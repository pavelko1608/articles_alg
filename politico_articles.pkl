V Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s island is shrinking.  The West Virginia Democrat\u2019s path to reelection in 2018 was already the toughest of his career. Now, party-switching Gov. Jim Justice just complicated it even more. By defecting to the GOP in a show of unity with President Donald Trump in Huntington on Thursday, the bombastic governor has left Manchin more isolated than ever, the lone big-name Democrat in a state once dominated by them.  Story Continued Below  \u201cIt can\u2019t help Joe,\u201d said former West Virginia Senate President Jeff Kessler, a Democrat, of Justice\u2019s move. \u201cBut Joe\u2019s always run on his own.\u201d  A former governor and secretary of state himself, Manchin\u2019s fate in the overwhelmingly pro-Trump state was always going to rise and fall on his own distinctive political brand. But Justice\u2019s flip handed the state\u2019s ascendant Republican Party a potent piece of ammunition that Manchin wasn\u2019t counting on, while depriving the senator of a potentially useful surrogate.  \u201cThe only way Gov. Justice could have been less helpful to Sen. Manchin was handing out pictures of him campaigning with Secretary Clinton bragging about putting a lot of coal miners out of business,\u201d said Colin Reed, senior advisor to the America Rising opposition research group that\u2019s going after Manchin\u2019s seat in 2018. \u201cBy switching parties, Gov. Justice highlighted the political liability Manchin can\u2019t shake: he\u2019s a Democrat in a state that\u2019s trending Republican and showing no signs of slowing down.\u201d  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Overnight, Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm put together a video juxtaposing Justice\u2019s proximity to Trump with Manchin\u2019s praise for Hillary Clinton -- political poison in a state where Clinton lost all 55 counties.   \u201cJoe Manchin is out of touch with West Virginia,\u201d reads the digital spot, now running across the state.  Despite the attacks, Manchin remains popular at home, with a 57 percent approval rating and nearly 90 percent name recognition in last month's Morning Consult poll. But he\u2019s still going to need all the help he can get.  After Trump stormed to a landslide victory in West Virginia in November, both Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey jumped into the Republican race to challenge Manchin. And the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC on Thursday kicked off its own anti-Manchin barrage with digital ads even before the Justice news broke.  Aside from the ads, though, Manchin\u2019s name barely surfaced on West Virginia\u2019s political talk radio programming on Friday. And neither Manchin, the Democratic infrastructure backing him, nor any of his Republican challengers immediately changed their strategies in the aftermath of Justice\u2019s surprise move.  To some Democrats, it\u2019s confirmation that the fallout from the party switch will be limited.  \u201cI legitimately cannot fathom how this has any impact on Joe\u2019s campaign. There is almost no way that next fall would have ended with a Manchin-Justice statewide tour, but more importantly, Justice has already seen a dramatic decline in his job approval while Manchin is currently more popular,\u201d said a Democrat who has worked closely with Manchin.  Republicans were always likely to try to tie Manchin to his unpopular national party, the Democrat added: \u201cThe fact that Jim Justice became a Republican doesn\u2019t change what the Republicans will try to say about [Manchin], but his brand is stronger than those attacks and has withstood those cheap shots in multiple campaigns."  \u000a  \u000a            By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM, GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI, KEVIN ROBILLARD and DANIEL STRAUSS  Still, the quiet after the storm reflected an uncertainty about how the electorate will behave in a place where statewide Democrats are nearing extinction \u2014 but where national Democrats are optimistic a well-known figure with a reputation for bucking his party can survive.  Both confident and eager to avoid the hyper-partisan current political environment, Manchin has been slow to ramp up for 2018: he waited until June 30 to kick off his campaign with a fundraising reception in Charleston, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. That was over six months after many of his similarly vulnerable Democratic colleagues began repositioning themselves for the Trump era.  But in West Virginia the transition to Republican domination has been so rapid that the first comment to come from Manchin\u2019s office on Thursday went out of its way to note that he was still a Democrat.   In 2014, Republicans gained control of the state legislature for the first time in 83 years and Shelley Moore Capito became West Virginia\u2019s first Republican senator in 55 years. Jenkins, now one of Manchin\u2019s challengers, switched to the GOP that year in order to challenge a 19-term Democratic incumbent.  Jenkins said Justice\u2019s party switch was just the latest sign the national Democratic party is hopelessly out of touch with the pro-gun, coal-producing state, which has seen thousands of voters change their registration from Democrat to Republican.   \u201cThe Democratic party\u2019s agenda is not the agenda of West Virginia,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhat Jim Justice has done may be out of the ordinary for governors. It is not out of the ordinary for West Virginians.\u201d   Jenkins said Manchin could no longer hope to stick out as a trustworthy Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s become a Washington insider. He\u2019s part of the Schumer-Warren-Sanders leadership team.\u201d  Manchin, who won his first full Senate term in 2012, has skillfully navigated the new landscape. He distanced himself from Barack Obama's administration, siding with those who viewed it as waging a \u2018war against coal.\u201d And he has at times been closer to the Trump White House than any other Democrat, visiting with the president-elect in Trump Tower during the transition, during which time he was briefly considered for a cabinet post.  That\u2019s muddied GOP efforts to portray him as a rubber stamp for Democratic leadership: a handful of Republicans said Friday that they were disappointed that neither Trump nor Justice singled Manchin out on stage this week, which would have given them a neat clip for television ads.

The senator\u2019s more immediate headache comes from the left. Progressives \u2014 including many who repeatedly point to Bernie Sanders\u2019 victory in the Democratic primary there last year \u2014 regularly accuse Manchin of being an anti-environment, pro-gun fake Democrat despite his new leadership role in the Senate caucus and his gun control legislation.  Thanks to Justice \u2014 a longtime Manchin friend who repeatedly donated to Manchin\u2019s campaigns, even when he was registered as a Republican \u2014 Manchin now must remind his party they can still rely on him.   \u201cThey have egg on their face and a stick in the eye,\u201d said Kessler, who ran against Justice in the 2016 Democratic gubernatorial primary, of Manchin and his allies. \u201cHow do they explain this to their party membership \u2014 that their savior turned out to be a Benedict Arnold?"  Former Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall, who lost his seat in Congress to Jenkins, predicted \u201cminor rumblings\u201d of annoyance with Manchin, since the senator was one of Justice\u2019s main validators during last year\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.   It\u2019s not clear yet whether Justice will get involved in the Senate race. Jenkins, who said he reached out to the governor\u2019s office to try to schedule a sit-down, indicated he wasn\u2019t totally sure of the governor\u2019s new allegiances and couldn\u2019t say whether Justice would hit the campaign trail with the GOP nominee next fall.  \u201cI would certainly hope Gov. Justice would support, embrace the Republican nominees at all levels,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very disappointing if he chose not to fully support the team he is now a member of.\u201d   Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                President Donald Trump has been railing against the leaks coming out of his administration for weeks as a stream of unflattering stories has embarrassed the White House.  | Alex Brandon/AP  \u000a            By MADELINE CONWAY  08/04/2017 09:38 AM EDT  Republicans and Democrats denounced government leaking this week after transcripts of President Donald Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders was exposed by the Washington Post.   The rejection of leaks comes as Attorney General Jeff Sessions is expected Friday to launch a Justice Department investigation into leaks coming out of the government.  Story Continued Below  Trump has been railing against the leaks coming out of his administration for weeks as a stream of unflattering stories has embarrassed the White House. Some of those stories are based on anonymously sourced but unclassified gossip about infighting among his aides, while others are more serious leaks of information about the ongoing probe into his campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia or his dealings with foreign leaders.  Republicans have typically been quick to draw attention to the leak problem throughout the Russia investigation, while Democrats have generally focused on questions about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in the election last year. But a leak on Thursday prompted lawmakers from both parties to speak out and raise their concern.  The Washington Post published the transcripts of Trump\u2019s tense calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, embarrassing the White House because at times Trump seemed not to grasp policy basics and appeared to downplay his campaign promises.   White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Friday warned that the disclosure could jeopardize national security.

While many Trump critics were quick to express their dismay at the content of the exchanges on Thursday, some Democrats joined in to warn that leaking a transcript of conversations between the president and other world leaders is dangerous and a bad precedent.  Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Daily Beast on Thursday that Congress should investigate the leak.   \u201cA president of the United States, a governor would tell us they've got to be able to have confidential conversations,\u201d Warner said. \u201cAnd I think it was disgraceful that those [came out].\u201d  David Frum, a former aide in the George W. Bush White House and a consistent Trump critic at The Atlantic, wrote a column decrying the leak as \u201cunprecedented, shocking, and dangerous\u201d and warned that it \u201cwill reverberate around the world.\u201d   \u201cNo leader will again speak candidly on the phone to Washington, D.C.\u2014at least for the duration of this presidency, and perhaps for longer,\u201d Frum wrote. \u201cIf these calls can be leaked, any call can be leaked\u2014and no leader dare say anything to the president of the United States that he or she would not wish to read in the news at home.\u201d  Tommy Vietor, a former spokesperson for President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council, also called the leak \u201cabsurd.\u201d  \u201cI would\u2019ve lost my mind if transcripts of Obama's calls to foreign leaders leaked,\u201d Vietor, who co-hosts the popular liberal podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d said on Twitter. \u201cHe wouldn't have sounded so dumb, but it's still absurd.\u201d  Added former Obama adviser David Axelrod: \u201cTranscripts of @POTUS calls w/leaders of Mexico; Australia were embarrassing. Yet the leaking of them feels like a terrible precedent.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Senate Republicans spent their last week before a four-week August recess on a series of moves with one main goal: Reining in Donald Trump.  The GOP delivered an unstated declaration of independence from their own Republican president by passing a Russia sanctions bill he resisted, rebuffing his demands they try again on health care after the spectacular implosion of Obamacare repeal, even taking steps to head off any attempt by Trump to fire the special counsel investigating him, Robert Mueller.  Story Continued Below  Trump\u2019s attempts to blame and strong-arm Senate Republicans came amid mounting frustration over his stalled agenda in Congress during what\u2019s typically the most prolific stretch of a new administration.  Indeed, the breach between the executive and legislative branches appears to be widening, despite their shared party affiliation.  \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking GOP leader, said of the moves to establish more independence from Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Congress assert its authorities under the Constitution and be an equal branch of the government.\u201d  Republicans disputed Trump\u2019s Thursday claim that U.S.-Russia relations have frayed, thanks to congressional sanctions that Congress passed overwhelmingly and Trump signed into law, albeit with major reservations. Instead, lawmakers laid blame squarely at the feet of the president\u2019s would-be ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin.  And in another clear signal of distance from the White House, two GOP senators joined Democrats on separate pieces of legislation designed to shield the special counsel \u2014 investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u2014 from any attempt to fire him.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who partnered with Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) on the new bill to help Mueller be reinstated if fired by Trump, told POLITICO that the proposal is \u201cone of a number of things I\u2019m looking at to try and seize the opportunity for us to strengthen this institution and reinstate some of the authority it\u2019s conveyed down the street\u201d to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  \u201cIf you look back over the last 75 years, there have been a number of instances where Congress has conveyed authority to the president because it happened to be their president in the White House,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cIt\u2019s more appropriate to be reserved here on Capitol Hill.\u201d  Trump escalated his combative rhetoric toward Senate Republicans this week, suggesting that they would be \u201ctotal quitters\u201d for ending their efforts to repeal Obamacare. Even after signing a bipartisan package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, Trump blamed Congress in a tweet for pushing relations with Moscow to \u201can all-time and dangerous low.\u201d  Republicans rejected both arguments before leaving Washington.  They\u2019re set to return to the Hill after Labor Day with an array of arduous battles ahead, from raising the federal debt ceiling, to avoiding a government shutdown, to crafting a tax bill \u2014 and perilously few legislative days remaining in the year. Not to mention Trump\u2019s dimming approval ratings, which will only slice into the political capital needed to achieve the ambitious agenda the GOP promised voters.  Several Republicans said Thursday that their assertion of power was nothing more than a continuation of their resistance to Trump\u2019s predecessor.  \u201cI think the Founding Fathers anticipated a tension between the\u201d legislative and executive branches, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said in an interview. \u201cAnd this is the healthy tension. Even if the president is of your own party, there should still be that tension.\u201d  Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) agreed: \u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve been in Congress, and particularly since I\u2019ve been in the Senate, I look for a stronger Congress.\u201d   \u000aHealthcare  \u000a            By JENNIFER HABERKORN and PAUL DEMKO  Even while absent from the Capitol while receiving treatment for brain cancer, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who dealt the fatal blow to his chamber\u2019s Obamacare repeal bill last week \u2014 took time to blast Trump for criticizing the Russia sanctions bill.  \u201cOur relationship with Russia is at a dangerous low,\u201d McCain tweeted. Rather than Congress, he added, \u201cyou can thank Putin for attacking our democracy, invading neighbors & threatening our allies.\u201d  Trump is running into Republican obstacles seemingly everywhere he turns these days.   On health care, GOP senators have ignored his demands to keep trying to repeal Obamacare, moving on to other priorities, such as confirming key administration nominees and looking ahead to tax reform. If anything happens on Obamacare at the moment, it\u2019ll be bipartisan fixes that will come nowhere close to the promise of repeal that Trump pledged on the campaign trail.  The president is even threatening to blow up the health care system by cutting off Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies, which help stabilize insurance markets, as a tactic to destroy the 2010 health care law and force Democrats to negotiate.  No dice, say key Republican senators.  \u201cI\u2019ve recommended that he continue it,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said of the payments. \u201cI hope that he will.\u201d  Even Trump\u2019s beloved border wall continues to run into resistance from Republicans.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas and three other GOP senators unveiled immigration legislation on Thursday that called for more border enforcement but made clear that a wall sealing off the U.S.-Mexico border was not their preferred route.  Cornyn said in an interview that there is now a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d for Congress to take the lead on policy.  \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen on the Russian sanctions bill, sometimes the president will come along, even reluctantly, and we\u2019ll be able to make progress,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cHistorically, it hasn\u2019t always been the case that the president is the one who sets the policy and Congress responds. It was that Congress led. And I think this is the opportunity we have now and I welcome that.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                While President Donald Trump has stopped short of saying he plans to fire Robert Mueller, his top aides have acknowledged the subject has come up. That, in turn, has prompted a sharp retort from top Republicans and Democrats alike. | Alex Wong/Getty Images  \u000a            By DARREN SAMUELSOHN  08/03/2017 02:06 PM EDT  Competing bipartisan Senate bills introduced Thursday put President Donald Trump on further notice that any move to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller wouldn\u2019t go down without a serious fight.  The two pieces of legislation take different approaches but both have the same mission of requiring judicial review of any move to oust Mueller, who is leading the independent probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  Story Continued Below  One of the measures, introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee members Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), would let Mueller challenge his firing by a panel of three federal judges \u2014 but only after he\u2019s been terminated. By contrast, a different proposal from Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) would force the top Justice Department officials who were tasked with firing Mueller to go before the judicial panel before he\u2019s even terminated to explain their reasons for the move.  Trump has long complained about the different Russia investigations, which have heightened tensions in Washington and distracted from the Republican\u2019s policy goals. He\u2019s also criticized Mueller for hiring multiple attorneys who have contributed to Democratic candidates and questioned whether Mueller has a close relationship with James Comey, the former FBI director who Trump fired in May. Sources close to both Mueller and Comey, however, have disputed that the two men are as close as the president has suggested.  While Trump has stopped short of saying he plans to fire Mueller, his top aides have acknowledged the subject has come up. That, in turn, has prompted a sharp retort from top Republicans and Democrats alike.  \u201cAny effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong,\u201d Graham told reporters last week.  The South Carolina Republican, who ran against Trump for the 2016 presidential nomination and also served in the late 1990s as an impeachment manager against President Bill Clinton, was joined in his bill introduction today by Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Appearing Thursday on CNN, Tillis said he wasn\u2019t concerned that Trump would move to fire Mueller but he said the bill was still needed to show bipartisan support against the idea. \u201cIf there is a termination, we just want to make sure through judicial review it was warranted,\u201d he said.  Another co-sponsor of the Tillis-Coons bill, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) told CNN that the bill \u201csends a pretty clear message\u201d to Trump that he would be sparking a much bigger fight if he did move to oust Mueller. \u201cIts symbolic,\u201d Carper said. \u201cBut is an important symbol. It\u2019s a bipartisan symbol.\u201d  Beyond the prospect of Trump\u2019s veto pen, it\u2019s unclear how legislation to protect Mueller would fare on the other end of the Capitol.  House Speaker Paul Ryan has said his \u201cbest advice\u201d to the president was to \u201clet Robert Mueller do his job.\u201d  At the same time, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) joined 19 other GOP lawmakers last week calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to appoint a new special counsel apart from Mueller to \u201cinvestigate a plethora of matters\u201d during the 2016 campaign related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and senior Obama administration officials, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

aV \u000a                Forty percent are in favor of repealing parts of Obamacare, while 33 percent do not want any repeals at all, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll.  \u000a            By JAKE LAHUT  08/03/2017 01:27 PM EDT  A Quinnipiac University poll shows staggering opposition among registered voters toward Republican-led efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, with 80 percent of voters disapproving of the way Republicans in Congress are handling health care\u2014including 60 percent of self-identified Republicans.  Sixty-four percent of voters across the ideological spectrum disapprove of Republican ideas to replace Obamacare, while just 25 percent are in favor of the legislation presented thus far.   Story Continued Below  As for outright repeal, only 22 percent of voters surveyed say President Donald Trump and the GOP should repeal the entirety of the Affordable Care Act. Forty percent are in favor of repealing parts of Obamacare, while 33 percent do not want any repeals at all.   Medicaid remains a touchy subject in the poll, with voters opposing a decrease in funding to the program 69 percent to 26 percent, including 52 percent of Republicans opposing cuts while just 39 percent remain in favor of austerity.   A narrow majority of voters support replacing the current health care system with a single-payer system by 51 percent to 38 percent. The question specifically defines single payer as Medicare covering every American citizen.  When asked if the 2018 congressional midterms were to be held today, 52 percent to 38 percent of voters across the spectrum say they would like the Democrats to gain control of the House of Representatives, including 48 percent to 37 percent of self-identified independents. 53 percent of voters and 49 percent of independents say they would like to see the Democrats take the Senate as well.   While the Democrats enjoy relatively low favorability at 36 percent compared with just 22 percent for Republicans, 56 percent of voters think Democrats can do a better job on health care.

Quinnipiac also asked about transgender rights, which have come to the fore after Trump's three-part tweet that proposed banning transgender Americans from serving in the military.   According to the poll, 68 percent of voters \u2014 including 55 percent in military families \u2014 believe transgender individuals should be able to serve openly in the military. Eighty-nine percent of those surveyed believe it should be illegal for an employer to discriminate against an employee based on sexual orientation. (The question did not explicitly reference gender identity.)   The survey was conducted from July 27 to August 1 among 1,125 self-identified registered voters nationwide, with a margin of error between 3.4 percentage points. All interviews were conducted live over cellphones and landlines.   Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                From left, Sens, John Barrasso of Wyoming, John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina hold a news conference Thursday on the Republican plan forward on border security. | John Shinkle/POLITICO  \u000a                        Trump\u2019s call for a border wall has faced a stiff resistance in Congress.  \u000a            By SEUNG MIN KIM and TED HESSON  08/03/2017 01:17 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/03/2017 04:41 PM EDT  President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall is continuing to crumble, at least on Capitol Hill.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and three other Senate Republicans rolled out legislation on Thursday making it clear that, in their view, a stand-alone wall running the length of the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a core Trump campaign promise \u2014 isn\u2019t the answer.  Story Continued Below  The legislation, called Building America\u2019s Trust Act, would allot $15 billion over four years for what its backers call \u201csmart, multi-layered infrastructure\u201d along the southern border. That may include a wall, fence, levees, technology or other barriers, according to a summary of the bill.  \u201cThe Border Patrol, in particular, risk their lives every day to keep us safe," Cornyn said at a news conference announcing the plan. "It\u2019s really inexcusable that they don\u2019t have either the policies in place or the resources to get that done.\u201d  Trump\u2019s call for a border wall has faced a stiff resistance in Congress, with Democrats opposing the idea and border-state Republicans uneager to accommodate a demand that could wreak havoc on communities and commerce along the border.  But Trump may still insist that funding for the border wall be included in any must-pass government spending measure due by the end of September, provoking a potential government shutdown. The House last week passed a defense spending package that included money to build about 70 miles of barriers along the southern border, which Republican leaders called a \u201cdown payment\u201d for a border wall.

Other chief Republican sponsors of the Senate bill include Sens. John Barrasso of Wyoming, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, all of whom joined Cornyn on Thursday at the press event.   Cornyn said the lawmakers sought input from federal officials to craft the measure. \u201cWe worked very closely with the Department of Homeland Security to get both substantive and technical suggestions, and this bill incorporates that,\u201d he said.  The Texas Republican stopped short of saying Trump backs the measure, but he sounded optimistic. \u201cWith this president in the White House, we think we have an ally who will help us,\u201d he said.  DHS spokesman David Lapan did not comment on the Cornyn bill directly, but said the department "supports enhanced border security and looks forward to working with Congress as specific legislation is introduced.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The proposal has already been endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and the Southwest Border Sheriffs Coalition, among other law enforcement organizations.  It would boost resources for ports of entry along the border while increasing the number of Border Patrol and immigration officers.  Cornyn fielded several questions Thursday about the president's campaign promise to have Mexico pay for a border wall.   \u201cWe\u2019re used to Congress appropriating the money," Cornyn said. "We\u2019ll leave it to the president and his plan for how we recoup that at some point.\u201d  The Senate majority whip also blurred the line between a "wall" and the mix of border security measures outlined in his legislation.  \u000a  \u000a            By SARAH FERRIS  \u201cThe idea of physical infrastructure or walls is not novel," he said, pointing to a photo of a bollard-style fence with a concrete base. "President Trump didn\u2019t dream that up.\u201d  In addition to border infrastructure, the bill would tackle interior enforcement and aim to pressure so-called sanctuary cities to cooperate with federal immigration officials.   To discourage repeat border crossers, the legislation would incorporate Kate's Law, a measure that would increase penalties for immigrants who re-enter the country after a deportation.   At the news conference, Tillis argued that immigrant advocates should also favor the type of border security laid out in their bill, the text of which was expected to become available later in the day.  \u201cIf you\u2019re against the wall, if you\u2019re in the group of people that think we need bridges not borders," the senator said, "think of the humanitarian crisis that will continue if we don\u2019t increase situational awareness and operational control down there.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Republican congressional leaders are quietly preparing to pass a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling increase, according to multiple senior GOP sources \u2014 setting the stage for a high-risk showdown with rank-and-file Republicans this fall.  Trump administration officials, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are imploring Congress to raise the $19.8 trillion debt limit with no strings attached by the end of September. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 well aware they need Democrats to pass any debt bill through the Senate \u2014 are on board, albeit begrudgingly so.   Story Continued Below  But beyond the leadership, there are few Republican takers, at least so far. GOP lawmakers in both chambers of Congress are calling for any debt ceiling hike to be accompanied by spending cuts or fiscal reforms \u2014 the same demand they made repeatedly during Barack Obama\u2019s two terms.   That means McConnell (R-Ky.) and Ryan (R-Wis.) will have to rely on Democrats and enough moderate Republicans to help them avert a financial catastrophe by Sept. 29, the day Treasury exhausts its borrowing authority and the very last day for Congress to act.  \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t even play with that. It should just be \u2018clean,\u2019\u201d said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who supports McConnell\u2019s strategy. \u201cSome conservatives think they can get some programs cut. Well, that\u2019s not gonna happen \u2026 We have to pay our bills and anybody who doesn\u2019t want to do that doesn\u2019t deserve to be here.\u201d  Compare that with Sen. James Lankford\u2019s take: The Oklahoma Republican flatly responded \u201cno\u201d when asked whether GOP leaders should move a so-called clean debt limit increase.   A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  \u201cYou should never have a time that we deal with the debt ceiling that we\u2019re not dealing with the reason that we have debt ceilings,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the debt and deficit. So they should always be combined in some way.\u201d  Meanwhile, Democrats, who time and again have coughed up votes to allow the GOP to avoid crises, are mulling their own demands with a Republican now in the White House. Some Senate Democrats have floated seeking a reauthorization of health insurance programs for low-income children in return for their support. And House Democrats likewise are considering a play to leverage their own priorities.   The upshot: Congress will return next month from August recess with no clear road map for avoiding the first-ever default on the nation\u2019s debt.   McConnell is already privately raising the issue with fellow GOP senators, according to one senior GOP aide. Top Republicans are eager to avoid a repeat of the 2011 standoff between Congress and the Obama White House that led to a downgrade of the nation\u2019s sterling credit rating.  Spokesmen for the majority leader declined to comment on McConnell\u2019s debt limit strategy. But some other senior Republicans are backing up McConnell, warning lawmakers of the consequences of tangling over the nation\u2019s debt limit, particularly with the party controlling all levers of power in Washington.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to raise the debt limit,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about different options.\u201d  One option being considered is to roll a debt ceiling increase into a spending bill that must pass by Sept. 30 to avoid a federal government shutdown. Moderate Republicans in the House, including Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a leader of the Tuesday Group, have been imploring House leaders to champion such a package as well.   Some Hill Republicans have suggested that rolling a debt increase in with a bipartisan budget deal would not be "clean" per se. But others do view such a strategy as a "clean" increase, since it would not include dollar-for-dollar offsets or partisan policy riders pushed by either side.   Complicating the task is the fact that Trump administration officials have sent conflicting signals about how they want the debt ceiling to be handled.  Though Mnuchin has been the dominant voice of the administration on this issue, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney earlier this year insisted that spending cuts or other reforms should be part of any debt hike, even as he\u2019s indicated Treasury is taking the lead.   Mulvaney took a hard line on the debt ceiling as a member of the House before his elevation to the Cabinet. And his view has plenty of support in Congress.   \u000a  \u000a            By BEN WHITE  \u201cIf there\u2019s ever a good example of kicking the can down the road, it is continually raising the debt ceiling and not dealing with the cause of the debt,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). \u201cSo it concerns me greatly that it\u2019ll just be another punt if we don\u2019t do anything, at least some structural reform.\u201d  In the House, Ryan and his leadership team are waiting for the Senate to act first. While they have not publicly endorsed a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling approach, House GOP leaders are preparing to push whatever the Senate passes and clear it for President Donald Trump\u2019s signature.  They know that it's likely to be a straight debt ceiling hike. And some in House leadership are dreading the fight it will spark with the right flank of their conference.   They know they\u2019ll have to rely heavily on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for votes to pass any deal. All but perhaps a couple dozen moderate-minded House Republicans, leadership sources predict, will vote against a bill raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit without equivalent spending cuts \u2014 so Ryan will need every Democrat Pelosi can get.  Democrats don\u2019t want to risk defaulting on the debt. But they\u2019re also concerned that after offering up their votes to Republicans to clear the debt ceiling hurdle, Republicans will promptly turn around in October and pass tax cuts that could balloon the deficit and disproportionately benefit the wealthy.  So Democrats are waiting for Republicans to reveal their strategy before going public with their own demands.  \u201cYou know what? They are in charge. They have a majority in the House and in the Senate and the White House and so they have to make the decisions governing,\u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the fourth-ranking Senate Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them but they\u2019re gonna have to step up.\u201d  \u000a  \u000a            By JENNIFER HABERKORN  The likelihood that House leaders will have to lean on Democrats could undermine Ryan's political standing. Conservatives drove out ex-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) because he sometimes violated a GOP tradition known as the Hastert Rule, which dictates that a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d must support legislation.  Ryan, for the first time, will probably have to break that unofficial agreement. Most of his 240-member conference is expected to oppose a clean debt ceiling bill.  Conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus have made demands to support a debt increase, including steep cuts to mandatory programs. But GOP leaders under their current strategy will, in essence, ignore conservatives because they can\u2019t give them what they want and expect it to clear the Senate\u2019s higher, 60-vote threshold.  During an Americans for Prosperity speech Wednesday, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows seemed to acknowledge that conservatives would get squeezed. While the North Carolina Republican prefers spending cuts, he said a \u201cclean\u201d increase was also a possibility \u2014 and he assured the audience that he wanted no part of the government defaulting on its debts.  \u201cI think that we ought to attach something to it,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cEither that will get done or a clean debt ceiling will get done. We will raise the debt ceiling and there shouldn\u2019t be any fear of that.\u201d  The headache for Ryan on the debt ceiling, however, won\u2019t just be from the Freedom Caucus. Even some Ryan allies have said privately they would never back a clean debt ceiling increase. Many of them campaigned promising to lower, not increase, the debt.  House GOP leaders, however, could receive cover from the White House. And centrist Republicans will also likely go along.   Still, the call for cuts from the base won\u2019t be easy to resist for some.  \u201cI wish we could tie things to it,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). \u201cBut can we? I don\u2019t know.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                Senate Democrats tried their hand at tax reform counter-messaging Tuesday in a public letter sent and signed by the vast majority of Senate Democrats.  \u000a            By COLIN WILHELM  08/02/2017 05:21 PM EDT  Everyone in Washington agrees that the tax code doesn\u2019t work. Just don\u2019t expect them to agree on how to fix it, especially across party lines.   Senate Democrats tried their hand at tax reform counter-messaging Tuesday in a public letter sent and signed by the vast majority of Senate Democrats, 45 out of 48, urging Republicans not to use a budgetary maneuver known as reconciliation to pass tax reform solely with GOP votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was quick to shoot down the suggestion.  Story Continued Below  Nonetheless, senators on both sides of the aisle paid lip service to working with the other party for a more bipartisan process on reshaping the tax code to aid economic growth.   The most intriguing part of the letter was not what it said, but the three signatures it lacked \u2014 from Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), all of whom are up for reelection in states where President Donald Trump is popular.  All three played down the significance of their demurral from the letter, and it's certainly too early to read much into it other than political caution.  \u201cWe believe that the most important thing is no more debt, my God, we\u2019re in enough debt, we need something that doesn\u2019t increase the debt,\u201d said Manchin, who added that he hoped to work with the White House and Republicans on reforming the tax code but had yet to receive any outreach.

You can unsubscribe at any time.  The Democrats\u2019 message appears to anticipate that Republicans will write a bill with temporary provisions \u2014 a tactic that House Speaker Paul Ryan mapped out in a meeting with conservative groups last week \u2014 in order to gain a favorable budgetary score for provisions that come with a high price tag but quick economic benefit.  A spokesperson for Heitkamp said, "Sen. Heitkamp is approaching tax reform with an open mind and she wants work across the aisle to help make reforms that will grow the economy and support working families."   But few saw an outbreak of bipartisanship as realistic.   \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be 1986, when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code,\u201d McConnell said at a weekly press availability, invoking the year in which a comprehensive \u2014 and bipartisan \u2014 overhaul of the tax code last occurred.   \u201cIt\u2019s their best opportunity to work with us and get something done,\u201d said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). But in the next breath he added, \u201cIf not, then blame the Democrats.\u201d   When asked about Democrats demanding in their letter that tax reform not add to the deficit, Hatch said: \u201cTell them to grow up.\u201d   Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP senator, said that the Democratic letter asked for steps \u201cthat aren\u2019t consistent with what we want to see in a pro-growth tax reform bill.\u201d But Thune also said he hoped to find some Democrats willing to work with Republicans on tax reform, and predicted that both parties would be able to offer amendments in a Finance Committee markup.  \u000a  \u000a            By ELANA SCHOR  \u201cI would like to see us at least attempt to try and work with the Democrats, see if there are any of them who are available and are willing to work with us on tax reform that we think truly is pro-growth,\u201d Thune told reporters.  According to a recent Gallup poll aggregate, Trump's approval ratings are highest in Manchin's and Heitkamp's home states. In Donnelly's Indiana, Gallup aggregated a 48 percent approval rating for Trump.   McConnell noted the absences, suggesting that, \u201cDemocratic senators who did not sign the letter ... may be open to pro-growth tax reform.\u201d   While Republicans may be able to more quickly find broader agreement among themselves on a tax overhaul, a few extra votes from moderate Democrats would provide the majority leader with a luxury he doesn\u2019t have in the health care debate.   Liam Donovan, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee staffer who now handles legislative and political affairs for the Associated Builders and Contractors, said estate tax repeal \u2014 which Republicans have promised to include in their effort \u2014 could be floated as a carrot in front of vulnerable Democrats like Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly to bring them to the table. Manchin was the lone Democrat to cross the aisle on a 2015 bill to repeal the estate tax.  But, \u201cat the end of the day I don\u2019t expect them to be there,\u201d said Donovan.

aV \u000a                Sen. John McCain's office announced last week he would undergo a regimen of radiation and chemotherapy, missing the two weeks this month that the Senate plans to be in session. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images  \u000a            By CONNOR O\u2019BRIEN  08/02/2017 01:47 PM EDT  Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said Wednesday he's "feeling good" just days after starting treatment for brain cancer and vowed to continue working and return to the Senate in September.  The Arizona Republican sounded an upbeat note in an interview on "The Mike Broomhead Show" on Phoenix talk radio station KFYI, his first since he began treatment Monday.  Story Continued Below  "It's a tough challenge, of course, but [I'm] getting the best care you can possibly have. I'm eating well and feeling fine, getting plenty of exercise," McCain said.  McCain's office announced last week he would undergo a regimen of radiation and chemotherapy, missing the two weeks this month that the Senate plans to be in session. But McCain reiterated Wednesday he continues to work during treatment and he'll "be ready to go back to work in September."  "I'm doing the things we do during the recess \u2014 having meetings, appointments. We'll be traveling around ... the state," he said. "Look, the best thing ... whenever you're faced with a challenge like this is stay busy."  "I must say ... thank you for all the cards and letters and calls," he said, joking: "It's been very deeply moving to me, even those who have said, 'I hope you die, but you're still a good guy.'"  The Senate is expected to debate the annual National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1519 (115)), managed by McCain, when it returns from its summer break after Labor Day.   Leaders from both parties attempted to quickly pass the measure last week before McCain left Washington to start treatment, but the proposal was blocked.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Republicans now say they want to stabilize the distressed Obamacare markets for 2018, but it may be too late.   Insurers have warned for months that they need certainty from Washington in order to decide where they will sell Obamacare plans and how much to charge. But after months of fruitless repeal efforts and growing unease over White House threats about pulling funding and undermining the law, the damage may be done. Lawmakers can\u2019t simply flip a bipartisan switch and pass a stabilization plan, particularly since they won\u2019t return to Washington for a month.  Story Continued Below  The health plans don\u2019t have that long. They need to finalize premium rates in most states in the next two weeks and sign final contracts for 2018 by the end of September. And the fifth year of open enrollment is shaping up to have more premium hikes, less consumer choice of health insurers, and the prospect of a score of rural counties having no Obamacare plans whatsoever.  President Donald Trump insists that Obamacare is collapsing. Many insurers and state regulators say that Republican policies and the uncertainty they engendered have created new obstacles just as the exchanges were beginning to find steadier financial footing. Several health plans that announced departures from Obamacare markets in 2018 cited that uncertainty as their motive, and some states have let insurers propose two sets of premiums \u2014 one showing how they\u2019d jack up rates 10 or 20 percent if the Trump administration cuts off crucial payments.

"Probably the month of September\u2019s all we have, and that\u2019s a big task for Congress to think about passing even a small stabilization piece of legislation that quickly," said Tennessee Insurance Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak, who is president-elect of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Given the chaos, regulators in many states are likely to allow some wiggle room on deadlines. But with open enrollment starting on Nov. 1, their options are limited.   Even if Congress does try to put together a stabilization plan, September looks daunting. Lawmakers will be facing deadlines to continue funding the government, raise the debt ceiling and renew the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. And they haven\u2019t come close to agreeing on what Obamacare stabilization should look like \u2014 and what kind of political tradeoffs would be needed to seal a deal. Conservatives are certain to balk at anything that could be seen as a relief package for insurers  \u201cThe solution to the Obamacare crisis is not simply billions of bailouts for giant insurance companies,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on Thursday.   There\u2019s no mystery about the easiest way to bring greater stability to the wobbly Obamacare markets for 2018: fund cost-sharing-reduction subsidies. Insurers rely on the monthly payments \u2014 estimated to be $7 billion this year \u2014 to reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income Obamacare customers. Trump keeps threatening to cut them off.   \u201cCSRs are job one, two and three,\u201d said Joel Ario, a former Obama administration official who helped set up the exchange markets. \u201cIf they\u2019re paid I think things will be decent for 2018.\u201d   But if Trump does follow through on his threat, he could tip the insurance markets into chaos. Insurers are certain to jack up premiums, likely in the neighborhood of 20 percent, or could bolt the markets altogether.   \u201cIt\u2019s not going to fail in one giant collapse,\u201d said Jeff Goldsmith, a longtime health care consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more like a brownout.\u201d   Anthem, in announcing its pullout from all Ohio Obamacare markets in June, said the state's individual market "remains volatile, and the lack of certainty of funding for cost sharing reduction subsidies, the restoration of taxes on fully insured coverage and, an increasing lack of overall predictability simply does not provide a sustainable path forward to provide affordable plan choices for consumers.  The tense situation has state regulators twisting themselves in knots trying to accommodate skittish health plans and keep them in the marketplaces. In many states, they\u2019re allowing health plans to submit two sets of rates \u2014 depending on whether or not the subsidy payments continue to flow.   \u201cWe\u2019re in a very strange position as regulators trying to decide what to do with rate increase requests that are pending before us with all of the uncertainty in the regulatory environment, and yet open enrollment is coming upon us,\u201d McPeak said,   In California, premiums for Obamacare plans are going up by an average of 12.5 percent, state officials announced this week, but those increases would double if the subsidy payments stop. In addition, industry titan Anthem is pulling out of all but three of the state\u2019s 19 markets.   Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Peter Lee, CEO of Covered California, the state\u2019s exchange, said regulators need reassurance about the subsidy payments not only from the Trump administration, but backed by Congress before they can adopt the lower rates.   \u201cA tweet would not be enough,\u201d Lee said.   In New Jersey, insurers filed their initial rates in June, with the state\u2019s largest insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, requesting average increases of more than 24 percent. But this week, Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration announced that it will allow insurers to file new rates because of the continuing uncertainty.   "But one thing is clear: were it not for uncertainty surrounding the future of the [Affordable Care Act], Horizon would be proposing a single-digit rate increase," Horizon spokesman Kevin McArdle said in a statement.  Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, announced this week that they will hold bipartisan hearings on stabilizing the market when they return to Washington after Labor Day. Their goal is to come up with a plan that can be enacted before insurers have to lock in rates for next year.  In addition, a bipartisan group of House members announced a plan, first reported by POLITICO, on Monday for stabilizing the markets. The blueprint from the roughly 40 members of the \u201cProblem Solvers\u201d caucus includes funding the cost-sharing subsidies, weakening the employer mandate and eliminating the medical-device tax.   But the Trump administration continues to undercut any potential stabilization efforts by celebrating the struggles of the marketplaces. This week it sent out a press release touting Molina Healthcare\u2019s decision to pull out of two states and Aetna\u2019s full withdrawal from the Obamacare markets as evidence of the system\u2019s inevitable collapse.   Those mixed signals add to the skepticism about whether any steps can be taken in time to help stabilize the markets ahead of open enrollment.   Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said before leaving town on Thursday that he thinks a plan \u201ccan be done." But he added \u201cI\u2019m not an insurance executive obviously.\u201d  Victoria Colliver and Katie Jennings contributed to this report.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV The Senate unanimously approved a bill Thursday that would allow people facing life-threatening diseases access to unapproved experimental drugs, providing a victory for libertarian advocates who see government regulators thwarting patients\u2019 rights.   The bill, S. 204 (115), passed swiftly and easily in a Senate bitterly divided over health care. The powerful pharmaceutical lobby, which had quietly opposed an earlier version, kept an unusually low profile. The industry has been focused on fighting off any efforts to go after drug pricing, which President Donald Trump has said he would tackle.   Story Continued Below  The bill\u2019s chief champion, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), declared it a victory for individual liberty over government, and for \u201cthe right to hope.\u201d It\u2019s also been championed by the libertarian Goldwater Institute, and Vice President Mike Pence, who tweeted that it gives patients \u201chope & a chance.\u201d  The legislation would allow patients with serious diseases \u2014 anything from a late-stage cancer to multiple sclerosis \u2014 to request access to experimental drugs directly from drug companies without having to go through the FDA, which has its own compassionate use program that approves 99 percent of requests.  But the right-to-try bill doesn\u2019t require drugmakers to make the experimental treatments available. In the 37 states that have similar laws on the books, Goldwater can point to only one doctor who says he has utilized a state right-to-try law for a patient \u2014 and that medicine was being made available to certain patients by the FDA anyway.  That\u2019s led some critics to call it \u201cright-to-ask\u201d \u2014 and it may give desperately ill people false hopes.  \u201cThis bill is inherently deceptive,\u201d Alison Bateman-House, a medical ethicist at New York University who led the charge against Johnson\u2019s bills, wrote in an email. \u201cWhat [patients] have a right to (and did long before this bill) is to ask drug companies for permission to use their experimental drugs outside of clinical trials. If the drug company says no, both before and after this legislation, that's the final word: neither the FDA nor the courts have to power to make companies provide access to their experimental drugs-in-development.\u201d  And if the experimental drugs do become widely used outside the standard clinical trial system, it could undermine some of the rigorous science needed to know whether medicines are safe and effective. Many drugs that start the clinical trial process flop. Some are harmful.  Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  \u201cYou have a situation where patients think they want to take a risk and don\u2019t necessarily understand what risk they are taking," said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, which lobbied against the bill.  And while the revised bill would require annual reports on whether the drugs used by these patients helped \u2014 or potentially harmed \u2014 them, patient safety experts are concerned it may not be enough.  But it\u2019s hard for lawmakers to say no to \u201chope.\u201d  \u201cOpposing right-to-try laws is akin to opposing motherhood, apple pie, and the American flag; you just don\u2019t do it and expect to be re-elected,\u201d David Gorski, an oncologist at Wayne State University, wrote in his blog on science-based medicine. It\u2019s easier for a senator to vote for the bill than to explain to constituents the nuances of why the new law might not help them \u2014 and might even harm them.  PhRMA issued a statement \u2014 but declined to say whether it now supported the bill, which must still be approved by the House after the summer recess. \u201cWe appreciated the opportunity to work with Sen. Johnson and look forward to continuing to work with his office,\u201d it said. \u201cThe revised Right to Try legislation that passed the Senate includes important protections for patient safety and the clinical trial process.\u201d   Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and ranking Democrat Patty Murray (D-Wash.) \u2014 the same duo who are about to embark on bipartisan Obamacare \u201cstabilization" hearings \u2014 played a role in helping Johnson work out a compromise. Alexander told POLITICO after the vote that Johnson \u201ctried to run it by everyone who was affected,\u201d including the pharmaceutical industry, trial lawyers and patients. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for him and the patients around the country who will benefit from it.\u201d  Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), one of the few Democrats who had been in favor of it all along, said more liberal members \u201call wanted to step up\u201d once the revised bill was explained to them.  FDA also worked behind the scenes to push for changes to make the bill safer for patients.   Not every senator endorses the libertarian rhetoric about getting federal regulators out of patients' way that propelled right-to-try \u2014 a key theme of the message the Goldwater Institute took through the states and to Washington.  \u201cThere\u2019s no more fundamental freedom than the right to save your own life. Right to Try guarantees that freedom by ensuring that patients, along with their doctors, are in control of the treatments they receive when facing a terminal diagnosis,\u201d Goldwater's president and CEO Victor Riches said in a statement after passage.  But more liberal lawmakers faced significant lobbying, featuring heartbreaking stories of young children or newlyweds facing shortened lives. Meanwhile, the most powerful opposition, the drug industry and doctors\u2019 groups, kept their disagreement very low-profile. Their soft voices gave lawmakers little political protection for a "no" vote.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it \u2014 there are a lot of patients out there that think this is the answer to their prayers. \u2026 They certainly believed that, and they pushed their members of Congress to support a bill that in many cases the members of Congress thought was not a good idea,\u201d said Zuckerman.  \u000a  \u000a            By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM, GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI, KEVIN ROBILLARD and DANIEL STRAUSS  PhRMA\u2019s low-profile on right-to-try hurt detractors from the outset. The industry group never took a formal position on the state right-to-try laws or earlier federal proposals. But it consistently reiterated its concerns about any approach to experimental medicines that sought to bypass the FDA and the clinical trial process. Of the major drug makers, only Merck formally came out against the earlier Johnson bill.  \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d NYU\u2019s Bateman-House said of PhRMA\u2019s reluctance to take a stronger public stance. \u201cWhen I speak with legislators, they say, \u2018Well if it\u2019s that bad, why isn\u2019t pharma speaking against it?\u2019\u201d   Critics of right-to-try concede the final Senate bill is much improved from earlier versions. It adds crucial safeguards that should help protect patients' safety \u2014 and their pocketbooks, as they can no longer be charged excessive amounts for unproven drugs.  But the critics, including bioethicists, safety advocates and researchers, still worry about the risk of undermining an agency like the FDA \u2014 an important safety regulator that has ensured that drugs are studied in controlled settings so FDA can make informed decisions to approve or disapprove them.  The bill looks to be an "improvement," said Patti Zettler, a professor at Georgia State University and former associate chief counsel at FDA. "However, the fundamental problem with the bill is not resolved in that it still envisions removing, or drastically reducing, FDA's role in expanded access."  And it may fall short \u2014 an example of Congress checking a box, but not really solving a problem.  \u201cIt\u2019s something where your reluctant representative can claim they are taking action but does not effectively address root problems,\u201d said Ameet Sarpatwari of Harvard Medical School. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with rising drug prices, and now we see it with experimental treatment. It is a show, but it is also dangerous in the sense that it furthers this sort of attack on FDA as somehow being antithetical to the interest of patients.\u201d  Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Patti Zettler's affiliation.

aV Republicans are leaving Washington Thursday for a month of recess with no clear direction on what they\u2019ll do next on Obamacare.  Senate leaders want to just drop the issue altogether. Conservatives say they\u2019re still fighting for repeal. Moderates want to launch a bipartisan effort to fix the shaky Obamacare system.  Story Continued Below  The reality is that, after seven years of unity on repealing Obamacare, Republicans are rudderless on how to talk about or address the defining domestic policy issue of nearly the past decade for their party, and they have no clear plans despite holding all the levers of power in Washington. Now, they face a month away from the Capitol, answering to their home-state voters about their lack of progress.  \u201cI still think something gets through, just because there\u2019s families that are not going to be able to afford their insurance, middle-income families,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of effort.\u201d   A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  Robert Laszewski, an insurance industry consultant, thinks Republicans may find their footing. \u201cThings get done in Washington, D.C., when they have to get done,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is over. They\u2019re going to get yelled at when they got home for being incompetent, for embarrassing themselves.\u201d  The August recess will mark the first time lawmakers have been home for an extended period since the repeal effort collapsed in the Senate. After seven years of campaigning against the law, this break marks the first time in nearly a decade that the GOP hasn't aligned its talking points against the Affordable Care Act. Several Republican lawmakers, most House members, have planned town hall meetings, meaning they\u2019re unlikely to be able to avoid the subject.  \u201cOur focus should be on honoring our promise to repeal Obamacare and to lower premiums,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \u201cUnder Obamacare the profits of the 10 largest insurance companies have doubled. The insurance companies are making out like bandits, yet Senate Democrats want to give them billions more in taxpayer money. We should be working for the American people, not for the giant health care companies.\u201d  President Donald Trump wants to keep the focus on repeal, too. He has continued to hammer Republicans for not following through on their promise to scrap the law, which will make it hard to move on to other priorities, particularly tax reform.   The looming open-enrollment season for Obamacare is also likely to keep health care on the front burner. Insurers must finalize rates in the next month, with many seeking premium increases in excess of 20 percent. Republicans routinely pilloried Democrats for such rate hikes in the past, and used lower premiums as justification for overhauling health care system.   Now, they're in the uncomfortable position of having to explain inaction as millions of Americans again get hit with sticker shock.   When Republicans return from recess they\u2019ll face a packed to-do list that will make it difficult to focus on health care exclusively. Congress will have to raise the debt limit and funding the government by the end of September, as well as reauthorizing the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.

The various Obamacare proposals could gain or lose momentum over recess. The Congressional Budget Office is expected to score key Obamacare proposals, including Cruz's amendment to allow states to waive certain Obamacare consumer protections; Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's proposal to help people who gained coverage under Obamacare's Medicaid expansion buy private insurance; and a plan from Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Cassidy that would keep many of Obamacare\u2019s taxes but allow states to decide how to spend the money. Even Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he is working on advancing his idea to allow small businesses to band together and offer employee coverage through the small group market.  Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash) are expected to start work on their health plan ahead of hearings planned for early September.  Looming over it all is the unpredictable Trump. He has repeatedly threatened to scrap crucial cost-sharing subsidies \u2014 estimated to be $7 billion this year \u2014 that insurers rely on to lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income Obamacare customers.   If that funding goes away, it could tip the insurance markets into chaos. Health plans would likely jack up premiums by around 20 percent or bolt the markets altogether.  There are already 19 counties at risk of having no insurer willing to sell ACA coverage for 2018. If those bare counties proliferate across the country, and tens of thousands of Americans have no access to coverage, it would intensify pressure for congressional action.  But if Trump unilaterally eliminates the subsidies, it would also enrage Democrats, who would view it as an act of sabotage. That would douse prospects for bipartisan work on health care for the foreseeable future.   Despite the tenuous situation, most lawmakers remain optimistic they\u2019ll reach agreement on repealing and replacing Obamacare.   \u201cWhatever we get 50 votes for,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), \u201cwe\u2019re going to be ready to vote on immediately.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) threatened to hold up a five-year reauthorization of the FDA user fee programs if he didn\u2019t get a vote on the bill.  | Getty  \u000a            By SARAH KARLIN-SMITH and SEUNG MIN KIM  08/03/2017 12:58 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/03/2017 06:45 PM EDT  The Senate approved a bill Thursday that would allow seriously ill patients in all 50 states to request access to experimental medicines without Food and Drug Administration approval.  Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s measure, S. 204 (115), would authorize the use of unapproved medicines by patients diagnosed with a life-threatening illness as long as the drugs in question have already gone through preliminary testing on humans and continue to be evaluated in research the FDA oversees. Eligible patients would have to exhaust other treatment options and be unable to participate in ongoing clinical trials.  Story Continued Below  The Senate's unanimous approval follows a nationwide lobbying effort by the libertarian Goldwater Institute, which got similar right-to-try laws passed in 37 states. Vice President Mike Pence, who signed a right-to-try law while governor of Indiana, also has endorsed the federal effort. Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania have a companion bill pending in the House.   Johnson\u2019s Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello and Jordan McLinn Right to Try Act of 2017 aroused concern from the drug industry, public health advocates and some at the FDA, who said it could undermine patient safety and drug development efforts. Drug companies wouldn't be required to give patients medicine under the law, but it would remove a requirement that companies and physicians obtain the FDA's sign-off to treat patients with experimental medicines.  The measure is broader than some state laws, because it covers patients with serious but not imminently deadly conditions, such as muscular dystrophy.   \u000aCongress  \u000a            By SEUNG MIN KIM and RACHAEL BADE  Johnson (R-Wis.) threatened to hold up a five-year reauthorization of FDA user fee programs if he didn\u2019t get a vote on the bill. Senate leaders and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions struck a compromise under which Johnson got a vote on a revised version of his bill, separate from the FDA user fee bill, which was approved on a 94-1 vote earlier Thursday.  "We tried to run it by everybody who was affected," HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander said. He added that Johnson did "a skillful job of legislating" to get a result.  The compromise included major changes to Johnson\u2019s original proposal to satisfy skeptics' concerns. Among other tweaks, the bill now requires FDA to receive reports of safety events that occur in right-to-try situations. It also forbids patients from being charged more than the cost of production for the medicines.   Separately, the FDA reauthorization bill included a proposal from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would make certain hearing aids available over the counter and make it easier for consumers to obtain them.  Despite some early objections from gun rights and conservative groups, the legislation passed with far-reaching support from both ends of the Capitol.   "Everyone leaned forward and said this is the kind of change that will help bring down health care costs in America," Warren said in an interview. "Forty-eight million Americans have hearing loss, but fewer than one in six gets a hearing aid that could help them and the principal reason is because they can\u2019t afford it."

aV There\u2019s never been a major bipartisan Obamacare bill, and the path to passing one now \u2014 after the death of Senate Republicans' repeal effort \u2014 is steep.  Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and ranking Democrat Patty Murray of Washington are up against both time and history in their race to stabilize the shaky Obamacare markets and solidify their status as the chamber\u2019s top deal-makers.  Story Continued Below  The pair has just a few weeks before a self-imposed deadline to bridge deep partisan divisions over the health care law and pass a bill by the end of September, when insurance companies make their final decisions on 2018 Obamacare plans. And that\u2019s assuming they can first unite their own committee \u2014 a patchwork of political interests that includes iconoclastic conservative Rand Paul (R-Ky.), moderate Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and liberal firebrands Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).   \u201cLamar Alexander and Patty Murray shepherded a bill through \u2014 [the update to] No Child Left Behind \u2014 that made the school-choice people happy and made the teachers unions happy, so stranger things have happened,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.).  Alexander and Murray want a bill to stabilize the Obamacare insurance markets in time for next year's plans. Lawmakers who are warm to the idea agree the contours would combine expanded state flexibility for Republicans with market stability \u2014 such as funding critical Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies \u2014 for Democrats.  Republicans will seek a more flexible 1332 waiver \u2014 an existing Obamacare provision that allows states to make changes to the law\u2019s requirements, according to GOP sources. Democrats say funding the approximately $7 billion annual payment to insurance companies to help cover low-income people is the minimum requirement for a deal. The Trump administration has said it is ready to pull the monthly payments at any time in response to the failed repeal effort, a move that could immediately drive companies off the exchanges and further undermine the Obamacare markets.

Alexander says he\u2019s ready to fund the program, but adds "it also should include greater flexibility for states in approving health insurance policies. Any solution that Congress passes for a 2018 stabilization package would need to be small, bipartisan and balanced.\u201d  But first, Alexander needs to win over skeptics in his own party, which is coming off an exhausting and ultimately fruitless effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Other Republicans have likened the cost-sharing program to a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurance companies.  Several conservative senators, as well as President Donald Trump, haven't given up on repealing the law outright. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Paul have balked at any proposal that aims to fix Obamacare rather than roll it back.  "I think it would be a serious mistake to bail out the insurance companies instead of honoring our promise to repeal Obamacare," Cruz said.  Senate GOP leaders have made clear that they\u2019ve tried everything on Obamacare and are ready to move on. But they\u2019ve left the door open to any Obamacare bill that has the votes. Alexander and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are close friends, and it is unlikely the chairman would move forward with a bipartisan bill if his leader was opposed.  \u201cShow me 51 or show me 60, I guess, and I\u2019m happy to talk,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).  Alexander and Murray \u2014 who have made deals on the No Child Left Behind update, the 21st Century Cures Act and an updated Medicare payment policy, among other things \u2014 have their work cut out for them. The HELP Committee is a diverse mix of Republicans and Democrats representing a cross-section of ideological spectrums. On the Republican side, HELP has conservatives Tim Scott of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas, the libertarian Paul and moderates Murkowski and Collins. On the other side of the dais are the Senate\u2019s most liberal Democrats \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 and more moderate lawmakers, such as Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).  Should Alexander and Murray get a bill through committee, it would have a strong shot at passage in the full Senate. The group will need to find common ground quickly \u2014 Alexander has set a mid-September deadline to strike a deal propping up the Obamacare markets, in hopes of speeding a bill through Congress by the end of a month. That leaves just a few weeks for the committee to hold hearings, negotiate a stabilization package and then win broader Senate support on an issue that Republicans and Democrats have fought over for nearly a decade. Staff is expected to work on the plans while members are in their home states in August.  \u000a  \u000a            By JENNIFER HABERKORN  Democrats and Republicans have starkly different visions for the future of the health care system, and there\u2019s little appetite on either side to give in. That means crafting a narrow bill that props up Obamacare in the short term without shaping the longer-term debate.   \u201cIf you start piling on everybody\u2019s pet priorities, it\u2019s a dangerous path to go down,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), an advocate for single-payer health care. \u201cJust because Chairman Alexander and I don\u2019t agree on the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t mean that either of us think that lighting the individual market on fire is a good idea.\u201d  Still, it remains unclear what qualifies as neutral ground. Both sides have floated funding stabilization efforts, either through a federal reinsurance system or by sending more money to the states. And Kaine said he\u2019s intrigued by a proposal from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Collins to automatically enroll individuals in basic health plans.   But Republicans remain loath to pour more money into Obamacare without a clear path toward rolling back some of its regulations \u2014 a suggestion that still makes Democrats nervous.  \u201cThe notion of flexibility to the states, I think that\u2019s good,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cBut sometimes flexibility to the states leads to a race to the bottom line. Sometimes flexibility to the states is actually perceived by the states as the feds just pushing off hard decisions on them.\u201d  Democrats are already pushing back on Alexander\u2019s suggestion that a compromise bill fund cost-sharing subsidies for only a year.   \u201cSolving the CSR problem for a year doesn\u2019t keep the insurance companies in,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the Senate\u2019s strongest Obamacare defenders. \u201cIf we\u2019re going through the trouble of bringing Republicans and Democrats together to forge a compromise, let\u2019s do it for more than one year.\u201d  For now, though, some rank-and-file lawmakers are just excited hearings have been planned.  \u201cI love it,\u201d Murkowski said of the hearings. \u201cSmart people making good things happen.\u201d  Collins, who with Murkowski played a pivotal role in sinking the GOP's repeal bills, was equally enthusiastic: \u201cLamar Alexander is a master at getting bills through.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                The White House is not expected to immediately end the subsidies, even as President Donald Trump stews in the legislative defeat. | Getty  \u000a            By JOSH DAWSEY and JENNIFER HABERKORN  08/02/2017 11:33 PM EDT  President Donald Trump has told advisers repeatedly he wants to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that are crucial to the marketplaces continuing to work, and he has publicly said it would make sense to blow up the system, put the blame on the Democrats and force a negotiation.   But after the inability of Republicans in Congress to repeal and replace the law, the White House is not expected to immediately end the subsidies, officials said, even as Trump stews in the legislative defeat. And they could remain in place indefinitely, some officials said.   Story Continued Below  The administration has slowed a decision to hear from lawyers, who are studying how the payments could be ended and what legal liabilities the administration could face if the payments stop, according to administration officials.  Lawyers and some administration officials have raised questions about ending the payments but are expected to offer an analysis later in August, West Wing officials said. One official said the analysis could arrive as soon as next week. A different official said the White House was in no hurry and wanted to consider all factors before making a decision.   Another payment is due approximately Aug. 22.   Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Insurers rely on the subsidies \u2014 estimated at $7 billion for this year \u2014 to reduce costs for low-income Obamacare customers. If the funding is scrapped, it's anticipated that insurers would jack up premiums by around 20 percent or bolt the Obamacare markets altogether.  The White House is also facing blowback from Republicans who are pushing the administration to keep the subsidies, White House and Capitol Hill officials said. Many Senate Republicans \u2014 notably Sen. Lamar Alexander, who is trying to craft a bipartisan market stability bill with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray \u2014 want the payments to continue, at least for two months to allow the GOP time to appropriate the funding. In recent days, Republicans in leadership have also privately urged the administration to continue the payments, White House officials said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody ought to do anything to hurt the American people. Obamacare is not working," said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). "Until we can get the thing fixed, I think we have to try to maintain the status quo."  Kellyanne Conway, the president's counselor, said last weekend a decision would be made this week. And Trump continues to lean towards ending the subsidies, officials said.   \u000a  \u000a            By TIMOTHY NOAH and MARIANNE LEVINE  But several other officials said to not expect a decision this week.  Some White House officials have grown increasingly annoyed that Republicans want the payments continued even as they failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to two White House officials. Conservatives have said the administration should not continue to pay the subsidies, and some have questioned if they are even legal. And some in the West Wing essentially see the subsidies as a "bailout to the insurance industry," one White House official said.  Whether the president is eventually willing to pull the trigger \u2014 and whether lawyers sign off on the decision, or whether Trump listens to lawyers \u2014 remains unclear. Sen. John Thune, the third ranking Republican in the Senate, said Trump pulling the subsidies would force quick action.   \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t [continue the funding], then Congress will have to look at what our options are," he said.

aV \u000a                Gov. Paul LePage championed a plan that would block-grant Medicaid money back to states, a plan he said would give states the flexibility to target money as they see fit and impose work requirements. | Robert F. Bukaty/AP  \u000a            By LOUIS NELSON  08/02/2017 07:51 AM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/02/2017 06:36 PM EDT  Maine Gov. Paul LePage slammed his state\u2019s senators in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Tuesday night over their opposition to Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, characterizing them as Washington insiders who are out of touch with the residents they represent.  Both Republican Sen. Susan Collins and her colleague, independent Sen. Angus King, voted against legislation that would have advanced GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Collins, a consistent opponent of her party\u2019s repeal-and-replace efforts throughout the process, was one of three Republican lawmakers to join Democrats in voting \u201cno,\u201d essentially scuttling the GOP health care reform plans at least for the time being.  Story Continued Below  \u201cWhen it comes to providing affordable health care to the people of Maine, Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King are worse than out of touch \u2014 they are downright dangerous,\u201d the Maine Republican, wrote in the Journal of the two senators' no votes. \u201cSadly, this is no surprise from senators who are more comfortable cutting deals in the polished marble corridors of Washington than meeting with Mainers struggling to make ends meet.\u201d  LePage blamed King, a former governor of his state, for a 2002 Medicaid expansion that \u201cnearly bankrupted\u201d Maine. He said King\u2019s and Collins\u2019 votes would do the same again, leaving Maine in a financially untenable position by supporting another Medicaid expansion that is \u201ctantamount to giving them another welfare entitlement.\u201d  Instead, LePage championed a plan that would block grant Medicaid money back to states, a plan he said would give states the flexibility to target money as they see fit and impose work requirements.

"Ms. Collins and Mr. King have ignored these ideas, since they are more interested in preening for the cameras than in making real progress,\u201d the Maine governor wrote. \u201cThough they seem unwilling to deliver on their promises of better care, at least they have given Mainers a clear sense of their priorities.\u201d  Despite LePage\u2019s assertion that the two senators had voted against the interests of their own constituents, Collins received an impromptu ovation last Friday in the airport in Bangor, Maine, upon her arrival from Washington. She told CNN last weekend that the applause was \u201cextraordinary, heartwarming, and affirming.\u201d  And later Wednesday, Collins and King issued a joint statement defending their position, saying: "We believe strongly that we cast the right votes on behalf of the people of Maine."  \u201cAfter months of conversations and research, we both reached the same inescapable conclusion that the Senate health care bill would have been extremely harmful to our state, particularly to our most vulnerable populations, including children with disabilities and low-income seniors," Collins and King said. \u201cEvery version of the Senate plan would have increased the number of uninsured by millions and weakened important consumer protections.

aV \u000a                Sens. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander speak on Capitol Hill on Jan. 31. | Alex Brandon/AP  \u000a            By ADAM CANCRYN  08/01/2017 05:46 PM EDT  Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray plan a series of hearings aimed at crafting bipartisan legislation to shore up Obamacare markets by mid-September, in the wake of the GOP\u2019s failed repeal efforts.  The pair said Tuesday afternoon that the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will hold sessions beginning the week of Sept. 4, in a bid to \u201cstabilize and strengthen\u201d the individual health insurance markets.  Story Continued Below  Alexander, the chairman of the committee, emphasized that the work will be bipartisan and that the hearings will feature a range of health policy experts, including state insurance commissioners, patients and insurance industry representatives.  He added that he\u2019s urged President Donald Trump to continue paying for Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies through September, to give Congress time to craft a stabilization plan that would include one year of funding for the payments.  \u201cWithout payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans will be hurt,\u201d Alexander said, adding that any bipartisan stabilization legislation would need to be narrow and also include greater flexibility for states.

Alexander and Murray, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, also committed to including senators outside the HELP panel in its work.  The effort comes as the GOP tries to move on from its failed attempts at dismantling Obamacare \u2014 and despite Trump\u2019s insistence that Senate Republicans take another shot at repeal.   Trump has taunted GOP senators on Twitter and threatened to end cost-sharing subsidy funding, in a move that could drive up premiums and potentially prompt insurers to flee the market altogether. He\u2019s also suggested ending the federal contributions that lawmakers receive to help pay for their own health care.  But top Senate Republicans are ignoring Trump, saying this week that they\u2019re done trying to tear down Obamacare.   Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Senate Republicans couldn\u2019t agree on a way to repeal and replace Obamacare. So now they\u2019re contemplating a totally different approach: Blow it up and let the states sort it out.  The latest attempt to resuscitate the GOP's repeal bid would reshape the nation\u2019s health care system by sharply curtailing the federal government\u2019s role and placing the future of Obamacare in the hands of governors. But Republican senators will have a hard time overcoming the internal divisions that doomed their three attempts last week to unravel the Affordable Care Act.  Story Continued Below  The proposal spearheaded by Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina would send billions of dollars in federal funding set aside for Obamacare directly to states in the form of annual block grants, and give them near-complete control over how to use the money. States could pour funds into ensuring Obamacare continues to function, they said. And those states that don't would also be free to scrap their health care systems and start anew with little federal interference.  \u201cWe attempt to establish fairness for all Americans in terms of the support they receive from the federal taxpayer,\u201d Cassidy said in a floor speech last week.  But in practice, it\u2019s not likely to be that simple. The so-called Graham-Cassidy plan would still force deep health spending cuts, as well as set new limits that would end Medicaid\u2019s open-ended entitlement status and threaten subsidies designed to help people afford coverage. Each element could raise objections from moderate GOP senators. That comes on top of keeping nearly all of Obamacare\u2019s taxes, a likely deal-breaker for conservatives still intent on scrapping the entire law.  Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  And the federal funds sent to the states would come with few strings attached, creating the potential for a patchwork of markets that could make it even more complicated for insurers and patients to navigate an already-complex health care system.  In short, there\u2019s something for everyone to dislike in the proposal \u2014 making it a long shot for a Republican Senate running short on both time and enthusiasm for following through on a seven-year pledge to repeal Obamacare.  \u201cWhat it does is make the federal government spend the money with very little in the way of accountability,\u201d said Judith Solomon, a vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.   But in Graham-Cassidy, Republican leaders are seeking a quick fix that can get the repeal effort back on track. Cassidy, Graham and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) met Monday with top aides to President Donald Trump, and there are efforts also underway to get the endorsement of conservatives Mike Lee of Utah and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). Cassidy described meetings with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and governors as \u201cproductive.\u201d  Under the latest version of the proposal, red states could get near-free rein over their health insurance markets, paving the way for a rollback of such Obamacare pillars as the individual mandate and tight regulations on insurance companies. Blue states like California, meanwhile, could keep much of the status quo in place without having to worry about further federal efforts to repeal the law.  \u201cThe best way to repeal and replace Obamacare is to give each state the resources and responsibility for health care,\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said in a statement. \u201cGovernors and other state leaders are more effective, more efficient and more accountable to the public.\u201d  \u000a  \u000a            By BURGESS EVERETT and JOSH DAWSEY  Still, gaining that broad flexibility comes with the downside of far fewer federal dollars. The Graham-Cassidy plan proposes block granting all the federal funding for Obamacare starting in 2020 at a level that Solomon estimates is 16 percent lower than current law.  The plan would also limit the annual growth of that funding, deepening reductions over time to as much as 34 percent \u2014 or $83 billion \u2014 lower than under Obamacare. That could force difficult trade-offs for officials knowing that a dollar spent on one program \u2014 like Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 means a dollar less spent on another, like tax credits to help people purchase individual insurance plans.   States under the Graham-Cassidy proposal would be required to match as much as 5 percent of the federal dollars they receive by 2025, according to the amendment text \u2014 a concept that some deep red states have already cited as their reason for rejecting Obamacare funding to expand Medicaid.   \u201cNow you\u2019re asking them to pay a match not only for Medicaid expansion, but also for the premium credits and subsidies that have been totally federally funded,\u201d Solomon said.   The block grant concept could create intense competition among states, as each vies for a bigger slice of the overall pie. Cassidy and Graham have touted the plan as a way to ensure that states get the level of funding that they need, but it also risks leaving some with significantly less.  States that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare could end up among the biggest losers under a Graham-Cassidy plan that ends the greater funding given to expansion states and tilts money toward their non-expansion counterparts, potentially putting Republican congressmen in states such as California, New York and New Jersey in a difficult position.  \u000a  \u000a            By STEVEN SHEPARD  \u201cThat gets you right back into some of the issues that they had with repeal and replace,\u201d said Chris Sloan, a senior manager at health care consultancy Avalere. \u201cYou\u2019re going to start ticking off specific delegations.\u201d  It also risks upsetting the insurance industry, which has proved a powerful opponent to the repeal efforts to date. The Graham-Cassidy proposal could generate massive uncertainty in pockets across the nation as individual states race to remake their insurance markets. Broadly uniform regulations and benefit standards would be upended in favor of a patchwork of wildly varying markets, forcing insurers to reevaluate their participation \u2014 and prospects for making a profit \u2014 across a new frontier for health care.   Just the threat of repealing Obamacare has insurers hedging their bets this year, Sloan said, with companies requesting higher premiums and pre-emptively pulling out of shaky markets. Giving states the ability to drastically alter the market on their own risks driving the uncertainty to new heights.  \u201cIt does set up the situation where a lot of states could do things that the health plans think are bad for the industry,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine health plans really supporting something like this.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                On Monday, President Donald Trump seemingly alluded to the insurer payments again, writing on Twitter: "If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?" | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images  \u000a            By PAUL DEMKO  07/31/2017 03:16 PM EDT  President Donald Trump at any time could make good on a threat to scrap crucial Obamacare payments to insurers \u2014 a decision that could raise Obamacare customers\u2019 costs and potentially leave tens of thousands more without any coverage options next year.   While the Obamacare repeal effort has faltered in Congress, Trump has the unilateral power to abolish the payments, worth about $7 billion this year, as he has repeatedly threatened to do. His warnings have escalated since the implosion of the Senate's Obamacare repeal effort last week.   Story Continued Below  \u201cIf a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday, as he also threatened to nix a health insurance subsidy for lawmakers and their aides. On Monday, he seemingly alluded to the insurer payments again, writing: "If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?"  The fallout from pulling Obamacare payments to insurers would be significant. It could cause skittish insurers that have already lost billions in the Obamacare markets to bolt for the exits. At the very least, insurers would hike premiums in 2018 to cover the lost payments.  "We should call this the sabotage surcharge, because that\u2019s literally what this is," said John Gorman, a health care consultant who works with many insurers. "The insurance industry should tattoo this on Trump\u2019s forehead."   Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The subsidies, known as cost-sharing reductions, lower out-of-pocket costs, such as co-payments and deductibles, for Obamacare customers earning less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $30,150 for an individual and $61,500 for a family of four. The payments help cover costs for roughly 7 million Obamacare customers this year.   Insurers are facing looming deadlines for the 2018 enrollment season with the fate of the subsidies still in limbo. They must file final rates in most states in two weeks, and they have just a month to make final decisions about where to sell coverage.   Even if the federal payments disappear, insurers would still be required to discount customers' bills. Insurers aren't going to eat those additional expenses, so they'll either stop selling coverage or jack up rates as much as an estimated 20 percent. Insurers would also likely sue the Trump administration, arguing that they're entitled to the payments.   Uncertainty about subsidy payments has been cited as a factor by some insurers, including Anthem and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, as a factor in their decisions to scale back their Obamacare business next year. Recent insurance exits are now threatening to leave roughly 12,000 Obamacare customers across 19 counties in Ohio, Indiana and Nevada without any insurance options for 2018.   Trump has the power to pull the Obamacare payments thanks to a long-running legal dispute over the program. House Republicans sued the Obama administration in 2014, arguing that the executive branch was funding the program illegally because Congress never appropriated the money. A federal judge sided with the House last year, but the Obama administration appealed the decision.   The Trump administration hasn't dropped the appeal, which would cause the payments to stop flowing, but instead has sought delays from the court as the Obama repeal effort played out in Congress the past six months. But the next deadline for a decision about whether to continue fighting the case comes up in three weeks.   However, Trump could potentially decide to pull the subsidies much sooner. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday said that there will be a decision \u201cthis week\u201d about whether to eliminate the subsidies, which the administration has been issuing each month. The president is scheduled to meet with aides Tuesday to discuss the issue, according to two administration sources.   \u000a  \u000a            By BURGESS EVERETT and JOSH DAWSEY  Trump has insisted scrapping the subsidies would force Democrats to negotiate over an Obamacare replacement plan after the program "implodes." But some aides have so far have talked him out of it, believing the public would blame Trump for damaging the insurance markets.  Congress could eliminate the uncertainty about Obamacare subsidies by appropriating money for the program. Both the Senate and House called for temporarily funding the program in their Obamacare replacement bills, but the repeal effort stalled after the Senate's stunning rejection last week.   Some centrist lawmakers are now pushing for immediate fixes to Obamacare, though conservative hard-liners who oppose Obamacare are unlikely to drop the effort to dismantle the 2010 health care law. Earlier Monday, a bipartisan group of more than 40 House members released a proposal for a short-term marketplace stabilization package that would include funding for the subsidies.   \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a doctor to diagnose that the individual market across the country is not healthy and urgent action is needed to help our constituents,\u201d said Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) in a statement announcing the proposal.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps suspended the rescue operation and launched a recovery effort instead, the Marine base Camp Butler in Japan said in a statement, essentially confirming the military does not expect to find the missing Marines alive.

The Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter, but flies like an airplane. They have been involved in a series of high-profile crashes in recent years.  The aircraft was in Australia for a joint military training exercise held by the U.S. and Australia last month in Shoalwater Bay in Queensland state. The Talisman Sabre exercise, a biennial event between the two nations, involved more than 30,000 troops and 200 aircraft.

aV \u000a            By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  08/04/2017 02:38 PM EDT  WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court has overturned the first-degree murder conviction of a former Blackwater security contractor. The court has ordered a new trial for the man who prosecutors said fired the first shots in the 2007 slayings of 14 Iraqi civilians at a crowded traffic circle in Baghdad.  In a split opinion, the three-judge panel in Washington ruled Friday the trial court erred in 2014 by not allowing Nicholas Slatten to be tried separately from his three co-defendants. The 33-year-old contractor from Tennessee is serving a life sentence. The slayings strained international relations and drew scrutiny of American contractors' role in the Iraq War.  Story Continued Below  The ruling orders new sentences for three other contractors who each received 30-year prison terms for manslaughter and firearms convictions.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV National security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has waged a pitched battle with other senior staff for control over policy and personnel on the National Security Council, is taking advantage of the shield offered by the arrival of his old military colleague John Kelly as White House chief of staff.  Kelly told McMaster this week that he wanted him to remain as national security adviser, said two senior White House aides, and has encouraged him to make any staffing changes he deems necessary. McMaster took that as a green light this week to oust top intelligence aide Ezra Cohen-Watnick \u2014 a Michael Flynn hire who has a warm relationship with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law \u2014 after months of trying.  Story Continued Below  Kelly's arrival did not lead directly to Cohen-Watnick's dismissal, officials said, but was months in the making.   McMaster, a three-star general who was enlisted by Trump to replace Flynn in February, has been an increasingly volatile presence in the West Wing, operating under a cloud of rumors that Trump, with whom he is said to have a testy relationship, was considering reassigning him to another post, possibly sending him to oversee the war in Afghanistan.  In recent weeks, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials who have had direct interaction with him, McMaster has bristled at White House aides close to Trump whom he perceives as undercutting his authority. He seethes over every national security leak and lashes out over negative news stories he thinks are spread by his enemies. And McMaster, whose temper is legendary, frequently blows his top in high-level meetings.  \u201cHe can be very intense,\u201d a McMaster confidant who speaks with him regularly and is a major supporter, told POLITICO Thursday. \u201cSome find that difficult.\u201d  McMaster is fiercely at odds with Steve Bannon, the Trump strategist who was removed from the principals committee of the National Security Council in April after McMaster\u2019s appointment. In mid-July, the two sparred openly, in a widely attended policy meeting about Afghanistan, with McMaster advocating greater U.S. involvement and Bannon arguing for a major pullback.

The dispute got so out of hand, according to a pair of senior White House officials, that Secretary of Defense James Mattis had to intervene to get the discussion back on track.  While he has occasionally clashed with Kushner, the influential son-in-law, has a better relationship with him these days, a White House official with direct knowledge said.   The officials also said that McMaster fumes that he believes Bannon is responsible for leaking negative information about him to the news media \u2014 including via Breitbart.com, the far-right news site Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign in 2016.  Several of the officials, who like others spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of losing their jobs, said McMaster, who holds a Ph.D. in American history, remains on shaky ground with Trump, who they said wants to keep him -- for now.  A spokesman for McMaster declined to address questions about McMaster's relationship with key White House officials and his plans in the days ahead.  McMaster has steadily changed the complexion of the top White House policy shop in the past six months, going after people brought into the NSC by Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after failing to be truthful to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.  Officials say McMaster had a leading role in pushing out K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News analyst and Reagan administration official who served as Flynn's deputy and has been nominated to be ambassador to Singapore. He ousted the top Middle East adviser, an Iran hawk, replacing him with a retired Army colonel and military academic. Another top aide was dismissed after penning a memo that accused globalists, bankers and the \u201cdeep state\u201d of undermining Trump \u2014 somethingMcMaster saw as trafficking in conspiracy theories.  His assault on those whom some have derided as \u201cFlynnstones\u201d reached its pinnacle on Wednesday when he removed Cohen-Watnick. He had been trying to push him out at least since March, when it was alleged in some reports that without authorization he shared classified information with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who at the time was leading the House investigation of potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Other reported accounts disputed that Cohen-Watnick shared the information with Nunes.  Yet for at least a few weeks, Kushner and others close to Cohen-Watnick have tried to land him a different job, knowing his days at the NSC were probably numbered.   \u000aHealthcare  \u000a            By JENNIFER HABERKORN and PAUL DEMKO  McMaster, several of the officials related, was overruled by Kushner and Bannon when he first sought to fire Cohen-Watnick, and he seethed about his inability to get rid of Cohen-Watnick when an article appeared in The Atlantic last month titled \u201cThe Man McMaster Couldn't Fire.\u201d  McMaster has prevailed in some fierce policy fights \u2014 part of a broader battle between Trump administration officials with a more establishment and internationalist worldview, like Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2014 to prevail over the more nationalist vision espoused by Bannon and Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka.  McMaster has achieved some big victories, like preventing Trump from using the controversial phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d that Flynn insisted upon and getting the president to explicitly endorse the NATO charter\u2019s Article 5 \u2014 which commits the United States to the defend its European allies \u2014 after sending mixed signals about the U.S. commitment to the alliance.  But McMaster was excluded from Trump\u2019s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month at the G-20 summit in Germany, has failed to convince Trump to send more troops to Afghanistan, and was barely able to keep the president from ditching the Obama-era deal with Iran to halt its nuclear weapons program.  \u201cThere is a split in the White House between the Bannon camp of ideologues and the McMaster-Mattis-Tillerson camp of more centrist intellectuals,\u201d said Pete Mansoor, a retired Army colonel who worked closely with McMaster and now teaches at Ohio State University. \u201cAnd this conflict is playing out in real time as the Trump administration tries to flesh out its foreign policy and national security policy.\u201d  \u201cThe centrists appear to be winning the battle,\u201d Mansoor added. \u201cBut not always.\u201d  Despite what he has accomplished, McMaster is clearly still very much under fire.  He is accused by his detractors of trying to undercut the president's agenda and has been the subject of a series of negative news stories that he blames on his enemies in the West Wing \u2014 especially Bannon, who people close to him say he believes was behind a recent string of stories on Breitbart that accuse him, among other things, of being anti-Israel.  Before his White House arrival, McMaster was a darling of the media. His best-selling 1997 book, an indictment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the early years of the Vietnam War, gained him a reputation as one of the Army's leading thinkers.  His later exploits as commander of an armored cavalry regiment near the Syrian border in 2006 formed the building blocks of the counterinsurgency strategy that underpinned the surge of American forces a year later to tamp down a sectarian war \u2014 and earned him public accolades from President George W. Bush.  \u000aCongress  \u000a            By SEUNG MIN KIM and RACHAEL BADE  But in spite of all that \u2014 or because of it \u2014 he had his share of detractors inside the ranks. As an iconoclast he rubbed many of the top generals, who also saw him as a publicity hound, the wrong way. It is unlikely he would have ever been promoted to general had it not been for a mentor named David Petraeus, the most accomplished general of his generation and another leading "warrior-intellectual."  In the White House, McMaster finds the fierce public scrutiny grating, according several of his close supporters, including articles that have suggested he sullied his reputation by agreeing to work for Trump in the first place and for defending him publicly \u2014 particularly when he went to bat for his boss after reports that Trump shared classified information with visiting Russian officials in the Oval Office.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how much of H.R.\u2019s reported troubles are real and how much are just crafted by his enemies inside the White House,\u201d said Douglas Ollivant, a retired Army officer who served with McMaster in Iraq and is now a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank. "It\u2019s difficult to know what reality is.\u201d  Another salvo was launched at McMaster on Thursday, after the Washington Post published embarrassing transcripts of Trump's calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico, citing the National Security Council.  A conservative activist group immediately called for his ouster.   \u201cIf you are in charge of something and can\u2019t keep control of your own staff, you lose your job,\u201d said Rick Manning, a former official in the Bush administration and now president of the nonpartisan Americans for Limited Government, which blasted out a news release calling on Trump to fire his national security adviser. "He has lost control of the national security apparatus.\u201d  But McMaster's supporters are certainly not counting him out yet and said his approach may ultimately win over who counts the most: Trump, who admires his hard-charging but thorough approach.  \u201cHe does respect those who produce at the end of the day and come in with a well-thought-out plan,\u201d said the confidant. \u201cMcMaster knows how to run a rigorous process. He seriously wants America to achieve its objectives and to provide the president thoroughly developed, integrated policy options.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Congress is moving to force the Pentagon to violate a nuclear arms treaty with Russia \u2014 in yet another effort to box in President Donald Trump on relations with Moscow.  Language in key defense bills in both the House and Senate would require the military to begin developing medium-range missiles banned by a 1987 treaty that Ronald Reagan negotiated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the twilight years of the Cold War.   Story Continued Below  Supporters say the move is necessary because Russian President Vladimir Putin has violated the pact. But opponents fear it could increase the chances of a nuclear confrontation at a time when relations between the two nations are at a post-Cold War low.   The legislation is also likely to stir up new friction between lawmakers and Trump, who has already accused Congress of illegally meddling in his dealings with Russia. Trump blasted Congress on Wednesday for including \u201cclearly unconstitutional provisions\u201d in a bipartisan bill imposing new sanctions on Putin\u2019s regime \u2014 legislation he said he nonetheless signed "for the sake of national unity."  The Office of Management and Budget has slammed the House push for the new weapon, saying it \u201cunhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific missile system, which would limit potential military response options."  The administration "is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy that maximizes pressure on Russia,\u201d OMB added in a recent statement.  Trump is also getting a rare assist from congressional Democrats alarmed by the potential for a newly stoked nuclear arms race. They include Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who voted to ratify the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988.  Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  "Now, as then, short and medium range nuclear missiles have no deterrent value, while making it more likely for miscalculations to lead to the unthinkable," Leahy said about the new provisions in a statement to POLITICO.  Legal experts are also criticizing the legislation as congressional overreach, saying the Senate can only ratify treaties and the president alone can negotiate or pull out of them. The House has no role whatsoever in approving treaties.   The House\u2019s language, included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed last month, would create a program for developing a land-based missile that is banned by the INF Treaty. The Senate will soon debate a similar provision in its version of the defense policy bill, which would set aside $65 million and also require the military to reintroduce a missile capable of traveling between 500 and 5,500 kilometers \u2014 a weapon that both Cold War rivals phased out three decades ago.  The House language specifically calls for a conventional missile, not a nuclear one, but the treaty itself \u2014 which was designed to limit weapons that could carry an atomic warhead \u2014 does not differentiate between the two.   \u201cIt exceeds the power of Congress,\u201d said Mallory Stewart, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance until earlier this year. \u201cIt is ignoring a division of power that has been recognized since the beginning of our Constitution.\u201d  "It is unclear whether it is even constitutional," agreed Alexandra Bell, another former State Department official.  The National Security Council declined to answer questions about the legality of the missile legislation. A spokeswoman said in a statement that the administration "is currently undertaking an extensive review of our policy" and will "assess the potential security implications for the United States, our allies and partners, and to develop potential response options."  Supporters of the provisions \u2014 including Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2014 assert that Russia's recent deployment of an intermediate-range missile in violation of the treaty requires the U.S. to respond in kind.  \u000a  \u000a            By MATTHEW NUSSBAUM and ELANA SCHOR  Cotton, in an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies last month, also argued that the congressional action would not violate the treaty.   "Under the treaty, we cannot test, produce or possess land-based intermediate-range missiles," he said. "But we can conduct research on how to improve other missiles, such as extending their range or adapting them for different environments. For instance, we could develop a land-based version of the Tomahawk, which we usually launch from Navy ships. This kind of research stays well within the four corners of the INF Treaty, but also prepares us and our allies in case the treaty becomes obsolete."  The military value of the type of weapon Congress is calling for is also very much in doubt.   Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Cotton in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in July that the Russian moves were not a security threat.   "Given the location of the specific missile and the deployment, they don't gain any advantage in Europe," Selva said.   Cotton also asserted that because other nations such as China are not party to the treaty, they could have a military advantage over the United States and its allies \u2014 something Selva pushed back on.   Selva noted in the hearing that that the INF Treaty covers only land-based missiles, not those fired from aircraft or ships at sea. "I believe we can assert that the deployment of missile systems on aircraft and ships will allow us to hold those [Chinese] targets at risk."  Cotton's office did not respond to a request for comment.   For others, the military value of such a weapon is beside the point. They warn that taking steps to develop a weapon outlawed by the INF Treaty would be unlikely to compel the Russians to adhere to it, and could even lead to the same type of nuclear arms race that the treaty was designed to avoid.   \u000a  \u000a            By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL  "Both provisions would authorize funding for a weapon system that lays the groundwork for a new nuclear weapon to be deployed in Europe," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. "We have argued that kind of R&D program is not in any way going to modify Russia's behavior and it gives them an convenient excuse" to develop more weapons.  Kimball and others also contend that no European ally would likely want to host such a weapon.  Several congressional aides said efforts are underway to try to water down the provisions before the Senate and House have to pass a common version of the Defense Authorization Act.   One proposal under consideration by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Armed Services panel, would require the Pentagon to first conduct an analysis on whether a new intermediate-range missile is needed before any funding could be released to develop one, they said.  Warren's office did not respond to several requests for comment.   But there is general agreement in the arms control community that the INF Treaty is worth saving despite the Russian violations.   A group of international experts earlier this year proposed a series of steps to compel Russia to comply.   "The INF Treaty is fundamental to European security," they wrote. "If the treaty collapses, it would further weaken trust between the West and Russia and undermine the entire regime of nuclear arms control between the United States and Russia. This would have unpredictable strategic and political consequences for West-Russia relations. The INF Treaty should be preserved."  Former Democratic Rep. John Tierney, who chaired a national security oversight panel, contends that preserving arms control pacts with Russia needs to be a bigger priority for the Trump administration despite the differences between the two nations.   "These are existential issues," said Tierney, now executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. "They need to be separated out from the others. [Ronald] Reagan understood that. They need to be addressed even when you are not getting along. It was done in the past with Russia and should be done now."  Missing out on the latest scoops?

Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee (right), praised the legislation as \u201ca great victory for our veterans and their futures.\u201d | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  08/02/2017 06:43 PM EDT  The Senate signed off Wednesday on a sweeping expansion of GI Bill education benefits, sending the bipartisan legislation dubbed the "Forever GI Bill" to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.   The bill, which would increase veterans benefits by more than $3 billion over the next decade, passed the Senate by unanimous consent.   Story Continued Below  Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin had encouraged passage of the bill, and a White House spokesman told POLITICO that Trump plans to sign it.   The bill would remove, for new enlistees, the 15-year limit on when recipients must use their GI Bill benefits \u2014 a provision meant to give veterans more flexibility to attend higher education and obtain new skills later in life.   The legislation boosts education assistance for National Guard and Reserve troops, Purple Heart recipients and for the dependents of fallen troops. It also would send funding to nontraditional education providers like coding boot camps.   In addition, the legislation would fully restore the GI Bill education benefits for veterans who were affected by the collapse in recent years of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech, two massive for-profit college chains that had campuses across the country.

So far, more than $70 billion has gone out for veterans and their families to attend colleges, universities and career training programs, and the program is a popular benefit among military personnel.   Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who chairs the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, praised the legislation as \u201ca great victory for our veterans and their futures.\u201d Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the top Democrat on the committee, said he looked forward \u201cto working with President Trump to quickly sign our bill into law.\u201d  Many of the benefit expansions had long been sought by veterans\u2019 groups, which cheered the passage of the bill on Wednesday.  House and Senate leaders in both parties struck a deal over the legislation last month after negotiations earlier this year were bogged down by how to pay for the expansion of benefits.   The expansion would be paid for by reducing the increases in housing allowances paid under the GI Bill to new beneficiaries.   Last month, the measure cleared the House on a 405-0 vote.

aV \u000a                Following the president\u2019s announcement last week that trasngender men and women would no longer be allowed to serve in the military, Commandant Paul Zukunft said he reached out to the secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense to consider the announcement\u2019s implications.  | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  \u000a            By GREGORY HELLMAN  08/01/2017 01:20 PM EDT  The head of the Coast Guard is pledging he \u201cwill not break faith\u201d with transgender personnel, marking the strongest rebuttal yet by a leader of the armed forces to President Donald Trump's declaration that he wants to ban all transgender troops.  Commandant Paul Zukunft, in remarks to a Washington think tank on Tuesday, cited the story of Coast Guard Lt. Taylor Miller, who was featured last week in The Washington Post, to express his support for transgender members of his service.  Story Continued Below  \u201cI told Taylor I will not turn my back,\u201d Zukunft told the Center for Strategic and International Studies forum. \u201cWe have made an investment in you and you have made an investment in the Coast Guard, and I will not break faith.\u201d  The Coast Guard is part of DHS but in wartime can be transferred to the Navy by the president or Congress.   Trump, in a series of tweets last week, said that transgender men and women would not be allowed to serve in the military "in any capacity."  Following the president\u2019s announcement, Zukunft said he reached out to the secretaries of Homeland Security and Defense to consider the announcement\u2019s implications. He also said he has personally reached out to all openly transgender members of the Coast Guard to express his support.  How the president's wishes will be implemented remains unclear. Both Democrats and Republicans, including some who oppose the government paying for the health care of transgender personnel, have criticized the proposal to drum them out of the ranks in strong terms.  Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis reiterated Monday that the Defense Department hasn\u2019t received any additional guidance beyond the president\u2019s tweets last week and that it\u2019s still waiting for a formal order.

He said officials from the White House have reached out to begin drafting the order but declined to get into any specifics, saying that \u201cwe have conversations back and forth all the time with the White House through a variety of channels.\u201d  Asked whether the Pentagon has a solid reason to believe an order will come, Davis said, "We have no reason not to believe we are\u201d getting something.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also told reporters last week that "the White House will work with the Department of Defense and all of the relevant parties to make sure that we fully implement this policy moving forward and do so in a lawful manner."

The U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement the B-1 bombers were escorted by South Korean fighter jets as they performed a low-pass on Sunday over an air base near the South Korean capital of Seoul before returning to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.  It said the mission was a response to North Korea's two ICBM tests this month. Analysts say data from the test conducted Friday night showed a broader part of the mainland United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of Pyongyang's weapons.

The sanctions target six Iranian subsidiaries of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group. The Treasury Department says that group is \u201ccentral\u201d to Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles program.

aV \u000a                The BBC reported the launch of the missile \u2014 which landed in Japan\u2019s territorial waters \u2014 is the 14th so far this year.   \u000a            By JACQUELINE KLIMAS  07/28/2017 11:41 AM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 07/28/2017 03:27 PM EDT  North Korea on Friday launched another ballistic missile that experts estimate had the reach to hit practically all of the major cities on the U.S. mainland.  Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the Defense Department detected the intercontinental ballistic missile launch at 10:41 a.m. Washington time. Launched from Mupyong-ni, he said, the missile traveled about 1,000 kilometers, or more than 600 miles, before coming down in the Sea of Japan.  Story Continued Below  Following the launch, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford and U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris called the South Korean Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Lee Sun Jin to discuss "military response options," Dunford spokesman Capt. Greg Hicks said.  The missile, Davis said, "did not pose a threat to North America."   Arms control experts, however, estimated the missile actually had a range of more than 10,000 kilometers \u2014 more than enough to hit the U.S. mainland.   Jeffrey Lewis, director of the east Asia nonproliferation program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the latest missile was fired straight in the air. And judging by how high the missile went, how far it went and how long it flew, estimates show it could go from 10,800 to 12,000 kilometers on a standard trajectory.   That means the missile could hit several major U.S. mainland cities, including Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston.   Washington was estimated to be about 100 kilometers out of range.  The BBC reported the launch of the missile \u2014 which landed in Japan\u2019s territorial waters \u2014 is the 14th so far this year.   The launch comes after The Washington Post reported the Defense Intelligence Agency has projected that North Korea was on track to field a nuclear-armed ICBM next year.   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Paul Ryan called North Korea "a global menace" and said the country's pursuit of a nuclear weapon that can strike the U.S. "poses clear and immediate danger to our national security."  "We take this threat very seriously. That's why, earlier this week, a bipartisan majority of the House voted to sanction North Korea," he said. "The Kim regime needs to pay for its actions."  Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who chairs the Senate Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee, said the launch pointed to an even greater need for a response from the United Nations and additional sanctions against "those who enable the regime."  "Sitting by and allowing these tests to continue is not an option," she said.   Earlier this month, North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of more than 3,400 miles, long enough to reach Alaska or Hawaii, as well as several U.S. allies in the Pacific. That missile, which flew for 37 minutes, landed off the coast of Japan.   The launches have caused concern among key members of Congress. House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said this week following a closed briefing on the country\u2019s missile capabilities that he was growing \u201cincreasingly alarmed.\u201d  \u201cFor some time, and especially during the last eight years, we have neglected the nation\u2019s missile defenses,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cNow we face a growing threat with significant ground to make up.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                DHS has had trouble filling the assistant secretary of partnership and engagement position. | AP Photo  \u000a            By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and KYLE CHENEY  07/27/2017 06:15 PM EDT  A candidate for a senior position at the Department of Homeland Security withdrew from consideration on Wednesday, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military.  John Fluharty, a former executive director of the Delaware Republican party, informed a DHS official in an email Wednesday morning that he was pulling out of contention to be the assistant secretary of partnership and engagement at the department.  Story Continued Below  \u201cAs I mentioned in our conversation, I am a strong advocate for diversity, both in the Republican Party and in government,\u201d Fluharty wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO. \u201cThe President\u2019s announcement this morning \u2014 that he will ban all of those who identify as transgender from military service \u2014 runs counter to my deeply held beliefs, and it would be impossible for me to commit to serving the Administration knowing that I would be working against those values.\u201d  Fluharty, who is openly gay, said he interviewed for the job on Tuesday, one day before Trump\u2019s surprise tweet that the government \u201cwill not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity\u201d in the U.S. military.  The decision blindsided much of the federal government, including many at the Defense Department and in the White House. It has led to widespread confusion about the what will happen to openly transgender members of the military, and the White House has not yet provided clarity on the issue.  Department officials confirmed Fluharty was under consideration, though it\u2019s unclear whether he was in line to get the job at the department.  \u201cHe was one of many candidates being considered and he withdrew from consideration,\u201d DHS spokesman David Lapan wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of anyone else who withdrew for that reason.\u201d  DHS has had trouble filling the assistant secretary of partnership and engagement position. David Clarke, the sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, who had come under criticism for a series of deaths at the jails he oversees, was under consideration for the job. But DHS announced in June that he was no longer in contention.  Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

The assistant secretary, which does not require Senate confirmation, coordinates outreach to state, local and tribal officials and law enforcement.

aV \u000a                Stephen Miller, a White House senior adviser, touted the bill during a press briefing Wednesday.  \u000a            By TIMOTHY NOAH and MARIANNE LEVINE  08/02/2017 06:58 PM EDT  White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Wednesday that a bill to halve legal immigration would "add to the economy" \u2014 a proposition rejected by most economists.  "This is a historic moment," Miller said at a White House briefing on the bill, which President Donald Trump endorsed earlier Wednesday. He said it was "the biggest proposed change that would take place in 50 years," an apparent reference to the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, which greatly expanded U.S. immigration, especially from non-European countries.  Story Continued Below  But economists consistently say that economic growth depends on expanding the workforce, not shrinking it, as the RAISE Act (S. 354 (115)) would do. The bill, which faces steep opposition from Senate Democrats and pro-immigration Republicans, was sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R.-Ark.) and David Perdue (R.-Ga.).  Economic growth, as measured by Gross Domestic Product, is an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced by workers; the more workers, the more goods they can produce. And with U.S. population growing at its slowest pace since the Great Depression, the only way the workforce can expand is through immigration.  Economists therefore tend to worry not about there being too much immigration, but rather not enough. "For the past half century," a 2015 McKinsey report said, "the twin engines of rapid population growth (expanding the number of workers) and a brisk increase in labor productivity powered the expansion of gross domestic product. ... This demographic tailwind is weakening and even becoming a headwind in many countries."  Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

In his remarks, Miller focused on the downward pressure immigration placed on wages for native-born Americans, citing findings by Harvard economist George Borjas about the effects of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans into Florida. "He went back and reexamined and opened up the old data," Miller said, "and talked about how it actually did reduce wages for workers who were living there at the time."  Miller said the United States\u2019 current policy for issuing green cards had led to \u201csignificant reductions in wages for blue-collar workers, massive displacement of African-American and Hispanic workers, as well as the displacement of immigrant workers from previous years.\u201d   But Borjas, whose study of the Marielitos disputed an earlier one finding no wage effect by Berkeley economist David Card, found a "substantial" decrease in wages only for high-school dropouts \u2014 a finding in line with Borjas's earlier studies of immigration's impact nationally.   Miller said high levels of immigration have "exacerbated wealth inequality in the country in a pretty significant way.\u201d But the growth in inequality over the past 40 years has been a middle-class phenomenon, with disparities rising between middle and high incomes. Poverty trends (which encompass high-school dropouts) have remained relatively stable during this period.  The RAISE Act would de-emphasize family connections as a consideration in immigration to focus more on potential workers' skill levels. This would place \u201cupward pressure on wages instead of downward pressure,\u201d Miller said.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL  But there's no evidence that the H-1B guest-worker program, which brings skilled workers into the U.S., has raised incomes for comparably skilled native workers. Indeed, Democrats and Republicans alike have complained that it has displaced skilled native workers, which would have the effect of lowering wages.  Miller has conferred with Sen. Dick Durbin (D.-Ill.) and Chuck Grassley (R.-Iowa) about their proposed bipartisan legislation to reform the H-1B visa program. But the Trump administration has yet to endorse it. Asked Wednesday about guest worker programs, Miller said "that\u2019s a separate thing."   In April, Trump signed an executive order to develop reforms of the H-1B program. But guest workers have proved a problematic issue for the Trump administration due to business pressure to increase their number and the Trump Organization's own dependence on guest workers. According to BuzzFeed, Mar-A-Lago and Trump's nearby National Golf Club have requested 230 guest worker visas since Trump launched his presidential campaign.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                        The Dow\u2019s climb above 22,000 has given the president steady Twitter fodder, shrugging off warnings about an overpriced stock market.  \u000a            By BEN WHITE  08/02/2017 02:15 PM EDT  NEW YORK \u2014 The stock market has a new cheerleader in chief.  President Donald Trump has latched onto gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke 22,000 for the first time Wednesday, as a key accomplishment of his tenure while railing against others for his struggles on health care, Russia and more. The president has tweeted about the stock market at least 10 times in the past month. \u201cHighest Stock Market EVER,\u201d he proclaimed on Monday.   Story Continued Below  American presidents traditionally avoid weighing in on the daily gyrations on Wall Street for a simple reason: Stocks also go down.  Now that Trump has eagerly claimed credit for instilling investor confidence and driving share prices to fresh highs, he stands to take the blame if markets hit a rough patch and decline. With fights looming over raising the debt limit and funding the government \u2014 and with tax reform far from a certainty \u2014 Wall Street analysts caution a significant pullback is possible that could leave Trump badly exposed. One widely followed measure of stock market valuation, by economist Robert Shiller, puts the S&P 500 more than 40 percent above its historical relationship to corporate earnings.  \u201cPresidents typically don't brag about the stock market much,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, who served as top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who generally avoided market commentary even though the Dow rose about 140 percent during his tenure. \u201cThat's because it doesn't make sense to take credit for something that goes up if you don't want to be blamed when it goes down.\u201d  \u201cPlus, presidents normally care more about ordinary folks as a measure of the economy than about how the Wall Street investors are doing,\u201d Goolsbee said.  Trump\u2019s recent stock market exhortations are also a sharp reversal from his views during the 2016 campaign, when he repeatedly dismissed the increase in stock prices as phony. \u201cIt's all a big bubble,\u201d he said on Fox News almost exactly a year ago. He predicted the bubble would burst if the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, which it is now doing. \u201cIf rates go up, you're going to see something that's not pretty,\u201d he said.

You can unsubscribe at any time.  Republican communications professionals are watching Trump\u2019s repeated invocation of the stock market with concern, both because cheerleading stock prices does not exactly fit with his populist message and out of fear of a correction on Wall Street.   \u201cThis was something that always aggravated me when I worked in Hill leadership,\u201d said Kevin Madden, Mitt Romney\u2019s chief spokesman during the 2012 campaign and now a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies. \u201cOther offices would try to get ahead of an expected Dow milestone by putting out a joint statement taking credit for it. But I never met a market analyst or economist who thought that was a good idea.\u201d  \u201cThe better, long-term communications strategy should focus on the big picture and how a policy agenda will boost the fundamentals driving the economy that truly matter to people,\u201d Madden said.  How much credit Trump actually deserves for the new records on Wall Street also remains an open question. Stocks surged after the election on hopes that Trump would deliver strongly pro-business policies, including reduced regulations and corporate tax cuts.  But the pace of the gains moderated as the administration got dragged into controversy after controversy, faced staffing troubles and suffered the collapse of its Obamacare repeal efforts.  The Trump effect can still be seen \u2014 especially in the soaring shares of big banks anticipating softer regulations \u2014 but analysts now say most of the increases are based on fundamentals like strong corporate earnings and continued modest economic and job growth that are in line with the trend under Obama. The Fed\u2019s slow and methodical approach to raising interest rates is also helping boost stocks to new highs.   \u201cI think most of it has been fundamentals right from the get-go,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. \u201cA lot of the market movement started the summer prior to the election when you had the global manufacturing recession ending and the two-year pause in the earnings cycle ending. There were a lot of fundamentally good things happening that were largely the reason for this rally.\u201d   \u000a  \u000a            By JENNIFER HABERKORN  Paulsen and other analysts, however, do credit Trump for changing investor attitudes about the regulatory climate for banks, drug companies, the energy sector and other industries. \u201cThe lasting impact of Trump, to me, is that he stopped and maybe even rolled back the Obama regulatory trade,\u201d Paulsen said.   Even with the new record on the Dow, Trump actually trails many recent presidents in stock market performance over the first six months of an administration. The Dow rose about 11 percent during Obama\u2019s first six months, compared with 9 percent for Trump, about the same increase as under President Bill Clinton in 1992. The recent record belongs to President George H.W. Bush, with a 15 percent increase in 1988, according to data compiled by the Bespoke Investment Group.   There is something of a silver lining in stock prices now for Trump. Because Wall Street is no longer counting on massive tax cuts or a full rewrite of financial regulations, there could be less of a risk of collapse if Trump\u2019s agenda stalls.   \u201cThe Trump trade is pretty much gone from the market right now,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. \u201cThat\u2019s a far cry from where we were in December, when investors assumed everything Trump promised would be signed into law.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                President Donald Trump will soon call on U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open an investigation against China. | Evan Vucci/AP  \u000a            By ANDREW RESTUCCIA and DOUG PALMER  08/01/2017 11:50 PM EDT  The Trump administration is preparing to take action against China over trade as soon as this week, two administration officials familiar with the issue told POLITICO.  President Donald Trump will soon call on U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open an investigation against China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 for violations of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers.  Story Continued Below  As POLITICO reported earlier this week, senior Trump aides held a series of high-level meetings in recent days to finalize the decision, which is the culmination of three months of regular huddles on trade.   Trump's aides have been deeply divided on trade, with top trade adviser Peter Navarro and chief strategist Steve Bannon calling for aggressive measures, while others, like National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, have urged caution. But an administration official said the decision to launch a Section 301 investigation won broad support among the president's ideologically diverse staff.  "We found a sweet spot," one administration official said.   An announcement is expected late this week, but an official cautioned it could slip into next week.

Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with China in recent months, fuming in public and in private about what he views as the country\u2019s unfair trade practices. He has separately complained that China isn\u2019t doing enough to stop North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the United States.  The pending decision would dramatically escalate tension between the United States and China \u2014 and it could result in steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  U.S. companies have complained they are often forced to share valuable technology with Chinese counterparts as a condition of doing business in the country. Section 301 allows the U.S. to impose unilateral duties against countries that impose barriers to U.S. exports.  Any administration action would give Lighthizer a leading role in a lengthy investigation that could peer into all aspects of Chinese industrial policies and potentially result in unilateral U.S. trade sanctions. As talk of the possible move circulated this week throughout the trade community, the trade representative's press office has remained mum.  Frustration that China is not doing more to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear program seems to be motivating the administration to fire a shot across the bow on the trade front, one source said. Many in the business community are likely to silently cheer the action as long overdue, but others may be worried about a further souring of the business environment and possible Chinese retaliation, a second source said.   \u000a  \u000a            By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL  The Commerce Department is separately completing its own investigation into steel imports that could result in additional actions against China. That investigation is ongoing and likely won\u2019t be unveiled this week, sources said.  Section 301 has not been widely used since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, when the United States began to litigate disputes through the Geneva-based body rather than take through unilateral action. However, it remains on the books as a potential tool.   Aggrieved industries can file a petition asking for an investigation into unfair trade practices, or the USTR can self-initiate a probe. Once the trade agency makes a finding of unfair trade, it would be empowered to seek a negotiated settlement - backed up with the threat of possible retaliation if no deal is made.   Lighthizer is well-versed in use of the tool from his previous stints at USTR in the 1980s during the Reagan administration, when it was utilized on a number of occasions.   Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats are set to roll out new trade legislation Wednesday with a special emphasis on stopping China and other countries from cheating on trade rules and manipulating markets for an unfair advantage.  Schumer has repeatedly goaded Trump to make good on campaign promises to get tough on China. On Tuesday, he urged the president to punish Beijing for its failure to stop North Korea by blocking it from making any further purchases of U.S. companies. \u201cIf China does not change its posture, the U.S. should take clear and firm action to seek to ensure China\u2019s cooperation," Schumer said.  The Democrats\u2019 new bill is part of their effort to convince voters they can offer \u201ca better deal\u201d for the middle class than the Republicans can under Trump.

aV Senate Republicans are hoping a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill can solve their stalemate over dismantling Obamacare. But this partial Obamacare repeal \u2014 which is gaining steam in the Senate \u2014 could destabilize already wobbly Obamacare insurance markets, make premiums jump and increase the number of uninsured by millions, health policy experts say.  \u201cI call it the 20-percent-increase-in-premiums-and-at least-15-million-out-of-insurance plan,\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d   Story Continued Below  The slimmed down repeal bill, H.R. 1628 (115), is the Senate GOP\u2019s fallback if they can\u2019t agree on anything more comprehensive. The idea is to get rid of the unpopular individual and employer mandates, as well as a tax on medical devices, but leave everything else intact \u2014 and get the 50 votes needed to pass it. Killing the individual mandate would take away the primary mechanism that helped build the Obamacare insurance markets. The CBO estimated 16 million fewer people would have coverage in a decade without the individual mandate tax penalty in place, based on an analysis requested by Senate Democrats.   Chris Jacobs, a conservative health policy analyst, points out a historical irony if the Senate passes legislation that only nibbles at the edges of Obamacare. Two years ago it was conservative hardliners in the Senate who rejected similar House legislation because it didn\u2019t go far enough in undoing the federal health care law.   But that was when then-President Barack Obama was certain to veto any repeal measure. On Wednesday, the Senate rejected a straight repeal bill modeled on the 2015 legislation, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in defeating the measure.

Scrapping the individual mandate, the heart of the skinny bill, is the problematic piece. The tax penalty for failing to obtain coverage is the most unpopular provision of Obamacare. But most health care policy experts believe it\u2019s necessary to have a mandate or some other cudgel to persuade relatively healthy people to get covered. Otherwise, young and healthy people will take their chances, while older and sicker people drive up insurance prices.  Senate Republicans say those fears are overblown. They don\u2019t expect this fallback proposal to be the end of the story. It would merely be a means to get beyond the repeal impasse. It would then go to a conference committee between the Senate and the House, which passed a much more extensive repeal bill in early May.   "If they move to the skinny solution, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s looking at it as a solution that would actually be the solution that the House and Senate together would come to,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s thinking the House would just pass that and it\u2019d be the end of it."  Passing legislation that could raise premiums is problematic for Republicans since they\u2019ve repeatedly cited reducing premiums as their No. 1 goal in pushing forward with repeal efforts.   \u000a  \u000a            By TYLER FISHER, SARAH FROSTENSON, JEREMY C.F. LIN and JON MCCLURE  But many experts say that\u2019s precisely what would happen.  \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it would increase premiums,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, even if experts don\u2019t agree on quite how much.  An analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress predicts that premiums would increase by an average of 20 percent \u2014 or about $1,200 per year \u2014 if the individual mandate is scrapped, in addition to the CBO estimate of 16 million fewer insured.   Many conservative health care policy analysts scoff at those numbers. They think CBO overestimates the power of the individual mandate to compel people to get coverage. But even they acknowledge that there would be significant premium increases that would gradually diminish marketplace enrollment.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something like 25 percent,\u201d said Joe Antos, a health care finance expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re going to have that kind of increase is inevitably going to discourage people from signing up.\u201d  In the past, states such as New York and Washington that have required insurers to accept all customers regardless of medical condition without adopting a coverage requirement have seen their markets implode in a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d The markets only attracted customers with expensive medical needs, premiums spiraled upward and insurers eventually headed for the exits.   \u000aCongress  \u000a            By BURGESS EVERETT, SEUNG MIN KIM and JENNIFER HABERKORN  In Washington state, for example, 19 insurers were selling individual plans before the state eliminated its individual mandate in 1995. Within four years there were no insurers willing to sell that coverage.   But a death spiral is unlikely for the Obamacare markets even if the individual mandate is eliminated, according to health care finance experts. That\u2019s because generous subsidies would remain in place, which more than 80 percent of Obamacare customers receive. That means they\u2019re largely protected from big premium increases and would have little incentive to drop their coverage.   \u201cNeither the New York or Washington experiences are analogous here because those states didn\u2019t\u2019 have significant subsidies,\u201d said Levitt. \u201cThe subsidies are really important in preventing a full-on death spiral.\u201d   In fact, Washington state Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler, a Democrat, argues that the individual mandate is less important in the current environment than getting certainty around whether Obamacare\u2019s subsidies will remain in place. That includes cost-sharing payments, estimated to be $7 billion this year, that President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to eliminate. Those payments, which are made to insurers, are meant to cushion low-income people from out-of-pocket expenses like co-pays and deductibles.   \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make sure those subsidies remain in place or you run a very serious risk of collapsing these marketplaces,\u201d Kreidler said.   He points out that one of the state\u2019s major insurers has already significantly scaled back its Obamacare footprint in large part because of uncertainty about the future of the marketplace.   \u201cInsurance companies are conservative by their nature,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cAll of this saber rattling makes the markets that much less stable."

aV \u000a                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accompanied by Congressional Democrats, speaks in Berryville, Virginia on July 24 to unveil their new agenda. | Cliff Owen/AP Photo  \u000a            By HEATHER CAYGLE and ELANA SCHOR  07/24/2017 06:10 PM EDT  BERRYVILLE, VA. \u2014 Congressional Democratic leaders descended on this rural Virginia town Monday to unveil a progressive economic package they say can win back working-class voters next November, even in red states.  And noticeably missing, amid the talk of raising wages and reining in corporate interests, were the left-leaning stances on social issues that help form the backbone of the party, such as immigration, abortion and LGBT rights.  Story Continued Below  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed that his party\u2019s red-state incumbents would largely embrace the new agenda \u2014 which, he acknowledged, purposefully avoids the social issues that have already opened a rift this year between the party\u2019s liberal base and centrist bloc.  \u201cThere is not that divide on economic issues,\u201d Schumer told reporters as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose anti-corporate agenda influenced Democrats\u2019 new economic strategy, worked a small but adoring crowd in a county that went for Donald Trump by more than 55 percent last year.  \u201cThe focus starts on economic issues,\u201d Schumer continued. \u201cThat\u2019s where the American people are hurting. That\u2019s what we most felt was missing in the past in the last several elections.\u201d  The streamlined economic focus, if successful, offers a dual benefit for Democrats: First, it could appeal to center-right voters who may be open to Democrats\u2019 populist economic pitch but turned off by their liberal social plank. Second, by focusing on creating jobs and increasing wages, Democrats can avoid, at least for now, some of the tough family conversations on issues like abortion and immigration that have lately magnified simmering party divisions.

Still, the decision to downplay social issues is remarkable for a party that has largely defined itself in recent years by aggressively advocating for abortion access, expanding rights for LGBT Americans and providing citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Republicans jeered their opponents for offering an agenda that had some echoes of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, predicting a focus on policing corporate mergers in the airline and telecom industries would fall flat with voters in the red and purple states where Democrats have to win to claw back power in 2018.   The GOP also mocked the similarity of Democrats\u2019 \u201cBetter Deal\u201d to Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d agenda for his party and the \u201cBetter Ingredients, Better Pizza\u201d tagline of Papa John\u2019s Pizza. Protesters on the sidelines in Berryville silently hoisted Papa John\u2019s boxes with an image, created by the conservative opposition group America Rising, that lampooned House Democrats for reelecting Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).  National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Bob Salera predicted in a statement that red state Democrats up for reelection next year would be \u201cin for a shock\u201d if Schumer, Pelosi and Warren make good on their vow to travel around the country to sell \u201cthe same failed policies and same failed leaders that have already been rejected time and again.\u201d  The Democrats who gathered in Berryville countered that their economic agenda, the product of months of polling and internal meetings, would play well in the heartland. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said that working-class voters care about corporate consolidation \u201cwhen it starts hitting them in the pocketbook.\u201d  Republicans \u201cshouldn\u2019t be so cocky about it,\u201d she told POLITICO, \u201cwhen maybe they need to look back at history, at Teddy Roosevelt.\u201d  Those on the dais for Monday\u2019s rollout notably included none of the 10 Senate Democratic incumbents who face reelection next year in states Trump turned red, although Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who represents a GOP-leaning district, was in attendance. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a member of Democratic leadership who Republicans are fighting hard to topple next year, was invited to the event but declined because of a scheduling conflict.  Manchin supports the tax, trade and expanded broadband elements of the agenda, spokesman Jonathan Kott said. He and 16 fellow Senate Democrats have not signed on to the $15 minimum wage bill that Pelosi has vowed to pass quickly if her party takes the House next year.  \u000aPolitics  \u000a            By TIM ALBERTA and ZACK STANTON   The chairman of Senate Democrats\u2019 2018 campaign arm, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, said in an interview that Democrats had achieved \u201coverwhelming consensus\u201d on the agenda, which was crafted through outreach in \u201cplaces Trump won as well as those he didn\u2019t.\u201d  \u201cMembers will emphasize the parts that they think are most focused on the needs of their states,\u201d added Van Hollen.  But hours before Schumer and Pelosi unveiled their agenda, the network of Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 one of their party\u2019s most popular leaders, despite officially being an independent \u2014 took a shot at them from the left.  Our Revolution, the outside group the Vermont independent formed after losing the Democratic presidential nomination to Clinton, announced a Tuesday event alongside more than a dozen other liberal groups petitioning Democratic leaders to back bills that \u201creflect the real concerns facing the American people.\u201d  Among the legislation on the progressives\u2019 wish list agenda are some of the same issues Democratic leaders sidestepped Monday: immigrant and abortion rights, as well as action on climate change and a tax on Wall Street transactions.  Schumer, when asked about the Our Revolution push, said Sanders had \u201cgreat input\u201d in Democrats\u2019 agenda.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do here is choose things that just about every Democrat can support but that really resonates with the American people,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cAnd a lot of them are things Bernie Sanders campaigned on.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

Democrats have searched for a new message since their loss to President Donald Trump in November, with public polling showing that most people don't know what Democrats stand for beyond opposition to the unpopular president. The left wing of the party, including many followers of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pushed for the party to adopt a more populist economic message, including single-payer health care.   Asked if single-payer was on the table, Schumer responded: "Sure."  "Many things are on the table. Medicare for people above 55 is on the table. A buy-in to Medicare is on the table.

Scaramucci's hiring on Friday led to the departure of press secretary Sean Spicer, who resented working for the former hedge fund executive with no professional communications experience. In an appearance on CNN's "State of the Union," Scaramucci hinted he might make major changes to the administration's communications operation.  Story Continued Below  "There's obviously a communications problem, because there's a lot that we've done as it relates to executive orders, bills that have been signed, economic progress \u2014 I don't want to cite all the economic data, but the economy is super-strong, business optimism is way up," he said, adding later: "I just think we need to deliver the messaging a little bit differently than we've been doing it in the past."

"I think we should put the cameras on," he said. "But if the president doesn't want the cameras on, we're not going to put the cameras on. It's going to really be up to him."   He also said he wanted to "soften up" the administration's relationship with the press. "They're tough on us, so let's be tough on them," he said.   Scaramucci predicted both tax reform and a repeal of Obamacare would pass before the end of the year \u2014 something of which Republicans outside the White House are intensely skeptical.  "If the president gets those two pillars done, which I predict he will, over the next six months, you and I will hopefully sit down around Christmastime and be having a different conversation about the presidency, the communication coming out of the White House and our achievements," Scaramucci said.  Appearing on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Scaramucci also said he would work to cut down on leaks coming out of the White House, even suggesting he will \u201cpare down staff\u201d to eliminate the leaks, a major point of frustration for Trump.  \u201cWe have to get the leaks stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cI will take dramatic action to stop those leaks.\u201d   Missing out on the latest scoops?

Fifty-one percent of those polled said they believe the stock market will end 2017 higher than it is right now, and 30 percent said they anticipate a lower finish. Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they think they are moving closer to reaching their career and financial hopes.  Story Continued Below  But just 46 percent of those polled said they approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, and 47 percent said they approved of his record on job creation. Overall, just 40 percent of respondents said they approve of the job Trump has done as president. Fifty-five percent said they view him unfavorably and 61 percent said the nation is headed down the wrong path, both numbers that climbed 12 points relative to a Bloomberg poll taken last December.  The president\u2019s net favorability rating was 41 percent in Monday\u2019s poll, a 9-point dip relative to last December, when Trump was president-elect.  Trump\u2019s rhetoric appears to have taken a toll on his standing among poll respondents, with 56 percent saying that his statements and actions have made them more pessimistic about the president. Last December, 55 percent said Trump\u2019s statements and actions made them more optimistic about him.  Those polled also expressed skepticism that Trump will follow through on some of his most high-profile campaign promises. Just 30 percent said they think the president will successfully oversee the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, while 67 percent predicted the wall will not be built. Just 43 percent said they expect the president to revive the U.S. coal industry and 47 percent said he will succeed in reforming the tax code.  On other campaign promises, respondents were more optimistic: 66 percent said they expect Trump to significantly cut government regulations, while 54 percent predicted the president will negotiate trade deals with foreign nations that are beneficial to the U.S. Fifty-three percent said they expect Trump to make good on his promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

Seventy-three percent of those polled said relations with Mexico have worsened under Trump, while 55 percent and 62 percent said the same of Germany and Cuba, respectively.  Trump has improved relations with the United Kingdom, 51 percent of respondents said.  The Bloomberg poll was conducted from July 8-12, with 1,001 adults nationwide via landlines and cellphones.

aV \u201cObamacare is dead,\u201d President Donald Trump frequently declares.  But reports of its demise appear to be premature. For the first time ever this year, insurers selling plans in Obamacare\u2019s markets appear to be on a path toward profitability. And despite the drumbeat of headlines about fleeing insurers, only about 25,000 Obamacare customers live in communities facing the prospect of having no insurer next year.  Story Continued Below  Insurers in the Obamacare marketplaces spent 75 percent of premiums on medical claims in this year's first quarter, an indication the market is stabilizing and insurers are regaining profitability, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study released this week. By comparison, in the prior two years, insurers spent more than 85 percent of premiums on medical costs during the same period, which translated into huge losses.  \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any evidence of a death spiral or a market collapse,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, Kaiser\u2019s associate director of health reform and private insurance. \u201cRather, what it looks like is insurers are on track to have their best year since the [Affordable Care Act] began.\u201d  The financial results are only for the first quarter, and there are still plenty of problems with the markets: Just 141 insurers submitted plans to sell on the exchange market for next year \u2014 a nearly 40 percent decrease from this year, HHS said this week. And there are 38 counties nationwide where no insurer has filed any plans to sell for 2018, potentially leaving 25,000 individuals with no coverage options. In addition, insurers in many states are once again seeking eye-popping premium increases, often exceeding 20 percent.  Another sign of trouble: The uninsured rate nationwide ticked up to 11.7 percent, according to a Gallup survey this week, up from a historic low of 10.9 percent.   But those woes don\u2019t mean the Obamacare markets are on the verge of collapse. One big reason for their resilience: the overwhelming majority of Obamacare customers are eligible for subsidies that shield them from big price spikes.   \u201cYou have about 10 million people, mostly low-income, who are relying on this program for their sole source of health care coverage,\u201d said Dan Mendelson, president of the health care consultancy Avalere Health. \u201cThat gives the program some level of stability and implies that it is unlikely that there will be a complete implosion of this benefit program.\u201d  Much of the current turmoil can be attributed at least in part to questions about the future. The ongoing slog to pass an Obamacare repeal package means insurers have no clear understanding of the long-term makeup of the individual market.   In addition, mixed signals from the Trump administration about whether it will continue making crucial subsidy payments or keep enforcing the individual mandate are further unsettling insurers.  \u201cThe Trump administration has poured gasoline on the fires of uncertainty in the private insurance market,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cWhat plans need more than anything else is some predictability and some certainty.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s been six and a half months so far and they still haven\u2019t gotten to any clear policy or even a clear signal,\u201d added Joe Antos, a health care finance expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.  Insurers' filings for 2018 highlight how that uncertainty is contributing to struggles in the markets. In Tennessee, for example, the state's dominant Blue Cross Blue Shield plan wants to raise rates by an average of 21 percent for next year. But the insurer attributed that increase entirely to uncertainty about federal subsidy payments and enforcement of the individual mandate.   The Kaiser data tracks projections by industry analysts that the Obamacare markets are on a path toward viability, despite the financial bloodletting of the law's early years that saw billions of dollars in losses. An April report by analysts at Standard and Poor\u2019s found that Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which dominate many Obamacare markets, saw big improvements in their bottom line last year and that many would approach break-even margins this year.

Any blanket statements about the viability of the Obamacare markets are bound to be misleading. That\u2019s because there are really 51 different state markets, including D.C. with unique characteristics.   California has experienced vigorous competition, relatively stable pricing and healthy enrollment from the outset. A recent report from the Trump administration showed that the average enrollee in the state's marketplace, Covered California, last year was 20 percent less expensive than Obamacare customers nationwide.   \u201cI sort of feel like we\u2019re in an alternate universe to some of the national rhetoric,\u201d said Peter Lee, Covered California\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe continue to have a very stable and well-functioning market in California, as is the case in much of the nation.\u201d  California hasn\u2019t announced rates for 2018, but Lee stressed that uncertainty around the cost-sharing subsidies, the individual mandate and GOP repeal efforts will drive prices much higher than otherwise would be necessary.   \u201cThe business of health insurance is not like rolling the dice or playing blackjack,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is actuaries that bet on certainty.\u201d  Maryland\u2019s marketplace looks very different. The state\u2019s largest insurer, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, wants to raise rates by more than 50 percent for 2018. The other three competing insurers are seeking increases of at least 23 percent. It\u2019s the second straight year that Maryland's individual market insurers are seeking huge increases.  \u000aCongress  \u000a            By BURGESS EVERETT and RACHANA PRADHAN  \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the term death spiral? I think unfortunately that\u2019s where we are,\u201d said Maryland Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer, Jr., a Republican.   Redmer is dismissive of suggestions that the market\u2019s struggles are the result of uncertainty caused by the actions of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.   \u201cTo say we\u2019re seeing a 50 percent rate increase because of uncertainty is ludicrous,\u201d Redmer said. \u201cThat ignores history. Uncertainty did not create half a billion dollars in losses over the last four years.\u201d   The biggest blow to the Obamacare markets in recent months has been Anthem\u2019s decision to pull back from the marketplaces. The Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, which this year sold coverage in 14 states, is exiting or scaling back its footprint significantly in Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana and Nevada, leaving potentially bare counties in three of those states.  But those exits have been at least partially offset by Centene\u2019s decision to significantly expand its Obamacare footprint. The insurer is entering three new states and expanding its presence in six others. In Missouri, for example, 25 counties were at risk of having no insurer before Centene announced it would sell plans in those markets.  The problem of counties without insurers could still blow up in the coming weeks. That\u2019s because insurers typically have until late September to make final decisions about market participation.   If they see more signs of market mayhem -- in particular, if the Trump administration follows through on threats to cut off cost-sharing subsidies -- there could still be a mass exodus.   \u201cI would have expected more insurance companies to be exiting,\u201d said Kaiser\u2019s Cox. \u201cIt has been remarkable how resilient this market has been.\u201d   Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.

aV President Donald Trump has only limited tools for venting his often-expressed fury at CNN, even as his administration weighs whether to approve AT&T's bid to purchase the network's parent company, Time Warner.  White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has pushed the idea of blocking the merger, a White House official told POLITICO on Thursday, after months in which the president has accused the news network of airing "fake" and "dishonest" coverage of his administration. But the official added that Bannon hasn't mentioned the matter in recent days and that it does not appear to be at the top of his agenda.  Story Continued Below  And many industry observers say Trump's Justice Department has no obvious antitrust arguments for blocking AT&T's $85 billion deal, which would give the telecom and wireless giant control of an entertainment conglomerate whose holdings include CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. movie studio.  "Just because you don't like CNN doesn't mean you can block a merger," said Rich Greenfield, a media and tech analyst at the investment research firm BTIG. "You still need a legal basis, and calling CNN 'fake news' or 'FNN' doesn't make the transaction illegal."  The New York Times reported Wednesday that White House officials were discussing using the merger review as a \u201cpotential point of leverage\u201d over CNN, whose tensions with the Trump administration have worsened in recent weeks.  But other factors add to the political awkwardness of any potential move to block the megadeal: Trump\u2019s pick to head the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, said in October that he didn't think the purchase would pose a "major" antitrust problem. (Delrahim, who is still awaiting confirmation, later declined to comment on the merger at his Senate nomination hearing.) And the GOP-led Federal Communications Commission has indicated it will not review the deal because it's structured in a way that puts it outside the agency's jurisdiction.

Still, Trump has made plain his disdain for CNN, even singling out the network on Thursday during his trip to Europe. \u201cThey have been fake news for a long time,\u201d he told reporters during a news conference in Poland.   Days earlier, Trump had tweeted a link to a wrestling video that portrayed the president hitting a man with a CNN logo superimposed on his face. CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski later reported that he had located the anonymous Reddit user who first posted the video, stirring up a fuss that prompted Trump supporters to accuse the network of "blackmail."  CNN did not respond to a request for comment, though the network's president, Jeff Zucker, told the Times that the pending deal does not influence his management of the network. Time Warner declined to comment, and AT&T did not respond to a request for comment.  If the administration does intervene in the AT&T-Time Warner deal, it would frame Trump's stance as an opposition to business monopolies rather than a war on the media, the White House official told POLITICO.   Trump himself framed the issue that way during the presidential campaign, when he pledged that his administration would not approve AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner. In an October speech, he called the deal "an example of the power structure I\u2019m fighting" and said it represents "too much concentration of power in the hands of too few." The language was striking because it echoed the rhetoric of Democrats who oppose megamergers, rather than the business-friendly attitude of mainstream Republicans.  \u000a  \u000a            By POLITICO STAFF  His stance has been murkier since then. In December, the Financial Times reported that Trump\u2019s transition team \u201creassured AT&T that its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner will be scrutinized without prejudice," a message that left AT&T executives feeling \u201cconfident.\u201d Trump appeared to soften his rhetoric in a February interview with Breitbart News, declining to comment on the merger specifically while saying he wants to ensure competition in the industry.   The prospect of the White House using the government's review as a cudgel against CNN sparked criticism Thursday from Democrats, who otherwise agree with Trump's original concerns about concentrating so much power in AT&T's hands.  \u201cI have serious concerns about the AT&T-Time Warner merger because it stands to reduce consumers\u2019 choices while increasing their costs," Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told POLITICO. "Those are factors the government is supposed to take into account. Using news coverage of the president as a factor would be illegal and flies in the face of the First Amendment.\u201d  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), another skeptic of the merger, said an "independent antitrust division" should make the decision on the merger, adding, "The Trump administration\u2019s war against the media must not influence the fate of this transaction."  The deal would combine AT&T's wireless, broadband and pay-TV services, including DirecTV, with Time Warner\u2019s media properties. Liberal critics say the deal would unfairly disadvantage competitors by giving AT&T an incentive to give priority to its own programming, a criticism that has been raised against past mergers between content creators and distributors.   AT&T and others have argued the Time Warner deal constitutes a "vertical" merger, meaning each company operates in different but related segments of an industry. Such deals are typically viewed as less dangerous to competition because they do not remove a direct competitor from the market, unlike deals such as AT&T's unsuccessful 2011 attempt to purchase T-Mobile.

"I don\u2019t think that blocking [the deal] is really a credible threat," said economist Hal Singer, who studies antitrust and media issues and has testified before Congress. "I think the most you could do is extract some sort of concessions as to the merged entity's dealings with independent networks and rival distributors."  Singer has done work for AT&T in the past, but not on the Time Warner merger.  AT&T has deployed its formidable political machine in Washington to persuade the Justice Department to approve the deal, and earlier this year it retained lobbyist Bill Smith of Sextons Creek, a former longtime political aide to Vice President Mike Pence. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has met with Trump on multiple occasions since his election, including a June 22 summit with other technology leaders. At that meeting, Trump praised Stephenson for "doing really a top job," The Dallas Morning News reported.  Stephenson has also pledged to stay out of CNN's decisions, telling the Senate antitrust subcommittee in December that AT&T is "committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN" should regulators approve the deal.  Tad Lipsky, a former acting director of the Federal Trade Commission's competition bureau who served on the Trump transition team, said antitrust regulators pledge to remain apolitical in their reviews. He pointed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' statement during his confirmation hearings that politics would not influence the antitrust review process.  "I believe that is the appropriate stance for the antitrust agencies to take with regard to any antitrust law enforcement question," Lipsky said in an interview. "In my experience at both agencies, that approach was always followed scrupulously, and I hope and expect it will be the same in this and in any future administration."

aV Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of shovel-ready infrastructure projects have been held up by a bureaucratic morass that President Donald Trump helped to create.  Trump\u2019s slowness to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is one reason for a growing backlog of natural gas pipelines and a gas export terminal awaiting approval from the agency, which has been unable to conduct major business since February. The waiting list has grown to at least $13 billion worth of projects expected to generate more than 23,000 construction jobs, according to a POLITICO analysis \u2014 largely in states Trump won in November.  Story Continued Below  Finally, the agency is ready to get back to work after the Senate confirmed two FERC nominees late Thursday. The commission was crippled by leadership vacancies just two weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration when he demoted its former chairman, who promptly quit. Since July 1, four of the agency\u2019s five seats have been vacant.  FERC oversees interstate pipelines, liquefied natural gas exports and wholesale electricity markets. For the projects\u2019 supporters and people who follow the agency, Thursday\u2019s confirmation of Pennsylvania regulator Rob Powelson and Republican Senate aide Neil Chatterjee could not have come too soon.   \u201cI would not begin to minimize even the passage of another month,\u201d said former FERC Commissioner Colette Honorable, \u201cbecause there are high stakes in the matters that come before FERC each and every day \u2014 vast amounts of capital at issue, vast amounts of consumer cost or savings at stake.\u201d  Many of the largest pipeline projects waiting for approval run right through Trump country, carrying gas out of shale plays in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio \u2014 all states Trump won last year and hopes to win again. One project alone, called Atlantic Coast, would bring 10,000 jobs to West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina, and the $2 billion NEXUS line would put 3,300 people to work in Michigan and Pennsylvania, states Trump flipped to red for the first time in decades.   Encouraging domestic energy production and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure were major campaign themes for Trump, whose promises of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan have yet to yield concrete progress on Capitol Hill.  FERC\u2019s holdup came as the agency, which has a $350 million annual budget and 1,500 employees, has found its once-quiet regulatory responsibilities increasingly politicized as its work draws closer to the center of some of the nation\u2019s most significant energy and climate policy debates.   The small independent agency does not formally take direction from the White House, but it has ample power to shape Trump\u2019s agenda of U.S. \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d FERC is in charge of authorizing facilities to export natural gas; balancing the environmental risks and benefits of the fracking boom; setting rates for increasingly complicated energy markets; and deciding how far states can go in propping up nuclear power plants by paying more for their carbon-free energy.   Environmentalists, who besieged the agency\u2019s meetings with protests last year, say FERC takes too narrow a view of its mandate to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies and has ignored larger questions of climate change and environmental protection. Their protests have intensified in the wake of the fracking boom that led to higher demand for new pipelines and export terminals.

You can unsubscribe at any time.  Industry supporters say any policy changes need to come from Congress and complain that their projects are falling victim to partisan infighting.   But virtually everyone who has a history with FERC agrees that the polarization around the agency did not begin this year. The agency\u2019s long state of paralysis is complex enough that Trump is not solely at fault.  \u201cThere are a number of things that had to go wrong to put FERC in this current position, and every single one of them went wrong,\u201d said Marc Spitzer, a former Republican FERC commissioner. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put all the blame on any one person.\u201d  FERC was set at the precipice of dysfunction by former President Barack Obama, when GOP Commissioner Phil Moeller resigned in October 2015 and fellow Republican Tony Clark followed him out the door 11 months later. Obama never nominated anyone to fill the two GOP-designated seats, in part because of Democrats\u2019 larger political feud with Senate Republicans after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court without any hearings or votes.   But it was Trump who pushed FERC off that cliff, when he stripped the chairmanship from Norman Bay and gave it to Cheryl LaFleur, another Democrat. Bay followed the lead of most chairs who lose the gavel and resigned, taking the agency\u2019s quorum with him. As of July 1, when Honorable resigned, LaFleur became the agency\u2019s sole member.  Democrats fault the White House for the pace of confirming new commissioners. The Senate has traditionally confirmed nominees to bipartisan commissions such as FERC by packaging picks from both parties together before bringing them to the floor for votes. But the White House only formally nominated Democratic aide Rich Glick on Wednesday, five weeks after announcing plans to do so.  Others blame the lack of trust in a polarized Washington.  \u201cThe Senate functions based on trust and unanimous consent. If everything in the Senate has to go the whole nine yards, then virtually nothing gets done,\u201d said one longtime industry official close to pending projects who asked not to be named in order to speak freely. The Senate can move swiftly, the source added, \u201cbut in order for that to happen, there needs to be some measure of trust.\u201d   Two of Trump\u2019s FERC picks, Republicans Chatterjee and Powelson, cleared the Senate energy committee in June, but without Glick\u2019s nomination, Senate Democrats were unlikely to allow a delay-free confirmation. Once Glick\u2019s papers came in, Democrats let them through on the last day before a monthlong recess.   But industry spent the intervening months watching the clock tick while projects stayed frozen.  \u201cFERC\u2019s lack of a quorum since early February represents an unnecessary drag on the economy, sidelining billions of dollars in private capital otherwise poised to put thousands of Americans to work expanding and improving our nation\u2019s energy delivery system,\u201d said Adam Parker, a spokesman for the NEXUS pipeline project being built by Enbridge.   Enbridge will miss a year-end deadline to begin operating the $2 billion, 256-mile natural gas link between a Marcellus shale natural gas field in eastern Ohio and markets in Michigan and Canada. The project, which would put 3,365 people to work, finished its environmental review in November \u2014 the penultimate regulatory step before construction can begin \u2014 and has been waiting since for the commission to get staffed up.  NEXUS is one of 18 pipelines and gas projects that have completed environmental reviews since last fall but could not receive FERC\u2019s final OK while it lacked a quorum. Others include TransCanada\u2019s WB Xpress; the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which has six companies behind it; the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, being built by a partnership of Duke, Dominion, Piedmont Gas and Southern Co.; and PennEast, whose backers include Southern Co. and Spectra Energy. Each of these projects will carry natural gas out of the Marcellus shale to population centers in the East or Midwest.   An unusual deep-water LNG export terminal that Delfin LNG wants to build at Port Delfin in Louisiana has its Department of Energy approval, but it needs FERC to sign off on-shore parts of the project before construction can begin.

Together, the projects stand to employ more than 23,000 people in mostly temporary construction jobs and would inject more than $13 billion in investments into the economy, according to the companies behind them.  For many of these pipelines, the lack of a quorum may have cost them a year of work: Summer and fall are ideal times to build in much of the country. Foul weather stops construction in winter, and environmental considerations often make spring work untenable.   The delays provided a temporary win to the growing ranks of anti-pipeline protesters, who have been arrested at FERC meetings and sometimes even camped outside of commissioners\u2019 homes to protest approvals of the infrastructure necessary to move all the new natural gas unlocked by the fracking boom.   Some of those same activists were hoping Senate Democrats would do everything possible to keep the open seats from ever being filled. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom activists cite as an ally, opposed the two nominated commissioners in committee, and he opposes a bipartisan energy bill that would speed up pipeline approvals.   Keeping FERC without a quorum slowed that process.  \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no quorum established, no pipelines are being approved. That helps us,\u201d said Karen Feridun, founder of Berks Gas Truth, an anti-fracking group out of Berks County, Pa., that is part of the umbrella FERC Vacancies Coalition.   Pipeline approvals are not the only backlog awaiting Trump\u2019s new FERC commissioners. They will also be thrust into the center of testy regional and state-level battles over programs designed to address climate change by subsidizing nuclear power plants, and potentially price carbon emissions.   \u201cFERC, and what\u2019s subject to its jurisdiction, kind of got dragged into the climate debate,\u201d the industry official said, noting that the agency has found itself the target of ever-increasing interest on Capitol Hill from \u201cthose in Congress who wanted to stop the [Obama administration\u2019s] Clean Power Plan and were unable to do so.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                President Donald Trump announced in June that the U.S. will leave the agreement. | Tasos Katopodis/AFP/Getty Images  \u000a            By ANDREW RESTUCCIA  08/04/2017 12:40 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/04/2017 05:23 PM EDT  The Trump administration outlined the United States\u2019 intention to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement in an official notice delivered to the United Nations on Friday.   It was the first written notice to the U.N. that the administration plans to pull out of the 2015 pact, which has won the support of nearly 200 nations.  Story Continued Below  In a statement, the State Department said the administration will nonetheless continue participating in international climate change negotiations, including talks aimed at implementing the Paris climate deal, "to protect U.S. interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration."  Trump announced in June that the U.S. will leave the agreement.  Under the terms of the Paris deal, the U.S. can\u2019t fully withdraw until Nov. 4, 2020 \u2014 one day after the next presidential election. The next president could decide to rejoin the agreement if Trump doesn\u2019t win a second term.  In addition, the U.S. can\u2019t even formally notify the United Nations that it is withdrawing until 2019. As a result, Friday\u2019s notice is a largely symbolic statement with no legal weight.  International diplomats are still holding out hope that Trump might change his mind, or reach some kind of compromise that would allow the United States to stay in. And they argued that Friday's statement leaves some wiggle room for the U.S. to remain.   In the June speech in which Trump announced he would pull out, the president held out the possibility that the U.S. would \u201cbegin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.\u201d  The State Department on Friday said the U.S. "will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources."

But they believe the U.S. might opt to stay in if Trump publicly abandons former President Barack Obama\u2019s domestic emissions reduction commitment.   It remains unclear what the Trump administration\u2019s next steps might be.  POLITICO first reported earlier Friday that the U.S. would announce its intent to withdraw from the agreement.

aV \u000a                Biofuels producers believed that if the EPA, whose headquarters is pictured here, had shifted the 'point of obligation' away from refiners it would cause years of upheaval.  | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  \u000a            By ERIC WOLFF  08/03/2017 11:53 AM EDT  The Trump administration plans to reject a proposal that would let oil refiners off the hook for complying with the federal ethanol mandate, a senior administration official told POLITICO, dashing the hopes of billionaire Carl Icahn and a slew of independent companies.  The Environmental Protection Agency plans to formally announce the decision within the next two weeks, the official said.   Story Continued Below  The move is a severe blow for Icahn, a longtime associate and early supporter of Donald Trump who owns the refiner CVR Energy. He was once so confident that the obligation would be changed that he tried to strike a deal with a biofuels trade association.   Ultimately, Icahn and his allies were unable to prevail over a peculiar alliance of major oil companies and biofuels producers, who opposed changing the Renewable Fuel Standard, though for different reasons.   Icahn, refining giant Valero and smaller refiners argued that purchasing compliance credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers, squeezed their bottom lines and, in some cases, threatened to put them out of business. Icahn's CVR lost $19 million in the second quarter of this year after guessing incorrectly that the administration would make the policy change.  Trump has turned away from one of Icahn's main policy goals in large part due to pressure from corn-state voters and ethanol organizations.  "President Trump supports the EPA's decision," the official said.   The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  The decision follows through on Trump's campaign promise to support ethanol and leave the mandate intact. Corn staters and ethanol interests have been lobbying hard, arguing that the change would set back an ethanol industry that is vital to some of the states where voters strongly backed Trump.   "Mr. Trump won that election because voters in Iowa and across the heartland, we rose up in support of him," Annette Sweeney, a member of Trump's Agriculture Advisory Council, said in an interview after the election. "Mr. Trump, the time I visited with him, he understood the need for home-grown fuel, the need for cleaner fuel. Here in Iowa, we were some of Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest supporters. And I really think shifting the point of obligation would interrupt America\u2019s progress toward making clean renewable biofuels."  Biofuels producers believed that if EPA had shifted the "point of obligation" away from refiners, as Icahn and other companies requested, it would cause years of upheaval. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents much of the oil industry, including the oil majors, has opposed the change, saying it would be a distraction from the kind of overhaul or full-on repeal the program needs.   EPA will finalize an Obama-era proposed decision to reject a petition by refiners that asked to change the program. The agency has been ready to act for months, but the White House Office of Legal Counsel advised waiting for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to rule in an omnibus case of RFS challenges, the official said. The case included a challenge by merchant refiners to force EPA to make a decision on the obligation question. In its ruling, the court rejected the request by the refiners to require EPA to decide on the obligation question in every annual RFS rule, but it did say EPA should make a decision at some point. The resolution of the case opens the door for EPA to act.   \u000a  \u000a            By DANNY VINIK  Oil analysts don't believe the decision to leave the program unchanged will have a significant effect on the cost of RINs, which has fallen substantially since last year.   "The changing of the point of obligation doesn\u2019t mean RINs will be more expensive or cheaper," said Tom Kloza, Global Head of Energy Analysis for OPIS.   Critics of the RFS focus on high RIN prices as a chief reason for changing which companies are obligated. CVR lost $19 million in RIN costs in the second quarter after guessing incorrectly that the administration would expand the number of companies complying with the RFS, a move that might have pushed RIN prices down.  Valero CEO Joe Gorder said Valero spent $750 million on RINs last year, and Icahn has called RIN sales "the mother of all squeezes." Delaware Valley refiners like the Delta Airlines-owned Monroe Energy and Philadelphia Energy, already smarting from the legalization of crude exports in 2015, say RIN costs could drive layoffs or even bankruptcy.   Valero and other refiners sued the EPA over the obligation issue, arguing that EPA should address it each time it sets new mandates for biofuel blending. Oral arguments in that case were held before the D.C. Circuit last month.   For Icahn, the move could be a blow to the stock price of CVR's refining subsidiary, which shot up 40 percent between Trump's election and the first months of his presidency. But by Wednesday, CVR Refining's stock had fallen back to 6 percent below Election Day.   An early Trump supporter, Icahn was named a "special adviser" to the president, though he is not on the government payroll. Icahn was so confident the change was coming that he and Valero presented the president with draft language for an executive order in February. That same month, he called Bob Dinneen of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group, and told him the ink was already drying on an executive order changing the program, and offering to meet Dinneen's demands for providing support. News of the conversation drove down RIN prices and also split RFA from the biofuels community. Within days, RFA had been booted from Fuels America, a political umbrella group for ethanol producers.   \u000a  \u000a            By DANNY VINIK  The order never came, and in the wake of the news, Icahn became the subject of ethical questions surrounding his role at the White House. Public Citizen filed a lobbying complaint with both houses of Congress, and last week eight Senate Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, EPA and Commodity Futures Trading Commission calling for an investigation into Icahn's dealings.   Icahn went quiet on the issue over the past few months, possibly as a result of all the investigations and letters from senators.   Icahn did not respond to a request for comment, and EPA did not respond for the record.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                TransCanada CEO Russell Girling with President Donald Trump after Trump announced the final approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline on March 24.  \u000a            By BEN LEFEBVRE  07/28/2017 02:25 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 07/28/2017 02:52 PM EDT  The company behind the Keystone XL pipeline has not yet determined whether there is enough demand for the project to justify actually building it, a top executive said today.   It was the strongest acknowledgment from TransCanada to date that the nearly decade-long Keystone saga may end in failure \u2014 despite President Donald Trump's overwhelming support for the project, which he green-lit as one of his first acts in office. The company says it remains confident in the project. But it has been struggling to find enough customers, and it still needs approval from Nebraska regulators for the pipeline's route, which landowners and activists in the state have been fighting since the project was first proposed.   Story Continued Below  TransCanada on Thursday called for an \u201copen season\u201d on Keystone XL, a process in which potential customers are invited to bid for contracts to ship oil on the pipeline, which would connect oil sands in Alberta with refiners and export opportunities in the U.S. The open season will last until September, TransCanada Executive Vice President Paul Miller said during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call today.   A decision on whether to follow through with construction of the $7 billion pipeline will come later, he said.  "In November, we\u2019ll make an assessment of commercial support and [Nebraska] approval," Miller said. "In the event we do decide to proceed on the project, we\u2019ll need six to nine months\u201d before construction could start.   It would be another two years once construction begins before the project comes online, Miller added.   The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

If TransCanada decides to build, that schedule means oil would start flowing through the pipeline just before the 2020 presidential election \u2014 but that any further delays could complicate Trump's ability to boast about Keystone when he runs for re-election.   On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised to green-light the pipeline, saying "I want it built, but I want a piece of the profits." When he approved the project in March, Trump did not apply any special conditions to his approval of the project that would have required TransCanada to share its profits, and he backed away from another promise to make the company use all U.S.-made steel for the pipeline. He seemed caught off guard when TransCanada CEO Russ Girling told him in a televised Oval Office appearance that construction was not imminent.   Keystone XL would transport up to 830,000 barrels a day of heavy crude from oil sands in western Canada to Steele City, Neb. From there it would go to refiners in the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast, where it also could be exported thanks to Congress lifting the oil export ban in late 2015 after then-President Barack Obama had denied an earlier permit for the line.   But refiners have been able to take delivery of Canadian crude without Keystone XL, using either rail cars or alternative pipelines. Oil imports from Canada grew to 3.8 million barrels a day in 2016, up 52 percent from when TransCanada first proposed the pipeline in 2008, according to EIA data.  One problem facing TransCanada is that much of the new demand for oil is coming from Asia. Canadian oil shippers would most likely prefer to ship oil to the west coast via Kinder Morgan\u2019s proposed TransMountain pipeline or rail car for easier export to Asia, said Rusty Braziel, president of energy consulting firm RBN Energy.   \u000a  \u000a            By BEN LEFEBVRE  \u201cIf you\u2019re a producer in Alberta, the conundrum you face here is you really want to go west. Do you want to take barrels to the Gulf coast and fight with everyone else sending barrels through the Gulf Coast? Hell no.\u201d  TransCanada is also trying to woo back companies who had signed on for Keystone XL but then dropped away after Obama denied the cross-border permit it needed, Miller said.   \u201cWhen the permit was decided in late 2015, many of our shippers reviewed other options," Miller said.   TransCanada spokeswoman Jacquelynn Benson said the company "maintains shipper support for the project and remains committed to Keystone XL. We are confident that we will have the support we need to move this project forward as we seek additional shipper commitments through the open season."  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV Republicans are trying to conjure up a Russian scandal they can get behind.   GOP House members and at least one Trump Cabinet member are pushing years-old allegations from conservative activists that Russia has funneled money to U.S. environmental groups to oppose fracking. The story has reappeared in conservative circles in recent weeks \u2014 a respite, perhaps, from the steady drip-drip of news reports about dealings between Russians and President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.   Story Continued Below  Allegations have circulated for years that Moscow has sought to discourage European countries from developing their own natural gas supplies as an alternative to Russian fuel. And conservatives have sought to extend those concerns to the U.S. \u2014 though there\u2019s little but innuendo to base them on.   But the rumors gained new life in late June, when House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith and fellow Texas Republican Rep. Randy Weber asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to investigate whether the Kremlin is bankrolling green campaigns against the fracking technology that helped the U.S. overtake Russia in gas production.  Among other material, Smith and Weber cited articles in conservative news publications and an alleged Hillary Clinton speech published by WikiLeaks \u2014 part of a trove of stolen Clinton campaign documents that U.S. intelligence agencies have linked to Russia\u2019s election-meddling efforts.  The reports, the Republican lawmakers wrote in the letter to Mnuchin, suggest \u201cthat Russia is also behind the radical statements and vitriol directed at the U.S. fossil fuel sector.\u201d   Green groups dismissed Smith\u2019s allegations as an attempt to divert attention from all the news surrounding Trump and Russia.   The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  \u201cIf congressional Republicans are so concerned about Russian influence, they should start seriously investigating that country\u2019s interference in our election, not attacking long-standing environmental organizations,\u201d said Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the Sierra Club, one of the groups Smith and conservatives have accused of potentially taking Russian money.  The League of Conservation Voters, another group named in Smith\u2019s letter, also blasted the Science Committee\u2019s allegations.  \u201cThis is false,\u201d LCV spokesman David Willett said. \u201cWe have no connections to Russia and have been an effective advocate for environmental protection for over 45 years. This seems like nothing more than an attempt at distraction away from the Trump campaign\u2019s well-publicized interactions with Russian interests to influence the election.\u201d   Still, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal op-ed page have both run items about the committee\u2019s letter, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry lent his voice to the effort when a Fox Business anchor asked whether he supported an investigation.   \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Perry said in the July 11 broadcast. \u201cSteve is a very capable and very focused business individual who knows that this type of activity has to be investigated, has to be halted.\u201d  Spokespeople for the Energy Department and Treasury Department did not respond to questions. A White House spokesperson did not reply to questions about whether the allegations had made their way to Trump.  Anti-fracking sentiment in the U.S. started bubbling up among U.S. environmental groups as soon as the oil and gas production method started surging in the late 2000s, with the documentary \u201cGasland\u201c appearing in theaters in 2010 after a year and a half in production. Much of that opposition was driven by local activists in new gas hot spots like Pennsylvania who complained about threats to their drinking water, while major national environmental groups like the Sierra Club were slower to take up the cry.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, who oversees an economy almost totally dependent on oil and gas exports, has also slagged fracking technology. He once said that fracking makes \u201cblack stuff\u201d come out of people\u2019s water faucets, according to a New Yorker report.   Still, there is no evidence that Russian money has gone to U.S. green groups, at least on the national level, said Brenda Shaffer, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Eurasian, Russian and Eastern European Studies. And there is even less evidence that any money would have been well spent, given how hard it would be to push widespread fracking bans through the myriad of local, state and federal governments involved in permitting, she added.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By DARREN SAMUELSOHN  \u201cIt would be almost impossible to prevent fracking in the United States,\u201d Shaffer told POLITICO.   The evidence the committee cites includes comments that former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made at a London-based think tank in 2014, when he said he believed Russia was working with environmental groups in Europe to oppose shale gas development.   \u201cOther officials have indicated the same scheme is unfolding in the U.S.,\u201d Smith\u2019s letter goes on to say \u2014 though from there the trail becomes murkier.  The letter also cites a speech that Clinton allegedly delivered in Canada in 2014, according to Clinton campaign  emails published by WikiLeaks, in which the former secretary of state supposedly said she had encountered \u201cphony environmental groups\u201d that opposed pipelines and fracking. The emails were part of a cache of Democratic documents that U.S. intelligence officials believe were originally pilfered by Kremlin-linked hackers.  \u201cI\u2019m a big environmentalist, but these were funded by Russians,\u201d Clinton says in the alleged transcript.  But the text does not indicate whether Clinton \u2014 who promoted shale gas drilling in Europe \u2014 was referring to environmental groups in Europe or the United States. A Clinton campaign aide did not answer questions about the veracity and the context of the speech. The campaign has refused to confirm or deny the content of any of the leaked materials.   Still, the alleged Clinton quotes have taken off in conservative news outlets, with The Daily Caller and Washington Times including them in articles published in the past year. Smith, in turn, cited those articles in the footnotes of his letter to Treasury.   \u201cIt\u2019s a theory, but the reasoning behind it makes sense,\u201d said a committee aide, who requested anonymity. \u201cThe chairman is saying there\u2019s data points pointing to this theory, and he\u2019s saying the Treasury secretary can shine some light on this. This isn\u2019t out of left field and crazy.\u201d  Science Committee aides also argued that last year\u2019s national intelligence report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election supports the concerns raised in Smith\u2019s letter. However, the intelligence report doesn\u2019t allege any Kremlin outreach to U.S. environmental groups.   The intelligence report\u2019s non-classified, 14-page version makes reference to anti-fracking programming broadcast by Kremlin-controlled news channel RT. \u201cThis is likely reflective of the Russian Government\u2019s concern about the impact of fracking and U.S. natural gas production on the global energy market and the potential challenges to Gazprom\u2019s profitability,\u201d the report says. Gazprom is a Russian natural gas giant.  Much of the rest of the case that Russia funneled money to U.S. green groups comes from a 2014 report created by the Environmental Policy Alliance, which describes itself as \u201cdevoted to uncovering the funding and hidden agendas behind environmental activist groups.\u201d   \u000aElections  \u000a            By DAVID SIDERS  The group shares a Washington, D.C., address and a phone number with a public relations firm run by Richard Berman, a lawyer and former lobbyist who has also created issue groups such as the Center for Union Facts and Center for Consumer Freedom \u2014 prompting liberal critics to nickname him \u201cthe astroturf kingpin.\u201d CBS News once called him \u201cDr. Evil\u201d in a 2011 piece focusing on his lobbying efforts on unpopular issues, including a campaign against Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  A representative of the Environmental Policy Alliance confirmed that Berman\u2019s firm manages the group.  The group\u2019s report and Smith\u2019s letter focus on $23 million that a Bermuda-based philanthropic firm, Klein Ltd., donated in 2010 and 2011 to the San Francisco-based Sea Change Foundation, according to information disclosed in Sea Change\u2019s IRS tax forms. Sea Change then awarded around $55 million in each of those years to the Sierra Club Foundation, U.S. Climate Action Network, Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmental groups to promote energy efficiency and climate change-related operations, according to its IRS tax filings.  \u201cAlthough the source of Klein\u2019s capital has not been documented,\u201d the Science Committee\u2019s letter says, the panel alleged that various corporate and personal connections \u201cstrongly suggest\u201d that the money originated with \u201cthe Russian government and energy sector.\u201d  But a lawyer representing Klein told POLITICO that none of the money came from sources connected to Russia. And a Sea Change spokesperson said none of its donations to environmental groups were earmarked for opposition to fracking.   \u201cThe Klein Foundation grants were given as general support and no requirement was made that the funds be used for specific projects, programs, or activities of the Sea Change Foundation,\u201d the spokesperson said.  Berman\u2019s report draws on a court case filed in the British Virgin Islands in the mid-2000s that resulted in a money-laundering conviction against IPOC Group, an entity owned by Leonid Reiman, Russia\u2019s former telecommunications minister and adviser to Putin, according to an outline of the case maintained by the World Bank. Roderick Forrest, a lawyer for Wakefield Quin, a law firm representing Klein Ltd., was one of IPOC\u2019s directors, according to case documents.   The House committee did not contact Klein as part of its fact-finding, a committee aide said. But Forrest railed against the accusations and said the company was considering legal action following the committee\u2019s letter.   \u201cThe allegations are completely false and irresponsible,\u201d Forrest told POLITICO. \u201cWe can state categorically that at no point did this philanthropic organization receive or expend funds from Russian sources or Russian-connected sources, and Klein has no Russian connection whatsoever.\u201d  The Sierra Club\u2019s Pierce also denied that any of the money it received from Sea Change ultimately came from Moscow.   \u201cWe have confirmed that the origin of these funds is a private U.S. donor who cares about climate change and has invested in the work the Sierra Club does to tackle the climate crisis and advance the clean energy economy \u2014 not from Russia,\u201d she said.

aV LOS ANGELES \u2014 The lab-coat liberals are marching on Washington.   Dismayed by President Donald Trump\u2019s perceived hostility to climate science and other areas of research, a surge of scientists is entering the public arena and running for political office for the first time.  Story Continued Below  They represent an evolving brand of Democrat that has been gaining steam for months. What began with rogue Twitter accounts and protest marches has graduated into candidacies in House races in places as varied as California, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York.   The handful of scientists who have formally announced their candidacies so far \u2014 and the others who are preparing to join them \u2014 have cast themselves as a counterforce to the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of climate science and de-prioritization of innovation funding.  But they are also stretching the boundaries of the scientific field into unfamiliar terrain. Researchers traditionally avoided wading into politics. Now, amid winds of anti-intellectualism, they are testing whether a significant number in their ranks can break through.  \u201cIt is past time for scientists to step up and get involved \u2026 because that is the only way that we are going to change the course,\u201d said Shaughnessy Naughton, a cancer researcher-turned-business owner who twice ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Pennsylvania. She is the founder of 314 Action, a political action committee that helps people with scientific backgrounds run for office. \u201cTraditionally, the attitude has been that science is above politics, and by getting involved in politics, it could possibly pollute science. My response to that is, \u2018How\u2019s that working for you?'\u201d  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Researchers have long bemoaned stagnating federal investment in innovation, and advocacy groups have existed for more than a decade to encourage scientists to become more active in civic affairs. But few current members of Congress come from backgrounds in math and science. Among the 435 members of the House, there are seven engineers, one physicist, one microbiologist and one chemist, according to the Congressional Research Service.   For many scientists, Trump\u2019s election marked a turning point. Researchers marched in protest throughout the world in April, and former New Jersey Congressman Rush Holt, a physicist and now chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said he began fielding more calls from scientists considering running for public office.  \u201cIt\u2019s still not in the dozens [of prospective candidates]. But instead of two or three, it might be 12 or 15,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThere seems to be a general sense that policy is being made without sufficient attention to scientific evidence.\u201d  Trump, whose dismissal of mainstream climate science had already alarmed researchers, infuriated the scientific community when, soon after taking office, he proposed reducing non-defense research and development spending by about 19 percent, sharply curbing spending on climate and clean energy innovation and basic science and medical research.  Hans Keirstead, a pioneering stem-cell researcher who is running to unseat GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in California\u2019s Orange County, said that when he \u201csaw the budget and health care bills starting to come up, that\u2019s what tipped me over the edge.\u201d  \u000aWASHINGTON AND THE WORLD  \u000a            By BEN SCHRECKINGER  Looking to Washington from a lab where his latest clinical trial on an ovarian cancer treatment is underway, Keirstead said of Congress, \u201cI see it as a grander platform to do good.\u201d  While many researchers believe they hold a firmer grasp on science-related policy than politicians from other fields, the mechanics of an election remain largely unfamiliar \u2014 and there have been uneven starts to their campaigns.  Despite a torrent of media coverage surrounding her bid to unseat GOP Rep. Steve Knight in Southern California, geologist Jess Phoenix raised just more than $77,000 in the second quarter of this year. She told a small group of supporters soon after the fundraising period closed that she had finished strong and that the next quarter would be \u201ceven better.\u201d But other scientists have found the effort too taxing.  Patrick Madden, a computer scientist and university professor who recently abandoned his campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York, described a jolt when his department chair came to him \u201ca little freaked out\u201d that the university had received a public records request from a conservative opposition group for Madden\u2019s emails and other documents.  \u201cIn politics, it seems you get ahead by lying, by misleading, by misstating things,\u201d Madden said.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By ANNIE KARNI  He said scientists have a \u201cgood skill set\u201d for Congress and that the records request would not have dissuaded him. But he succumbed when it became apparent he could not raise enough money to run a competitive campaign.  \u201cI was hassling all my friends, all my contacts, and it just didn\u2019t feel \u2026 I don\u2019t want my life to revolve around money,\u201d Madden said. \u201cTo get up in the morning and worry about money, worry about money all day long \u2014 it was no fun.\u201d  By one measure, scientists would appear exceptionally well-positioned to run for public office. Seventy-six percent of Americans say they have at least a fair amount of confidence in scientists generally to act in the best interests of the public, according to a Pew Research Center poll last year. That level of confidence outpaces religious and business leaders, educators, the news media and elected officials.  But Pew has also documented wide differences in opinion between scientists and the public on issues ranging from evolution to vaccines and the safety of genetically modified foods. And other research suggests that if scientists wade too deeply into politics, public confidence in them might fall.  Jon Krosnick, a Stanford University professor who has studied public opinion on climate change, has found in surveys that when natural scientists stray from pure science and offer policy prescriptions related to their work, trust in those scientists erodes. And scientists who engage in politics face the additional problem of communicating with lay people unaccustomed to the dialogue of a university or a lab.  \u201cYou know, the premise of having more scientists in Congress is an interesting one,\u201d said Jennilee Brown, a Republican strategist in Los Angeles who studied chemistry as an undergraduate student. \u201cInitially, I would say that\u2019s a fantastic idea because scientists are very used to looking at complex situations and \u2026 finding solutions to things.\u201d   However, Brown said, \u201cWhere I question scientists running for Congress is more in their \u2026 power of public persuasion.\u201d  Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who sits on 314\u2019s board and has been working with a handful of scientist candidates, said Friday that the challenge for scientists is no different than for lawyers or elected politicians, all of whom must learn to leave their profession\u2019s jargon behind when talking with voters. But in contrast to Trump, he said, scientists may cut an especially appealing profile.  \u201cIn this environment Trump is setting, where everything is a rhetorical Twitter stream,\u201d Trippi said, \u201cI actually think people talking common sense based on the facts \u2026 may be where a sweet spot is\u201d in 2018.  Naughton\u2019s political action committee said it is working with 10 congressional candidates and has heard from thousands of people who are interested in running for office at some level. They have hosted candidate trainings to address messaging, fundraising and other tactical concerns, and they have helped candidates find strategists and other advisers to work on their campaigns.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By JOSH DAWSEY  Phoenix, the geologist, said scientists have to work harder to \u201chumanize\u201d their issues, reflecting a view among some academics that without concerted outreach, science can seem out of touch. In a campaign, Phoenix said, \u201cEven if you can\u2019t get people excited about, you know, \u2018Save the whales,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cyou can say, 'Do you want your kids going outside at recess? Yes? OK, then we need to have protections for air quality in place.'\u201d  Andrew Hoffman, a University of Michigan professor who has written about the role of scholars in public life, said many scientists are unprepared to step into the bruising field of politics, with debates that are \u201cmuch messier\u201d than in evidence-based research. But, like Holt, he said he senses that is changing.  The scientific community is \u201cfacing a crisis of relevance, and scientists are starting to feel compelled to stand up for it,\u201d Hoffman said.  In Congress, Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), a wind energy consultant, said last week that \u201cit would be helpful to have more STEM people in both parties, really,\u201d saying that \u201cwould help us with some of these technical issues.\u201d   His own doctorate in mathematics, McNerney said, has given him \u201ca perspective and an appreciation for science and research and what\u2019s possible in a technical field,\u201d informing his opinion about matters ranging from telecommunications to nuclear energy and data security.  But he acknowledged that when he was first seeking election \u2014 as the current crop of scientist candidates is now \u2014 his background did not afford him a ready-made network for a political campaign.   \u201cFor one thing, people in STEM \u2026 generally shy away from political involvement. So generating support \u2026 developing a support network and getting the sort of grass-roots support that I needed was a real challenge.\u201d  Elaine DiMasi, an experimental physicist who has taken a leave from Brookhaven National Laboratory to weigh a run against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York, said that after watching her friend Madden withdraw from his race, \u201cI think I understand how difficult it\u2019s going to be.\u201d  DiMasi, who is planning to burn through savings to support herself while campaigning for the rest of the year, said her father was \u201chorrified\u201d at her decision.   \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re going to give up your job and be a politician?\u2019\u201d DiMasi said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a scientist with a job as a legislator working on policy.\u2019\u201d  DiMasi said her parents eventually came around.

aV \u000a                "I just think the hypocrisy runs rampant," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said of European critics of the Trump administration. | AP Photo  \u000a            By ANDREW RESTUCCIA  07/12/2017 07:02 PM EDT  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt dismissed European critics of President Donald Trump's climate policies as hypocrites on Wednesday, while chastising German Chancellor Angela Merkel for phasing out her country's nuclear power plants.  "I just think the hypocrisy runs rampant," Pruitt said in an interview with POLITICO. "To look at us as a nation and say, 'You all need to do more' in light of what we\u2019ve done in leading with innovation and technology \u2014 the hypocrisy is palpable in those areas."  Story Continued Below  Pruitt mentioned Merkel by name, urging the public to press her on the issue. If reducing carbon dioxide emissions "is so important to you, Madam Chancellor, why are you getting rid of nuclear? Because last time I checked, it\u2019s pretty clean on CO2," he said.   Merkel is one of the most vocal public defenders of the Paris climate change agreement, the 2015 pact that Trump said last month he intends to leave. Merkel hosted the recent G-20 summit of the world's wealthiest economies, where the United States was the only country not to throw its support behind the deal. At the same time, Germany announced in 2000 it would phase out nuclear power, a shift that Merkel accelerated after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan.   Pruitt repeated his criticism of the Paris deal, casting doubt on whether the United States would remain part of the climate agreement even if the Trump administration rewrites former President Barack Obama's aggressive plan to cut U.S. emissions. When Trump announced the withdrawal June 1, he held out the possibility of negotiating to "re-enter" the accord "on terms that are fair to the United States."  Pruitt argued that the United States has shown it can address climate change without being bound to an international agreement. He noted that U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have declined since President George W. Bush decided in 2001 to abandon the Kyoto Protocol.

"What we ought to be focused upon in my view is exporting innovation and technology to nations like China, like India, to help them with respect to their power grid," he said.   Pruitt said the United States will continue to engage with the international community on climate change, but he called the Paris deal "pure symbolism," adding, "It was a bumper sticker.  "Engagement is unquestioned. We\u2019re going to continue to engage," he said. "But we have led with action.\u201d  Still, Pruitt continued to raise concerns that remaining in the Paris deal could create legal complications as the administration tries to unravel Obama's domestic climate regulations, arguing that outside groups could seek to hold the U.S. to its pledges in court. "Why would you hold yourself out to that type of legal liability?" he said.   During the administration's monthslong debate over Paris, Pruitt and other opponents of the agreement made that argument behind the scenes, clashing with other Trump advisers who believed those legal fears were unfounded. Pruitt, along with Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon, was the most forceful advocate of ending U.S. participation in the Paris deal.   Pruitt bristled at the phrase "climate denier," a description that his critics have often applied to him in light of his repeated statements disputing scientific conclusions about the large role humans play in warming the planet.  "What does it even mean? That\u2019s what I think about it. I deny the climate? Really? Wow, OK. That\u2019s crazy, in my view," he said.  Pruitt reiterated his position that the climate is warming and humans contribute to that, but "the ability to measure with precision the human contribution to warming is something that\u2019s very challenging to do."  \u000a  \u000a            By NAHAL TOOSI  In contrast, the vast majority of the world's climate scientists agree that the planet is warming in large part due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal. Pruitt has come under fire from Democrats \u2014 and even some moderate Republicans, including former EPA chiefs \u2014 for his stance on climate change. Others have raised red flags about the steep budget cuts facing the agency, worrying that its mission to protect human health and the environment could be compromised.  Pruitt has called for a public \u2014 possibly televised \u2014 debate about climate science.   "The American people deserve an honest, open, transparent discussion about that, and that\u2019s how you ultimately get to consensus," he said. "And I tend to think at times that maybe consensus wasn\u2019t the focus historically, over the last several years. It was to use it as a political issue, to put jerseys on \u2014 either you\u2019re for or against."  In the end, he said, his ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is limited by the 1972 Clean Air Act, whose authority he believes Obama overstepped when he imposed greenhouse gas restrictions for the nation's power plants.   Pruitt argued that the media's focus on climate change has distracted from the work he is doing at the EPA on everything from air pollution to regulating dangerous chemicals.  "We\u2019ve got a very positive environmental agenda. [There's] work to be done, opportunity to achieve good outcomes, a plan to do that, and there\u2019s not very much margin, if any at all, with groups that are liberal, conservative, the rest, at getting those things done," he said.   \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL  Pruitt has sought to "reorient" the EPA toward what he argues are its core functions, including reducing air pollution, cleaning up toxic waste sites, regulating chemicals and improving water quality. Pruitt said he organized an internal task force that will soon deliver recommendations on how to improve the agency's Superfund program, which is designed to clean up the nation's worst toxic pollution sites.  The EPA administrator laid into Obama, arguing he didn't do nearly enough to limit air pollutants and sought to severely restrict the use of fossil fuels.   "God has blessed us with natural resources. Let\u2019s use them to feed the world. Let\u2019s use them to power the world. Let\u2019s use them to protect the world," Pruitt said. "But this idea that we as a nation have this abundance of natural resources and the job of this agency \u2014 and I\u2019m speaking rhetorically here and facetiously \u2014 is to say, \u2018Do not touch.\u2019 Where is that in the statute?"

aV \u000a                President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pose for a photograph prior to a bilateral meeting on the eve of the G-20 summit in Hamburg, northern Germany, on July 6. | AP Photo  \u000a            By ANDREW RESTUCCIA  07/06/2017 07:06 PM EDT  The United States and other major economies are nearing a compromise on climate change, one of the thorniest issues facing world leaders at the G-20 summit in Germany.  After days of preliminary talks, G-20 negotiators are increasingly hopeful they can settle on a joint communique in which the United States underscores its intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement while the other nations emphasize their support for the pact, according to a senior diplomat involved in the discussions.  Story Continued Below  Diplomats stressed that the text remains fluid and could be rewritten at the insistence of President Donald Trump and other world leaders, who will join the closed-door discussions in Hamburg over the next 48 hours.   But if it holds, the unity among the 19 other members of the G-20 would be a coup for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders who support strong action to tackle climate change. And it would further isolate the United States on the issue, underscoring that it is one of the few countries in the world that don't back the 2015 Paris deal.  There has long been speculation that fossil fuel-dependent countries in the G-20 might hesitate to forcefully back the Paris agreement, and that nations like Turkey and Saudi Arabia might refuse to sign on to a separate action plan that details steps countries should take to reduce their emissions.  Instead, diplomats said, both countries are expected to join other nations in endorsing the Paris deal and backing the action plan \u2014 unless the tone of the talks shifts dramatically in the coming days. The action plan, which was written by German officials and will be referenced in the communique, is the product of months of negotiation, and some news reports say it was watered down in an attempt to win broader support.   \u201cIt seems that the G-19 is all on board,\u201d the diplomat said.   The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  The joint communique will include several paragraphs on energy and climate issues, including a U.S.-backed section touting sustainability and the importance of improving energy security, according to diplomats and drafts reviewed by POLITICO.  According to new language shared with POLITICO, the communique will \u201ctake note\u201d of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement and to \u201cimmediately cease the implementation\u201d of former President Barack Obama\u2019s domestic emissions reduction plan, known in United Nations jargon as a \u201cnationally determined contribution.\u201d  The draft says the U.S. is committed to an \u201capproach that ... lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.\u201d An earlier draft used the phrase \u201cglobal approach,\u201d but the latest version removed the word \u201cglobal\u201d because countries worried it left room for some nations to form an alternative international mechanism to reduce emissions beyond the Paris agreement.  \u201cGiven the importance of energy access and security in the nationally determined contributions of other countries, the United States of America will endeavor to work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources,\u201d the draft continues.   As it stands, the U.S.-centric portion of the communique is incorporated into the full text, rather than added as a footnote as it was in a statement issued at the close of a June G-7 meeting of environmental ministers.  The current G-20 draft communique includes some new hints at the Trump administration\u2019s Paris strategy. Trump's June announcement that he intends to withdraw from the agreement left many foreign diplomats scratching their heads, unsure about the United States' next steps.  One diplomat told POLITICO that the draft communique language leaves room for the U.S. to write a new domestic emissions reduction plan and then announce plans to stay in the agreement under those new terms. Trump could frame the decision as a victory, while also pleasing U.S. allies.  In conversations with diplomats, some in the Trump administration have indicated that the president is open to that approach. But it remains unclear what the president will ultimately decide.  Still, outside experts and climate advocates say any broad show of support for Paris and Germany's climate action plan will be a reminder that Trump is increasingly on his own when it comes to climate change.  \u201cThat\u2019s really the top line on what\u2019s important coming out of this: another clear indication that the U.S. has isolated itself and is falling back while the other major parties step up and compete in the clean energy marketplace worth trillions of dollars,\u201d said former State Department climate change adviser Andrew Light, now a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute.

aV \u000a            By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE  07/28/2017 05:24 AM EDT  President Donald Trump has inspired a new online dating service\u2014between lawyers opposed to him seeking pro-bono work and opposition non-profits in need of help.  We the Action, launching Friday, will be an online portal to connect lawyers with legal work waiting to be done, from reviewing leases and contracts to filing Social Security claims to potentially heading to court in immigration cases. Non-profits will be able to post the services they need, and search through online profiles created by attorneys detailing expertise and availability.   Story Continued Below  Several connections have been made already by the 501c4, funded and incubated by the California-based Emerson Collective, the organization founded and led by Laurene Powell Jobs.  \u201cAfter the election and as Trump was coming, there was this huge outpouring of lawyers who just wanted to know what they could do,\u201d said Marc Elias, the D.C. Democratic elections lawyer who is serving as We the Action\u2019s board chairman. \u201cWe ought to be able to match this great demand for legal services.\u201d   Democratic operative Addisu Demisse and Emerson Collective immigration expert Marshall Fitz make up the rest of the board.   We the Action is in part a response to the explosion of new groups formed in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, many of which are low on funding and resources.

This is a way to connect lawyers that want to help with organizations that need help,\u201d said Sarah Baker, who worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office under President Barack Obama and will be We the Action\u2019s executive director.   The attorney profile asks which states they are member of the bar in for matters that require it, but the website will be able to connect lawyers and non-profits no matter the distance. And the hope is to provide an avenue for attorneys who want to get around firms\u2019 sometimes ponderous and complicated pro bono policies.   The rush of lawyers to the airports in the wake of Trump\u2019s first travel ban drove home the point: hundreds arrived, few had any relevant immigration law expertise and no one was providing any direction.   \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any place for a progressive lawyer who simply wanted to make a difference,\u201d Elias said.  Eleven larger organizations are forming the backbone of support and outreach: Access Democracy, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Equality New York, the International Refugee Assistance Program, the Latin American Coalition, Let America Vote, NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and Hawaiian Islands and Voto Latino.  "There is great need for legal support and so many skilled lawyers who want to participate in the pursuit of equality and justice,\u201d said Gabriel Blau of Equality New York, \u201cbut until now, there hasn\u2019t been a sufficiently focused and robust tool to make that match."

aV Secret Russia meeting? So what. Collusion? Nah. Media outrage? Fake news.  Anyone who thinks the Republican base will abandon President Donald Trump over the latest Russia revelations is sorely mistaken.  Story Continued Below  According to a POLITICO survey of more than two dozen local Republican Party leaders in counties where 2018\u2019s most competitive races are shaping up, the GOP grass roots aren\u2019t fazed by news of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting last year with a Kremlin-linked lawyer or the daily drip of stories about Trump and Russia. They aren\u2019t even paying close attention.  That\u2019s a problem for Democrats, who will likely need to win over the support of some Trump-backing Republican voters in the battleground congressional districts where the House majority will be won or lost in 2018.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a non-issue. Most people that do reference it, reference it as a witch hunt. It\u2019s a one-sided thing: \u2018Trump, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.\u2019 I hear more about that than any credible evidence against Trump, Trump Jr.,\u201d said Carl Bunce, chairman of the Las Vegas-based GOP in Nevada's Clark County, where two tight House races are expected to be fought.   \u201cIt\u2019s just all noise to people on the ground here. People on the ground are just concerned about job security. It\u2019s almost embarrassing for the media from my perspective. Move on. I\u2019m sure they could find something else to report on,\u201d he said.  While it\u2019s too soon for any public polling on the new controversy surrounding the president\u2019s son, Republican voters in general haven\u2019t budged in their support of the president \u2014 8 in 10 back him nationwide, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll this month.

One reason is that the Russia narrative simply isn\u2019t one that party activists are following closely \u2014 or even believe.   \u201cYeah, so I haven\u2019t heard about that, I guess that\u2019s an indication of where it is on my radar,\u201d said Brian Murphy, the GOP chairman of southern New Hampshire\u2019s Rockingham County, referring to Tuesday\u2019s publication of Trump Jr.\u2019s emails arranging a meeting with a Russian lawyer offering information that would \u201cincriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton.   \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard a lot of scuttlebutt about it. I think it\u2019s a whole lot about nothing,\u201d said Craig DuMond, GOP vice chairman in Delaware County, New York, where Rep. John Faso is a top Democratic target. \u201cIt\u2019s something really, personally, I\u2019ve dismissed. It\u2019s a lot about nothing.\u201d   Any collusion, went a common refrain, is between the news media and the desperate, out-of-power Democratic Party.   \u201cDemocrats and their allies in the media are actually doing the country a disservice with their \u2018scandal each day\u2019 narrative,\u201d added San Diego County Republican Party Chairman Tony Krvaric, whose local congressman, Republican Darrell Issa, is facing a highly competitive reelection race. \u201cWhile it\u2019s like catnip for the elites and it keeps pundits busy, regular people tune it out.\u201d   Echoing an administration that regularly refers to stories about possible ties to Russia as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d driven by the \u201cfake news\u201d media, local Republican officials were quick to insist the constant coverage said more about the state of the press \u2014 and its alleged hatred for the president \u2014 than Trump.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By TARA PALMERI and JOSH DAWSEY   Their takeaway from the glut of stories? The media can\u2019t be trusted.  \u201cThe story with Don Jr. falls into the category of being taken with a grain of salt, or several grains of salt. People are reserving judgment,\u201d said Vlad Davidiuk, a senior official in Texas\u2019 Harris County GOP. There, in the Houston suburbs where Republican Rep. John Culberson\u2019s seat is considered vulnerable next year, Davidiuk notes that voters are more concerned with the state\u2019s impending legislative special session.   \u201cIt\u2019s part of the over-saturation of the Russia story and the collusion allegations. And [having] no evidence to back up those original assertions kind of led people to the conclusion that a lot of it was manufactured. A lot of the subsequent reporting and stories that emerged showed [that] some people in the mainstream media were using the story to further a political narrative or boost ratings artificially,\u201d he said.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL   Among Republicans at the local level at least, the latest revelations that have rocked Washington are little more than a product of Democratic overreach, without any real implications for GOP candidates next year.   \u201cThe coverage is overblown. It\u2019s a product of the fact that the Democrats and the DNC don\u2019t have their own message, and they\u2019re reduced to buckshot, blanket criticism of the president,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cIf you put that criticism coupled with the media, they believe that what they\u2019re reporting on is salient and appropriate, and the DNC and the Democrats think that it\u2019s critical for them to message in that anti-Trump manner, but it\u2019s really out of tune with what Americans are looking for and what is truly newsworthy.\u201d   Even talking about it, many insist, is a waste of time.   \u201cThere are certainly much more important issues,\u201d said Roxie Armstrong, GOP chair of Kansas\u2019 suburban Wyandotte County, where Rep. Kevin Yoder is facing a competitive challenge in a seat that Clinton carried in 2016.   Armstrong then hung up the phone.  Missing out on the latest scoops?

Clinton sent a blast email to supporters Monday afternoon asking people to sign up for her next venture, Onward Together.   Story Continued Below  "From the Women's March to airports across the country where communities are welcoming immigrants and refugees to town hall meetings in every community, Americans are speaking out like never before," Clinton emailed. "I believe more fiercely than ever that citizen engagement at every level is central to a strong and vibrant democracy."   Clinton describes the group as "an organization dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election. Onward Together will work to build a brighter future for generations to come by supporting groups that encourage people to organize and run for office."   \u000a  \u000a            By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI  Specifically, Clinton mentioned Swing Left, Emerge America, Color of Change, Indivisible and Run for Something as the five groups Onward Together will initially support.

For others, we'll help amplify their work and do what we can to help them continue to grow their audiences and expand their reach," she emailed.   "This year hasn't been what I envisioned, but I know what I'm still fighting for: a kinder, big-hearted, inclusive America. Onward!" Clinton tweeted Monday.   Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV A firm co-founded by Donald Trump\u2019s initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, quietly agreed to lobby for the oil company Citgo as the company, which is owned by the leftist government of Venezuela, was becoming increasingly embroiled in tensions involving the United States, Venezuela and Russia.  Officials with Lewandowski\u2019s firm, Avenue Strategies, confirmed that last month it formalized a $25,000-a-month lobbying contract with Citgo.   Story Continued Below  The officials initially told POLITICO that the firm had filed legally required paperwork revealing the contract to the U.S. government on Feb. 20. But Lewandowski\u2019s co-founder in the firm, fellow Trump campaign aide Barry Bennett, subsequently clarified that it \u201cwas just an origination date,\u201d and the firm was working to file the paperwork Wednesday.  As of Wednesday evening, that paperwork was not posted on the website of the Senate Office of Public Records, which processes and automatically posts such filings almost instantaneously.  Bennett said Avenue has yet to begin lobbying for Citgo and that \u201cit\u2019s not entirely clear\u201d on what issues it will lobby. He stressed, though, that he will be the only firm employee who registers to lobby on the contract, and that Lewandowski \u201cdoesn\u2019t really have a role\u201d in it.  Sources familiar with the contract say that Avenue Strategies was brought on by Citgo to help provide access to the Trump administration amid calls for the U.S. to seize the company\u2019s assets as a way to expand the impact of sanctions against Venezuela.  But the revelation of Avenue\u2019s previously unreported contract with Citgo comes at an awkward moment for the company, Lewandowski and the Trump White House.   \u000aPolitics  \u000a            By KENNETH P. VOGEL and JOSH DAWSEY  Trump ran on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interest influence in Washington, and the increasing attention on the lobbying firm co-founded soon after the election by Lewandowski, who remains a close Trump confidant, threatens to undermine the president\u2019s efforts to make the case he\u2019s fulfilling that promise.  On Wednesday, the government-ethics watchdog group Public Citizen sent a letter to the Department of Justice and congressional lobbying oversight offices requesting investigations into whether Lewandowski was violating lobbying laws by not registering as a lobbyist, based on a POLITICO report about a newer company created by Avenue Strategies that appeared to be offering prospective clients meetings with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.   Bennett called the letter a baseless and partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d   But Bennett also acknowledged that Avenue Strategies on Wednesday dissolved the newer company, which was called Washington East West Political Strategies.   The company had distributed pitch materials to prospective Eastern European clients promising to arrange meetings with Trump, Pence and senior members of their administration, POLITICO revealed last week. Bennett said he and Lewandowski never saw the document, which he said was produced by Avenue\u2019s partners in the company, an Azerbaijani oil executive and an American political consultant who works extensively in Russia.  The document \u201cwas a violation of our understanding with them,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the headache.\u201d  Lewandowski issued a statement saying he had \u201cno affiliation or involvement\u201d and \u201cnever entered into any agreement with this firm.\u201d   Bennett clarified that \u201cAvenue Strategies owned the equity \u2014 and that is me and Corey \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have any role.\u201d Bennett didn\u2019t respond when asked whether Avenue had dissolved other firms it had created with other partners to prospect in the Middle East, Canada and Central America.  Concerns about Lewandowski\u2019s adherence to lobbying rules and boasts of access also have taken hold inside the White House, said two people who have discussed Lewandowski\u2019s lobbying with administration officials.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER and MICHAEL STRATFORD  And Citgo, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, is under increasing scrutiny as the Trump administration takes a tougher line against the cash-strapped government of Venezuela, which has been accused of human rights abuses and drug trafficking.  Complicating matters further, there are rising concerns that the Russian government-owned oil company Rosneft could be on the verge of taking control of Citgo. That\u2019s because Venezuela\u2019s national oil company, Petrleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took out a loan from Rosneft in December, offering as collateral 49.9 percent of Citgo\u2019s shares. International energy market analysts have predicted that the economic crisis in Venezuela could lead PDVSA to default on its debt, which would put Rosneft on the cusp of controlling three of the largest and most sophisticated refineries in the U.S., plus three major pipelines and dozens of fuel terminals.   The involvement of Russia is fraught for Trump\u2019s administration. The president\u2019s team is under scrutiny from law enforcement and congressional investigators examining Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, including by stealing and disseminating emails from allies of Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  A bipartisan group of senators wrote a letter last month to Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, linking the election hacking and Russia\u2019s alleged violations of arms control agreements with Rosneft\u2019s position in Citgo.  The senators wrote that they are \u201cextremely concerned that Rosneft\u2019s control of a major U.S. energy supplier could pose a grave threat to American energy security, impact the flow and price of gasoline for American consumers, and expose critical U.S. infrastructure to national security threats.\u201d They urged Mnuchin \u2014 in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has to sign off on acquisitions of U.S. assets by foreign companies \u2014 to prepare for the prospect that PDVSA might soon default.  \u201cIn the event Rosneft were to acquire Citgo, we would expect a thorough, conflict-free and expedient review,\u201d the senators\u2019 wrote in their letter to Mnuchin.  Bennett had previously vowed that Avenue would not lobby for an entity that was averse to U.S. foreign policy interests \u2014 specifically singling out Russia and China \u2014 and he said that if Rosneft took control of Citgo, \u201cwe would resign immediately. Don\u2019t want that hassle.\u201d  When asked whether Venezuela was averse to U.S. foreign policy interests, Bennett said \u201cI don\u2019t work for Venezuela. I work for a Houston-based company that has three plants in America and produces 19 percent of America\u2019s gasoline. It\u2019s an American company, Americans work there.\u201d  Get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Citgo attracted attention last month, when it was revealed in a Federal Election Commission filing that the company donated $500,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, despite not having donated to recent presidential inaugurations.  The company has long employed established Washington lobbying firms and lobbyists, including Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and Cornerstone Government Affairs.  Bennett explained that Avenue\u2019s deal with Citgo was a subcontract with a company called VantageKnight that was started by a veteran lobbyist named Manuel Ortiz, who previously represented Citgo while working at Brownstein.  Ortiz has deep ties on the Democratic side of the aisle, but no obvious connections to Trump\u2019s administration. He did not respond to requests for comment, but sources say he also brought in Avenue Strategies to lobby for the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which signed Avenue to a $125,000 contract covering the four months from March through June.   VantageKnight was paid $270,000 during the first three months of the year to lobby for Citgo, according to filings with congressional oversight offices.   The filings indicate that Ortiz lobbied Congress and the Trump administration on the \u201cpotential impact of U.S. energy and foreign policy restrictions\u201d on Citgo\u2019s \u201coperations and valuation of assets,\u201d as well as \u201csanctions related issues.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his style, but he\u2019s shaking it up,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said of President Donald Trump. | Rodney Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO  \u000a            By KEVIN ROBILLARD  02/24/2017 08:59 PM EST  \u201cCautiously optimistic.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see.\u201d  Story Continued Below  \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his style, but he\u2019s shaking it up.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the answer is going to be.\u201d  That's how the several of nation's governors described their feelings, hopes and expectations about the Trump administration. And after listening to them on Friday, it's clear they still have a lot of questions \u2014 and few answers \u2014 when it comes to a new White House that has talked more in broad strokes than wonky specifics when it comes to policy.  Even some Republicans didn\u2019t seem able to fully endorse the new administration.   \u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic,\u201d Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said at POLITICO\u2019s State Solutions Conference. Herbert said he was pleased with President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet picks.   \u201cYou have to surround yourself with good people,\u201d he said. \u201cI see him doing that, and I think he can have a successful presidency.\u201d  Of the 11 governors interviewed at the conference, only one \u2014 Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who led a pro-Trump super PAC during the campaign \u2014 was unabashedly excited about President Trump.   \u201cWe believe we have a partner in the White House,\u201d Scott said at the conference.   But it was Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson who may have best encapsulated the governors\u2019 view of the entertainer-turned-President.  \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his style, but he\u2019s shaking it up,\u201d he said.  A record 46 of the nation\u2019s 50 governors were in D.C. for the annual meeting of the National Governors\u2019 Association, along with sideline meetings for the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association and the Republican Governors\u2019 Association. The state executives ate lunch with Vice President Mike Pence on Friday, and were scheduled to visit the White House for dinner with President Donald Trump on Sunday night, followed by meetings with White House staff and members of Congress on Monday.   \u000a  \u000a            By SHANE GOLDMACHER  The governors were unanimous in their opposition to Trump\u2019s desire to crack down on foreign trade, fretful about his plans to replace Obamacare, pleased with his plans for an increase in federal infrastructure spending, and sharply divided on his push for immigration enforcement.   The governors, who mostly came out of the establishment wings of both political parties, unanimously broke with the White House on trade policy. No governor was ready for Trump to start slapping tariffs on imports and potentially starting a trade war.   \u201cTrade is one of the truly essential ingredients of progress,\u201d Democratic Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said.   \u201c[Trump] doesn\u2019t fit neatly into my conservative principles over time, one of those being trade issues,\u201d Hutchinson said later.  New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu, asked if he was worried about Trump\u2019s renegotiation of NAFTA \u2014 Canada is a key trading partner for the Granite State \u2014 wasn\u2019t sure of what the Trump administration\u2019s next steps were.  \u201cWe\u2019re watching it, but I\u2019m not sure what the answer is going to be,\u201d Sununu said.   On healthcare, Republicans were ready to repeal Obamacare and implement block-granting for Medicaid, but were also worried about the process and confusion if the law is repealed without a replacement.  \u000a2020 Elections  \u000a            By GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI  Herbert, for instance, warned about passing a fix without some Democratic support, making Republicans wholly responsible for the health care system, premium hikes and consumer confusion.   \u201cI\u2019d rather do it right than quick,\u201d he said.  Arkansas\u2019 Hutchinson sounded a similar note: \u201cI support a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but you have to know where you\u2019re going after that.\u201d   Democrats, on the other hand, repeatedly warned of the danger of repealing Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion and expressed doubt Republicans would succeed. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, a Republican-turned-independent, summed up the danger for his former party.  \u201cAlmost daily, I hear from people who are alive today because of Medicaid expansion,\u201d he said.   \u000a                            \u201cAlmost daily, I hear from people who are alive today because of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Alaska Gov. Bill Walker said during POLITICO's Seventh Annual State Solutions Conference at Microsoft Innovation & Policy Center in Washington on Friday. | Rodney Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO  Some issues saw more of a partisan division. Trump\u2019s plans to rapidly ramp up the deportation of undocumented immigrants, including those who had committed only minor crimes, alarmed Democrats but won plaudits from Republicans.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the administration is going to go out and have massive collections, massive deportations [of undocumented immigrants,]\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d   Hutchinson, on the other hand, said he read the White House orders on immigration and didn\u2019t fully understand the fuss.  \u201cAll he\u2019s saying is that he\u2019s going to enforce the law,\u201d he said.

aV \u000a            By MADELINE CONWAY  01/19/2017 01:24 PM EST  Ivanka Trump says it is \u201cinappropriate\u201d to speculate that she will effectively serve as first lady in her father\u2019s administration and occupy an office in the East Wing.  \u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate observation,\u201d Trump told the ABC News program \u201c20/20\u201d for a segment set to air Thursday night. \u201cThere\u2019s one first lady and she\u2019ll do remarkable things.\u201d  Story Continued Below  President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s wife, the former model Melania, was a reluctant campaigner, and she plans to stay in New York City for several months after the inauguration before moving to Washington so that their young son, Barron, can complete the schoolyear there.   But Ivanka, Trump\u2019s oldest daughter, was a regular surrogate for the campaign and has advised him on policy issues including parental leave and the environment. Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, is also an incoming senior adviser to the president-elect, and the couple is moving to Washington with their three children.  All that has prompted widespread speculation that Ivanka may fulfill some of the first lady\u2019s traditional duties in Melania\u2019s place.  She pushed back on that in her interview with ABC, though. She also discussed her transition from leader at the Trump Organization to Washington, describing it as \u201cemotional.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s emotional that I\u2019m stepping away from my business, and my father will be president, and hopefully I can be there to support him and to support those causes I\u2019ve cared about my whole professional career,\u201d she said.  ABC also spoke with Trump\u2019s two adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, for the segment. Both sons are taking over managerial control of their father\u2019s business empire, an arrangement that has not satisfied ethics experts, who say it does not eliminate Trump\u2019s many financial conflicts of interest.  \u000aPresidential Transition   \u000a            By DAVID SIDERS  Eric, though, suggested that his father will be too busy to get involved with the business as president.  \u201cMy father has the biggest responsibility of any person, arguably, on the planet, and that\u2019s to run the United States of America,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cHis focus is going to be running this country.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a            By LOUIS NELSON  12/14/2016 10:49 AM EST  Congressional Republicans knew about Russian attempts to meddle in the U.S. presidential election as those efforts were ongoing and chose to do nothing about them for fear of hurting the electoral chances of President-elect Donald Trump, former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin said Wednesday.  \u201cLook, the truth is it\u2019s been very obvious for leaders in Washington on the Republican side that the Russians have been undermining our democracy, or did undermine our democracy,\u201d McMullin said at an event hosted by POLITICO Wednesday morning. \u201cI know because I know for a fact that they know this. It was a topic of discussion during the election and they chose not to stand up.\u201d  Story Continued Below  McMullin ran for president as an independent, conservative alternative to Trump, who won the Republican presidential nomination despite lacking traditional conservative bona fides. Before jumping into the race last August, he was the chief policy director for Republicans in the House of Representatives and before that, was an operations officer in the CIA.  In a report released last October, the U.S. intelligence community stated that Russia had attempted to interfere with the American election process, launching cyberattacks against political targets. Trump has refused to concede the intelligence community\u2019s assessment and has sought to push back against a CIA assessment that Russia launched its hacking efforts in an attempt to boost the president-elect\u2019s candidacy.  Russian cyberattacks, which hacked into the email systems of the Democratic National Committee as well as politically influential individuals, were just part of the Kremlin\u2019s efforts, according to McMullin. He said Republicans in Congress were aware that the Russian government also sought to undermine Americans\u2019 faith in the election process and bolster Trump through RT America, the Kremlin-owned cable news station. Congressional Republicans also knew about online accounts created by the Russian government that backed Trump and attacked those who did not.  \u201cThey understood what was happening and they understood that that was probably only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cAs a former intelligence officer, it\u2019s hard to overstate how alarming this is and how alarming it should be.\u201d  \u000a  \u000a            By MADELINE CONWAY  \u201cWe now have the intelligence agencies who have taken, candidly, their sweet time in coming out to say \u2018yes, indeed Russia did attempt to undermine our elections, to influence our election\u2019 and then more recently, you know, the reported CIA assessment that they did it on behalf of Donald Trump or to support Donald Trump, which I think, again, is obvious and not something we should need the CIA to tell us, based on all the other information we have.\u201d  McMullin was especially troubled by Trump\u2019s decision to nominate for secretary of state ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has close business ties to Russia and was awarded the Russian \u201cOrder of Friendship\u201d by President Vladimir Putin. McMullin said Tillerson \u201cis a predictable pick\u201d because he is \u201csomebody who will not stand up to what Donald Trump intends to do, which is a realignment, a strategic realignment of the United States with Russia.\u201d  Members of both political parties on Capitol Hill have called for an investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in last month\u2019s election, and McMullin said he has more faith in the Senate than he does in the House when it comes to those investigations. He said specifically that he trusts Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and that more lawmakers should join them in investigating Russian interference. He said the issue should be bipartisan and should get more attention from the media, lines that earned him applause from the audience.  \u201cThis is what Russia does in Europe and has done with effect. The Republicans are sticking their heads in the sand on this issue as they did during the campaign,\u201d McMullin said. \u201cI will tell you, this is not a new issue. They knew during the campaign that this was happening and they chose not to say anything because they knew it would harm them politically. That is the issue, the sacrifice of principle for power, the sacrifice of the country\u2019s interests for the party\u2019s interests.\u201d  Missing out on the latest scoops?

aV \u000a                "We are told today that truth no longer matters. It does," writes Roger Simon. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO  \u000aSimon Says  \u000a            By ROGER SIMON  02/01/2017 05:19 AM EST  This is the end, my friends. It is time to say goodbye. I realize this is the worst possible time for a political columnist to retire, but what I didn\u2019t realize is that any of you cared.  Robert Feder, a famous media writer from Chicago, found out about my retirement a few days ago and I have been flooded with farewells ever since.  Story Continued Below  I have also been flooded \u2014 really, you can read them \u2014 with messages on Facebook and Twitter asking me not to retire. Not now. Not, I\u2019m told, when America \u201cneeds you.\u201d  I know, I know: It is preposterous. It is laughable. But not to some. For some, I have been the friend they have never met for more than 40 years.  For all those years, my job took me all over the world. My wife and I had precious little time for extended vacations. She stayed behind working at newspapers for 35 years and then running her own editing business.  Now she wants to see the world. And I\u2019d like to go with her while I still can.  As I said, bad timing. So instead of the usual, goopy farewell, I will actually speak my mind. And I will do so no matter how many disagree with me. \u201cMine enemies grow older,\u201d Alexander King, a social critic, once wrote. It is one of the comforts we columnists have.  We live at a pivotal time because Donald Trump and his thugs have done us a favor. They have shown us that democracy is not inevitable. They have shown us it can fail.  In just a matter of days, they have shown us how democracy can be transformed into something evil. And we can imagine a future of jackboots crashing through our doors at 2 a.m., trucks in the streets to take people to the internment camps, bright lights and barking dogs \u2014 and worse.  \u000aSimon Says   \u000a            By ROGER SIMON  Does this make me sound hysterical? Maybe. But this is my last chance to be. In its first week, the Trump administration demonstrated its contempt for Mexicans, for Muslims and for Jews. I imagine the true list is longer. Much longer.  Should we keep quiet as we watch this? Is this why America was created?  If, for amusement, you wish to pay attention to the opinion polls, do so. (Jimmy Kimmel said: \u201cHillary underperformed with women, African-Americans, Latinos and young people. The only group she did well with was pollsters.\u201d)  But the most important poll was created by Henry David Thoreau when he wrote, \u201cany man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one \u2026 \u201d  You are a majority of one. You have a duty to act like it. You have a duty to do something to preserve democracy. Something nonviolent, I hope, but something.  Trump tells civil rights leader John Lewis to keep his mouth shut and then Trump smiles his porcine smile. In what fantasy land, in what delusional world would one desire the words of a bellicose Donald Trump and the silence of John Lewis?  I hear that George Orwell\u2019s classic \u201c1984\u201d is popular again. Good. It is a great read with a real message. But don\u2019t get carried away. Spoiler alert: The bad guys win at the end. Their tentacles of power have reached too deeply and spread too far.  We are told today that truth no longer matters. It does.  We are told human decency is the concern of the weak. It isn\u2019t.  We are told civil liberties can be brushed aside when it is convenient to the wielders of power to so do. Such people should be stopped. They must be stopped.  And there is only the people to stop them.  Is Trump a \u201clegitimate\u201d president? You tell me: Hillary Clinton got 3 million more popular votes. The Russians may have hacked the results. The minority vote continues to be suppressed. And FBI Director James Comey may have influenced the outcome of the election by behavior that ran the gamut from the peculiar to the inexplicable.  \u000aSimon Says  \u000a            By ROGER SIMON  Legally, Trump today is legitimate. Who knows what we will find in the future?  What a terrible time to subtract even one puny voice from the forces of opposition to him.  But I must. I leave the writing of a regular column entirely voluntarily. No editor hung a dead chicken over my doorway. And it is a terrific job. A job of spectacular fun and deep satisfaction.  And yet I have no desire to have my corpse discovered late one night draped over my keyboard by the cleaning guy, who whistles a low note and says, \u201cI thought he died years ago.\u201d  Our long national nightmare may have just begun. You, each of you, is a majority of one. You can speak out for me. You don\u2019t need leaders; you just need a conscience.  \u201cI decline to accept the end of man,\u201d William Faulkner wrote. \u201cI believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. It is the writer\u2019s privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart.\u201d  Have I lifted a heart? Just once? Just for the most fleeting of moments?  Then I leave you a happy man, one filled with joy. And don\u2019t worry. We will always have each other. And Twitter.  So long.  Roger Simon is POLITICO's chief political columnist.

WELCOME TO THE LULL, hopefully. Congress is gone. The president is in Bedminster. The sleepy D.C. August is in full swing. Enjoy.  BREAKING \u2013 AP at 8:56 a.m.: \u201cOKINAWA, Japan (AP) - U.S. Marine officials say a search is underway for service members after the \u2018mishap\u2019 of an aircraft off Australia coast.\u201d  Story Continued Below  INCOMING! -- NYT A1, \u201cMueller Seeks White House Documents on Flynn,\u201d by Matt Rosenberg, Matt Apuzzo and Mike Schmidt: \u201cInvestigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, recently asked the White House for documents related to the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, and have questioned witnesses about whether he was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the final months of the presidential campaign, according to people close to the investigation. Though not a formal subpoena, the document request is the first known instance of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team asking the White House to hand over records. In interviews with potential witnesses in recent weeks, prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have spent hours poring over the details of Mr. Flynn\u2019s business dealings with a Turkish-American businessman who worked last year with Mr. Flynn and his consulting business, the Flynn Intel Group.  \u201cThe company was paid $530,000 to run a campaign to discredit an opponent of the Turkish government who has been accused of orchestrating last year\u2019s failed coup in the country. Investigators want to know if the Turkish government was behind those payments \u2014 and if the Flynn Intel Group made kickbacks to the businessman, Ekim Alptekin, for helping conceal the source of the money. The line of questioning shows that Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry has expanded into a full-fledged examination of Mr. Flynn\u2019s financial dealings, beyond the relatively narrow question of whether he failed to register as a foreign agent or lied about his conversations and business arrangements with Russian officials.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2ubct7K   **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh  JOSH GERSTEIN with a REALITY CHECK -- \u201cSessions\u2019 broad attack on leaks aimed at an audience of one: Trump\u201d: \u201cDozens of reporters and a horde of photographers turned out for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 news conference Friday to announce a crackdown on leaks, but the most important target for his message wasn\u2019t in the room: President Donald Trump. Sessions\u2019 eight-minute broadside against leaks and his stern warning to leakers seemed to be aimed at trying to repair his badly frayed relationship with Trump, who has expressed regret for selecting Sessions and who has specifically complained that he was doing too little to fight the tidal wave of leaks that have swamped the Trump White House. ...  \u201cFriday\u2019s event at Justice Department headquarters was carefully structured to ensure that Sessions\u2019 message reached Trump with the fewest distractions possible. If reporters had the chance to question the attorney general about the Russia investigation, he might have demurred because he has recused from the probe. But with the recusal at the core of Trump\u2019s complaints about Sessions, any televised scene of the attorney general broaching the subject could send the president into a blue rage. So, Sessions filed out after he spoke. Cameras were then shut off at Justice officials\u2019 insistence before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein returned to take reporters\u2019 questions about the nitty-gritty of the leak crackdown.\u201d http://politi.co/2wuqqys   -- \u201cLeak Investigations Triple Under Trump, Sessions Says,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Charlie Savage and Eileen Sullivan: \u201c[T]he Justice Department is pursuing about three times as many leak investigations as were open at the end of the Obama era, a significant devotion of resources to hunt down disclosures that have plagued the Trump administration.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2utCMpc   -- @chucktodd: \u201cIf DoJ media source threat is real (I assume it\u2019s not; just a show presser to please WH) then I look forward to ignoring that subpoena\u201d.  SHORING UP MCMASTER -- PETER BAKER in the NYT, \u201cTrump Defends McMaster as Conservatives Seek His Dismissal\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump defended Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his embattled national security adviser, on Friday in the face of a full-bore campaign by the nationalist wing of his political coalition accusing him of undermining the president\u2019s agenda and calling for his dismissal. General McMaster has angered the political right by pushing out several conservatives on the national security staff and cautioning against ripping up the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by President Barack Obama without a strategy for what comes next. ... [A]fter two days of unrelenting attacks on General McMaster by conservative activists and news sites, complete with the Twitter hashtag #FireMcMaster, the president weighed in to quash such talk. \u2018General McMaster and I are working very well together,\u2019 he said in a statement emailed to The New York Times. \u2018He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country.\u2019 ...  \u201cAt one point on Friday, Breitbart News ... had close to a dozen headlines on its home page about General McMaster, like \u2018McMaster \u201cDeeply Hostile to Israel and to Trump.\u201d\u2019 The #FireMcMaster hashtag was tweeted more than 50,000 times since Wednesday.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2vBxtsV   BELOW THE SURFACE -- \u201cNational security adviser attempts to reconcile Trump\u2019s competing impulses on Afghanistan,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Greg Jaffe and Phil Rucker: \u201cIn a disorderly West Wing in which decisions are evaluated not by ideology but by their impact on the Trump brand and their fealty to the president\u2019s campaign-trail promises, McMaster has struggled to become a dominant foreign policy force. ... Among his biggest challenges was holding the attention of the president. ... Trump had little time for in-depth briefings on Afghanistan\u2019s history, its complicated politics or its seemingly endless civil war.  \u201cEven a single page of bullet points on the country seemed to tax the president\u2019s attention span on the subject, said senior White House officials. \u2018I call the president the two-minute man,\u2019 said one Trump confidant. \u2018The president has patience for a half-page.\u2019 ...

That door is now closed. Aides can\u2019t linger outside the chief of staff\u2019s office, either. White House staff waiting to see Mr. Kelly -- or other senior advisers in nearby suites -- are asked to remain in the lobby, where White House visitors sit on couches and can read a selection of daily newspapers. \u2026 \u2018The problem here is that he won\u2019t have anyone to talk to, and he\u2019ll get frustrated,\u2019 said one person who regularly speaks with Mr. Trump. \u2018I give General Kelly four months.\u2019 ...  \u201cMr. Trump was impressed by Mr. Kelly\u2019s presentations at DHS, at times describing him as \u2018a killer.\u2019 He is also taken, said one official, by the \u2018presence\u2019 of his chief of staff, who stands about 6-foot-2 and tends to dominate the room. ... Mr. Trump kept Mr. Priebus on a shorter leash, expressing his irritation when his former chief of staff would hover in Oval Office meetings. At times, Mr. Trump charged him with menial tasks such as organizing small groups of reporters to glimpse the first few moments of a meeting with the president. ... People who have known Mr. Kelly for years describe his style as no-nonsense. He introduces himself on phone calls and in emails to people he knows simply as \u2018Kelly.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re in a 10-minute meeting with him, he\u2019ll be quiet for the first nine minutes,\u2019 listening before making a decision or a pronouncement, said one person close to him. ...   \u201cRunning one of his first senior staff meetings, Mr. Kelly laid down clear lines of authority and ordered aides to stick to their assigned areas. Discussions with senators, U.S. House members or others on Capitol Hill must be reported to the White House\u2019s legislative affairs director, Marc Short. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Mr. Kelly said, must know about meetings with foreign diplomats. ... Mr. Kelly moved senior staff meetings to 8 a.m., instead of 8:45, and holds them around the long mahogany table of the Roosevelt Room. His predecessor, Mr. Priebus, held the meetings in his office, where the television was often turned on and where staff could often redirect the discussion away from the agenda.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2wurimF   -- JOSH DAWSEY, \u201cJohn Kelly\u2019s big challenge: Controlling the tweeter in chief\u201d: \u201c[K]elly has said he would like to know what Trump is planning to tweet before he does so and would prefer that big decisions not be announced on Twitter -- but has privately conceded there will be late-night or early-morning missives he cannot review. Kelly is trying to put together a system in which top aides don\u2019t learn of decisions on Twitter, one where policy and personnel decisions are not first tweeted without having procedures in place to make them happen. ... Ironically, the announcement of Kelly\u2019s new role foreshadowed the challenges he faces. Kelly knew he was going to be named chief of staff, officials said. But he didn\u2019t know that Trump, sitting on the tarmac aboard Air Force One on July 28, would announce it on Twitter. Other senior administration officials first learned of the news through a buzzing phone, several officials said.\u201d http://politi.co/2uaX47H   -- STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT THIS: The White House chief of staff has to develop a system to try to ensure his own senior White House aides don\u2019t learn about decisions through Twitter.

But on Thursday afternoon, senior administration aides postponed the announcement at the urging of United Nations and State Department officials, who are in the sensitive final stages of convincing China to sign on to a U.N. resolution that would impose new sanctions on North Korea. U.N. and State Department officials warned that the trade announcement could kill their chances of winning Beijing\u2019s buy-in.\u201d http://politi.co/2vzJCxz   COMING ATTRACTIONS -- \u201cTrump may host visiting leaders at his N.J. golf club during upcoming U.N. gathering,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Anne Gearan: \u201cPresident Trump is planning to host foreign leaders at his New Jersey golf club when he attends the annual U.N.

Trump\u2019s slowness to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is one reason for a growing backlog of natural gas pipelines and a gas export terminal awaiting approval from the agency, which has been unable to conduct major business since February.

The grand jury, which began its work in recent weeks, signals that Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry will likely continue for months. ... Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn\u2019t aware that Mr. Mueller had started using a new grand jury. \u2018Grand jury matters are typically secret,\u2019 Mr. Cobb said. \u2018The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\u2019\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2ua1HTD  **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh  REUTERS -- \u201cGrand jury issues subpoenas in connection with Trump Jr., Russian lawyer meeting: sources,\u201d by Karen Freifeld and John Walcott: \u201cA grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with a June 2016 meeting that included President Donald Trump's son, his son-in-law and a Russian lawyer, two sources told Reuters on Thursday, signaling an investigation is gathering pace into suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The sources added that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in Washington to help examine allegations of Russian interference in the vote.\u201d http://reut.rs/2fbO6V3  -- \u201cOne year into the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, Mueller is on the Trump money trail,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Shimon Prokupecz: \u201cFederal investigators exploring whether Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russian spies have seized on Trump and his associates\u2019 financial ties to Russia as one of the most fertile avenues for moving their probe forward, according to people familiar with the investigation. The web of financial ties could offer a more concrete path toward potential prosecution than the broader and murkier questions of collusion in the 2016 campaign, these sources said. ...  \u201cCNN has learned some of the investigators involved in the probe are buying liability insurance out of concern they could become targets of lawsuits from those who are being investigated, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. The Justice Department covers legal fees for employees sued in the course of their duties, but some of the lawyers want extra protection.\u201d http://cnn.it/2v4ktJ1  TRUMP RESPONDS -- \u201cTrump rallies his base against Russia investigation,\u201d by Matt Nussbaum in Huntington, West Virginia: \u201cPresident Donald Trump used a campaign-style rally Thursday night to level a sustained attack on the investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election, just hours after news broke that special counsel Robert Mueller had tapped a grand jury as part of the wide-ranging probe. Calling the investigation \u2018fake\u2019 and \u2018demeaning,\u2019 he said it was both a Democratic excuse for the election loss and a distraction from what Trump contends are the more serious crimes of his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.  \u201cThe adoring crowd here responded by reprising a hallmark of the campaign, chanting, \u2018Lock her up!\u2019 ... \u2018We didn\u2019t win because of Russia -- we won because of you, that I can tell you,\u2019 Trump said, continuing the riff. \u2018Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight?\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2u6asKo  -- \u201cWest Virginia Democratic governor switches to GOP,\u201d by Matt Nussbaum, Gabe Debenedetti, Kevin Robillard and Daniel Strauss: \u201cWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announced a party switch Thursday evening in a surprise appearance with President Donald Trump in Huntington, West Virginia. \u2018Today, I will tell you, with lots of prayers and lots of thinking, I can\u2019t help you anymore being a Democrat governor,\u2019 Justice said. \u2018So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican.\u2019 ... Justice, who seldom worked with other Democrats, recently spent a well-publicized day hunting with Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 a familiar political optic in a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition. But his move still blindsided his old party, which is now left with control of just 15 governor mansions.\u201d http://politi.co/2uq4seu  WHERE THINGS STAND ON CAPITOL HILL \u2026  REPUBLICANS looking to find a path forward on a short-term government funding bill and raising the debt ceiling when they come back in September have begun discussing combining the two must-pass pieces of legislation. Both the debt ceiling and government funding bills will need Democrats to pass. They are likely to try to extend the debt ceiling and government funding to December. If they combine them it would allow leadership to try to strike a deal. EXPECT this strategy to inflame conservative members who are unlikely to be appeased by the argument that the real fight is in December.  JUST TO CLEAR THINGS UP -- OMB DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY told reporters yesterday at a brown-bag lunch that \u201cSteve Mnuchin speaks for the administration when it comes to -- on the debt ceiling. We\u2019ve heard that out of the President\u2019s mouth, and I respect that, in fact that\u2019s the right way to do it. I've got budget, Mnuchin\u2019s got debt ceiling, and Cohen\u2019s got tax [along with Mnuchin] \u2026 so there is no infighting within the administration about the debt ceiling.\u201d  -- \u201cRepublicans leave town with no clear path on Obamacare,\u201d by Jen Haberkorn and Paul Demko: \u201cSenate leaders want to just drop the issue altogether. Conservatives say they\u2019re still fighting for repeal. Moderates want to launch a bipartisan effort to fix the shaky Obamacare system. The reality is that, after seven years of unity on repealing Obamacare, Republicans are rudderless on how to talk about or address the defining domestic policy issue of nearly the past decade for their party, and they have no clear plans despite holding all the levers of power in Washington. Now, they face a month away from the Capitol, answering to their home-state voters about their lack of progress.\u201d http://politi.co/2ht3bm3  REMEMBER THE STAY-IN-UNTIL-HEALTH-CARE-IS-DONE THING? -- @nielslesniewski: \u201cAt 7:01 p.m., the Senate has adjourned for August recess.

Kelly often described the White House as one of the most dysfunctional organizations he had ever seen, complained to colleagues and allies about its meddling, incompetence and recklessness, and was once so angry he briefly considered quitting. Now as President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, he is doing something about it -- with a suddenness and force that have upended the West Wing. Mr. Kelly cuts off rambling advisers midsentence. He listens in on conversations between cabinet secretaries and the president. He has booted lingering staff members out of high-level meetings, and ordered the doors of the Oval Office closed to discourage strays. ...  \u201c\u2018Several times I\u2019ve been on phone conversations with the president over the last couple of days and General Kelly has been on those conversations as well,\u2019 Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Thursday when asked if Mr. Kelly was making a mark. The Trump White House is a judge-a-book-by-its-cover workplace, and staff members have been struck by Mr. Kelly\u2019s bearing: tall, stern and commanding a respect Mr. Priebus never did. People close to Mr. Kelly said they expected him to methodically assess his new staff before making more drastic changes -- and he has told people that he wants to improve morale before attacking the organizational chart.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2wcsdJn   -- \u201cKelly gives McMaster cover in West Wing battles: Trump\u2019s national security adviser has emerged as one of the most volatile personalities in White House,\u201d by Bryan Bender, Josh Dawsey and Nahal Toosi: \u201cNational security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has waged a pitched battle with other senior staff for control over policy and personnel on the National Security Council, is taking advantage of the shield offered by the arrival of his old military colleague John Kelly as White House chief of staff. Kelly told McMaster this week that he wanted him to remain as national security adviser, said two senior White House aides, and has encouraged him to make any staffing changes he deems necessary. ...  \u201cIn recent weeks, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials who have had direct interaction with him, McMaster has bristled at White House aides close to Trump whom he perceives as undercutting his authority. He seethes over every national security leak and lashes out over negative news stories he thinks are spread by his enemies. And McMaster, whose temper is legendary, frequently blows his top in high-level meetings. \u2018He can be very intense,\u2019 a McMaster confidant who speaks with him regularly and is a major supporter, told POLITICO Thursday. \u2018Some find that difficult.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2wqV1wN  ANOTHER PLOT TWIST -- \u201cFlynn details tie to data firm, transition pay,\u201d by AP\u2019s Chad Day and Stephen Braun: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is revealing a brief advisory role with a firm related to a controversial data analysis company that aided the Trump campaign, The Associated Press has learned. The disclosure of Flynn\u2019s link to Cambridge Analytica will come in an amended public financial filing in which the retired U.S. Army lieutenant general also discloses income that includes payments from the Trump transition team ... The amended disclosure shows that just before the end of the campaign, Flynn entered into a consulting agreement with SCL Group, a Virginia-based company related to Cambridge Analytica, the data mining and analysis firm that worked with Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d http://bit.ly/2htghj9  TRUMP INC. -- \u201cSecret Service vacates Trump Tower command post in lease dispute with president\u2019s company,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Carol Leonnig, David Fahrenthold and Jonathan O\u2019Connell: \u201cThe Secret Service has vacated its command post inside Trump Tower in Manhattan following a dispute between the government and President Trump\u2019s company over the terms of a lease for the space ... Previously, the Secret Service had stationed its command post \u2014 which houses supervisors and backup agents on standby in case of an emergency \u2014 in a Trump Tower unit one floor below the president\u2019s apartment. But in early July, the post was relocated to a trailer on the sidewalk, more than 50 floors below, a distance that some security experts worry could hamper the agency that protects the president\u2019s home and family. The command post appears unlikely to move anytime soon back inside Trump Tower, where the president and his family have rarely gone since moving to the White House. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the government should seek space in another location.\u201d http://wapo.st/2ht2PM7  AT MAIN JUSTICE -- \u201cJustice Dept., Under Siege From Trump, Plows Ahead With His Agenda,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Rebecca Ruiz: \u201c[E]ven as the Justice Department has been under siege by Mr. Trump, [Jeff] Sessions and [Rod] Rosenstein have sought to tune out the noise as they remake the department into the one that is most powerfully carrying out the president\u2019s agenda. \u2018We value the independence of the Justice Department,\u2019 Mr. Rosenstein said in an interview this week. ... Mr. Sessions is carrying out the president\u2019s conservative agenda with head-turning speed, roiling critics on the left and leaving some career staff members within the department disoriented by the sea change. \u2018Sessions as attorney general has been everything conservatives could have dreamed of and liberals could have feared,\u2019 said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.  \u201cIn the last six months, the attorney general has rolled back Obama-era policies on gay rights, voting rights, and criminal justice and police reform while advancing his own fight against drugs, gangs and violent crime. ... Mr. Sessions has mandated that prosecutors be as tough as possible in charging and sentencing all crimes, including drug offenses that carry stiff mandatory minimum prison sentences. He has expanded the ability of the police to seize people\u2019s assets, irrespective of whether they may have been convicted of a crime or even charged. And as he presses a hard-line immigration agenda, he has dispatched additional federal prosecutors to border districts to prosecute immigration cases and has ordered cities and states to fall in line with federal immigration authorities or else face cuts in federal funding.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2v2TGi5  --INTERESTING NUGGET: \u201cAmong the paintings that Mr. Rosenstein selected to decorate his conference room at the Justice Department is a portrait of Edward H. Levi, appointed attorney general by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 after the department\u2019s credibility had been eroded by President Richard M. Nixon, whose firing of the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, led to the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus in what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973. \u2018That right there,\u2019 Mr. Rosenstein said, motioning to the portrait of Mr. Levi. \u2018That\u2019s the post-Watergate A.G.\u2019\u201d  -- \u201cU.S. Attorney Subpoenas Kushner Cos. Over Investment-For-Visa Program,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Erica Orden, Aruna Viswanatha and Byron Tau: \u201cKushner Cos., the New York property development business owned by the family of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, has been subpoenaed by New York federal prosecutors regarding its use of an investment-for-immigration program ... The subpoena concerns at least one Jersey City, N.J., development financed in part by a federal visa program known as EB-5: twin, 66-floor commercial-and-residential towers called One Journal Square ... The subpoena, received by the company in May, was a document request that included a demand for emails.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2wqQCKr  1600 PENNSYLVANIA -- \u201cLife in the West Wing: Bug zappers and helicopter fumes,\u201d by Tara Palmeri: \u201cBug zappers buzz in the West Wing while flies zip around. The yellow carpet is worn, and it can sometimes be difficult to work in parts of the White House because it fills with fumes when Marine One lands or takes off on the lawn of America\u2019s most famous home.

I explained that in those encounters, the president\u2019s children were unfailingly deferential and polite. Long before their father\u2019s election, the Trump children enjoyed a stellar reputation among most Manhattan influencers for being hard-working and well raised. They possessed few of the flaws too easily recognizable in other wealthy and well-connected kids. Often, conversations that centered on the boorish behavior of Trump himself would end with someone citing his children as a mitigating factor against whatever severe judgments were being handed down. I once told Trump that a good way to judge most people is by the children they raised, and that by that measure, he seemed to be an unqualified success.  \u201cThe Donald\u2019s response was uncharacteristically humble. \u2018Anything good you see in my children is the result of them having a great mother,\u2019 he quietly said, with no cameras rolling to catch this fleeting glimpse of humility. \u2026 Americans have seen enough headlines over the past six months to better understand why nepotism does not work in the White House. Though my words may suggest otherwise, I genuinely like Jared and Ivanka. I also love Joey, Andrew, Katherine and Jack Scarborough.

Landrieu, who is wrapping up his last year as mayor of New Orleans, is following in the footsteps of his father, Moon Landrieu, who was himself a New Orleans mayor and president of the conference. The Democrat remains mum about his future plans, but he has been mentioned as a dark horse candidate for higher office once his term expires. \u201cI really don\u2019t [have future plans]. I haven\u2019t had time to think about it that much \u2026 and I intend to finish really, really strong, to make sure I keep my eyes focused on the streets in the city of New Orleans and to make sure the people have my full attention and full commitment. When that\u2019s over, I\u2019m going to take a nap.\u201d   The highlights ...  ON WORKING WITH TRUMP: \u201cThis administration is particularly confused about what they want to talk about at any particular time. They have a very hard time staying on message and as a consequence it is hard to respond to. We don\u2019t have a set position, we\u2019re always ready to work. Whenever they want to find an issue that we have common ground on, and even ones that we disagree on, we\u2019re always ready to be engaged. We don\u2019t have an ideological bent. We don\u2019t have the freedom to do that. We have to work with any president at any time to try to find an answer that works.\u201d  ON HOW MAYORS CAN WORK WITH CONGRESS: \u201cDon\u2019t wait to bring us in until the last minute when everything looks like it\u2019s gone to hell in the handbasket. Talk to us early and we might be able, based on our practical experience, to help you design a better mousetrap on whatever it is you might be talking about. \u2026 We\u2019re the ones who build all the projects on time, on task and under budget. We do it much better than the federal government does. But they\u2019ve got to show up to do that role.\u201d   HIS ADVICE FOR WASHINGTON: \u201cStop being so ideologically bent. Be problem-solvers. Be thoughtful, be practical and be bipartisan. Talk to each other and find common-sense solutions to real problems. We do it every day in our cities.

THE KELLY REGIME. CUE THE REPUBLICAN APPLAUSE, via Josh Dawsey: \u201cWhen new White House chief of staff John Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House that he planned to fix: Bad information getting into the president\u2019s hands. Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him -- whether on paper or in briefings -- because the president would make better decisions if given good information. \u2026  \u201c\u2018John Kelly knows the challenges he is facing,\u2019 said Leon Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who spoke to Kelly after he took the job. \u2018He\u2019s not going to just stand to the side and watch the White House fall apart piece by piece.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2u1mODq   Story Continued Below  -- AP\u2019S JONATHAN LEMIRE: \u201cTrump\u2019s new top aide assures Sessions his job is safe\u201d: \u201cNew White House chief of staff John Kelly, in one of his first acts in his new post, called Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reassure him that his position was safe despite the recent onslaught of criticism he has taken from President Donald Trump. Kelly called Sessions on Saturday to stress that the White House was supportive of his work and wanted him to continue his job, according to two people familiar with the call. \u2026 Kelly, who was appointed to the post the day before, described the president as still miffed at Sessions but did not plan to fire him or hope he would resign.\u201d http://bit.ly/2wnqOir   -- ONE THING REPUBLICANS ARE WORRIED ABOUT is the growing narrative that John Kelly is going to change everything in the White House. Yes, he is certainly doing things more traditionally. He\u2019s reaching out to former chiefs of staff and Hill leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan. And the president appears to be following Kelly\u2019s lead. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Trump is going to change overnight. For now, Kelly is adhering to James Baker\u2019s advice, via Peter Baker: the job is more about \u201cof staff\u201d than \u201cchief.\u201d  **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh  TRUMP\u2019S WASHINGTON -- NYT A1, \u201cTrump Supports Plan to Cut Legal Immigration by Half,\u201d by Peter Baker: \u201cPresident Trump embraced a proposal on Wednesday to slash legal immigration to the United States in half within a decade by sharply curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. The plan would enact the most far-reaching changes to the system of legal immigration in decades and represents the president\u2019s latest effort to stem the flow of newcomers to the United States. Since taking office, he has barred many visitors from select Muslim-majority countries, limited the influx of refugees, increased immigration arrests and pressed to build a wall along the southern border. \u2026   \u201cIn throwing his weight behind a bill, Mr. Trump added one more long-odds priority to a legislative agenda already packed with them in the wake of the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care program.

The dismissal of Ezra Cohen-Watnick, confirmed by the White House, is the latest in a string of NSC staff members removed at the behest of McMaster, who has steadily shed aides that had been brought on by his short-lived predecessor Michael Flynn.  \u201cCohen-Watnick, 31, was one of the few remaining aides in the organization hired by Flynn, who was fired in February. Since his arrival McMaster has had a hand in steadily cleaning out several of Flynn\u2019s marquee hires \u2013 three of them in the past three weeks. ...

During the July 19 meeting, Trump repeatedly suggested that Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford replace Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, because he is not winning the war, the officials said. Trump has not met Nicholson, and the Pentagon has been considering extending his time in Afghanistan.   \u201cOver nearly two hours in the situation room, according to the officials, Trump complained about NATO allies, inquired about the United States getting a piece of [Afghanistan\u2019s] mineral wealth and repeatedly said the top U.S. general there should be fired. He also startled the room with a story that seemed to compare their advice to that of a paid consultant who cost a tony New York restaurateur profits by offering bad advice. \u2026  \u201cTrump\u2019s national security team has been trying for months to come up with a new strategy he can approve. Those advisers are set to meet again to discuss the issue on Thursday at the White House. The president is not currently scheduled to attend the meeting, though one official said that could change. \u2026 At one point the president directed his frustration at Mattis, saying Trump had given the military authority months ago to make advances in Afghanistan and yet the U.S. was continuing to lose ground, the officials said. \u2026 One official said Trump pointed to maps showing the Taliban gaining ground, and that Mattis responded to the president by saying the U.S. is losing because it doesn\u2019t have the strategy it needs.\u201d http://nbcnews.to/2w7VjJH   TRUMP\u2019S THURSDAY -- PRESIDENT TRUMP will hold a rally in Huntington, W.Va., the second time in two weeks where he has taken his message on the road.  -- SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT: @realDonaldTrump at 9:29 p.m.: \u201cI love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen.

People may not like our answers\u2014but they should always be treated professionally and respectfully (obviously, this starts with the new Director of Communications).\u2019 \u2026 Scaramucci \u2014 who in his first days on the job repeatedly went on TV to threaten firings of White House staffers, and publicly accused then-chief of staff Reince Priebus of being the primary source of White House leaks \u2014 also called for staff to be more civil and humble. \u2018Make it clear that horn tooting and denigrating colleagues is unacceptable,\u2019 the memo reads. ...  \u201cThe memo ends with a personal to-do list, in which Scaramucci lays out a series of meetings he planned to have with incoming chief of staff Gen. John Kelly and other members of the White House staff, including Steve Bannon (\u2018I want his insight and help. He presumably has an opinion on how Comms can operate more effectively,\u2019 the memo says.)

John Kelly\u2019s swearing in as chief of staff and a medal of honor ceremony for a Vietnam veteran. On Tuesday night, Spicer was seen giving his family a tour of the White House grounds. He\u2019s posted nostalgic pictures on Instagram, like one of the first family taking off from the lawn on Marine One, with the caption: \u2018This will never get old.\u2019 ...  \u201cIn the wake of Scaramucci\u2019s departure, Spicer \u2014 who committed to staying several weeks to ensure an orderly transition in the press office \u2014 briefly considered staying on at the White House to help with Trump\u2019s effort to pass a major tax reform, a policy issue that Spicer had engaged with since stepping back from regular briefings in the last month.

THE WHITE HOUSE, PART INFINITY: \u201cCongress readies Round 2 with Trump on Russia: Language in key defense bills would make the administration revive a type of missile banned by a 1987 treaty,\u201d by Bryan Bender: \u201cCongress is moving to force the Pentagon to violate a nuclear arms treaty with Russia -- in yet another effort to box in President Donald Trump on relations with Moscow. Language in key defense bills in both the House and Senate would require the military to begin developing medium-range missiles banned by a 1987 treaty that Ronald Reagan negotiated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the twilight years of the Cold War.  \u201cSupporters say the move is necessary because Russian President Vladimir Putin has violated the pact. But opponents fear it could increase the chances of a nuclear confrontation at a time when relations between the two nations are at a post-Cold War low. The legislation is also likely to stir up new friction between lawmakers and Trump, who has already accused Congress of illegally meddling in his dealings with Russia. Trump blasted Congress on Wednesday for including \u2018clearly unconstitutional provisions\u2019 in a bipartisan bill imposing new sanctions on Putin\u2019s regime -- legislation he said he nonetheless signed \u2018for the sake of national unity.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2u5Nnvf   -- COALITION BUILDING -- NYT\u2019s Rick Gladstone: \u201cJoined by three Western allies, the United States on Wednesday escalated pressure on Iran over its space launch last week, saying the act disregarded a United Nations Security Council resolution on the use of missiles and was \u2018threatening and provocative.\u2019 In a letter to the Security Council and Secretary General Antnio Guterres, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States and envoys from Britain, France and Germany said the Iranian missile that carried a satellite into orbit was \u2018inherently capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/2ulHaXl   THE LATEST ON HEALTH CARE \u2026 -- \u201cLawyers, lawmakers leave Trump administration in limbo on Obamacare subsidies,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Jen Haberkorn: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has told advisers repeatedly he wants to end Obamacare cost-sharing subsidies that are crucial to the marketplaces continuing to work, and he has publicly said it would make sense to blow up the system, put the blame on the Democrats and force a negotiation. But after the inability of Republicans in Congress to repeal and replace the law, the White House is not expected to immediately end the subsidies, officials said, even as Trump stews in the legislative defeat. And they could remain in place indefinitely, some officials said.  \u201cThe administration has slowed a decision to hear from lawyers, who are studying how the payments could be ended and what legal liabilities the administration could face if the payments stop, according to administration officials. Lawyers and some administration officials have raised questions about ending the payments but are expected to offer an analysis later in August, West Wing officials said. One official said the analysis could arrive as soon as next week. A different official said the White House was in no hurry and wanted to consider all factors before making a decision. Another payment is due approximately Aug. 22.\u201d http://politi.co/2uYSn3M  -- JEN HABERKORN and ADAM CANCRYN: \u201cNew bipartisan Obamacare push faces steep climb\u201d: http://politi.co/2faLUgD  BIG ANNIE KARNI SCOOP -- \u201cZuckerberg hires former Clinton pollster Joel Benenson\u201d: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama and the chief strategist to Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the hire.  \u201cBenenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the ChanZuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy. The organization -- whose mission statement, according to its website, is \u2018advancing human potential and promoting equality\u2019 -- is endowed with the couple's Facebook fortune. Zuckerberg and Chan have vowed to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares, worth an estimated $45 billion, to charity.

The first was Israel\u2019s order, since rescinded, to install metal detectors at the Noble Sanctuary, the Muslim name for the disputed plateau in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City that holds the Al Aqsa Mosque and gold Dome of the Rock. Although Israel backed down, the decision was seen as a slap to Jordan, which is the legal custodian of the site. The other involved Israel\u2019s response to a deadly incident in the Jordanian capital, Amman, in which an Israeli Embassy guard killed two Jordanians, a 17-year-old delivery boy and an orthopedic surgeon. ...  \u201cBefore any summit could be planned, Israel and Jordan narrowly avoided yet another collision. As relations between the two countries deteriorated, two flamboyant parliamentarians -- one from Israel, one from Jordan -- fought via their Twitter feeds. Eventually, Jordanian Yehiya Saoud challenged the Israeli, Oren Hazan, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party, to a duel in the Judean desert at 10 a.m. Wednesday. Hazan, a former pimp who gained an extra measure of fame when he crashed Donald Trump\u2019s arrival ceremony in Tel Aviv last May to snag a selfie with the president, accepted. Gleeful online anticipation followed Hazan\u2019s progress toward the Allenby Bridge border post until someone in Netanyahu\u2019s office got wind of the scheme and sharply ordered Hazan back home.\u201d http://lat.ms/2v0wXl7   -- THIS GIVES JARED KUSHNER another problem to deal with. Israel and Jordan\u2019s relationship has long been crucial in maintaining relative calm in the Middle East. Jordan is the protectorate for the al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, for example. If they aren\u2019t getting along, then a complex plan with other Middle Eastern and Gulf nations to strike a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians is nothing more than a pipe dream.   COMING ATTRACTIONS -- \u201cGOP clash looms over raising the debt ceiling,\u201d by Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade: \u201cRepublican congressional leaders are quietly preparing to pass a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling increase, according to multiple senior GOP sources \u2014 setting the stage for a high-risk showdown with rank-and-file Republicans this fall. Trump administration officials, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are imploring Congress to raise the $19.8 trillion debt limit with no strings attached by the end of September. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 well aware they need Democrats to pass any debt bill through the Senate \u2014 are on board, albeit begrudgingly so.  \u201cBut beyond the leadership, there are few Republican takers, at least so far. GOP lawmakers in both chambers of Congress are calling for any debt ceiling hike to be accompanied by spending cuts or fiscal reforms \u2014 the same demand they made repeatedly during Barack Obama\u2019s two terms. That means McConnell (R-Ky.) and Ryan (R-Wis.) will have to rely on Democrats and enough moderate Republicans to help them avert a financial catastrophe by Sept. 29, the day Treasury exhausts its borrowing authority and the very last day for Congress to act.\u201d http://politi.co/2u2TVGK  -- AP: \u201cBipartisan Senate bill aims to protect special counsel\u2019s job\u201d: \u201cTwo members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are moving to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s job, putting forth new legislation that aims to ensure the integrity of current and future independent investigations. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware plan to introduce the legislation Thursday. The bill would allow any special counsel for the Department of Justice to challenge his or her removal in court, with a review by a three-judge panel within 14 days of the challenge. The bill would be retroactive to May 17, 2017 \u2014 the day Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Donald Trump's campaign.\u201d http://nydn.us/2fbmhfD  THE JUICE \u2026   FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: WILL ALLISON TO ARIZONA FOR SEN. JEFF FLAKE\u2019S REELECTION -- Will Allison is heading back to the campaign trail to run the comms operation for Flake\u2019s reelection bid. Allison was press secretary for Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s (R-Wis.) successful re-election bid in 2016. He has also worked for the North Carolina Republican Party when Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) won in 2014. In the House, Allison has worked for Tom Price and Paul Ryan. FLAKE is in a food fight, of sorts, with the Trump administration. He published a book sharply critical of the White House, and the administration responded by saying Flake would be serving his constituents better if he more focused on governing and not attacking the president. Allison\u2019s role was in the works before the tiff between Flake and the White House.  --SPOTTED: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and John Bolton having dinner last night at Capital Grille.

The internal document, described in a New York Times report on Tuesday evening, set off a torrent of speculation \u2014 and concern from many civil rights and higher education groups \u2014 that the Trump administration was preparing to sue universities over their affirmative action policies.   \u201c\u2018The posting sought volunteers to investigate one administrative complaint filed by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations in May 2015 that the prior Administration left unresolved,\u2019 Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. \u2018The complaint alleges racial discrimination against Asian Americans in a university\u2019s admissions policy and practices.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2u6aFRQ  -- BOSTON GLOBE: \u201cThe majority of Harvard\u2019s incoming class is nonwhite,\u201d by Deirdre Fernandes: \u201cFor the first time in Harvard University\u2019s history, the majority of students accepted into the incoming freshman class are not white, a milestone for an institution that prides itself on educating future presidents, CEOs, and world leaders.\u201d http://bit.ly/2vrR4uK  BANNON BEAT -- \u201cA Vatican Shot Across the Bow for Hard-Line U.S. Catholics,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Jason Horowitz in Vatican City: \u201cTwo close associates of Pope Francis have accused American Catholic ultraconservatives of making an alliance of \u2018hate\u2019 with evangelical Christians to back President Trump, further alienating a group already out of the Vatican\u2019s good graces. The authors, writing in a Vatican-vetted journal, singled out Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, as a \u2018supporter of an apocalyptic geopolitics\u2019 that has stymied action against climate change and exploited fears of migrants and Muslims with calls for \u2018walls and purifying deportations.\u2019 The article warns that conservative American Catholics have strayed dangerously into the deepening political polarization in the United States.  \u201cThe writers even declare that the worldview of American evangelical and hard-line Catholics, which is based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, is \u2018not too far apart\u2019 from jihadists. It is not clear if the article, appearing in La Civilt Cattolica, received the pope\u2019s direct blessing, but it was extraordinary coming from a journal that carries the Holy See\u2019s seal of approval. There has apparently been no reprimand from the pope, who is not shy about disciplining dissenters, and La Civilt Cattolica\u2019s editor has promoted the article nearly every day since it was published in July. ...

There are small Oval Office gatherings, dinners with the president at the White House, regular strategy sessions with his senior staff, meetings with Vice President Mike Pence in his office and at his Naval Observatory residence.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2umll9Z  FOR STEPHEN MILLER -- \u201cTrump plan to hire 15,000 border and immigration personnel isn\u2019t justified, federal watchdog says,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Lisa Rein: \u201cA report released this week by the DHS inspector general concludes that based on its rigorous screening requirement for law enforcement jobs and the relatively high rate of attrition among Border Patrol agents, Homeland Security would have to vet 750,000 applicants to find 5,000 qualified personnel. In addition, to hire the 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents the president called for in executive orders he issued in his first days in office, a pool of 500,000 candidates would need to apply, auditors found. The report calls into question whether DHS officials even need 15,000 new hires to target undocumented immigrants. Agency leaders have done such poor planning for what their workforce should look like, with an understaffed, poorly trained human resources operation, that they cannot justify thousands of new employees, the report says.\u201d http://wapo.st/2vryZg6  INSIDE THE ROOM -- NYT A1, \u201cUnder Trump, a Hollowed-Out Force in Syria Quickly Lost C.I.A. Backing,\u201d by Mark Mazzetti, Adam Goldman and Mike Schmidt: \u201cThe end came quickly for one of the costliest covert action programs in the history of the C.I.A. During a White House briefing early last month, the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, recommended to President Trump that he shut down a four-year-old effort to arm and train Syrian rebels. The president swiftly ended the program.  \u201cThe rebel army was by then a shell, hollowed out by more than a year of bombing by Russian planes and confined to ever-shrinking patches of Syria that government troops had not reconquered. Critics in Congress had complained for years about the costs -- more than $1 billion over the life of the program -- and reports that some of the C.I.A.-supplied weapons had ended up in the hands of a rebel group tied to Al Qaeda further sapped political support for the program.  \u201cWhile critics of Mr. Trump have argued that he ended the program to curry favor with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, there were in fact dim views of the effort in both the Trump and Obama White Houses -- a rare confluence of opinion on national security policy.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2vuMJaY  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Growing disparities in income and more are among today\u2019s greatest socio-economic challenges.

But in recent days, he seems to be more definitive about his plans.  \u201cSources told NY1 that Grimm is beginning to let a small number of political leaders on Staten Island know that he intends to run for Congress. Any campaign would be a challenge for someone in Grimm\u2019s position; he spent seven months in federal prison for tax fraud, and he was released in May of 2016. Grimm also made headlines for threatening a NY1 reporter, Michael Scotto, with physical violence in 2014, saying he would throw Scotto off a balcony and break him in half while they spoke at the Capitol in Washington.  \u201cI spoke with Grimm on Wednesday afternoon and he insisted he has not made any decisions yet on his political future. But he did say that there are people who would like to see him run, and he said he plans to return to public office one day.\u201d http://bit.ly/2v16gNd   -- JOHN BRESNAHAN and Jake started hearing murmurs of this Wednesday afternoon, and began making calls about it.

Especially by Grimm, who spent years in prison and threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony. Remember, this district is only slightly Republican. It was held by Democrat Michael McMahon from 2009 to 2011. (McMahon is now the county district attorney.)

SOME NEWS -- We asked COLORADO GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER during a Playbook Exchange event here if he would run for the White House on a ticket with OHIO REPUBLICAN GOV. JOHN KASICH. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Kasich would ever do that \u2026 You never know. You never say. He\u2019s an easy person to work with. He\u2019s strongly opinionated. And quick to his opinion. But he also knows as much about the federal budget, and understands health care at a deeper level than almost any other governor I know. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the cards. But I do like the idea of working with him in some context at some point.\u201d The governor told us Trump has told him he's taken notice of his appearances on TV.  -- WILL HICKENLOOPER RUN AGAINST SEN. CORY GARDNER (R-COLO.)? He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Gardner\u2019s stance on health care. \u201cThat\u2019s not the Cory Gardner I thought I knew.\u201d Hickenlooper said he is \u201cnot ruling anything out.\u201d When asked what he thinks about when he considers running for a seat in Washington, Hickenlooper joked, \u201cI think why me? What did I do to hurt you?\u201d Video of the event at S&P Global\u2019s Denver office  http://bit.ly/2ujrpA8   Story Continued Below  SPOTTED: Reince Priebus and Anthony Scaramucci both dining Tuesday afternoon at the Lafayette restaurant at the Hay Adams. Reince was with one other person, Scaramucci was with four. They were at separate tables.  **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbht.  READ THIS STORY, about how Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing for a clean debt ceiling increase and, in part, is banking on Democrats to carry it. http://politi.co/2vs7LXJ. It\u2019s very hard to see how this is not going to be a huge legislative fight in the fall. Conservatives are going to want to notch a legislative achievement alongside lifting the debt limit. Democrats are out of power in every sense, and will want a clean increase but won't want to be seen as carrying it. The ceiling needs to be lifted by the end of September. Government funding also runs out then. And the White House has said they want to finish tax reform by the end of October.   TOP TALKER -- BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- \u201cFull transcript: Trump\u2019s Wall Street Journal interview,\u201d by Josh Dawsey and Hadas Gold: \u201cPresident Donald Trump called his son-in-law a \u2018good boy\u2019 while thanking Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker for a positive editorial about Jared Kushner and said the leader of the Boy Scouts told him his jamboree speech was \u2018the greatest speech ever made to them.\u2019 The comments, made to The Wall Street Journal and obtained in a transcript by POLITICO, show Trump holding forth at length with Baker and engaging in a familiar back and forth. Baker, according to the transcript, asked many of the questions and took the lead byline on the main piece about the interview as well, an unusual step for the editor in chief of a paper with a large White House reporting staff. The Journal has not published a full transcript of the interview. ...  \u201cMatt Murray, the Journal\u2019s deputy editor-in-chief, warned staffers in a conference call in recent days about leaking the transcript, saying it would be a breach of trust, according to several sources familiar with the call. \u2018Damn right I told them that. It\u2019s true,\u2019 Murray said on Tuesday via a Journal spokesperson. According to the transcript, Ivanka Trump stopped by the Oval Office during the interview, telling Baker she heard he was there and wanted to say hello. ... Baker told Ivanka Trump, \u2018It was nice to see you out in Southampton a couple weeks ago,\u2019 an apparent reference to a party thrown last month attended by many politicos, business titans and media elites thrown by Washington Post heiress Lally Weymouth ... Ivanka Trump and Baker also chatted about their daughters, both named Arabella.\u201d With the full transcript http://politi.co/2vhPWKC   BREAKING -- EARLY LEAD FOR DEMOCRATS -- NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL -- "Poll: Democrats surge ahead on generic ballot," by Steven Shepard: "Republicans trail Democrats by 7 percentage points on the generic congressional ballot, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, the Democratic Party's greatest advantage on the generic ballot since the poll began asking the question this past spring.   "The survey, conducted last Thursday through Saturday, shows a generic Democrat leading a generic Republican, 44 percent to 37 percent, with 19 percent of registered voters undecided. The two parties were tied, 40 percent apiece, in the previous week\u2019s poll." http://politi.co/2uiOgMm   TRUMP\u2019S WEDNESDAY -- THE PRESIDENT will announce a legal immigration overhaul with Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.). He\u2019ll also meet with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) in the afternoon.  VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE in Montenegro made brief remarks to the pool. Per WaPo\u2019s Ashley Parker, Pence said: \u201cAs you mentioned, NATO is made up of large countries and small countries, but the United States of America has no small ally.\u201d  NEXT UP -- \u201cU.S. Plans Trade Measures Against China,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Jake Schlesinger and Bob Davis: \u201cThe Trump administration is planning trade measures to force Beijing to crack down on intellectual-property theft and ease requirements that American companies share advanced technologies to gain entry to the Chinese market. The administration is considering invoking a little-used provision of U.S. trade law to investigate whether China\u2019s intellectual-property policies constitute \u2018unfair trade practices,\u2019 according to people familiar with the matter. That would pave the way for the U.S. to impose sanctions on Chinese exporters or to further restrict the transfer of advanced technology to Chinese firms or to U.S.-China joint ventures. \u2026  \u201cOne big question hanging over the White House review is whether the administration pursues any complaint through the World Trade Organization, or whether it chooses to impose penalties on its own without first seeking permission from the international body, which some Trump advisers have argued is incapable of dealing with China\u2019s trade practices. Trump aides have regularly vowed to pursue a more unilateral approach to trade but have so far done little along those lines. It is unclear how long the administration\u2019s internal review will take before an announcement is made. Officials at one point had signaled that an announcement could come as soon as this week.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2vrtXB6  -- ANDREW RESTUCCIA and DOUG PALMER: \u201cTrump\u2019s aides have been deeply divided on trade, with top trade adviser Peter Navarro and chief strategist Steve Bannon calling for aggressive measures even as others like National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have urged caution. But an administration official said the decision to launch a Section 301 investigation won broad support among the president\u2019s ideologically diverse staff.\u201d http://politi.co/2uiKpi2  MONEY CHASE -- AP\u2019S JULIE BYKOWICZ: \u201cTrump\u2019s fundraising prowess is the engine of the [RNC] and a lifeline for every Republican planning to rely on the party for financial help during next year\u2019s congressional races. Leaning heavily on Trump\u2019s appeal among small donors, the party has raised $75 million in the first six months of the year, more than double what the [DNC] had raised by the same point in President Barack Obama\u2019s first year.\u201d http://bit.ly/2wl5F8v   DRAIN THE SWAMP! -- \u201cTrump Loyalist Mixes Businesses and Access at \u2018Advisory\u2019 Firm,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Nick Confessore and Ken Vogel: \u201cMr. Lewandowski started his new business, Lewandowski Strategic Advisors, in May, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware, eight days after he announced he would part ways with the Washington lobbying firm he helped found, Avenue Strategies. Mr. Lewandowski has recently discussed expanding the new firm by adding, among others, two more Trump insiders -- the former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie and George Gigicos, who stepped down Monday as Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advance director -- according to two associates.  \u201cAmong the first new clients of Lewandowski Strategic Advisors is an Ohio-based company called Community Choice Financial. The company is a leader in the payday lending industry, which has faced heightened federal scrutiny in recent years. ... Mr. Lewandowski, who is known for his keen understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s news media tastes and habits, used an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 on Sunday to press his new client\u2019s interests, calling for Mr. Trump to oust the bureau\u2019s director, Richard Cordray, an Obama holdover who has led the effort to pass new payday lending requirements. ... Rejecting a question from the \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 host, Chuck Todd, about whether he had \u2018a client that wants to see\u2019 Mr. Cordray fired, Mr. Lewandowski said: \u2018No, no. I have no clients whatsoever.\u2019\u201d http://nyti.ms/2vrrcQt  THE LATEST ON HEALTH CARE \u2026   -- \u201cRepublicans in Congress Bypass Trump to Shore Up Health Law,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Robert Pear and Thomas Kaplan: \u201cCongressional Republicans moved on Tuesday to defuse President Trump\u2019s threat to cut off critical payments to health insurance companies, maneuvering around the president toward bipartisan legislation to shore up insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the influential chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, announced that his panel would begin work in early September on legislation to \u2018stabilize and strengthen the individual health insurance market\u2019 for 2018. \u2026   \u201cIn the House, two Republicans, Representatives Tom Reed of New York and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, teamed with Democrats to promote incremental health legislation that would also fund the cost-sharing subsidies. The moves were a remarkable response to the president\u2019s repeated threats to send health insurance markets into a tailspin. They offered tangible indications of cooperation between the parties after Republican efforts to scrap the Affordable Care Act collapsed in the Senate last week, all but ending the seven-year Republican quest to overturn President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. Lawmakers from both parties concede that the health law needs improvement, as consumers face sharp premium increases and a shrinking number of insurance options in many states.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2f7tMEj  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Driving Inclusive Growth: See where 20 countries stand in terms of opportunities for investing in technology that enhances inclusive economic growth. Learn more. ******  TOP-EDS -- LANHEE CHEN and TEVI TROY in the WASHINGTON POST: \u201cHow Republicans can fix Obamacare now\u201d: \u201cOn the legislative front, there are several rifle-shot provisions that could be attached to must-pass pieces of legislation, such as continued funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that medical liability reform could save almost $50 billion over 10 years. And allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines would help expand insurance markets, consequently, improving options for consumers in states burdened by heavy insurance mandates. Republicans could also eliminate the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a government body that has drawn bipartisan criticism for the extraordinary power it has to make significant cuts to the Medicare program.\u201d http://wapo.st/2vhxotW   -- SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-Okla.) in the WSJ, \u201cHow To Make The Senate Work Again: Keep The Filibuster But Change Other Rules That Promote Delay\u201d: \u201cHow do we get the Senate working again? First, we should reduce floor debate time for executive nominees from 30 hours to eight or less. The Senate could debate and vote on five or more nominees a week, instead of just one or two. Interestingly, this rule change was adopted for a short time by the Senate in 2013, under Harry Reid, as part of a temporary agreement to fill nominations. It worked then, and it would work now. Second, we should lower the vote threshold on the \u2018motion to proceed,\u2019 which begins legislative debate and amendment consideration, from 60 votes to 51.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2w4oxZT  IF YOU READ ONE THING -- ANNIE KARNI: \u201cIn Trump\u2019s White House, the women are the survivors\u201d: \u201cKellyanne Conway\u2019s office has a different vibe than other corners of the West Wing. Unlike some of the drab work spaces belonging to her male counterparts, whose offices look as impersonal as the day they moved in, Conway\u2019s office is decorated with colorfully framed, oversized family photos mounted on the walls and a copy of Ivanka Trump\u2019s book \u2018Women Who Work\u2019 prominently on display. The comfy digs are a sign that Conway, the White House counselor who recently has been keeping a lower profile, is planning on being here for the long haul \u2014 even though some of her colleagues, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and recently departed chief of staff Reince Priebus, have at times tried to cut her out of the information loop.  \u201cMeanwhile, former colleagues like Priebus, Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer, Michael Flynn, Michael Dubke, Michael Short and Boris Epshteyn have been fired, or simply resigned to save themselves. Even Bannon, according to multiple people close to President Donald Trump, has been the target of the president\u2019s recent frustrations and anger, and he has been trying to lower his genius-behind-the-throne profile in order to avoid sharing Priebus\u2019 unhappy fate. Conway, however, is not alone in surviving the snakepit. The quiet endurers of Trump\u2019s tumultuous White House, by and large, are the women who serve in his administration. That fact that may seem ironic in an administration run by a man who has launched sexist attacks on everyone from morning show host Mika Brzezinski to his former campaign opponent Hillary Clinton \u2014 and who in the past has been accused by more than a dozen women of groping or kissing them against their will.  \u201cBut the women of the West Wing, at least so far, have had the more stable ride. is not alone. Former Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell has risen in the ranks to become deputy national security adviser. She was also on the final shortlist of people Trump was considering for the chief of staff job given to retired Gen. John Kelly, according to two White House officials. It was Powell, alongside U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who was invited to ride in Trump\u2019s car, known as \u2018The Beast,\u2019 from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base last Friday, hours before the president unceremoniously fired Priebus in the rain. Communications adviser Hope Hicks maintains an unassailable position as a surrogate family member and loyal aide by the president\u2019s side, where she has stood since before there was even a campaign. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has risen to the position of press secretary, after Spicer resigned because he was not given the full control of the communications department that he demanded.\u201d http://politi.co/2wkSaFV  TRIAL BALLOON \u2013 \u201cKelly eyes DHS spokesman for communications director, sources say,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Dylan Byers: \u201c[Dave] Lapan, who has worked with Kelly for over a decade, is at the top of a short list to serve as the White House\u2019s top official on messaging and communications. He would take the position formerly held by Anthony Scaramucci. Kelly\u2019s interest in Lapan suggests that he is as eager to impose discipline on the White House messaging strategy as he is to impose order on the chaotic and fractious West Wing. Lapan has a background that, like Kelly\u2019s, is steeped in years of military experience. Before DHS, he led press operations at the Defense Department and the Marine Corps. Reached for comment, Lapan told CNNMoney he had not spoken to Kelly or anyone else at the White House about the position.\u201d http://cnnmon.ie/2tYnp8R  -- REPORTERS WE SPOKE TO said this would be a good hire for the White House.

THANKS, BUT NO THANKS -- \u201cSasse rebuffs Heritage for top job,\u201d by Eliana Johnson: \u201cThe Heritage Foundation has approached one of the Senate\u2019s leading anti-Trump Republicans, Ben Sasse, to gauge his interest in serving as president \u2014 an indication the influential conservative think tank may turn away from its supportive posture toward the president. Sasse, who was elected to his first term in the Senate in 2014, has swatted down the overtures from Heritage\u2019s board of trustees, according to two sources familiar with the recruitment effort. The Nebraska senator rose to national prominence when he announced early in the primary calendar that he would support neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton, and he has been a persistent critic of Trump ever since.\u201d http://politi.co/2vmrlDU  -- \u201cSenior [EPA] official quits, decrying \u2018triumph of myth over truth,\u2019\u201d by E&E\u2019s Ariel Wittenberg: \u201cElizabeth \u2018Betsy\u2019 Southerland worked at EPA for 30 years, most recently directing the Office of Water\u2019s Office of Science and Technology. Southerland slammed Pruitt\u2019s EPA for launching a \u2018repeal, replace, modify initiative\u2019 for regulations. ... She also described President Trump\u2019s executive order requiring that agencies repeal two regulations for every new one as \u2018a real Sophie\u2019s choice for public health agencies like EPA.\u2019 She said, \u2018Should EPA repeal two existing rules protecting infants from neurotoxins in order to promulgate a new rule protecting adults from a newly discovered liver toxin?\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/2uUBCGP \u2026 Her exit memo http://bit.ly/2vi4k5h   M.I.A. -- \u201cTrump\u2019s CEO Brain Trust Comes Up Short on Big Ideas for Policies,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Matt Townsend, Shannon Pettypiece and Joe Deaux: \u201cElon Musk of Tesla and Walt Disney\u2019s Bob Iger have quit. Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon have dissented. President Donald Trump\u2019s business brain trust -- originally these executives, plus some 50 other chief executive officers chosen to help shape White House policy -- has so far come up short on big ideas. In fact, there\u2019s been little activity for the strategic and policy forum and the manufacturing group, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. After initial meetings early in Trump\u2019s presidency -- which the White House promoted with great fanfare -- his administration hasn\u2019t convened the groups for months or set firm dates for future meetings.\u201d https://bloom.bg/2u2MRhw   DOJ WATCH -- \u201cSessions offers rare warning on dangers of police misconduct,\u201d by Josh Gerstein: \u201cAs Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered his usual recitation of the ills of violence and drugs plaguing America Tuesday, he added in a problem he rarely brings up unprompted: police misconduct. Sessions often chastises others for badmouthing police and, indeed, his remarks to an African-American law enforcement group in Atlanta, included just such a passage. But what was more notable was his public acknowledgment that \u2018bad\u2019 officers were contributing to a lack of community trust.  \u201c\u2018We all know the cases of the last several years when in confrontations with police, lives have been cut short,\u2019 Sessions told the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives conference. \u2018Just as I\u2019m committed to defending law enforcement who lawfully have to use deadly force to defend themselves while engaged in their work, I will also use the power of the office I\u2019m entrusted with to hold any officer responsible who violates the law.\u2019 \u2018You know all it takes is for one bad officer to destroy the reputations of so many who work every day to build good relationships in these communities and who serve with honor and distinction,\u2019 Sessions added.\u201d http://politi.co/2u2saCl  COMING ATTRACTIONS -- \u201cJustice Dept. to Take On Affirmative Action in College Admissions,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Charlie Savage: \u201cThe Trump administration is preparing to redirect resources of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division toward investigating and suing universities over affirmative action admissions policies deemed to discriminate against white applicants, according to a document obtained by The New York Times.

The attorneys argued the inquiries were so inappropriate that they could have affected witnesses who testified before the grand jury, and thus the indictment against Schock should be thrown out. \u2018The government\u2019s inquiries into Mr. Schock\u2019s sexuality and romantic relationships were not just distasteful and offensive,\u2019 Schock\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u2018They were prejudicial.\u2019 A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Central District of Illinois, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment. \u2026  \u201c\u2018The government has investigated nearly every facet of Mr. Schock\u2019s professional, political, and personal life,\u2019 defense attorneys wrote. \u2018This even includes his sex life. It is no secret that there has long been speculative gossip in the media about Mr. Schock\u2019s sexual orientation.

As President, Trump has already made four visits to the club. He has his own cottage adjacent to the pool; it was recently given a secure perimeter by the Secret Service, leading to the inevitable joke that it\u2019s the only wall Trump has successfully built. Chatting with some members before a recent round of golf, he explained his frequent appearances: \u2018That White House is a real dump.\u2019 (A White House spokesperson denies this occurred.) \u2026  \u201cTrump favors the latest in TaylorMade equipment, owing to a long-standing friendship with Mark King, the company's former CEO. But when Prime Minister Abe gave Trump a gold-colored Honma Beres S-05 driver, it went straight into the bag. (Retail price of the club: $3,755. The gift was made in November, and as President-elect, Trump was permitted to accept a gift that he would not have been allowed to take after the inauguration; Presidents are forbidden from accepting a present from a foreign government with a value that exceeds $390.) \u2026 A Wall Street banker and member of a Trump club with knowledge of the financing of the $63 million Turnberry [Scotland] purchase expects the deal to be a subject of interest to special prosecutor Robert Mueller, given the foreign lenders he says were involved. ...  \u201c[F]or the President, politics and golf are now inextricably linked.

But for a would-be peacemaker, if you ignore history it will bury you. Israeli and Palestinian officials can overwhelm you with intricate stories about which patch of land belonged to whom when and who double-crossed whom in previous negotiating rounds.

HERE\u2019S AN IMPORTANT STORY that developed yesterday late in the day when we were in the Capitol: \u201cRepublicans ignore Trump\u2019s Obamacare taunts,\u201d by Burgess Everett and Jen Haberkorn: \u201cSenate Republicans have no plans to revive their party-line attempts to repeal Obamacare this summer, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing frustration over the chamber\u2019s failed attempts last week to gut the law.   \u201c\u2018Until somebody shows us a way to get that elusive 50th vote, I think it\u2019s over,\u2019 said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican. \u2018Maybe lightning will strike and something will come together but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\u2019 ... Privately, Republican aides said there is essentially no chance McConnell will take another shot at repealing Obamacare soon. On Monday, there was discussion among Senate staffers of a \u2018hard pivot to tax reform,\u2019 one Senate aide said. ...  Story Continued Below  \u201c\u2018Do I think we should stay on health care until we get it done? I think it\u2019s time to move on to something else. Come back to health care when we've had more time to get beyond the moment we\u2019re in and see if we can\u2019t put some wins on the board,\u2019 said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership. \u2018Tax reform, infrastructure are the kinds of things we ought to be looking at.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2vcYzpJ   -- IN OTHER WORDS, members of the Senate don\u2019t really care what the president says they ought to do. Period.   NYT\u2019S CARL HULSE: \u201cLesson for Trump: Hardball Against Senators Is a Game He Can Lose\u201d http://nyti.ms/2uQR2f0   **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh  A QUICK REMINDER -- When the White House tells us -- as they did yesterday -- that tax reform is going to be done by September or October, remember that neither chamber has passed a budget resolution. Tax reform is very hard without reconciliation instructions (just ask Rich Rubin and Phil Mattingly!). And, if you\u2019ve watched the squirming on, well, everything on the Hill, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that passing a budget isn\u2019t easy. This seems to be a bit lost on the White House. Oh, and by the way, in September and October, Congress also has to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling. This won't be quick and painless.  -- PLAYBOOK SCOOPLET: SPEAKER PAUL RYAN is wholeheartedly embracing the flood of outside group support for tax reform. From the speaker: \u201cIt is time to unleash the full potential of the American economy by creating a tax code that actually works for the middle class. A simpler, fairer tax system that puts working families first will strengthen our economy and generate more jobs. I am encouraged to see the Middle Class Growth Initiative, and American Action Network, working to give their voice to this critical issue, and I\u2019m pleased for such allies and supportive efforts.\u201d  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- WHAT HOUSE DEMOCRATS WANT 2018 TO LOOK LIKE -- MARK PUTNAM, the top-flight Democratic ad maker, has cut a spot for Ret. Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, who is running against Rep. Andy Barr in a solid Republican district in Kentucky. The spot tells the story of McGrath\u2019s career -- she was the first female Marine to fly in an F-18 in combat and flew in 89 missions bombing al Qaeda and the Taliban. The ad has some familiar themes: Barr -- who she says is Mitch McConnell\u2019s hand-picked congressman -- wants to take health care away from people, according to McGrath. But the spot also highlights another theme in 2018: House Democrats are especially interested in veterans jumping in the race. The imagery in this ad shows how they might employ military ties in the midterm.  \u201cThis is my new mission: to take on a Congress full of career politicians who treat the people of Kentucky like they\u2019re disposable. Some are telling me a Democrat can\u2019t win that battle in Kentucky. That we can\u2019t take back our country for my kids and yours. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d The ad ends showing her Marine dress uniform with all her medals, decorations and her personal sword, with the text \u201cAmy McGrath: Democrat for Congress\u201d on the screen. The two-minute spot  http://bit.ly/2vohv5j   BUT, BUT, BUT -- \u201cDemocrats snub new party message,\u201d by Gabe Debenedetti, Elana Schor, and Heather Caygle: \u201cChuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill will spend the next 15 months talking up the new \u2018Better Deal\u2019 economic message they unveiled last week. What\u2019s not clear is if anyone else will follow. The national party remains far from consensus on a unified message -- Democrats can\u2019t even agree on whether the party needs one. \u2026 [N]ot every incumbent wants to be associated with the party\u2019s message. And many of the party\u2019s influential constituent groups and moneyed organizations are busy pursuing their own messaging and branding initiatives, and remain in the early stages of their own investigations into what went wrong in November. Some \u2014 including the Democratic National Committee and individual state party committees \u2014 are busy preparing their own, independent lines of messaging.\u201d http://politi.co/2uTGyKi  BREAKING LATE MONDAY -- \u201cTrump dictated son\u2019s misleading statement on meeting with Russian lawyer,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Ashley Parker, Carol Leonnig, Phil Rucker and Tom Hamburger: \u201cOn the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany last month, President Trump\u2019s advisers discussed how to respond to a new revelation that Trump\u2019s oldest son had met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign \u2014 a disclosure the advisers knew carried political and potentially legal peril. The strategy, the advisers agreed, should be for Donald Trump Jr. to release a statement to get ahead of the story. They wanted to be truthful, so their account couldn\u2019t be repudiated later if the full details emerged.   \u201cBut within hours, at the president\u2019s direction, the plan changed. Flying home from Germany on July 8 aboard Air Force One, Trump personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said that he and the Russian lawyer had \u2018primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children\u2019 when they met in June 2016, according to multiple people with knowledge of the deliberations. The statement, issued to the New York Times as it prepared an article, emphasized that the subject of the meeting was \u2018not a campaign issue at the time.\u2019" http://wapo.st/2vnN67f    JOHN KELLY\u2019S DAY ONE -- \u201cKelly flexes muscle his first day on the job at White House,\u201d by AP\u2019s Vivian Salama and Jill Colvin: \u201cRaised voices could be heard through the thick door to the Oval Office as John Kelly \u2014 then secretary of Homeland Security \u2014 offered some tough talk to President Donald Trump. Kelly, a whip-cracking retired general who was sworn in as White House chief of staff on Monday, had demanded to speak to the president alone after Trump complained loudly that the U.S. was admitting travelers from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran and Haiti.   \u201cKelly first tried to explain to Trump that the admissions were standard \u2014 some people had legitimate reasons to visit the country \u2014 but the president insisted that it was making him look bad, according to an administration official familiar with the exchange about a month ago. Kelly then demanded that other advisers leave the room so he could speak to the president frankly. Trump refused at first, but agreed when Kelly insisted. It was an early indication that Kelly, a decorated retired Marine general who served three tours in Iraq, is not afraid to stand up to his commander-in-chief.\u201d http://bit.ly/2uTrrRl  \u2026 FOR THE RECORD -- \u201cKelly called Comey to express anger over firing, sources say,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz and Pamela Brown: \u201cNew White House chief of staff John Kelly was so upset with how President Donald Trump handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey that Kelly called Comey afterward and said he was considering resigning, according to two sources familiar with a conversation between Kelly and Comey. Both sources cautioned that it was unclear how serious Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, was about resigning himself. \u2018John was angry and hurt by what he saw and the way (Comey) was treated,\u2019 one of the sources said.\u201d http://cnn.it/2tTnfj1  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Driving Inclusive Growth: See where 20 countries stand in terms of opportunities for investing in technology that enhances inclusive economic growth. Learn more. ******  UNDERSTANDING KELLY \u2026   -- \u201cKelly\u2019s military approach to the media: The new chief of staff respects the press but will defer to his superior, Donald Trump,\u201d by Hadas Gold: \u201cShould Kelly be presented with a situation in which Trump wishes to ban an outlet from the White House, Kelly would likely carry out the president\u2019s directive, [longtime press aide David] Lapan said. \u2018I think he would push back against banning a reporter from the briefing room, but he also recognizes that ultimately the president is the decision-maker and there is a time to have internal discussions and disagreements,\u2019 Lapan said. \u2018But at the end of the day \u2026 Gen. Kelly is the one to carry out those orders and directions, but he certainly will have a say.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2vi8sC9   -- THE NEW BOSS -- \u201cKelly seizes control of the chaotic West Wing,\u201d by Andrew Restuccia, Josh Dawsey, Tara Palmeri and Darren Samuelsohn: \u201cJohn Kelly and Reince Priebus had a joint -- and brief -- meeting with senior staff on Kelly\u2019s first day in charge to talk about the changes afoot in the West Wing. By Monday afternoon, Kelly was meeting with staff again, this time without Priebus. Kelly assembled senior aides in his office and laid down his rules of the road: More accountability on how jobs are done. More limitations on access to the Oval Office. More structure. Better briefings and information for the president. A White House staff where everyone reports to Kelly. ... To both Scaramucci\u2019s ouster and the new ground rules there was no public dissent ... Internally, people saw Scaramucci\u2019s firing as a good thing, several West Wing aides said. ...  \u201cWhite House officials said Kelly is planning to lock down the Oval Office, restricting the number of aides and outside visitors who can wander in. One aide said Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner have agreed to follow Kelly\u2019s rules when it comes to visiting the Oval and sharing information with the president. \u2018They are going to actually report to him,\u2019 the aide said.\u201d http://politi.co/2tZ8LSK   WSJ EDITORIAL BOARD -- \u201cKelly Sends a Message: The new White House chief of staff gives the Mooch the boot\u201d: \u201cThe big questions about new White House chief of staff John Kelly are whether he can impose discipline on a chaotic staff, and whether President Trump will listen to him. After one day on the job, Mr. Kelly appears to be 2-0.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/2uf2tK2   THE PRESSURE IS ON -- Yes, John Kelly made a dramatic mark on his first day as chief of staff firing controversial communications director Anthony Scaramucci. He also laid down the law to White House staffers, publicly saying that there would be a new chain of command -- and he was at the top. The question remains whether Kelly can force order in an inherently chaotic environment. It also remains to be seen whether Kelly can actually stop top aides like Dan Scavino, Steve Bannon and others from going directly to Trump, not to mention Ivanka and Jared when they disagree with their new boss.  BIG QUESTIONS \u2026   -- WHO WILL BE THE NEXT COMMS DIRECTOR? Trump\u2019s White House has struggled to fill the communications director position since the beginning of this administration. Mike Dubke didn\u2019t last. Clearly, Scaramucci wasn\u2019t a good fit. It\u2019s unclear who Kelly will look to fill the critical role of trying to set the message for the administration. Several Republican sources floated BLAIN RETHMEIER as a potential replacement. Rethmeier, a veteran Republican communicator who has worked at trade associations and more recently at firms like Ditto PR and Edelman, has a relationship with Kelly. He was part of the sherpa team that helped get Kelly confirmed as DHS secretary. JASON MILLER is another communications vet who is perennially brought up to fill the top comms slot. Miller, who served as communications director of Trump\u2019s campaign, currently is a CNN contributor and works at Teneo Strategy. Neither Rethmeier nor Miller responded to a request for comment.  -- WHO WILL BE THE NEXT DHS SECRETARY? Republican sources said that the White House\u2019s focus is on getting the West Wing in order before turning to fill Kelly\u2019s slot at DHS. It\u2019s unclear whether Trump will want to continue with a military official in the position, or turn to a more political operator. Either way, multiple sources said Trump\u2019s operation wants someone who can be easily confirmed. House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas) is on the shortlist for Kelly replacements. He\u2019s got the experience and political chops. Others in the mix include: ICE acting director Thomas Homan and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, though Kobach would likely have a hard time getting confirmed.  -- NOT ON THE SHORT LIST: \u201c\u2018America\u2019s toughest sheriff\u2019 found guilty of criminal contempt,\u201d by Ted Hesson: \u201cA federal judge in Arizona found former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt on Monday for violating an order in a racial-profiling case. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton said the evidence in the case showed a \u2018flagrant disregard\u2019 for a 2011 court order that required the sheriff to stop detaining people unless they were suspected of a crime. The 85-year-old Arpaio, who lost a reelection bid last year, earned a reputation during his tenure for his tough stance against illegal immigration and headline-grabbing approach to criminal justice, dressing inmates in pink underwear and operating an open-air \u2018tent city\u2019 jail in the scorching Arizona heat.\u201d http://politi.co/2tY307Y  NOT THE ONION \u2013 JAKE TAPPER on CNN.com, \u201cWhite House officials tricked by email prankster\u201d: \u201cA self-described \u2018email prankster\u2019 in the UK fooled a number of White House officials into thinking he was other officials, including an episode where he convinced the White House official tasked with cyber security that he was Jared Kushner and received that official's private email address unsolicited. \u2018Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soire towards the end of August,\u2019 the fake Jared Kushner on an Outlook account wrote to the official White House email account of Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert. \u2018It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening.\u2019 Bossert wrote back: \u2018Thanks, Jared. With a promise like that, I can\u2019t refuse. Also, if you ever need it, my personal email is\u2019 (redacted). ...  \u201cMasquerading as Priebus, the prankster emailed Scaramucci\u2019s official account using a mail.com account on Saturday, the day after Priebus\u2019 resignation was announced. ... The very real Scaramucci responded: \u2018You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.\u2019 Fake Priebus wrote back: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called \u201cMooch\u201d, who can\u2019t even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake. I have nothing to apologize for.\u2019 Actual Scaramucci responded: \u2018Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.\u2019  \u201cIn another exchange, Scaramucci was hoodwinked by the same prankster pretending to be Ambassador to Russia-designate Jon Huntsman Jr. \u2026 After a few ... nice messages of support from faux Huntsman, Scaramucci wrote, \u2018Are you in Moscow now? If not please visit.\u2019\u201d http://cnn.it/2vcYYZh   WILD STORY -- \u201cCapitol Police Responded to Wrong Site in Scalise Shooting,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Billy House: \u201cThe U.S. Capitol Police department opened an internal investigation into why its elite tactical team was initially directed to respond to the wrong location when a gunman opened fire last month at a GOP congressional baseball practice, according to two people familiar with the matter. Instead of responding directly to the Virginia field where House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others were shot, members of the Capitol Police Containment and Emergency Response Team were signaled instead to go to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s house in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, several miles away.\u201d https://bloom.bg/2uSnJqZ   RETIREMENT WATCH -- TENNESSEE REPUBLICAN JIMMY DUNCAN is retiring at the end of this Congress. The seat has been represented by a Duncan since 1965: he has been in Congress since 1988, and his father represented the same district before that. The move wasn\u2019t wholly unexpected and Republican sources predict several more lawmakers to join Duncan and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) in not seeking reelection.   NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL -- \u201cMajority of voters believe White House is in chaos,\u201d by Steven Shepard: \u201cWhile President Donald Trump claimed early Monday in a tweet that there was no \u2018chaos\u2019 in his White House, voters disagree: 60 percent say the administration is running somewhat or very chaotically, compared to only 33 percent who say it is running well. That\u2019s according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted last Thursday through Saturday. The survey was conducted entirely prior to Monday\u2019s ouster of Anthony Scaramucci from his position as White House communications director, and was already in the field when Reince Priebus left the chief of staff position.  \u201cIn general, voters have a low opinion of how Trump\u2019s White House is operating. Fewer voters, 29 percent, say Trump\u2019s staff serves him well than the 39 percent who say his staff doesn\u2019t serve him well. Republican voters have a much more positive impression of how Trump\u2019s White House is operating: 63 percent say it is running well, though more than a third, 34 percent, say it is running chaotically. By comparison, very few Democrats (12 percent) or independents (25 percent) say Trump's White House is running well -- with 80 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents saying it is beset by chaos.\u201d http://politi.co/2uP9NzO  NEW ISAAC DOVERE PODCAST -- ISAAC DOVERE spoke to DEVAL PATRICK in his Bain Capital office in the John Hancock tower in Boston. \u201cBarack Obama is nudging him to run.

Putin bet that Donald J. Trump, who had spoken fondly of Russia and its authoritarian leader for years, would treat his nation as Mr. Putin has longed to have it treated by the West. That is, as the superpower it once was, or at least a major force to be reckoned with, from Syria to Europe, and boasting a military revived after two decades of neglect. That bet has now backfired, spectacularly. If the sanctions overwhelmingly passed by Congress last week sent any message to Moscow, it was that Mr. Trump\u2019s hands are now tied in dealing with Moscow, probably for years to come. ...  \u201c[I]t is unclear how much the announcement will affect day-to-day relations. While the Russian news media said 755 diplomats would be barred from working, and presumably expelled, there do not appear to be anything close to 755 American diplomats working in Russia.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2uPF2Jh   -- ASHLEY PARKER in Tallinn, Estonia, with VP Mike Pence: \u201cVice President Pence touched down in Estonia on Sunday\u2026 and said he came bearing a message from the president: \u2018Russia\u2019s destabilizing activities, its support for rogue regimes, its activities in Ukraine, are unacceptable.\u2019 \u2026   \u201c[P]ence reaffirmed the president\u2019s decision to sign the sanctions bill but also held out the possibility that the implementation of the penalties \u2026 might actually improve relations between the two countries, saying he and Trump \u2018expect Russian behavior to change.\u2019 \u2018The president and I remain very hopeful that we\u2019ll see different behavior by the Russian government, with regard to Ukraine, with regard to supporting rogue regimes in Iran and North Korea,\u2019 Pence said. \u2018We continue to believe that if Russia will change its behavior, our relationship can change for the good and improve for the interests in both of our countries and the interest of peace and stability in this region and around the world.\u2019\u201d http://wapo.st/2vXItOm   ANOTHER BIG SUSAN GLASSER GET -- INTERVIEW WITH LEBANESE PM SAAD HARIRI -- \u201cWhy the Middle East Hated Obama But Loves Trump\u201d -- \u201cThe tone was measured, but taken together his comments amount to a striking and stark indictment of Obama and much recent U.S. policy in the Middle East. \u2018The unfortunate consequence of not acting\u2019 there, Hariri argues, has been Russia\u2019s restoration as a regional heavyweight, the resurrection of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s bloody regime in Syria and the failure to produce an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.  \u201c\u2018Clarity,\u2019 the prime minister says, and the hope for a more decisive approach is the reason why he and other Arab leaders prefer Trump, despite the bombast and uncertainty the first six months of his presidency has unleashed. Unstated, but by all accounts just as significant, is the expectation that Trump will take a more hawkish approach toward Syria\u2019s backers in Iran, and Hariri repeatedly brought up concessions Obama made toward Tehran to get his nuclear deal as an example of how the U.S. lost its way in the region.\u201d http://politi.co/2tQKSIW \u2026 Transcript http://politi.co/2vaA8sR   A BLINK OF BIPARTISANSHIP -- THE LATEST ON HEALTH CARE -- \u201cCentrist lawmakers plot bipartisan health care stabilization bill,\u201d by Heather Caygle and Paul Demko: \u201cA coalition of roughly 40 House Republicans and Democrats plan to unveil a slate of Obamacare fixes Monday they hope will gain traction after the Senate\u2019s effort to repeal the law imploded. The Problem Solvers caucus, led by Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), is fronting the effort to stabilize the ACA markets, according to multiple sources. But other centrist members, including Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), and several other lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition and the GOP\u2019s moderate Tuesday Group are also involved.  \u201cTheir plan focuses on immediately stabilizing the insurance market and then pushing for Obamacare changes that have received bipartisan backing in the past. The most significant proposal is funding for Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies. Insurers rely on these payments \u2013 estimated to be $7 billion this year \u2013 to reduce out-of-pocket costs for their poorest Obamacare customers.\u201d http://politi.co/2vdbyY7  -- WILL ANYTHING COME OF THIS? We'll see. This is just a House effort, at the moment. Senators are also in talks, and discussing options with the White House. Therein lies the problem: there is lots of talk, and much of it uncoordinated. But it shows that there is interest on both sides of the aisle in getting something done on health care. The problem, though, is conservative Republicans want the law gutted. But if enough middle-of-the-road lawmakers band together for changes, it could marginalize the wings.

Last week they were blindsided by the president\u2019s tweet saying he planned to ban transgender people from serving in the military, according to several White House aides, a major coup for conservatives who had been quietly lobbying the administration on the issue for months. ... Ivanka Trump ... learned of the decision when she saw her father\u2019s tweet on her phone. ...   \u201cMeanwhile, she desperately wants to lower expectations of what she can achieve in an administration where she views herself as one person on a large team -- even though other White House officials said she still has access to the president whenever she desires it. ... Ivanka Trump is aware she needs a real win -- not just starting a conversation about paid family leave that may or may not materialize in a final budget -- to win back credibility.\u201d http://politi.co/2hePsiB   THE BACKSTORY -- \u201cFor Trump and Sessions, a warm beginning turned into an icy standoff,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Sari Horwitz and Bob Costa: \u201cOne recent evening, Sessions and his wife, Mary, went to dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse of his old friend Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). Over pork brisket and banana pudding, Sessions and his wife chatted with Cornyn and his wife, Sandy, about their families and mutual friends.   \u201cBut when Cornyn asked the attorney general about his new job as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, his friend seemed a little dispirited. \u2018He came into the office with a clear agenda and ideas about what he wanted to do as attorney general,\u2019 Cornyn said in an interview. \u2018There\u2019s a lot of work to do, and there\u2019s not a lot of support there for him yet. He expressed his frustration with being distracted from that mission that he had so clearly in mind.\u2019  \u201cPeople close to Sessions say he has been hurt by the president\u2019s barbs and cold shoulder but is hoping the storm will pass. Trump\u2019s clash with Sessions mirrors bitter fights he has had with executives at the Trump Organization, according to veteran Trump watchers. ... Since March, Sessions has been trying to \u2018compartmentalize\u2019 the tension with the president, one person close to the attorney general said. He comes to work at 6 a.m. and works late, methodically moving forward with his conservative agenda to crack down on illegal immigration, provide more support to state and local law enforcement, and overhaul the criminal justice policies of the Obama administration.\u201d http://wapo.st/2vkkWKl  THE LONG WAR -- \u201cWhite House Looks at Scaling Back U.S. Military Presence in Afghanistan,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Dion Nissenbaum: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reservations about sending more troops to Afghanistan have triggered a new exploration of an option long considered unlikely: withdrawal. Unable to agree on a plan to send up to 3,900 more American forces to help turn back Taliban advances in Afghanistan, the White House is taking a new look at what would happen if the U.S. decided to scale back its military presence instead, according to current and former Trump administration officials. \u2018It\u2019s a macro question as to whether the U.S., this administration, and this president are committed to staying,\u2019 one senior administration official said. \u2018It doesn\u2019t work unless we are there for a long time, and if we don\u2019t have the appetite to be there a long time, we should just leave.

Trump\u2019s aides met over the weekend and will continue the discussions on Monday, with a final decision expected as soon as this week, the officials said. They said there are a range of options on the table, including trade restrictions. Other possibilities include economic sanctions.

Today she is the Washington-bureau chief of the Times. \u2018There\u2019s a relentlessness to it that\u2019s new,\u2019 she told me.

His story, in a way, is the story of the Republican Party itself: His initial wariness of Trump gave way to capitulation and then enabling.

This liberated him to say whatever he pleased as a candidate, and, by firing Priebus, Trump might feel similarly liberated.   \u201cThe fear now, among Republicans in his administration and on Capitol Hill, is that Trump will turn against the party, waging rhetorical warfare against a straw-man GOP whom he blames for the legislative failures and swamp-stained inertia that has bedeviled his young presidency.

Trump, increasingly impatient with the long-stalled repeal effort, met with three Senate Republicans about a new plan to roll back the health care law on Friday, signaling some lawmakers -- as well as the president -- are not ready to ditch their seven-year campaign promise.  \u201cThe group is trying to write legislation that could get 50 Republican votes, according to multiple administration and Capitol Hill sources. The proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) would block grant federal health care funding to the states and keep much of Obamacare\u2019s tax regime. White House officials also met with House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) to brainstorm how to make the idea palatable to conservatives, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.\u201d http://politi.co/2tNTxf7  -- ONE CONSERVATIVE said to us the other day that Obamacare is a tax bill -- even the Supreme Court said so.

IF TRUMP follows through on his threat to end the employer contribution for members of Congress, that would be a big deal, and could strip lawmakers of one of the only appealing benefits of their job. ALSO: Congress has to fund the government at the end of September and lift the debt ceiling shortly after that. Not passing anything until Obamacare is repealed and replaced is not necessarily a realistic position.  -- @burgessev: \u201cHistorically, conservatives use filibuster to block progressive legislation.

With his poll numbers at historic lows, his legislative agenda stalled and his advisers busy plotting against one another, Mr. Trump hoped to regain momentum by pushing out his top aide, Reince Priebus, and installing a retired four-star Marine general, John F. Kelly, to take command. But it is far from certain that the move will be enough to tame a dysfunctional White House.  \u201cThe shake-up followed a week that saw the bombastic, with-me-or-against-me president defied as never before by Washington and its institutions, including Republicans in Congress, his own attorney general, the uniformed military leadership, police officers and even the Boy Scouts. No longer daunted by a president with a Twitter account that he uses like a Gatling gun, members of his own party made clear that they were increasingly willing to stand against him on issues like health care and Russia. The setbacks came against the backdrop of a West Wing at war with itself, egged on by a president who thrives on conflict and chaos. Mr. Kelly, who had been serving as secretary of homeland security, brings a career of decisive leadership to his new assignment as White House chief of staff. But he confronts multiple power centers among presidential aides, all with independent lines to the man in the Oval Office who resists the discipline and structure favored by generals.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2wbgNog  THE KELLY LOOKAHEADS \u2026  WAPO\u2019S PHIL RUCKER, BOB COSTA and DAN BALZ: \u201cTrump enlists Kelly to enforce order, but can the \u2018zoo\u2019 be tamed?\u201d: \u201cWhen Kelly made the rounds on Capitol Hill before his nomination hearings in January, he did not know Trump very well and asked people there to share stories about the president-elect. He wanted to know how Trump made decisions. Told that Trump relished competing power centers around him, Kelly grimaced and said nothing. ...  \u201cTrump\u2019s transition documents included a lengthy memo about White House structure, based on past administrations. \u2018They didn\u2019t follow the product at all,\u2019 said a person with direct knowledge of what transpired as Trump was setting up his administration. \u2018They did it instinctively \u2026 The president-elect didn\u2019t want to say no to anybody.\u2019 The result was the White House that now exists, populated by advisers with competing ideologies that reflect an administration that is an amalgam of populist nationalists, hard-line conservatives and establishment Republicans \u2014 and a few Democrats. \u2026  \u201cThe environment is poised to change in the Kelly era. The new chief of staff is expected to have full control over the Oval Office and schedule, officials said. Trusted aides such as Hope Hicks, Dan Scavino and Keith Schiller -- as well as senior advisers such as Kushner, Bannon and Conway -- will continue to have casual access to the president.\u201d http://wapo.st/2tNL0cg  ANDREW RESTUCCIA, BRYAN BENDER and JOSH DAWSEY: \u201cKelly\u2019s first task: Stabilize the West Wing: The no-nonsense retired Marine Corps general will soon be thrust into the center of the West Wing soap opera\u201d: \u201cWhen he officially becomes chief of staff on Monday, Kelly, a no-nonsense retired Marine Corps general, will be thrust into the center of the West Wing soap opera, where President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda regularly gets preempted by feuding advisers and headline-grabbing scandals. ... \u2018I think this is the best and last shot,\u2019 said one person close to Kelly. \u2018This is it.\u2019 ...  \u201cKelly wants to have more of a pecking order among the staff and a more \u2018traditional\u2019 approach, one White House official said. But others in the White House said it\u2019s too early to make predictions. \u2018Everything is up in the air. Anyone who tells you they know anything is lying,\u2019 a White House official said. ... Kelly has built relationships with several top White House aides in recent months, including chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who have played a central role in Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.  \u201cKelly has nonetheless expressed frustration about the White House to friends and associates, complaining about the slow pace of hiring and bristling at having to answer to lower-level aides, according to one person who has spoken to him and another person familiar with the tension. ... Asked to name any similarities between the two men, the person said, \u2018They\u2019re both Catholic, but that\u2019s probably about it.\u2019 ... Kelly is expected to make his first staff change at the White House on Monday, when he\u2019ll bring in Kirstjen Nielsen, his chief of staff at DHS.\u201d http://politi.co/2tTD0KV  THE NEVER ENDING CAMPAIGN -- \u201cHow 2018 became the new 2020,\u201d by Gabe Debenedetti: \u201cThe 2020 Democratic presidential road show is already underway. And 2018 is beginning to look like the dress rehearsal. Top contenders are making endorsements, picking sides in party primaries and aggressively working the fundraising circuit on behalf of 2018 candidates, all the while building their own name recognition. With many of presidential prospects on the ballot themselves next year, potential challengers to Donald Trump are also stockpiling cash to help run up their re-election margins to burnish their stature for the big election on the horizon.  \u201cThe early focus on the midterms is a marked departure from previous practice, and a further acceleration of the presidential campaign cycle. Prior to the 2016 presidential primary season, for example, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders largely stayed off the campaign trail and out of elections until late 2014 \u2014 roughly six months before they officially announced their campaigns. But with a historically large presidential field taking shape, more than a dozen prominent Democrats \u2014 including governors like Terry McAuliffe and Steve Bullock, and senators like Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris \u2014 have recognized the need to distinguish themselves from the crowd. And they are already working hard to advance their brand while helping to reinvigorate the dilapidated party infrastructure in advance of the midterm elections.\u201d http://politi.co/2viPoo7  TRUMP is at his Virginia golf resort this morning, per the pool.  -- @markknoller: \u201cBy my count, it\u2019s his 36th visit to one of his golf clubs, 15th time at the one in Sterling, VA - since taking office.\u201d  VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE is in Tallinn, Estonia. Pence chief of staff Nick Ayers alerted staff and reporters on the trip that Jarrod Agen, communications director, had been promoted to deputy chief of staff, according to pooler Ashley Parker of the Washington Post.  IN MOSCOW \u2026 -- \u201cThe Kremlin is done betting on Trump and planning how to strike back against U.S. sanctions,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Andrew Roth in Moscow: \u201cRegardless of whether the Kremlin believes its own denials of interfering in the 2016 elections, there is one undeniable truth: Russia is now Washington\u2019s greatest political foe. Understanding that President Trump is \u2018tied hand and foot,\u2019 as one foreign policy hawk here put it, Moscow is weighing options for retaliation.  \u201cAfter a dalliance on the Trump train, Russia is once again channeling the ruthless realism that drives its political id, and embracing its role as antihero. \u2018Okay, you think we\u2019re bad guys, we\u2019re going to be bad guys, and we\u2019ll see whether you like it or not,\u2019 said Konstantin Eggert, a television political commentator, describing the Kremlin thinking.\u201d http://wapo.st/2tUhg1k  RUSSIAN DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI RYABKOV on potential retaliation as because of new U.S. sanctions to ABC\u2019S MARTHA RADDATZ: \u201cIf the U.S. side decides to move further towards further deterioration we will answer, we will respond in kind. We will mirror this. \u2026 \u201cI can assure you that different options are on the table and consideration is being given to all sorts of things, both symmetrical or asymmetrical to use a very popular word in the world of diplomacy.\u201d  FOR YOUR RADAR -- AP: \u201cU.S. bombers fly over South Korea after North\u2019s 2nd ICBM test\u201d: \u201cThe United States flew two supersonic bombers over the Korean Peninsula on Sunday in a show of force against North Korea following the country\u2019s latest intercontinental ballistic missile test. The U.S. also said it conducted a successful test of a missile defense system located in Alaska. The B-1 bombers were escorted by South Korean fighter jets as they performed a low-pass over an air base near the South Korean capital of Seoul before returning to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, the U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement. \u2026  \u201c\u2018North Korea remains the most urgent threat to regional stability,\u2019 said Gen. Terrence J. O\u2019Shaughnessy, Pacific Air Forces commander. \u201cDiplomacy remains the lead. However, we have a responsibility to our allies and our nation to showcase our unwavering commitment while planning for the worst-case scenario.\u2019 \u2018If called upon, we are ready to respond with rapid, lethal, and overwhelming force at a time and place of our choosing,\u2019 O\u2019Shaughnessy said.\u201d http://bit.ly/2hcLebc  SUNDAY BEST \u2026  -- HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI defends her leadership to CHRIS WALLACE on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d -- \u201cI am a master legislator. I know the budget to the nth degree. I know the motivation of people I respect the people who are in Congress. I think this is a great moment for those of us who understand what is at stake with the Affordable Care Act \u2013 what our possibilities are in terms of working together with the Republicans as has been our experience in the past.

I\u2019ve worked with him as Secretary Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security. So I will be speaking with him today. We look forward to working together. It\u2019s a very important position \u2013 the President\u2019s chief of staff to the President of the United States. And it has to be recognized that he is the chief of staff.\u201d  -- HHS SECRETARY TOM PRICE talks with CHUCK TODD on NBC\u2019S \u201cMEET THE PRESS: TODD: \u201cSo if they come up with a fix that helps, essentially gives some certainty to the insurance companies to go into rural markets, are you then going to implement the Affordable Care Act as it was meant to be, including encouraging people to sign up, encouraging enrollment, encouraging Medicaid expansion?\u201d PRICE: \u201cWell, our, as I said, our responsibility is to follow the law and again we take that responsibility very seriously and we will continue to do so. But remember that the current law right now is failing the American people. As I mentioned, I think, we\u2019ve got 40 counties across this \u2013 40 counties that will no longer have any insurance company next year.  \u201cThat\u2019s not a choice for anybody. You\u2019ve got a third of the counties right now that only have one insurance company providing coverage. That\u2019s not a choice for anybody. You\u2019ve got premiums that are up, deductibles that are up, people having that insurance card and no care, got insurers fleeing the market. 83 insurance companies fled the health insurance market last year. That\u2019s before this administration came in. This system is imploding upon itself and that's what we\u2019re trying to care of. That\u2019s what the president has said. That\u2019s why we need repeal and replace.\u201d  -- PRICE to ABC\u2019S MARTHA RADDATZ on \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d -- TRUMP DOESN\u2019T REALLY WANT TO LET OBAMACARE EXPLODE: RADDATZ: \u201cBut he says... -- let it -- let Obamacare implode, then deal. What does that mean?\u201d PRICE: \u201cWell, I -- again, I think what that does is punctuate the seriousness with which he understands the American people are having to deal with the current situation.\u201d  -- OMB DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY talks with CNN\u2019S JAKE TAPPER on \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION\u201d -- TAPPER: \u201cWhen General Kelly is sworn in on Monday as White House chief of staff, will all staff members immediately begin reporting to him?\u201d MULVANEY: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I answer to the chief of staff. And I will continue to do that. The Office of Management and Budget actually reports directly to the chief of staff. Obviously, we answer to the president, as everybody does in the West Wing. But, as far as I know, my reporting doesn\u2019t change, nor do I have any reason for it to change. So, we will continue to do our business at OMB the same way we did last week. I think we\u2019re doing some good work, and look forward to continuing that under General Kelly\u2019s leadership.\u201d  FUN -- NYT\u2019s NEW PODCAST \u2013 Per The Times: \u201c[W]e published the first episode of \u2018The New Washington,\u2019 a new limited-run politics podcast that takes you inside Trump\u2019s Washington.

But people like Carten Schurman need just a few minutes to raise doubts about that claim. Schurman, a professor of computer science at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, used a laptop\u2019s Wi-Fi connection Friday to gain access to the type of voting machine that Fairfax County, Virginia, used until just two years ago. Nearby, other would-be hackers took turns trying to poke into a simulated election computer network resembling the one used by Cook County, Illinois.  \u201cElsewhere, a gaggle of hackers went to work on a model still used in parts of seven states, as well as all of the state of Nevada. Though the device was supposedly wiped before it was sold by the government at auction, the hackers were able to uncover the results the machine tallied in 2002. They were among the hundreds of cybersecurity experts who descended on \u2018Voting Village,\u2019 one of the most talked-about features of the annual DEF CON hacker conference. In a cramped conference room, they took turns over three days cracking into 10 examples of voting machines and voter registration systems \u2014 a reminder, they say, of the risks awaiting upcoming U.S. elections.\u201d http://politi.co/2eYkwSM  BONUS GREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman, filing from the Deutsche Bahn ICE train from Munich to Berlin, where he\u2019s attending the American Council of Germany\u2019s American-German Young Leaders Conference:  --\u201cScott Pruitt\u2019s Crimes Against Nature,\u201d by Jeff Goodell in Rolling Stone: \u201cTrump\u2019s EPA chief is gutting the agency, defunding science and serving the fossil-fuel industry.\u201d http://rol.st/2uCAUhf  --\u201cPatagonia\u2019s Big Business of #Resist,\u201d by Abe Streep in Outside Magazine: \u201cThe iconic brand has long been the conscience of the outdoor industry, forsaking hefty profits to do the right thing.

He lost his cool when other West Wing staffers knew things that he didn\u2019t, and he would call people who had spoken to the president to ask them what Trump had told them. He would run from meeting to meeting trying not to miss anything. He would corner people who criticized him publicly and ask them to stop \u2013 but admit the criticisms were close to accurate. ... Trump never seemed to fully trust Priebus ... And he never fully empowered him, softly undermining him by calling him \u2018Reince-y\u2019 and making strange asides, officials said.  \u201cAt one point, he told associates that Priebus would make a good car salesman. At another, he mocked him for expressing excitement when he spotted his house from Air Force One, flying over Wisconsin. Trump exacerbated Priebus\u2019 status by frequently complaining about him to other staffers and outside advisers ... His press shop was criticized for fighting for protecting Priebus in the press over other staffers and the president. For some, defending him was just an old habit. One senior administration official even called the communications office\u2019s fixation with defending Priebus an \u2018inappropriate use of government funds.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2uGDjaA  **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh   -- WASHINGTON POST: Phil Rucker, Abby Phillip, Bob Costa and Ashley Parker: \u201cTrump first tried to offer the chief of staff job to Kelly in mid-May, according to two people familiar with their discussions. Kelly told the president that he was flattered, but declined, saying he still had more to accomplish beefing up national security and improving immigration enforcement. ...  \u201cAllies to Priebus said he told them he had resigned because the internal chaos had become \u2018unsustainable,\u2019 and that he felt demeaned by the president\u2019s treatment of him. One friend said Priebus told him he was frustrated that he could not assert control over basic White House functions, such as policy development, communications and even formal announcements ... His exit was described by one Republican strategist as \u2018the red wedding,\u2019 a reference to a mass-murder blood bath episode of HBO\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019 ...  \u201c\u2018It reached a fever pitch of the president complaining about Reince to all of us,\u2019 said one senior White House official ... \u2018If we heard it once, we heard it 20 times in the last week -- this erosion of confidence. The word was \u2018weak\u2019 -- \u2018weak,\u2019 \u2018weak,\u2019 \u2018weak.\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t get it done.\u2019 ... Trump\u2019s demeaning of Priebus came through in other ways, too. At one point, during a meeting in the Oval Office, a fly began buzzing overhead, distracting the president. As the fly continued to circle, Trump summoned his chief of staff and tasked him with killing the insect, according to someone familiar with the incident. (The West Wing has a regular fly problem.) ...  \u201cInside the White House, Priebus\u2019 rivals tried to sow doubts about Priebus\u2019 loyalty. Any negative mention of Priebus in a news story -- even a single sentence or mere clause -- would often elicit frantic phone calls from more junior staffers, the sort of vigorous defense in the media the president came to believe was not afforded to him. The impression within the White House -- that Priebus was most concerned with defending his own image -- further undercut his standing with Trump and the president\u2019s family.\u201d http://wapo.st/2tLf7Bi  TOP TWEETS -- @JohnJHarwood: \u201cRyan-Priebus ally tells me Trump is moving toward \u2018an independent WH\u2019 untethered from the Republican Party\u201d \u2026@codykeenan: \u201c\u2018Hello, Reince?

John Kelly, can calm the famously mercurial president and defuse the rivalries among staff\u201d: \u201cSenior West Wing officials said they believe Kelly would be far better at imposing some discipline on Trump, who never much listened to Priebus and even mocked him as \u2018not a five-star general\u2019 to the New York Times. ... Officials said late Friday they hoped Kelly would also have more respect from Trump because of his military background. And they say Trump behaves differently when he\u2019s around people he trusts. But they also feared that Kelly possesses limited political instincts\u2014but \u2018he\u2019s now in a very political job,\u2019 one White House official said. ...  \u201cWhite House aides are trying to decide to resuscitate the health care fight later this year, senior officials said. ... What is most frustrating, West Wing officials and advisers say, is that there never seems to be a week that goes without major hiccups or controversies. Hill aides say it is perplexing how much drama the White House can create. \u2018So much drama every day,\u2019 one person said. \u2018Can you even imagine them having an on-topic press conference and making the headlines they wanted?\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2eULgnq  -- \u201cJohn Kelly, New Chief of Staff, Is Seen as Beacon of Discipline,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Ron Nixon and Mike Shear: \u201cPresident Trump frequently referred to John F. Kelly as one of \u2018my generals,\u2019 the three senior military leaders he recruited for his team. On Friday, Mr. Trump decided to see whether Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, could impose a new sense of discipline on an unruly and chaotic West Wing. Mr. Kelly, who became a star in Mr. Trump\u2019s eyes for overseeing immigration policy as secretary of homeland security, will become the president\u2019s second chief of staff. \u2026 The square-jawed Mr. Kelly, the first general to hold the chief of staff position since Alexander M. Haig during the Nixon administration, will be an imposing and strait-laced figure in a West Wing filled with constantly warring aides and advisers, most of whom came to Washington with virtually no experience in federal government before Mr. Trump\u2019s victory last year.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2uLYWog  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Driving Inclusive Growth: See where 20 countries stand in terms of opportunities for investing in technology that enhances inclusive economic growth. Learn more. ******  THE BIG QUESTION -- Will Trump give Kelly the authority to impose discipline on the West Wing, or is this just a rearranging of the deck chairs? Typically, the chief of staff is the sole gatekeeper to the president. So far, Trump has chosen a very different leadership style. Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s recent comments that he answers directly to Trump undercut the argument that Kelly will be able to bring order and a chain of command to the administration. Is Kelly really going to be able to put limits on Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner\u2019s interactions with or limit their influence on the president? Will \u201cwalk in privileges\u201d to President Trump\u2019s office go away?  -- ALSO many members of Congress had Priebus as their chief contact in the administration. If they needed something, they went to Reince. At DHS, Kelly was a principal. Now he\u2019s an aide. It will be interesting to see how he adapts to that -- and how the Hill adapts to him.  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Growing disparities in income and more are among today\u2019s greatest socio-economic challenges.

Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, emerging as a leading candidate. Other potential picks include Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who accompanied Trump on Air Force One on Friday, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach ...

By almost every objective measure -- especially compared with 2009, the last time one party had control of the White House and both congressional chambers -- it is off to a dismal start.  \u201cNot only have lawmakers been unable to notch major accomplishments on health care or tax reform, but there are also fewer votes, fewer nominees confirmed, and fewer bills passed, according to a Globe review of congressional records of previous eras when the same party controlled the House, Senate, and White House.  \u201cToday\u2019s members of Congress are generally just not as active as their predecessors, according to another key measure. Through June, there were 9,247 pages of proceedings, which are the recordings of the daily business of Congress.

But their teaming only made sense if the new president was willing to listen \u2013 and learn. \u2026  \u201cIt is a truism of White House management that presidents get the chiefs of staff they want, at least as often as the ones they need. Early in his first term, Bill Clinton chose his boyhood friend Thomas \u2018Mack\u2019 McLarty, a pliable figurehead, because he wanted to function as his own chief of staff. Richard Nixon chose the crew-cut enforcer H.R. Haldeman to instill fear and deliver the bad news that Nixon himself often shrank from imparting.  \u201cIn Priebus, Trump first tried the kind of low-key, steady hand that what\u2019s left of the GOP establishment thought he needed as a novice politician.

aV \u000a            By JAKE SHERMAN (sherman@politico.com; @JakeSherman), ANNA PALMER (anna@politico.com; @apalmerdc) and  DANIEL LIPPMAN (daniel@politico.com; @dlippman)  07/28/2017 06:42 AM EDT  Good Friday morning. WELL, THAT\u2019S THAT...FOR NOW. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) voted \u201cno\u201d early Friday morning on a \u201cskinny\u201d Obamacare repeal bill -- an effort Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, framed as the way to begin a negotiation between the House and Senate on a large health care package. McCain and Murkowski have been targets of Trump\u2019s scorn in the last year or so.  THERE WAS PLENTY OF LATE-NIGHT DRAMA. GREAT TIDBITS from Seung Min Kim, Burgess Everett and Jen Haberkorn: \u201cThe president made a last-ditch effort, calling [McCain] on the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal measure, as the bill\u2019s fate hung in the balance, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. After Pence had spent about 20 minutes working McCain, the senator went off the floor to speak with Trump by phone, those sources said. ... \u2018I thought it was the right vote,\u2019 McCain told reporters as he left the Capitol. \u2018I do my job as a senator.\u2019 ...  Story Continued Below  \u201cBut his mind wouldn\u2019t change. McCain walked over to a gaggle of Senate Democrats and told them that he would be voting no on the Obamacare repeal measure. His mind had already sped ahead to what was next: the National Defense Authorization Act, a top priority for the Armed Services Committee chairman. \u2018Let\u2019s get this over with,\u2019 McCain told the cluster of Democrats, according to senators. \u2018I really want to do NDAA.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2h8bFih   -- Before the final vote was called, McCain walked to the Democratic side of the aisle and spoke to a happy Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and embraced Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Pence, who was standing by to cast a tiebreaking vote, was not presiding over the Senate during the final tally -- an ominous sign.

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CONN.) (@ChrisMurphyCT): \u201cI ran into John McCain as we walked underground to the Senate for the final vote.

John McCain cast the deciding vote to sink his fellow Republicans\u2019 so-called \u2018skinny repeal\u2019 of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d http://bit.ly/2vOZfPn   -- WHAT MCCAIN SAID: \u201cWe must now return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation\u2019s governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people. We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve.\u201d  --Drudge banner, \u201cTHE END -- MCCAIN KILLS REPEAL\u201d ...

Post cover, \u201cSURVIVOR WHITE HOUSE\u201d http://bit.ly/2tP12GI   REACTION FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP -- at 2:25 a.m.: \u201c3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\u201d  A FEW TAKEAWAYS: Health care is a very tricky topic, and there\u2019s very little agreement among Republicans on the key issues like Medicaid and coverage. Legislating takes time and effort. Artificial deadlines don\u2019t help. The president needs allies, not skeptics and enemies on Capitol Hill. Shifting responses on Russia, constant chatter about the outcome of the 2016 election and berating your attorney general and members of Congress haven\u2019t been helpful for the president, broadly speaking. The president has to learn to be nice to members of Congress. That\u2019s all part of the game. It\u2019s not always fun. But that\u2019s the way to win. Not many people are interested in fighting for the president and taking tough votes for him at this point. Right now, Trump has just one major Capitol Hill win: a new Supreme Court justice.  WHERE DO THINGS GO FROM NOW? It is not completely clear. Talk to Hill Republicans and the big problem is this: House Republicans do not believe Senate Republicans can pass anything substantial -- period. And the idea that a bi-cameral negotiation -- called a \u201cconference committee\u201d -- would have somehow produced a compromise was also a bit of a fantasy.   WILL REPUBLICANS GIVE UP ON HEALTH CARE? No, almost definitely not. Repealing and replacing Obamacare is still the party\u2019s central tenet -- and has been for nearly a decade. But it will have to start anew, now. And it will continue to eat up much of the party\u2019s time and energy on Capitol Hill. Obamacare was on life support many times in 2009-2010. Democrats eventually got it through. THE LIKELIHOOD? A package of fixes from Republicans. Dismantling or fixing -- depending on your political orientation -- piece by piece. There will definitely be a push to starve the law of funding.   HOUSE REPUBLICANS have a 9 a.m. closed party meeting this morning. There\u2019s no reason why they\u2019ll stay for the weekend, but some might want to. TOP REPUBLICANS believe it\u2019s incumbent on the Senate to come up with something it can pass.   ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Driving Inclusive Growth: See where 20 countries stand in terms of opportunities for investing in technology that enhances inclusive economic growth. Learn more. ******  WELL, WELCOME TO AUGUST. Washington hasn\u2019t accomplished anything on health care, infrastructure, government spending, the debt ceiling or taxes. As we\u2019ve been telling you, health care will stretch into the fall, and could damage the chance for tax reform. We\u2019re about two months away from a government shutdown, and not that far out from defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt.  THE WORST SCENARIO FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS -- A bipartisan deal on health care emerges from the Senate. It would deeply divide the House, which is more conservative and factional than the Senate.  FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: House Republican leaders raised $515,000 this week at a fundraiser for House Majority Leader Steve Scalise\u2019s leadership fund.   WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT -- RYAN LIZZA on NewYorker.com, \u201cAnthony Scaramucci Called Me to Unload About White House Leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon\u201d: \u201c\u2018What I\u2019m going to do is, I will eliminate everyone in the comms team and we\u2019ll start over,\u2019 he said. ... \u2018They\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u2019 he said. \u2018I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u2019 The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner [with Sean Hannity and Bill Shine] because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u2018Reince is a f***ing paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u2019 Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c\u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the f***ing thing and see if I can c***-block these people the way I c***-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\u201d   \u201cScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u2018I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own c**k,\u2019 he said ... \u2018I\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the f***ing strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u2019 (Bannon declined to comment.) He reiterated that Priebus would resign soon, and he noted that he told Trump that he expected Priebus to launch a campaign against him. \u2018He didn\u2019t get the hint that I was reporting directly to the President,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I said to the President here are the four or five things that he will do to me.\u2019 His list of allegations included leaking the Hannity dinner and the details from his financial-disclosure form. ...  \u201cI got the sense that Scaramucci\u2019s campaign against leakers flows from his intense loyalty to Trump. Unlike other Trump advisers, I\u2019ve never heard him say a bad word about the President. \u2018What I want to do is I want to f***ing kill all the leakers and I want to get the President\u2019s agenda on track so we can succeed for the American people,\u2019 he told me. He cryptically suggested that he had more information about White House aides. \u2018O.K., the Mooch showed up a week ago,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.? Because I nailed these guys. I\u2019ve got digital fingerprints on everything they\u2019ve done through the F.B.I. and the f***ing Department of Justice.\u2019 ... Scaramucci said he had to get going. \u2018Yeah, let me go, though, because I\u2019ve gotta start tweeting some s*** to make this guy crazy.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/2h75I58  -- @Scaramucci: \u201cI sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump\u2019s agenda. #MAGA ... I made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d   -- BUT \u2026 PER RYAN LIZZA\u2019s piece: \u201cScaramucci, who initiated the call, did not ask for the conversation to be off the record or on background.\u201d  ****** A message from Morgan Stanley: Growing disparities in income and more are among today\u2019s greatest socio-economic challenges.

Read more. ******  JOSH DAWSEY \u2013 \u201cScaramucci declares war on Priebus, Bannon\u201d: \u201cOne person who talked with Scaramucci said he talks openly about getting rid of Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman whose job has appeared to be in jeopardy for months. \u2018He\u2019s got to go,\u2019 this person said, summarizing Scaramucci\u2019s comments about Priebus. ... One White House official described the incident as a bump in the road for Scaramucci \u2014 and said that there was no expectation that he would be fired or punished for the interview. Nor any expectation that Trump will be inflamed by it. \u2018He didn\u2019t say anything negative about Trump,\u2019 this person said. ...  \u201cOne person who spoke with Priebus over the weekend said he\u2019d wanted to make it to one year in the White House, but has settled for staying \u2018at least through health care.\u2019 One reason Priebus and his allies opposed Scaramucci coming on board was that they knew \u2018he wouldn\u2019t just be a comms person going on TV,\u2019 one West Wing official said. Priebus has begun calling allies and asking for advice on whether he should stay in the job and how he should handle the situation, according to people familiar with the talks. One such call went to Speaker Paul Ryan earlier this week, who advised Priebus to stay and that the president needed him. ... Priebus has continued to hold daily meetings in his office, but people no longer feel like they have to attend, one senior White House official said.\u201d http://politi.co/2tOKwqz   REINCE WATCH -- INTERESTING NUGGET from NYT\u2019s Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman: \u201cMr. Trump has openly told people that he has lost faith in Mr. Priebus. He has said he wants \u2018a general\u2019 as chief of staff, and has focused on John F. Kelly, the retired four-star Marine now serving as homeland security secretary. Many of his advisers, however, consider that a bad idea.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2u3RwLc  -- \u201cReince Priebus\u2019s Days Are Numbered, Trump Allies Say,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Adrian Carrasquillo: \u201cThe White House used to sternly push back on reports that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was losing the president\u2019s favor and would soon be fired. ... Those days appear to be over. ... Privately, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, has told people that Priebus is \u2018gone\u2019 and that he is trying to figure out his next steps, a source with knowledge said. Her message is that White House staffers who came from the [RNC], which Priebus ran before being named chief of staff, are out, and that the administration is \u2018going back to Trump loyalists.\u2019\u201d http://bzfd.it/2h8h4G1  REMEMBER WHEN the Trump administration said tax reform was easy, and would happen by the end of the year?   THE SKINNY TAX PLAN -- \u201cTax reform: Is that all there is?,\u201d by Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo: \u201cThe White House, Treasury and congressional leaders issued a six-paragraph statement Thursday that tried to show off their commitment to pursuing tax reform without delving into any policy specifics. The only problem? Tax overhauls live and die on details -- and their absence, after months of weekly meetings aimed at achieving consensus, showed that the GOP\u2019s dream of achieving tax reform may be years from completion.  \u201cMissing from the \u2018Big 6\u2019 leaders\u2019 statement were details such as what rates Republicans think major corporations, the wealthiest individuals and the middle class should pay. Also unresolved were the status of the estate tax and the fate of prized tax breaks, such as the ability to deduct business interest and state and local taxes. It was even briefer and less detailed than the one-page tax proposal that the Treasury Department and White House released in April, which drew widespread criticism at the time for being too short.\u201d http://politi.co/2u4lJd7  -- \u201cBusiness Roundtable launching multi-million dollar push backing tax reform,\u201d by Nancy Cook: \u201cThe Business Roundtable is embarking on a multi-million-dollar national TV and radio campaign, beginning in early August, to give tax reform extra momentum over the congressional recess. Done in cooperation with White House, Treasury, and House and Senate leadership, this is BRT\u2019s effort to cast a potential tax overhaul as a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\u201d http://politi.co/2eT9f6g  FOR YOUR RADAR -- \u201cCongress sends Russia sanctions to Trump\u2019s desk, daring a veto,\u201d by Elana Schor: \u201cThe Senate on Thursday delivered Donald Trump the first big bipartisan rebuke of his presidency, giving final approval to a package of sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea that constrains his bid to defrost relations with Moscow. The Senate voted 98-2 to approve the sanctions bill that cleared the House earlier this week. ... The only no votes on the bill were Kentucky Republican Rand Paul and Vermont independent Bernie Sanders.\u201d http://politi.co/2tIGxrb  -- WAPO\u2019S MICHAEL BIRNBAUM: \u201cThe bill ... gives Trump the power to impose sanctions on [a] pipeline under development between Russia and Germany, a project that many policymakers in Europe and the United States say will harm Ukraine by enabling Russian gas to completely bypass it. The pipeline \u2026 may also increase European dependence on Russian gas imports. Days ahead of the vote, language was added to the bill saying that the president should coordinate with U.S. allies before moving on this front, in what backers view as an attempt to calm European concerns.\u201d http://wapo.st/2vOFyYb   -- NYT QUOTE OF THE DAY -- VLADIMIR PUTIN talking about the sanctions and the Russia investigations: \u201cIt is impossible to put up forever with this boorishness toward our country.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2tParyh   -- BULLETIN at 5:35 a.m. -- \u201cMOSCOW (AP) - Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry orders number of U.S. diplomats cut, seizes recreational retreat in response to U.S. sanctions.\u201d  FUN READ -- \u201cSpicer on the loose,\u201d by Annie Karni: \u201cSean Spicer doesn\u2019t need the bushes anymore.

Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Rob Hur and Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Thomas Homan spoke and took questions from the press briefing room podium in a previously-unannounced addition to the not-so-regular White House briefing.  \u201cHur and Homan were flanked by some compelling visuals: TV monitors showing images of tattoos belonging to MS-13 gang members, including enough of the face of one alleged gang participant to identify him. The scene troubled several former Justice Department officials, including Hur\u2019s predecessor in the Obama administration, Matthew Axelrod. He said the move was particularly unwise at a time when Justice\u2019s independence seems to be under challenge by President Donald Trump\u2019s extraordinary and sustained public criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u201d http://politi.co/2v4WmvS  -- \u201cSessions calls Trump criticism over Russia recusal \u2018kind of hurtful\u2019 in \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019 interview\u201d http://fxn.ws/2tOMyGR  NSC DEPARTURE LOUNGE \u2013 \u201cMcMaster ousts senior official on National Security Council,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Karen DeYoung and Greg Jaffe: \u201cThe National Security Council\u2019s top official for the Middle East has been removed from his job following internal complaints about his management style, according to senior Trump administration officials.

SCHUMER\u2019S HEALTH CARE PLAY -- \u201cDems to GOP: No amendments until you show us your bill,\u201d by Seung Min Kim: \u201cSenate Democrats are taking their ball and going home in the looming health care vote-a-rama \u2014 until Republicans finally cough up their actual Obamacare repeal plan. Fed up with the GOP's constant vacillations over how to dismantle Obamacare, Democrats say they will hold back on offering any more amendments in the health care floor fight until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) shows what plan the GOP will ultimately coalesce around. \u2018Democrats are not going to participate in this one-sided and broken process,\u2019 announced Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Wednesday evening. \u2018Once the majority leader shows his hand, reveals what his bill will actually be, Democrats will use the opportunity to try and amend the bill.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2uz3PTh  ONE SENIOR REPUBLICAN AIDE noted that \u201cduring reconciliation Senators can offer zero or 100 amendments. Dems declaring they won\u2019t offer amendments is basically taking their ball and going to the sideline. It doesn\u2019t affect anything. \u2026 In fact, all it does it show how unserious they are about participating. Hours will continue to be burned and we will keep voting.\u201d  -- THE SCHEDULE: @phil_mattingly: \u201cThe Senate will gavel in at 10am Thursday. About 10 hours of debate left on the health care clock.

GET SMART FAST -- \u201c\u2018Skinny\u2019 repeal could have big ramifications for Obamacare markets,\u201d by Paul Demko: \u201cSenate Republicans are hoping a \u2018skinny\u2019 repeal bill can solve their stalemate over dismantling Obamacare. But this partial Obamacare repeal \u2014 which is gaining steam in the Senate \u2014 could destabilize already wobbly Obamacare insurance markets, make premiums jump and increase the number of uninsured by millions, health policy experts say. ... Killing the individual mandate would take away the primary mechanism that helped build the Obamacare insurance markets. The CBO estimated 16 million fewer people would have coverage in a decade without the individual mandate tax penalty in place, based on an analysis requested by Senate Democrats.\u201d  http://politi.co/2uzjl1F  -- WHY A WORRIED REPUBLICAN WOULD VOTE AGAINST THE SKINNY REPEAL: The pitch from Republican leadership is this: vote for the skinny repeal so the House and Senate can move to a formal health care negotiation. But a negotiation between the House and Senate will be thorny: there is disagreement on changes to many things, including changes to Medicare. If you vote for the skinny repeal and end up with a negotiated product you don\u2019t like a few weeks or months later, it could be politically perilous.  -- BURGESS EVERETT, SEUNG MIN KIM and JEN HABERKORN: \u201c\u2018Skinny\u2019 Obamacare repeal still lacks votes to pass: A bare-bones plan picks up some key GOP support, but centrists and conservatives are skeptical\u201d: \u201cEven a bare-bones repeal of Obamacare is no sure thing in the Senate. A handful of key Republican senators who had spurned earlier overtures from GOP leadership endorsed the latest plan to gut Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer coverage mandates and its medical device tax. But several centrists said they\u2019re undecided on the so-called skinny repeal, leaving the GOP in limbo through at least the end of the week. ...  \u201cCentrist GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia were undecided on the so-called skinny repeal Wednesday. Another Republican from an expansion state, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada indicated he would back it. ... Conservatives could be another matter. \u2018I don\u2019t like it,\u2019 Sen. David Perdue of Georgia said of the process. \u2018Because I don\u2019t know where we end up. This whole [health care system] holds together or falls apart in totality.

NOT SO FAST -- \u201cWhite House adviser clashes with Mnuchin over tax plan,\u201d by Nancy Cook: \u201cThe White House is eager to present a unified front on tax reform, but those leading the effort inside the administration haven\u2019t been able to bridge deep fissures over how much to cut taxes and the best way to pay for it. The White House\u2019s top tax staffer, Shahira Knight, who works for Gary Cohn at the National Economic Council, has feuded in the last few months with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other Treasury officials, according to a senior administration official and four other people familiar with their interactions. This comes as the administration and congressional leaders prepare to unveil a broad-brush tax proposal, weeks ahead of schedule, as a way to pivot from the grinding debate over health care \u2014 and to show movement on an issue significant to the business community before Congress adjourns for its August recess.  \u201cYet many key outstanding questions remain, including how low the corporate tax rate can go -- a major focus of the president who wants it at 15 percent -- and what if any tax benefits or breaks lawmakers will need to eliminate to pay for cuts. These trade-offs are part of what makes tax reform difficult. No businesses, or individuals, like to see any particular tax break eliminated and tend to mobilize when their goodie is threatened. Figuring out how to balance the many competing interests at play have been the focal point of Knight\u2019s disagreements with Treasury \u2014 and a foreshadowing of Republicans\u2019 challenges with any tax overhaul.\u201d http://politi.co/2uEKGhh  SESSIONS WATCH -- \u201cTrump talks privately about the idea of a recess appointment to replace Sessions,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Carol D. Leonnig, Ashley Parker, and and Philip Rucker: \u201cPresident Trump has discussed with confidants and advisers in recent days the possibility of installing a new attorney general through a recess appointment if Jeff Sessions leaves the job, but he has been warned not to move to push him out because of the political and legal ramifications, according to people briefed on the conversations. ... Two of those people, however, described Trump as musing about the idea rather than outlining a plan of action ... Several people familiar with the discussions said that Trump\u2019s fury peaked over the weekend and that he and Sessions now seem to be heading toward an uneasy detente.\u201d  http://wapo.st/2tF4FuJ  -- \u201cAllies Warn Trump of Conservative Revolt Unless He Backs Off Sessions,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Peter Baker and Jennifer Steinhauer: \u201cFor a week, some of President Trump\u2019s top aides have tried to talk him down from his public campaign against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It was exposing tensions within the administration, stirring consternation with the conservative base and setting off a revolt among Senate Republicans incensed over the treatment of a former colleague. Among those urging Mr. Trump to spare Mr. Sessions have been Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist; and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, according to officials who asked not to be named describing internal deliberations.\u201d  http://nyti.ms/2tLvhyu  --FOR THE RECORD, NO NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL BE CONFIRMED -- @chuckgrassley: \u201cEverybody in D.C.

FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES -- \u201cSessions\u2019 powerful friends stand up to Trump,\u201d by Josh Gerstein and Josh Dawsey: \u201cSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham was among Sessions\u2019 most vocal defenders Wednesday, when he seemed to almost be taunting the president, suggesting that his failure to fire Sessions showed weakness, while also hinting that the impact of such a move could be catastrophic for Trump\u2019s presidency. ... Several Republican senators have reached out directly to Sessions and told him to stay put, expressing their frustrations with his puzzling situation, according to a person with knowledge of the contacts.  \u201cSessions has basically mused back to them he doesn\u2019t understand it either \u2014 but that he won\u2019t quit at the moment. The senators view Trump\u2019s treatment of their former colleague as \u2018offensive\u2019 ... Some GOP senators also fear that if Trump pushes out Sessions, the results could be dire for the president. Such a development might lead to mass resignations at the Justice Department and it might be impossible to find a majority in the Senate to confirm a replacement for Sessions.\u201d  http://politi.co/2v0ZQ2w  POLITICO\u2019S TY COBB INTERVIEW -- \u201cTrump\u2019s newest Russia lawyer: \u2018I think very highly\u2019 of Mueller,\u201d by Darren Samuelsohn: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is exasperated with the Russia probes that have overwhelmed his first six months in office, but his newest White House lawyer is looking to make nice with the president's main investigator - at least for now. \u2018I have a very respectful and professional relationship with Bob Mueller. I think very highly of him,\u2019 Ty Cobb, who starts Monday in a West Wing office as White House special counsel, said in an interview.  \u201cCobb, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who in the 1990s represented several Democrats under investigation during the Clinton era, was hired in part to help spearhead the internal Trump White House effort to respond to the expanding Russia investigations by Congress and special counsel Mueller. \u2026 In preparation for his arrival next week, Cobb met Wednesday with White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. Both men are new to the Trump team and both answer directly to Trump. ... It\u2019s possible that he'll speak on television and on the record with reporters.  \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll certainly provide background willingly when appropriate, but will work primarily with the comms staff and try to make sure the message is accurate and not confusing and let them run with those kind of things,\u2019 Cobb said. \u2018I\u2019m there to be a professional,\u2019 he added. \u2018And it\u2019s not about me. But I need to give the president good advice. and I need to make sure that anything we\u2019re asked to do at the White House and related to any of these investigations that we do well and on time.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/2tF2yHy  FOR YOUR RADAR -- \u201cGOP moves toward solution on Russia sanctions bill,\u201d by Elana Schor: \u201cHouse and Senate Republicans clashed Wednesday over a bipartisan package of sanctions targeting Russia, Iran, and North Korea before appearing to resolve a dispute that threatened to delay the bill\u2019s arrival on President Donald Trump's desk. \u2026 But further political headaches for the GOP appeared to be averted Wednesday night, when [Sen. Bob] Corker announced that he had reached agreement with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on a solution that would pave the way for final approval of the sanctions bill. \u2018Going forward, the House has committed to expeditiously consider and pass enhancements to the North Korea language, which multiple members of the Senate hope to make in the very near future,\u2019 Corker said in a statement Wednesday night.\u201d http://politi.co/2tDuU4K  -- \u201cAP sources: U.S. seeks to test Iran deal with more inspections,\u201d by Josh Lederman and Matt Lee: \u201cThe Trump administration is pushing for inspections of suspicious Iranian military sites in a bid to test the strength of the nuclear deal that President Donald Trump desperately wants to cancel, senior U.S. officials said. The inspections are one element of what is designed to be a more aggressive approach to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. While the Trump administration seeks to police the existing deal more strictly, it is also working to fix what Trump\u2019s aides have called \u2018serious flaws\u2019 in the landmark deal that \u2014 if not resolved quickly \u2014 will likely lead Trump to pull out.\u201d http://bit.ly/2h5gpVB  YIKES -- BuzzFeed\u2019s Cora Lewis, Dominic Holden and Nancy Youssef: \u201cAt the Pentagon, the first of the three tweets [on Trump\u2019s transgender decision] raised fears that the president was getting ready to announce strikes on North Korea or some other military action. Many said they were left in suspense for nine minutes, the time between the first and second tweet. Only after the second tweet did military officials receive the news the president was announcing a personnel change on Twitter.\u201d http://bzfd.it/2u0J1AQ   FUN READ \u2013 KATIE GLUECK in McClatchy, \u201cInside the Trumps\u2019 Instagram obsession\u201d: \u201cEric Trump was Making America Great Again at his father\u2019s New Jersey golf club just as United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley crammed onto a couch with a gaggle of her \u2018sweet friends\u2019 and the sunglasses-clad Trump surrogate Katrina Pierson reminisced about the days before politics forced her out of her car and into an Uber. Or, so said their Instagram feeds. If President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite form of social media is Twitter, the outlet of choice for many of his relatives, campaign boosters and even a Cabinet member is Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook.  \u201cPeople in Trump\u2019s orbit\u2014including several of his children\u2014use Instagram to highlight television appearances and tout the president\u2019s luxury properties. ... [T]hese social feeds closely say the Instagram accounts offer a glamorous glimpse into the president\u2019s inner circle and his ritzy enclaves, providing routine reminders of the days when\u2018 \u2018Trump\u2019 was more closely associated with celebrity than the White House. The feeds are a nonstop stream of fodder for a clamoring, adoring Instagram fan base that doesn\u2019t seem to mind the disconnect between that Trumpian lifestyle and that of the president\u2019s working-class base.\u201d http://bit.ly/2tFvu25  THE JUICE \u2026   -- MARK PRESTON and CHRIS FRATES are getting their own SiriusXM shows.

[But] a slew of critics have emerged to protest. Jewish organizations and many lawmakers are furious that Tillerson hasn\u2019t yet named a new special envoy to combat anti-Semitism. Digital gurus are unhappy that Tillerson may chop the slot focused on cyber issues. Tillerson\u2019s attempt to discard the special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan spurred such an outcry among South Asia watchers that he went ahead and named someone to the role temporarily.\u201d  http://politi.co/2tExQ1e   JEFF FLAKE PROFILE \u2013 MCKAY COPPINS in The Atlantic, \u201cJeff Flake\u2019s Gamble: The Arizona Republican is betting his Senate seat on the political appeal of decency\u2014but can that pay off in Trump\u2019s America?\u201d: \u201cIn 2013, Flake was part of the bipartisan \u2018Gang of Eight,\u2019 which helped pass a comprehensive immigration-reform bill in the Senate (it died in the House). He recalled for me his deep personal frustration watching Trump and his fellow Republicans make naked appeals to \u2018nativist sentiment\u2019 last year. When Kaine traveled to Florida and in fluent Spanish praised the patriotism of newly naturalized citizens, \u2018I almost cried,\u2019 Flake said. \u2018I just thought, That should be us. That was us, and now it\u2019s not.\u2019 ...  \u201cWhen I visited Flake and his wife, Cheryl, in his office on Capitol Hill the day after the shooting, he looked drained. Resting his head on the back of his armchair, he recounted the preceding 24 hours in a quiet, halting voice. \u2018It was a long day,\u2019 he said, glancing at Cheryl. \u2018Just\u2014I\u2019m just glad to be here.\u2019 He seemed to view the episode as a grim validation of his worst fears about the country. \u2018The deterioration of political discourse in general aids this,\u2019 he said. \u2018When we ascribe motives to our opponents, that they are evil, then we\u2019ve almost given license to extreme behavior.\u2019\u201d  http://theatln.tc/2uYNp7M  THE NEXT TURN OF THE SCREW -- \u201cLawyers for Brady, rival rebut claims of illegal campaign payoff,\u201d by the Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Jeremy Roebuck, Chris Brennan and Tricia L. Nadolny: \u201cU.S. Rep. Robert Brady\u2019s lawyer pushed back Wednesday against federal prosecutors\u2019 claims that the congressman secretly paid a political rival $90,000 to drop a bid to unseat him in the 2012 Democratic primary. Scoffing at the depiction of the money as a covert payoff, attorney James Eisenhower said that the funds were intended in part to acquire exclusive rights to valuable polling data from the primary challenger, Municipal Court Judge Jimmie Moore.  \u201cBut almost as if they had anticipated that explanation, government lawyers shot back in a court filing made public for the first time Wednesday. At the time Brady bought the data, they said, the poll in question was irrelevant, outdated, and contained information that the congressman had already had his possession five months before his campaign cut the checks. What\u2019s more, wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric L. Gibson, the price Brady paid was twice what it cost Moore to commission the survey.\u201d http://bit.ly/2uZNJDq  THE IVANKA BEAT -- \u201cTrump Administration Tapping Tech CEOs for STEM Policy Approach,\u201d by Bloomberg\u2019s Margaret Talev: \u201cWhite House officials including Ivanka Trump have begun an outreach campaign to major technology, business and education leaders including Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook for advice on shaping funding approaches to science, technology, engineering and math education in U.S. public schools. \u2026 [O]n Wednesday [she] joined Reed Cordish, the president\u2019s special assistant for technology initiatives, on a conference call with politicians, educators and CEOs to discuss STEM education, according to two people with knowledge of the call.

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Margaret Harding McGill, Ashley Gold, Nancy Scola, John Hendel and Steven Overly   SINCLAIR'S ASSIST FROM THE FCC \u2014 Sinclair Broadcast Group is expanding its conservative-leaning television empire into nearly three-quarters of American households \u2014 but its aggressive takeover of the airwaves wouldn\u2019t have been possible without help from President Donald Trump's chief at the Federal Communications Commission, Margaret and John report. Sinclair, already the nation\u2019s largest TV broadcaster, plans to buy 42 stations from Tribune Media in cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, on top of the more than 170 stations it already owns. It got a critical assist this spring from Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who revived a decades-old regulatory loophole that will keep Sinclair from vastly exceeding federal limits on media ownership. The FCC and the company both say the agency wasn\u2019t giving Sinclair any special favors by reviving the \u201cUHF discount,\u201d which has long been considered technologically obsolete.  Story Continued Below  With the regulatory path eased, and Republicans in control of Congress, Sinclair has focused its bare-bones lobbying effort on tamping down Democratic opposition. Senate Commerce Committee ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) recounted the broadcaster\u2019s charm offensive, noting that Executive Chairman David Smith \u201cwas in my office\u201d in June discussing the Tribune deal. Following the meeting, Nelson told John he saw no need for great congressional objection on his part: \u201cI really haven\u2019t gotten into that and I don\u2019t intend to. That\u2019s an issue that is in front of the various administrative agencies. So I\u2019m going to let them use their expertise.\u201d Sinclair\u2019s PAC cut a $1,500 check for Nelson on June 13, around the time of that meeting, following one for $1,000 in March. Republicans show general confidence in the deal\u2019s federal approval: \u201cI don\u2019t know why it shouldn\u2019t go forward,\u201d Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told POLITICO.   U.S. DIGITAL SERVICE SETS ITS SIGHTS ON REBUILDING \u2014 In the waning days of the Obama administration that created it, the USDS's ranks had swelled to about 200 programmers, designers and others charged with upgrading citizens' digital interactions with the federal government. That's shrunk down to 160 people at least in part, says Matt Cutts, the former Google software executive now serving as USDS's acting administrator, because of the freeze on federal hiring Trump imposed when he arrived in office. In a new story on USDS's next steps, Cutts talks about why the agency has kept its head down during the previous six months, how the digital service fits into Trump's Washington and why he doesn't think his team will be asked to build a so-called Muslim registry anytime soon. Nancy has the story. When it comes to recruiting, says Cutts, "It's not a secret that Silicon Valley tends to lean left." But he adds, \u201cthe bigger challenge we face is letting people know about the opportunity. We're still here. We're working on projects that matter. We're hiring."   \u2014 The Trump administration plans to further tap the expertise inside technology companies \u2013 but it's unclear how those plans relate to USDS. The White House Office of American Innovation will create \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d that pair experts from tech firms with government employees on projects related to cloud computing, data center consolidation and open data, Steven reports. White House senior officials shared an update of those plans during a phone call Thursday with representatives from nearly two dozen technology companies, including Apple, Oracle, Amazon, Google, Intel and Microsoft. CEOs from those firms took part in the inaugural meeting of the innovation office's American Technology Council in June.   LEAVING ON A JET PLANE \u2014 The Senate has officially cleared out for the August recess, leaving a plume of #jetfumes in its wake \u2013 and the last-minute passage of six tech and telecom bills, Ashley reports. The measures include Sen. John Thune's MOBILE NOW Act, which would free government spectrum for commercial use; Sen. Amy Klobuchar's Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act and the Kari's Law Act, which would require multi-line telephone systems to let users directly call 9-1-1 without any code or prefix. Also approved were Sen. Dean Heller's FCC Consolidated Reporting Act; Sen. Bill Nelson's Spoofing Prevention Act; and the DIGIT Act from Sens. Deb Fischer and Cory Booker, which would encourage government investment and development in the Internet of Things.   \u2014 On the nominee side: The Senate confirmed Jessica Rosenworcel and Brendan Carr to be FCC commissioners, but opted to hold off on adding another term for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Ashley and John report. The chamber will take a recorded vote on Pai when it returns in the fall, providing Democrats the opportunity to demonstrate their opposition, given the moves he's taken on issues like net neutrality.   \u2014 But that's not all: The Senate also approved Vishal Amin for IP czar and Peter Davidson, a former top Verizon lobbyist, for Commerce Department general counsel. One notable nominee who's still awaiting confirmation: Makan Delrahim, Trump's pick for DOJ antitrust chief.

Michigan was also among the states that issued an RFP to look at competitive options for the state plan.   DEMS SUGGEST MORE NET NEUTRALITY WITNESSES \u2014 Democrats from the House Energy and Commerce Committee wrote to Republican panel leaders Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) suggesting eight more witnesses to testify at the net neutrality hearing set for September. The committee has invited CEOs of major tech companies like Google and Facebook to testify, while Democrats have complained about a lack of inclusiveness for smaller companies and entrepreneurs. \u201cWhile we appreciate you scheduling a hearing to look at how the FCC is eliminating the ground rules for the internet ecosystem, we continue to believe that the witness list must be expanded beyond the Chief Executive Officers of eight large corporate interests,\u201d wrote Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Mike Doyle (D-Pa.). See their suggested witnesses here.   INVESTORS BACK ENTREPRENEUR VISA RULE \u2014 Sixty national and regional groups representing venture capitalists and entrepreneurs urged the Department of Homeland Security to reconsider its plans to abandon the International Entrepreneur Rule \u2014 an Obama-era policy that established temporary visas for foreign-born entrepreneurs who launch investor-backed companies in the U.S. In comments filed Thursday, the groups say entrepreneurs offered visas through the program would create U.S. jobs \u2014 a key tenet of Trump\u2019s campaign platform and economic agenda. \u201cThe International Entrepreneur Rule will allow the world\u2019s best entrepreneurs to create jobs in our country, rather than overseas where they will then compete with American workers and companies,\u201d the letter states. The National Venture Capital Association spearheaded the comments, which were endorsed by the Internet Association, Engine, FWD.us, the Information Technology Industry (ITI) Council and TechNet, among many others.   FCC ADDS TO BROADBAND GROUP \u2014 Pai announced the members of the final working group for his Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee, which he launched earlier this year and tasked with developing recommendations to speed the build-out of high-speed internet service. The working group, Streamlining Federal Siting, will explore methods for reducing barriers to build infrastructure on federal lands. Members include officials from the Agriculture, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development departments.

"They are monologuists, essayists, performers and vloggers who publish frequent dispatches from their living rooms, their studios or the field, inveighing vigorously against the political left and mocking the 'mainstream media,' against which they are defined and empowered."   QUOTE OF THE DAY \u2014 In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) slammed the Democrats' new antitrust platform, quipping that former FTC Commissioner Joshua Wright referred to the "progressive" approach as "hipster antitrust."

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from John Hendel, Ashley Gold and Margaret Harding McGill  WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY? \u2014 We're tracking whether the Senate votes to confirm the three FCC nominees (GOP Chairman Ajit Pai, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel and Republican Brendan Carr) before heading out of town for the August recess. The Commerce Committee approved the trio Wednesday and a Thursday vote, likely via hotline, is looking possible, but senators were still negotiating some sticking points.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 Democrats don't want Carr to be confirmed for two consecutive terms. \u201cThe Dems over here are not going to let that second term go,\u201d Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) told John Wednesday. He hinted that Republicans could settle for a single term.   \u2014 Republicans want to attach a bunch of bills. They're aiming to push through six pieces of telecom legislation with the confirmations. That would include Thune's MOBILE NOW Act, which would free up government spectrum for commercial use. The measure got caught in a partisan tussle over Rosenworcel's (failed) confirmation last Congress.   HAPPY RURAL BROADBAND MONTH \u2014 The FCC will vote today on several items devoted to that theme, including a public notice to kick off the second phase of the Connect America auction. That\u2019s set to start in 2018 and distribute up to $198 million annually in subsidies for 10 years to providers committed to bringing voice and broadband to hard-to-reach areas.   \u2014 The agency has also teed up a proposal on Mobility Fund subsidies for telecom companies building out 4G LTE, something supported by AT&T; potential changes to paperwork ISPs must fill out to provide broadband coverage data to the agency; and an inquiry into whether mid-band spectrum can be used for next-generation services, including wireless broadband.   PORTMAN PUSHES ANTI-SEX-TRAFFICKING BILL \u2014 Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) talked big-ticket legislation like tax and health care reform with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, but he made sure to mention another of his top priorities: an anti-sex-trafficking bill introduced this week. The bill, which would amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has sparked major pushback from the tech industry, which fears a wider array of online platforms will be held liable for content posted by users.    \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who filed pimping and money-laundering charges against Backpage.com as California attorney general, said the measure was an important one. "I think it's very important, and I have a whole history on working on trafficking, in particular on the work that I've done for years when I was District Attorney of San Francisco and even before that when I was a line prosecutor in the D.A.'s office of Alameda County," she told MT.   \u2014 A number of tech groups including the Internet Association and Consumer Technology Association have voiced their opposition to the bill. In another coalition letter, R Street Institute, TechFreedom and New America's Open Technology Institute are among the others sharing concerns about the additional liability tech companies could incur if the bill were to become law.

"Benenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Zuckerberg-Chan Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy."   WICKER, SCHATZ RALLY FOR 5G \u2014 Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced a resolution championing the deployment of 5G mobile broadband technology. "Potential benefits [of 5G deployment] include three million new jobs, $275 billion in investment from the wireless industry, and a boost of $500 billion to the economy," according to a news release.   DEMOCRATIC INCUBATOR STARTS INVESTING \u2014 Higher Ground Labs, a campaign tech incubator started by Obama administration alums, selected 10 startups for its first cohort of investment, The Hill reports. \u201cFor too long, progressives have counted on Presidential campaigns to incubate and build campaign technology \u2014 a strategy that isn\u2019t optimal when conservatives like the Koch brothers and the Mercers are pumping big money into permanent GOP campaign technology companies,\u201d said Ron Klain, the chairman of HGL's advisory broad and a former aide to President Obama. The chosen startups include GroundGame, Qriously and Tuesday Strategies. HGL is also among the firms that contributed to an $8 million Series A round for texting platform Hustle, a tool used by both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns during the election.   AT&T CHALLENGES STARZ MERGER STUDY \u2014 In a white paper submitted to the Justice Department, former Trump transition adviser Jeff Eisenach said the AT&T-Time Warner merger could lead to increased prices and reduced choices for consumers of premium channels. Eisenach argued that AT&T would have the incentive to steer pay-TV subscribers to Time Warner-owned HBO and away from rivals Showtime or Starz. The study was commissioned by Starz. AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris responded, "This conclusion doesn't square with the facts. We fully expect the DoJ to base its analysis on the facts and the law, as it always does, and not the work of HBO's competitors.\u201d   MORE TIME ON NET NEUTRALITY? Public Knowledge, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and several other groups want an eight-week extension on the deadline for reply comments in the FCC's net neutrality proceeding. The groups argue the comment periods for prior rulemakings on the topic were longer, and noted that the current proceeding already has a record-breaking 15 million filings. "This volume alone warrants an extension of time for the replies," they write. "The current schedule does not afford interested persons enough time to read and properly consider the record, let alone to prepare their own replies." The deadline for reply comments is Aug. 16.

Story Continued Below  \u2014 Committee Chairman John Thune told Ashley on Tuesday: \u201cI hope that hearing will go by smoothly \u2026 it would be great if we could get [the nominees] disposed of by voice vote.\u201d So will that free up legislation that\u2019s been held up? \u201cI hope so; that\u2019s the case that we\u2019re making to the Democratic leadership in the Senate. Once these nominees that they were concerned about get freed and busted loose in the Senate, it ought to open up the opportunity to get some of the telecom bills. I think we have half a dozen bills or so that have been held up that really have bipartisan support and should get passed. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll see that, maybe as early as this week.\u201d  \u2014 The goal after Senate Commerce signs off on the FCC nominees is to \u201cget them in a cleared package\u201d of nominations being negotiated among Senate leaders, with the hope of confirmation before August recess, Thune told John. The South Dakota Republican said it\u2019s a question of whether Democrats want to force roll call votes or whether \u201cthey\u2019re willing to take some sort of a deal\u201d that allows the nominations to move in the bigger leadership-negotiated package. Commerce Committee ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said with the right deal, the FCC nominees could move fast on the floor. \u201cYou know what greased lightning is?\u201d Nelson told John of the possible speed.   \u2014 Part of what\u2019s under negotiation now is whether to confirm FCC General Counsel Brendan Carr for two consecutive terms on the commission, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told reporters. Democrats see potentially withholding a second term for Carr as an important factor in easing confirmation of a successor to Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) noted that an interest in pairing the next Democratic nominee with a Republican one remains a priority. \u201cI want to ensure that there\u2019s a guarantee that we\u2019re going to have a merger of the next Democratic nominee with one of these Republican nominees, as a guaranteed confirmation,\u201d he told MT. Thune told Ashley he knows some Democrats have concerns but said there\u2019s \u201cplenty of precedent\u201d for similar circumstances.   \u2014 NTIA Administrator nominee David Redl is also up for a vote, after it was delayed because of questions Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had about Redl\u2019s stance on the ICANN transition \u2014 which was completed last year. Cruz still has some outstanding concerns about Redl and sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross alongside Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) about the nomination, Ashley reports. Redl "espoused a policy position directly contrary to the position taken out by the secretary of Commerce and directly contrary to the position of President Trump," Cruz said Tuesday. "I and a number of other senators want to receive some significant clarity on that question." During his confirmation hearing Redl said, \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re in the situation we\u2019re in. ... It would have been very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle," when Cruz asked whether he thought the ICANN transition was \u201cwise and prudent.\u201d   COULD NAFTA INCLUDE VISA UPGRADES? \u2014 Companies are interested in making it easier for top talent to go across borders, but Congress isn\u2019t quite sold on such policies, Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi reports. \u201cNow, as Mexico and Canada consider their demands ahead of the renegotiation of NAFTA, U.S. reluctance to address labor mobility terms in the context of trade deals is likely to remain unchanged, despite companies clamoring for reforms that would ease cross-border movement of workers tending to the complex and tight-knit supply chains that have developed over NAFTA's 23-year lifespan. \u2018Anything that looks like a back door into the immigration system is going to be a challenge,\u2019 said Daniel Ujczo, a lawyer based in Columbus, Ohio, who specializes in cross-border business issues between the U.S. and Canada.\u201d Read more, here.   BLUMENTHAL TALKS TECH\u2019S CONCERNS ON SECTION 230 BILL \u2014 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), one of the chief sponsors of an anti-sex-trafficking bill that would narrow the protections of Section 230, responded to some of the concerns that tech groups have raised about the increased liability and legal costs the legislation could lead to. \u201cAs attorney general for years and years, I urged these companies to respect their responsibility, and they moved by millimeters toward a recognition of that obligation and some action on it,\u201d he told MT. \u201cI respect their arguments, but I just think there has to be some action to protect people from the Wild West of a lawless site that encourages trafficking and destroys human lives. They have some responsibility to do better. \u2026 They\u2019ve been inching toward realization, but it has to be more than voluntary at this point.\u201d When asked whether he thought existing laws could address this issue, Blumenthal asked, \u201cAre they working? I don\u2019t think so, and I know firsthand the obstacles to enforcing those laws, so I know their weaknesses and we need to strengthen them.\u201d  GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where we can\u2019t get enough of these pairings.

An announcement is expected late this week, but an official cautioned it could slip into next week. U.S. companies have complained they are often forced to share valuable technology with Chinese counterparts as a condition of doing business in the country. Section 301 allows the U.S. to impose unilateral duties against countries that impose barriers to U.S. exports.  The action would give Lighthizer a leading role in a lengthy investigation that could peer into all aspects of Chinese industrial policies and potentially result in unilateral U.S. trade sanctions.   Frustration that China is not doing more to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear program seems to be motivating the administration to fire a shot across the bow on the trade front, one source said. Many in the business community are likely to silently cheer the action as long overdue, but others may be worried about a further souring of the business environment and possible Chinese retaliation, a second source said.   TIME FOR LIFELINE? Senate Commerce is eyeing a hearing on the FCC\u2019s Lifeline program before the August recess, according to sources on Capitol Hill and in the telecom industry. One tentative date could be next Wednesday, although plans could change depending on when the Senate leaves town. The hearing follows a GAO report critical of the program.  ENTHUSIASM FOR AIRWAVES \u2014 All three FCC commissioners were among those lauding the bipartisan AIRWAVES spectrum legislation, introduced Tuesday in the Senate and scoring points from everyone from CTIA to Public Knowledge. Pai called the measure \u201cforward-thinking\u201d and praised its inclusion of the rural set-aside idea he pushed last year. \u201cThere is a lot to like in the bill, including firm spectrum deadlines and auctions for key bands,\u201d said Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly. \u201cNotably, the bill directs the Commission to study how unlicensed spectrum can be harnessed to meet the needs of rural communities,\u201d Commissioner Mignon Clyburn noted.  FOXCONN OUT OF THE BAG \u2014 President Donald Trump may be on a crusade against leakers, but it turns out he may not be the best at keeping confidence, either. At a White House small business event Tuesday, Trump said Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told him the company may invest as much as $30 billion in the U.S. That\u2019s triple the $10 billion the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer recently announced it would spend on a new facility in Wisconsin. "He told me that off the record, so I promised I wouldn't tell anyone," Trump said to laughs. Trump did not elaborate further. Foxconn has an investment partnership with Japan-based Softbank, which has pledged to pump $50 billion into U.S. investments. \u201cThat\u2019s called big business, by the way,\u201d Trump told those gathered. \u201cYou\u2019ll be big business. You\u2019ve got to start out small but you\u2019re going to be big like that.\u201d  THE FIRST A.I. PRESIDENT? \u2014 Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) may be a longshot presidential contender by most any measure, but the main tenet of his political platform could get techies excited. The three-term lawmaker says that artificial intelligence and automation (among other transformative technologies) should be front and center in the 2020 race. \u201cChange historically or innovation historically has been very positive, but it\u2019s not positive for everyone,\u201d he said. The government needs to fix that. How? Delaney proposes public education that extends from prekindergarten through either community college or a post-high school certificate. He also wants portable health care and retirement benefits so that workers can more easily change jobs or pursue entrepreneurial ventures. Pros can read more about Delaney, including his views on guaranteed minimum salaries, A.I. regulation and research funding, in this Q&A.  APPLE HINTS AT JOBS ANNOUNCEMENT \u2014 Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts Tuesday that the company will have \u201csome things\u201d to say about company job growth and investment later this year. It\u2019s unclear whether those \u201cthings\u201d include the three \u201cbig, big, big\u201d plants that Trump recently referenced in a Wall Street Journal interview. Cook certainly didn\u2019t say as much in a conference call following the company\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement. However, Cook sees opportunities to help existing plants expand or \u201ceven maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time.\u201d In May, Apple invested $200 million of its $1 billion advanced manufacturing fund in a Corning factory in Kentucky that makes glass for its gadgets.   TECH LEADERS TALK TERRORISM \u2014 \u201cNearly every terrorist plot we uncover today has a digital dimension,\u201d Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said in a statement. That\u2019s why Duke was in San Francisco on Tuesday for a meeting with leaders from Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Snap and YouTube, among other companies. They formed the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in June to create a united front against the spread of terrorist propaganda online. \u201cFrom their virtual safe havens, groups like ISIS and al Qaeda have recruited followers in every single U.S. state and around the world,\u201d Duke said. \u201cA global crisis needs a global response, which is why I commend the companies here today for establishing this forum. Their platforms reflect the values of our open society \u2014 freedom of expression, debate, and ultimately tolerance. This is the opposite of the repressive worldview espoused by terrorist groups. Although they are trying to exploit these tools to do harm, the efforts discussed today will help us turn the tide against terrorists online.\u201d The companies plan to meet again in the coming months and recruit other tech firms to join their effort, they said. The meeting was closed to the press.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILL RAISING TECH\u2019S HACKLES \u2014 Senators including Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) are expected to introduce a bill as soon as today aimed at combating online human trafficking, legislation that comes after the lawmakers\u2019 investigation into controversial classified ad site Backpage.com, Nancy reports. The pending measure already has some in the tech industry on high-alert. They\u2019re alarmed about what it would do to narrow Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a landmark provision that limits website operators' liability for what their users post. Yes, they're quick to say, human trafficking is a menace. But they argue the proposed bill would make it legally precarious to operate sites like Reddit, Facebook and Airbnb, while drawing scrutiny away from true bad actors.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 "The bill jeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet, with serious economic and speech implications well beyond its intended scope," Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, tells MT. Adds Evan Engstrom, executive director of Engine, an advocacy group representing tech startups: "Section 230 is the foundational law of the internet, and starting to carve out exceptions to it scares people."   Whether senators buy those arguments \u2014 or instead see them as a dodge for sites unwilling to accept their role in facilitating horrid behavior \u2014 will be the debate of the coming days. We're tracking.   NET NEUTRALITY TAKE-AWAYS \u2014 Breathe easy, tech CEOs. House Energy and Commerce Republicans on Monday extended their deadline to RSVP for a Sept. 7 hearing on net neutrality legislation. That buys the execs some time to try to get out of a sticky situation. While a few tech players, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have made positive noises about net neutrality legislation \u2014 a longstanding goal of Republicans \u2014 their active participation in crafting such a bill could alienate Democrats and activist groups that want to keep the fight focused on the FCC. And tech companies don\u2019t seem inclined to spend all their political capital on net neutrality right now, given their array of priorities (tax reform, anyone?) in Washington.  \u2014 Democrats see the hand of Big Telecom in all this. Republicans want tech CEOs \u201cto go on the record to say that there should be legislation,\u201d Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Silicon Valley Democrat long active in telecom issues, told POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s the big ISPs that are pushing for the legislation.\u201d She accused the internet service providers of \u201cpolitical cross-dressing\u201d in which \u201cthey pound their chest, they say they\u2019re for net neutrality. You are? We\u2019ve got the protections. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d ISPs \u201cwant legislation so that it is tailor-made for them to do what they want to do, and they don\u2019t want any cop on the beat, they don\u2019t want FCC in it,\u201d she said.  \u2014 Watch Aug. 7. That\u2019s the date E&C Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) wants to gather all interested parties in person to offer feedback on his 2015 net neutrality bill. His staff is soliciting industry feedback now. \u201cBy the end of next week, we should all have a good idea of whether there is any chance of moving forward together,\u201d GOP chief counsel Robin Colwell emailed industry officials.   TODAY: A NEW SENATE SPECTRUM PACKAGE \u2014 Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) will unveil the Advancing Innovation and Reinvigorating Widespread Access to Electromagnetic Spectrum, or AIRWAVES, Act, which MT first reported was in the works back in June. The 10-page measure includes a number of provisions, including identifying spectrum bands for unlicensed use and freeing up mid-band spectrum. It would also create a rural set-aside, in which the FCC would allocate a tenth of proceeds from any spectrum auction and put it toward wireless broadband for unserved and underserved consumers. (Sound familiar? FCC Chairman Ajit Pai floated a similar idea last fall as part of his digital empowerment agenda).   \u2014 AIRWAVES \u201coffers innovative ways to avoid a spectrum crunch, pave the way for 5G service, and provide critical resources to rural America\u201d to continue \u201cbuildout in unserved and underserved areas throughout Colorado and the country,\u201d Gardner said.

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) have officially resurrected the International Communications Privacy Act, which would create a legal framework for U.S. law enforcement to obtain electronic communications data of U.S. citizens, even when this information is stored overseas. The bill would require the use of a warrant for such inquiries and also would establish a standard for officials to access the data of foreign nationals in certain cases. See the full bill here.   \u2014 Apple, Google, AT&T and Microsoft are among the tech and telecom giants that have called for such legislation. \u201cFor far too long, technology companies, law enforcement and, ultimately, the courts have been forced to choose between competing interpretations of an outdated statute,\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith writes in a blog post. \u201cThese conflicts of law put businesses in a no-win situation, putting American technology companies at a disadvantage.\u201d   GOOGLE RESPONDS TO EPIC\u2019S FTC COMPLAINT \u2014 Google is hitting back against a complaint that privacy watchdog EPIC filed with the FTC on Monday. In the complaint, EPIC argues that the search giant\u2019s tracking of user shopping data lacks both transparency and a clear way to opt out. A Google spokesperson emphasized that the company \u2014 which has a new feature that aims to trace the impact of its online ads on brick-and-mortar purchases \u2014 prioritizes privacy and uses \u201cdouble-blind encrypted technology\u201d so it does not see any individual\u2019s data or purchasing patterns. The spokesperson says users are able to easily opt out through their activity settings, but adds there\u2019s no explicit alert that prompts them to choose this option. The FTC has not contacted Google about the EPIC complaint, according to the spokesperson.   GOP TAKES ON LIFELINE (AGAIN) \u2014 Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) brought back his End Taxpayer Funded Cell Phones Act before House lawmakers left town. That\u2019s the legislation that GOP leadership fast-tracked straight to floor consideration immediately after its introduction last year. (They tried to advance it under suspension of the rules, and it went down 207-143.) It now has 18 GOP backers, triple what it had before. \u201cMy bill will reform the Lifeline Program and restore it to its original purpose of providing landline services and prohibit Universal Service support for mobile services,\u201d Scott said. A GOP leadership aide said there\u2019s no talk on when and if the measure may be brought to the floor this time around.   NET NEUTRALITY BACKERS SEEK MERGER INFO \u2014 Trade group INCOMPAS wants the FCC to include redacted materials from recent mergers involving Comcast, Charter and AT&T in its review of Chairman Ajit Pai\u2019s proposal to roll back the agency\u2019s net neutrality rules. The group, which counts Netflix and Sprint among its members, said economic studies, internal company presentations and other data submitted as part of the commission\u2019s merger review process shows that ISPs have incentive to curb competition. The information would be vital in a court review of final rules, INCOMPAS CEO Chip Pickering told POLITICO. \u201cThe FCC has taken a position that the ISPs do not have the means and the motive to act against online competitors,\u201d Pickering said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the question, you have to look at all the evidence. And a refusal to consider the evidence, I think any court would find unreasonable.\u201d  \u2014 INCOMPAS noted that its request would not make the information available to the general public. Instead, only certain parties would be able to see the documents \u2014 the same confidentiality the FCC used in the merger reviews. Comcast, Charter and AT&T opposed the request in filings last week, arguing that sharing the information in the net neutrality proceeding risks disclosure of sensitive documents. Charter said the \u201cunprecedented request is a harmful fishing expedition, which, if granted, would violate federal law.\u201d Pickering finds the companies\u2019 opposition suspect: \u201cTheir nuclear reaction for simply asking for the evidence to be included continues to beg the question, \u2018What do they have to hide?\u2019\u201d INCOMPAS asks the FCC to act by July 31. Agency representatives did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  07/31/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from John Hendel  RSVP WATCH \u2014 Today is the day Silicon Valley\u2019s top CEOs must tell the House Energy & Commerce Committee if they\u2019ll show up for the Sept. 7 hearing on net neutrality legislation. The invited tech executives \u2014 for Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix \u2014 \u201cabsolutely should come in and testify and participate in the process,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat representing part of Silicon Valley. \u201cI hope that many of them will take a strong view for net neutrality and against repealing it because many of the employees and many of the techies in the Valley, they very much believe in net neutrality and keeping the internet open and free and a place of innovation.\u201d It\u2019s the \u201cnext stage for these tech leaders\u201d following other advocacy on federal and state issues on immigration and LGBT rights, he said. \u201cIt would show a humility, it would show a respect for the political process, and it would show how important net neutrality is to free speech and innovation in the 21st century.\u201d   Story Continued Below  \u2014 Republicans are eager to hear from them. \u201cThe tech CEOs should be here,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who chairs E&C\u2019s telecom panel, told POLITICO. \u201cI think they\u2019ve been talking to everybody but us, so it\u2019s important that they come and talk with us about this. We want the opportunity to hear firsthand from them.\u201d E&C Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) agrees: \u201cWe need to hear from the edge providers, we need to hear from Netflix, we need to hear from the ISPs. It\u2019s time that they had the opportunity to express their views to us that often they\u2019re expressing around the country.\u201d   NEXT UP: FCC REAUTHORIZATION BILL MARKUP? \u2014 House lawmakers may have skipped town Friday for the long August recess, but Blackburn wants her telecom panel to dive into a markup of Republicans\u2019 draft FCC reauthorization bill after Labor Day. \u201cI am hopeful that we\u2019re going to be able to, as soon as we come back, move the reauthorization bill,\u201d Blackburn told POLITICO of a September markup. \u201cGo ahead and move that, get that part of the process behind us, and then move on to a broadband bill. So we\u2019re working through that. I\u2019ll spend a lot of time on that in August.\u201d House Republicans had floated an FCC reauth proposal last Congress but never marked it up. During last week\u2019s FCC oversight hearing, E&C ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) called the current draft \u201cflawed,\u201d not \u201cserious\u201d and lacking Democratic input.  \u2014 SENATE COMMERCE TO VOTE ON FCC: All three FCC nominees are up for a vote during a Senate Commerce Committee markup on Wednesday when the panel will also consider NTIA Administrator nominee David Redl.

In its complaint, EPIC argues that Google, which rolled out a feature that aims to link the impact of online advertising with users\u2019 brick-and-mortar purchases by analyzing credit card data, needs to be more transparent about how it monitors this information. The group is also calling for the company to offer a clear way for users to opt out of this program. \u201cEPIC requests that the Commission initiate an investigation into Google\u2019s in-store sales tracking algorithm to determine whether it adequately protects the privacy of millions of American consumers,\u201d the group writes.   FIRST IN MT: A HILL BOOST FOR WHITE SPACES -- Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) assembled 42 House lawmakers for a letter to the FCC today favoring use of TV white spaces for rural broadband, a plan popularized by Microsoft. The ask: \u201cpreserve at least three, 6 MHz television white spaces [spectrum] channels in every media market.\u201d Cramer secured sign-on from senior Republicans such as House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) and Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), as well as tech-friendly Democrats including Reps. Peter Welch (Vt.),Suzan DelBene (Wash.) and Anna Eshoo (Calif.). One loud critic is the National Association of Broadcasters, and last week saw skeptical op-eds from former Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Craig Fugate and Harvard Law School professor Susan Crawford. But these lawmakers, with ties to the Rural Broadband Caucus and leadership, say TV white spaces \u201chave strong potential to revolutionize broadband internet accessibility in rural areas\u201d and create dependendable internet connections that are \u201cextremely cost-effective requiring minimal infrastructure investments.\u201d And don\u2019t forget, a similar letter is likely coming from governors.   THE JOBS ACT AND THE STITCH FIX IPO \u2014 Stitch Fix, an e-commerce company that sends personalized clothing recommendations to users, has confidentially filed for an IPO, a move that was made possible via the 2012 JOBS Act, Recode reports. The legislation enables \u201cemerging growth\u201d firms to confidentially submit registration information including details about financial statements and risk factors to the SEC so as to receive feedback without the public exposure. The SEC recently expanded the scope of this practice to all companies, as part of a move to bolster more IPOs, USA Today reports. Blue Apron\u2019s paperwork also indicated it took advantage of the "emerging growth company" designation created by the JOBS Act when it went public earlier this year.

Companies like Apple, HP and Tesla, which rely on global supply chains, could have faced a hefty new tax bill if the border-adjustment proposal became law. The tech industry continues to eye other elements of tax reform like a reduced corporate tax rate. But good luck finding the details of what a future tax package will look like.  Story Continued Below  BEHOLD, A BIPARTISAN BROWSER ACT \u2014 Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) just scored a victory with her privacy legislation known as the BROWSER Act. Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) is signing on as its first Democratic co-sponsor. Blackburn, as you may recall, has struggled to win support from E&C Dems for this measure.   NEW ICPA BILL COMING \u2014 Hot on the heels of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act reintroduction from Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) are due to announce the return of the International Communications Privacy Act, according to a Hill aide. ICPA would provide a legal framework for U.S. law enforcement agencies to obtain electronic communication records of U.S. citizens that are stored overseas, which would include the use of a warrant. Google, BSA | The Software Alliance and SIIA are among those that have voiced their support for the return of the bill.   \u2014 Speaking of ECPA: Lee and Leahy on Thursday unveiled a new version of ECPA, which would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant for Americans\u2019 emails that are more than 180 days old. It would also create a warrant standard for tracking location information, including on cell phones. A previous version of the legislation got bogged down in the Senate last term, after Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) added amendments that appeared to give the FBI more leeway for surveillance. Lee also introduced a companion to the House\u2019s Email Privacy Act. Read the new version of ECPA, here.

Tackling contraband phones is high priority for Pai, who united FCC commissioners in March to spur the commission to look at technological fixes to the problem of illicit phones in correctional facilities. Technology may provide a solution where physically banning them has failed. But wireless companies aren't on board with what prison officials want. Read more here.

That\u2019s how much the Taiwanese electronics maker plans to invest in the factory, which will initially employ 3,000 workers to build LCD monitors for computers and other electronics, Steven reports.  Story Continued Below  But Foxconn\u2019s decision to locate the facility in Wisconsin is a clear political win for Gov. Scott Walker and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who stood at the president\u2019s side during his remarks. Both Republican politicians played an active role in wooing Foxconn not only to the Badger State, but to Ryan\u2019s own district. That will likely serve him well politically as other factories \u2014 including a massive GM plant \u2014 in his corner of Wisconsin have packed up and moved out in the last decade, leaving voters there with fewer options for employment. \u201cFor southeastern Wisconsin, this is an absolute game changer,\u201d Ryan said yesterday. \u201cIt means more jobs and more security and more prosperity for families. It is another example of how our region is truly a manufacturing powerhouse.\u201d  If the name Foxconn rings a bell, it may be because of a number of reports about how the company as a supplier for Apple has faced scrutiny in the past for poor treatment of Chinese workers and the suicide nets it installed on some buildings after some employees leaped to their deaths.  TECH: #LETTHEMSERVE \u2014 Leaders from the tech community sharply criticized the Trump administration\u2019s move banning transgender service members in the military, making the decision the latest flash point between the industry and the White House, Nancy and Steven report. Facebook executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey are among those who vocalized their opposition to this policy change. "We are indebted to all who serve. Discrimination against anyone holds everyone back. #LetThemServe,\u201d Cook tweeted. Salesforce posted a company statement of support for \u201cequality for all.\u201d Oath, the union of Yahoo and AOL\u2019s online properties, also chimed in with its backing of its LGBTQ workers and diversity.   TRUMP ADMIN REACHING OUT TO TECH ON STEM \u2014 "White House officials including Ivanka Trump have begun an outreach campaign to major technology, business and education leaders including Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook for advice on shaping funding approaches to science, technology, engineering and math education in U.S. public schools," Bloomberg reports.   NEW FCC NOMINATIONS WRINKLE \u2014 Senate Commerce has a vote on FCC nominations planned for Aug. 2, that will include two Republicans (FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and General Counsel Brendan Carr) and one Democrat (former Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel). Also on deck: NTIA administrator-nominee David Redl. But Democrats may want a GOP commitment to set up smooth confirmation for the next Democratic FCC opening, whenever Commissioner Mignon Clyburn departs. In multiple scenarios \u2014 such as not giving Carr a second full term or only confirming Carr and Rosenworcel now \u2014 \u201cCommissioner Clyburn\u2019s replacement could be paired with Carr or Pai,\u201d a Democratic aide said, adding that Thune and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want to confirm Pai, Carr and Rosenworcel together.   \u2014 Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) confirmed interest in securing GOP commitment on the next Democratic commissioner confirmation, although said he\u2019s heard nothing from Clyburn on when she may leave. \u201cI want to just make sure that there\u2019s a guarantee, you know, that the next Democrat is in, so we have to work out some kind of formula to guarantee that is a part of whatever\u201d nominations plans are made, Markey told POLITICO. Thune said there\u2019s \u201cbeen no formal engagement\u201d with him yet.    \u2014 The Commerce markup is also slated to include a bill from Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) that focuses on developing methodology at the FCC for data collection on commercial mobile service and commercial mobile data service.  SELF-DRIVING CAR MARKUP, ROUND TWO \u2014 The full House Energy and Commerce Committee is due to mark up a bill on self-driving cars that came together yesterday following a period of frenzied negotiations, Pro Transportation\u2019s Tanya Snyder reports. This legislation, which is the first of its kind to move through Congress, would set up distinct roles for federal and state governments for overseeing the deployment of self-driving vehicles, and addresses the issues of preempting state laws and safety exemptions. Read the full text of the legislation, here.   AXING THE FCC\u2019s UHF DISCOUNT \u2014 That\u2019s what House Democrats want to do as part of the Local and Independent TV Protection Act, expected to be introduced today. The FCC reinstated the discount earlier this year. That drew much Democratic pushback and became the regulatory change enabling the Sinclair Broadcast Group/Tribune Media merger. Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and David Price (D-N.C.) are lead authors. Other Dem backers: Reps. Anna Eshoo (Calif.), Raul Grijalva (Ariz.), Ro Khanna (Calif.), Jerry McNerney (Calif.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) and Jackie Speier (Calif.). The bill has backing from Free Press, Public Knowledge, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Common Cause and Consumers Union.   START YOUR ENGINES \u2014 Startup advocacy group Engine hits the Hill today to talk net neutrality with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with a focus on members of the House and Senate Commerce Committees.

ASCAP, BMI ESTABLISH MUSIC DATABASE \u2014 The two performing rights groups have announced they\u2019re setting up a searchable database of musical works to provide a reference point for song ownership and licensing, Variety reports. This move comes on the heels of the introduction of a bill from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) that would create a digital database of copyright ownership and licensing information for musical works. The House Judiciary Committee offered its support for ASCAP and BMI\u2019s efforts via Twitter, while the Digital Media Association observed that it underscores the need for the Sensenbrenner legislation.   GOOGLE.ORG\u2019S JACQUELLINE FULLER ON FUTURE OF WORK \u2014 The tech giant\u2019s charitable arm on Wednesday announced a $50 million commitment to "to help people prepare for the changing nature of work." The sum will be invested in various organizations that research and develop tools to enable people to adapt to shifts in the labor market. Google.org President Jacquelline Fuller sat down with reporters for a roundtable following the announcement to discuss these investments and talk about how the organization views its focus moving forward.   On how Google\u2019s own AI efforts could affect the workforce: \u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about technology, and we think machine learning, in particular, is very promising in terms of boosting productivity. We also want to make sure we are investing in efforts that are helping, make sure that everyone including the most vulnerable workers are able to upscale to meet those changes in work.\u201d  On what\u2019s next: \u201cThe themes where we feel like we can really double down and have an impact are: this concept of lifelong learning, particularly online education. And particularly for those who are most underserved, both in the U.S. and internationally, in developing countries. \u2026 And this idea of economic opportunity, really helping get ahead of that. \u2026 The third piece that cuts across both of them is inclusion.\u201d   MCCARTHY HUDDLES ON VETS AND TECH \u2014 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a roundtable discussing veterans and tech training on Wednesday.

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from John Hendel, Nancy Scola, Ashley Gold and Steven Overly  A \u2018BIG, BIG, BIG\u2019 BITE OF THE APPLE \u2014 President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Apple CEO Tim Cook has committed to building three manufacturing plants in the U.S. Not just any plants, but \u201cbig, big, big\u201d ones. If such factories are in the works, Apple does not appear ready to say so. The company declined to comment. Trump\u2019s thin-on-details remark raises some obvious questions: Where will the factories be located? What will they build? And how many people will they employ? But it could also have policy implications as several companies (Samsung, Toyota, Intel, Ford, etc.) have used investment promises to curry favor with the president. It remains to be seen whether the plans Trump revealed will be tied to Apple\u2019s own goals in Washington \u2014 including its top priority of reducing corporate taxes.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 The Trump-Apple relationship is already a complicated one. On the campaign trail, Trump blasted the company for making products in China \u2014 but since his victory he\u2019s tempered the hot rhetoric. Meanwhile, Cook, like other Silicon Valley heavyweights, is engaged in a delicate dance with the White House. The Apple CEO was spotted dining with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner shortly after the inauguration, and though he criticized the president\u2019s decision on the Paris climate accord, Cook joined other tech leaders at the White House last month to discuss government IT. In May, Apple launched a $1 billion fund to invest in U.S. advanced manufacturing companies \u2014 an announcement, many observed, that was likely to please the administration.   VAN DYCK DEPARTS USDS \u2014 Haley Van Dyck, the longtime Obama administration official who helped launch the U.S. Digital Service in 2014, has left that office, OMB confirms. Van Dyck, who once held the formal title of deputy USDS administrator, had quietly stayed on to guide the agency through the start of the Trump presidency, we reported back in March. "Haley's passion for improving digital services for the American people has been second to none," Matt Cutts, the former Google engineer-turned-acting USDS administrator, said in a statement. "Haley had a specific goal of assisting USDS through the administration transition and left when she felt that was completed to the best of her abilities. Although the USDS team is sad to see her go, we're excited to see what's around the corner for Haley and wish her the best."  TODAY: COMMERCE TOP LAWYER NOMINEE ON DECK \u2014 The Senate Commerce Committee holds a confirmation hearing for a slew of Trump nominees, including Peter Davidson, the former Verizon lobbyist who\u2019s up for general counsel at the Commerce Department. As we previously reported, Davidson spent more than ten years leading the telecom giant\u2019s government relations operation and worked for the U.S. Trade Representative during the George W. Bush administration. The Commerce general counsel could play a key role in helping navigate issues around Privacy Shield and spectrum management.

A MOMENT FOR NET NEUTRALITY LEGISLATION? \u2014 House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) put a marker down for a Sept. 7 hearing on net neutrality legislation, inviting tech and telecom CEOs, but don\u2019t expect Democrats to jump on board immediately. It\u2019s a \u201ca tremendous idea\u201d but \u201cthe courts are going to need to give some finality to this before we look at legislation,\u201d Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), the telecom panel\u2019s top Democrat, told POLITICO, referring to the expected legal challenge to FCC Chairman Pai\u2019s net neutrality rollback. Doyle said he doesn\u2019t see \u201cany serious legislative activity this year,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is not even in the talking stages.\u201d   \u2014 But Walden told POLITICO he wants legislation to move this Congress, pointing to a 2015 draft bill he sponsored with Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) as a starting point. But that draft banned paid prioritization, which telecom panel Chairman Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) insists should be legal. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question,\u201d Walden said of that internet fast lanes provision, saying he anticipates debate about the pros and cons in September. Lawmakers can find common ground if \u201cwe can get everybody to holster their rhetoric and their politics for a day or two,\u201d he said.  \u2014 Free Press\u2019s Candace Clement, meanwhile, slammed E&C for only inviting CEOs: \u201cWho will represent internet users, innovative startups and independent voices at this hearing? This is an internet hearing without the internet.\u201d Doyle and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) agree \u2014 they penned a letter to Walden and Blackburn asking for the committee to invite more witnesses to the September hearing.   WHEELER IN CHARM CITY \u2014 Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler are due to make the rounds in Baltimore today, where they\u2019ll push for protection of the net neutrality rules.

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from John Hendel  FCC IN THE SPOTLIGHT TODAY \u2014 Amid the ongoing net neutrality debate, the House telecom subcommittee scrutinizes the FCC today at an oversight hearing that will also examine a draft bill reauthorizing the agency. All three commissioners will testify and tipped their hands by releasing testimony in advance. They\u2019ll weigh in on the draft bill, which would make changes including allowing an owner to have a broadcast station and newspaper in the same market and creating an economics and data office at the commission. The House proposal precedes any offering from the Senate, where Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) has said he also intends to put forth legislation.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 E&C ranking Democrat Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) will call out his Republican counterparts for unilaterally putting together a reauthorization draft that did not include any Democratic contributions, according to prepared remarks. \u201cThe Republican majority recently surprised us all with a 42-page reauthorization bill that had absolutely no Democratic input,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cThis bill is flawed. It slashes $18 million from the FCC\u2019s budget \u2014 the same agency that is having issues keeping its website up and running. This is not serious legislation.\u201d  \u2014 FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is expected to praise the reauthorization in his testimony and call out tenets of the bill that address spectrum payment policies and post-incentive auction repacking. Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly also plans to lend "strong support" for the GOP draft. But he will also urge Congress to go further and include several other changes to commission process.  \u2014 Meanwhile, Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn will focus on preserving Title II reclassification of ISPs and the need to modernize the Lifeline program in her remarks.  ANTITRUST TALKS COMMENCE ON AT&T-TIME WARNER \u2014 Discussion has begun between U.S. antitrust officials and representatives from AT&T and Time Warner about conditions that would enable the $85 billion merger to go through, Bloomberg reports. While the merger is a vertical one \u2014 a category that\u2019s posed fewer antitrust challenges in the past \u2014 many media groups have argued that AT&T\u2019s ownership of content companies like CNN and HBO could lead the ISP to prioritize them. Democrats have also raised fears about the harm this merger could cause users by reducing competition and raising costs. Of late, there have been additional questions about the White House using this deal as leverage over CNN, following criticism from President Donald Trump of the news organization. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes has dispelled such concerns and has plans to leave his role if the merger is approved, The New York Times reports.

TRUMP ACCUSES WAPO OF \u2018LOBBYING\u2019 FOR AMAZON \u2014 Trump\u2019s tweets targeting both The Washington Post and Amazon continued on Monday. The tweets appeared to allege that the publication was \u2018lobbying\u2019 for the e-commerce company on the issue of taxes. \u201cSo many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN. Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?,\u201d one tweet read. These tweets coincide with other criticism that Trump has leveled against both companies. He has previously critiqued The Post\u2019s coverage and claimed that the publication is being used to help Amazon reduce its online taxes. Though the two entities are both linked to Jeff Bezos, they are separate from one another. Interestingly, among its lobbying hires this past year, Amazon has brought on several Trump campaign and transition associates including Brian Ballard and Dan McFaul of Ballard Partners and Robert Wasinger of McGuireWoods.   VERIZON\u2019S FIRSTNET STATE COMMENTS \u2014 While AT&T secured the contract for the FirstNet buildout earlier this year, competitors including Verizon are emphasizing the need for choice on state plans. \u201cA key aspect of the FirstNet framework established by Congress is ensuring that states have options for how they participate in that network,\u201d said Will Johnson, Verizon SVP of federal regulatory and legal affairs, in a statement about a recent filing to the FCC. \u201cVerizon\u2019s letter to the FCC is designed to respond to the needs of our public safety customers and to present states with viable opportunities to choose their own network partners and their own network configurations, as Congress envisioned.\u201d  NOT SO FAST \u2014 Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) was seeking co-sponsors last week for a House companion to the Protecting Internet Freedom Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). But a Biggs spokesman told POLITICO plans changed and that no bill is forthcoming. The GOP freshman instead will bring up his support for such legislation at his next so-called \u201cFreedom Fridays\u201d session, which spotlight regulations Biggs judges unconstitutional. No word on just why Biggs changed his tune. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), for what it\u2019s worth, stressed Monday afternoon at the Brookings Institution that she wants a House Energy and Commerce net neutrality bill negotiated with Democrats.   \u2014 E&C legislative priorities, per Blackburn: next-gen 911, media ownership, encryption and privacy as well as FCC reauthorization. Shortly after FCC reauth, E&C will turn to NTIA reauthorization legislation, Blackburn said. She also insisted that contrary to a New York Times report, the administration remains focused on an infrastructure package.   DEMS TO TACKLE INTERNET ACCESS \u2014 The Democrats\u2019 new economic agenda takes aim at companies for consolidation and market concentration, but that\u2019s not the only tech and telecom-related item on its list. Still to come, the Democrats intend to roll out plans that ramp up high-speed internet access across the country, according to a release from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office.

aV \u000a            By LI ZHOU  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Nancy Scola, Steven Overly and John Hendel  DEMS "BETTER DEAL" TARGETS TECH, TELECOM \u2014 The economic agenda being released by Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi during a swing through Virginia today includes a rethinking of the country's antitrust laws -- an overhaul that would have major implications for everything from cable ISPs to the country's most successful internet companies. The four-page "Cracking down on corporate monopolies" doc, posted by Axios, highlights telecom as one of the five prime targeted industries: "[T]he market for those services is so concentrated that consumers rarely have any meaningful choice of provider, and prices are high enough to be prohibitive for many." The proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger would "only enable the resulting behemoths to promote their own programming, unfairly discriminate against other distributers [sic] and their ability to offer highly desired content."  Story Continued Below  The Dems' antitrust proposal would, too, upend how regulators treat the country's biggest data-driven companies -- i.e. much of Silicon Valley. "Merger standards must explicitly consider the ways in which control of consumer data can be used to stifle competition or jeopardize consumer privacy," Schumer, Pelosi and co. say. Given that the party's new agenda is meant to reconnect Democrats with what a wide swath of citizens are thinking and feeling, this antitrust plank is a sign the left has judged that Americans today are unsettled by Big Tech and Big Telecom.   BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE ON SLOW TRACK \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s grand infrastructure plans \u2014 which include broadband buildout \u2014 are \u201cfast becoming an afterthought\u201d amid a pileup of other legislative priorities like the debt ceiling, tax reform and healthcare, The New York Times reports. Here\u2019s how the Times describes the \u201cbroad outlines\u201d of the developing proposal: \u201cThe plan would include \u2018massive permit reform\u2019 to cut approval times on major projects to two years or less, from 10; loans and grants to improve rural infrastructure; and funding for \u2018transformative projects,\u2019 like broadband and power grid improvements.\u201d  SCARAMUCCI DRAWS LESSON FROM DAVE EGGERS \u2014 In his first spin at the podium on Friday, new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci cited a 2013 Dave Eggers novel about life inside a Google-and-Facebook-esque tech company to argue against giving reporters an omniscient read on what goes on inside the White House. "On some of this stuff, it's unnecessary to go into that granular detail," said Scaramucci. "It's almost like the book "The Circle,\u201d where you're wearing, like, a police camera on you when you're having conversations. I don't think that's fair to the president." The book \u2014 made into an Emma Watson-Tom Hanks film earlier this year \u2014 got mixed reviews for its dystopian depiction of Silicon Valley. But it looks like it has at least one close reader among senior White House staff.   Lest you think that's the new White House comms director's sole claim to geekiness, know that, in the introduction of one of Scaramucci's own books, entrepreneur Peter Diamandis writes that, "in September 2014, Anthony attended the Executive Program of Singularity University (SU), the Silicon Valley-based institution focused on exponential technologies that I co-founded with artificial intelligence legend (and Google\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer), Ray Kurzweil."

TRUMP MAKES ANOTHER DIG AT \u2018AMAZON WASHINGTON POST\u2019 \u2014 In one of his latest tweets targeting media companies, Trump once again hit at the "Amazon Washington Post" \u2014 two separate entities which he\u2019s taken to criticizing as one body, likely because they are both linked to billionaire Jeff Bezos. \u201cIt's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!\u201d Trump wrote on Sunday evening. He has also tweeted in the past accusations that Bezos was leveraging The Washington Post to reduce Amazon\u2019s taxes.   GRILLING (AND HEALTHCARE TALK) WITH ZUCK \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to go live on Sunday and share some afternoon grilling with his followers \u2014 along with a few of his ideas on issues including healthcare. \u201cYou hear a lot in the social debates of today around healthcare. I think it\u2019s really important that we serve every person and that every person has the healthcare they need,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, one of the big issues in doing this is that it\u2019s really expensive today, because we don\u2019t have cures and preventions for all these diseases.\u201d Zuckerberg emphasized that bolstering investment in the work of organizations like the National Institutes of Health and making more long-term research investments could help society get closer to that goal and ultimately cut down on the number of people who get sick. He also talked about the need for a strong social safety net and STEM education among the myriad subjects that came up during the livestream. Watch the full discussion, here.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  08/04/2017 08:00 AM EDT  WELCOME TO JOBS DAY \u2014 President Donald Trump may not get a big number to brag about as he heads out on vacation. But expectations are for a very respectable 180K, down from 222K in June. The unemployment rate is expected to dip a tenth to 4.3 percent with wages up 0.3 percent.   A figure around 200K would put Trump at plus-1.3 million jobs over the first seven months of the year (though of course he wasn\u2019t president for most of January), slightly below the 1.4 million from the same period in 2016, the last year of President Obama\u2019s term. In other words: The trend is about exactly the same as it\u2019s been for years. There is no Trump effect.   Story Continued Below  Moody\u2019s Mark Zandi emails: \u201cThe economy produced approximately190,000 jobs per month on average since the beginning of the year. This is almost precisely the same job growth experience since job growth resumed over 7 years ago."  \u201cPresident trump has had nothing to do with the strong job market. It was strong before the election, and it remains strong after it. Moreover, the administration has not accomplished anything of consequence with regard to economic policy\u201d   TREASURY NOMS GO THROUGH \u2014 The Senate skipped town Thursday, joining the House, after clearing a big pile of nominations including David Malpass to be Under Secretary for International Affairs; Brent James McIntosh to be General Counsel; Andrew K. Maloney to be a Deputy Under Secretary; David J. Kautter to be an Assistant Secretary and Christopher Campbell to be Assistant Secretary for financial institutions.   Despite his title, Campbell, who spent years with the Senate Finance Committee, will spend much of his time early on working on tax reform. He\u2019s been deep in the weeds on the policy issues with the Gang of Six and will join with Justin Muzinich and others at Treasury as the administration and Hill Republicans try to have a legislative package ready in early September.   ALSO CONFIRMED, among others: J. Christopher Giancarlo, of New Jersey, to be Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Brian D. Quintenz and Rostin Behnam to be members of the CFTC.   MORTGAGE DEDUCTION AT RISK? \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm and Lorraine Woellert: \u201cA tax break popular with homeowners and the real estate industry could take a hit as Republicans look for ways to pay for their tax reform plan.   \u201cDespite promises from the Trump administration in April that it would \u2018protect the homeownership \u2026 deductions,[ multiple sources tracking tax reform said that the cap on the mortgage interest deduction \u2014 currently set at the interest on up to $1 million of mortgage debt \u2014 could be lowered in tax reform.\u201d Read more.

STILL NOT SO EASY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade: \u201cRepublican congressional leaders are quietly preparing to pass a \u2018clean\u2019 debt ceiling increase, according to multiple senior GOP sources \u2014 setting the stage for a high-risk showdown with rank-and-file Republicans this fall. \u2026   \u201c[B]eyond the leadership, there are few Republican takers, at least so far.

BUSINESSES FEAR TRUMP MISHANDLING OF \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Ginger Gibson: \u201cTrump's threat to investigate China's intellectual property and trade practices is valid, but his administration may not be up to the delicate task of carrying out a new China probe without sparking a damaging trade war, U.S. business lobbyists told Reuters on Thursday.  \u201cThe lobbyists' fears that Trump could mishandle such an inquiry came as he searched for ways to increase pressure on China to do more about reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, with trade policy viewed as a useful lever.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  08/03/2017 08:00 AM EDT  TRUMP BACKS LEGAL IMMIGRATION CUT \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday gave his endorsement to a bill from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) that aims to cut legal immigration in half in 10 years, from 1 million to 500,000.   The effort would also prioritize skills over family ties. You can read more about it here. The measure has little chance of becoming law largely because the bulk of economic research suggests it would be disastrous for an economy near full employment.   Story Continued Below  Moody\u2019s Mark Zandi emails MM: \u201cIt is a huge mistake \u2014 it is hard to imagine a policy that would do more damage to long-term economic growth. Especially now that the economy is back to full-employment, and businesses number one problem is filling a record number of open job positions, which will generally be the case for years to come.   \u201cIf implemented, it will mean that the labor force will come to a standstill over the next decade as the large baby boom generation leaves the work force. Instead of reducing immigration, we should be significantly increasing it. Moving to a more skilled-based system is a good idea, but we will desperately need immigrants of all skill levels in the future.\u201d   POLITICO\u2019s Timothy Noah and Marianne LeVine have more on the flaws in White House adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s arguments including the study he cited on Cuban immigration to Miami.  TRUMP\u2019S MAD MONEY \u2014 The Dow broke through 22,000 on Wednesday and Trump wasted no time bragging about it. The White House put out a statement lauding the achievement last night. Trump has boasted about the market nearly a dozen times in just the last month. This is highly unusual for a president, especially one who just last year called the increase in the stock market a \u201cbig fat bubble.\u201d   Now that Trump has eagerly claimed credit for instilling investor confidence and driving share prices to fresh highs, he stands to take the blame if markets hit a rough patch and decline. With fights looming over raising the debt limit and funding the government \u2014 and with tax reform far from a certainty \u2014 Wall Street analysts caution a significant pullback is possible that could leave Trump badly exposed.  NOT TYPICAL \u2014 \u201cPresidents typically don't brag about the stock market much,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, who served as top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who generally avoided market commentary even though the Dow rose about 140 percent during his tenure. \u201cThat's because it doesn't make sense to take credit for something that goes up if you don't want to be blamed when it goes down.\u201d  TRUMP PERFORMANCE LAGS \u2014 Even with the new record on the Dow, Trump actually trails many recent presidents in stock market performance over the first six months of an administration.   The Dow rose about 11 percent during Obama\u2019s first six months, compared with 9 percent for Trump, about the same increase as under President Bill Clinton in 1992. The recent record belongs to President George H.W. Bush, with a 15 percent increase in 1988, according to data compiled by the Bespoke Investment Group. Read more.   POLITICO\u2019s Danny Vinik with the reminder that the Dow is not the economy.   GARRETT GETS A CHANCE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt and Andrew Restuccia: \u201cTrump is giving former Rep. Scott Garrett a chance to save his nomination to lead the Export-Import Bank just weeks after the president privately questioned the appointment amid intense pushback from business groups.  \u201cThe New Jersey Republican\u2019s confirmation has been in doubt for months amid concern about his record in Congress, where he led efforts to try to kill the bank and took positions on LGBT issues that unnerved his corporate backers. An administration official said Trump has \u2018given Garrett an opportunity\u2019 to try to prove he can secure enough votes in the Senate\u201d Read more.   MORE ON GARY COHN FOR THE FED \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Jeanna Smialek, Max Abelson, and Dakin Campbell in a piece for Bloomberg Businessweek up this a.m. following on MM\u2019s scoop from last month on Gary Cohn as the leading candidate to take over at the Fed:   \u201cAs Trump considers whom to nominate as the next chairman of the Fed, former Goldman Sachs banker Gary Cohn has emerged as a leading candidate. Were he to get the job, Cohn would join old colleagues at the Fed, where three of the 12 regional bank heads used to work for Goldman.\u201d Read more.   JOBS DAY PREVIEW (A DAY EARLY) \u2014 Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: \u201cWhat is most needed \u2014 for Main Street, for Wall Street and for an orderly normalization of Fed policy \u2014 is a trifecta of healthy job creation (at least 80,000 to 100,000 per month on average), more buoyant wage growth (nearing 3 percent) and a larger number of Americans re-entering the labor force\u201d Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY \u2014 President Trump this evening speaks at a MAGA rally in Huntington, W.Va. \u2026 Senate Finance has a hearing at 10:00 a.m. on the nominations of Gilbert Kaplan to be Commerce undersecretary for international trade; Matthew Bassett to be assistant HHS secretary for legislation; and Robert Charrow to be HHS general counsel \u2026 Non-manufacturing ISM at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip to 56.9 from 57.4   HOENIG REACT \u2014 Per a banking industry source: \u201cThis is not a question of picking investors over lending. Banks want to lend more, meet their obligations to shareholders, and protect safety and soundness. We can have all three with some common sense changes.Without reasonable reform, America's economic engine simply can't fire on all cylinders.\u201d   ZUCK POLLSTERS UP \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni scoops: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama and the chief strategist to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the hire.  \u201cBenenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Zuckerberg-Chan Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy. \u2026 Bringing on Benenson is the latest sign that they\u2019re pushing their philanthropic work more heavily into the political and policy world. In January, the couple hired David Plouffe, campaign manager for Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run, as president of policy and advocacy\u201d Read more.   MEADOWS\u2019 TAX GOALS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin: \u201cThe leader of the most conservative faction of House Republicans outlined his principles for tax policy Wednesday, including a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate that could be difficult to align with other GOP goals.  \u201cRep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina backed a corporate tax rate below 20% and expressed a willingness to produce significant overall tax cuts, even if the plan needs to be temporary or leads to less federal tax revenue\u201d Read more.   APPLE DRIVES DOW ABOVE 22K \u2014 AP\u2019s Marley Jay: \u201cBeing the world's most valuable public company has its privileges, like getting almost all the credit for the latest stock market milestone. Apple made its biggest jump in six months Wednesday, helping send the Dow Jones industrial average above 22,000 points for the first time.  \u201cApple's latest profit and revenue were better than analysts expected, and the company's strong sales forecast suggests it's confident the next iPhone will reach the market on time. The technology giant's stock climbed to an all-time high, and when some other technology companies, utilities and industrial firms joined it, that was just barely enough to take the Standard & Poor's 500 index higher as well.\u201d Read more.  Who should we be thanking? \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Justin Lahart: \u201cAmericans cheering the U.S. stock market\u2019s latest milestone should pause to thank the rest of the world for making it possible. \u2026 Indeed, while there are notable exceptions (hello, International Business Machines), the greater the share of a company\u2019s sales come from overseas, the better its stock has tended to perform this year.\u201d Read more.  And here\u2019s a look at some of the Dow\u2019s other historic milestones. Read more.  ASIA STOCKS START LOWER \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Adam Haigh: \u201cAsian stocks started Thursday\u2019s trading session lower after surging to the highest level in almost 10 years, with investors assessing the strength of company earnings before American labor-market data provides the latest clues on the health of global growth\u201d Read more.  WELLS SUBPOENAED OVER UNWANTED AUTO INSURANCE \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Karen Freifeld: \u201cNew York state's banking and insurance regulator has issued subpoenas to two Wells Fargo & Co units after the bank admitted to charging several hundred thousand borrowers for auto insurance they did not ask for or need, causing many delinquencies.  \u201cThe New York Department of Financial Services is demanding Wells' loan contracts with New York borrowers, its financing agreements with auto dealers, and agreements between Wells units and insurers, according to copies of the subpoenas that were issued on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.\u201d Read more.  EURO BREACHES $1.19 \u2014 FT\u2019s Eric Platt: \u201cThe euro has found renewed strength as economic activity across the bloc has quickened and investors dial back expectations of when the Federal Reserve will next raise interest rates, a factor that has weighed on the dollar. The currency has risen 13 percent against the dollar this year.  \u201cThe gain by the euro pushed the DXY dollar index towards its lowest closing level since 2015. The index slid as much as 0.5 percent to a low of 92.55 on Wednesday, with losses accelerating after 1pm in New York.\u201d Read more.  INSURERS\u2019 OPERATING INCOMES RISE \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Leslie Scism and Nicole Friedman: \u201cAmerican International Group Inc. posted better-than-expected second-quarter operating results, as new Chief Executive Brian Duperreault took over midway into the period, while MetLife Inc. had a different turning point: the last quarter before the spinoff of its historic core life-insurance unit.  \u201cMetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer by assets before the divestiture is set to occur on Friday, also reported higher and better-than-anticipated operating income \u2026 Prudential Financial Inc.\u2019s operating income also rose, but it missed analyst expectations. All three insurers\u2019 per-share results were aided by share-buyback programs.\u201d Read more.  QATAR AIRWAYS DROPS PLAN TO INVEST IN AMERICAN \u2014 NYT\u2019s Micah Maidenberg: \u201cQatar Airways\u2019 courtship of American Airlines ended before it really started. On Wednesday, Qatar said it had dropped plans to buy a 10 percent stake in American, an abrupt change less than two months after the company surprised the industry by announcing the investment.  \u201cIn a statement, the state-owned airline cited American\u2019s \u2018latest public disclosure,\u2019 seeming to refer to a recent earnings report. Qatar said the disclosure demonstrated the \u2018investment no longer meets our objectives.\u2019\u201d Read more.  CANADIAN LENDER BOLSTERED BY GROWING FUNDING \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Katia Dmitrieva: \u201cHome Capital Group Inc., the Canadian mortgage lender trying to rebuild itself with the help of Warren Buffett, is clawing back after near-collapse.   \u201cThe Toronto-based company reported second-quarter results that showed a growing funding base, according to a statement late Wednesday. With its capital position improving, the lender said that uncertainty about its ability to continue as a going concern is resolved.\u201d Read more.  INVESTORS RUSH TO BUY IRAQ\u2019S FIRST INDEPENDENT BOND \u2014 FT\u2019s Thomas Hale: \u201cInvestors have rushed to buy Iraq\u2019s first independent bond sale in more than a decade, in a sign of a continued wave of demand for riskier debt across international markets.  \u201cThe $1bn bond, which matures in 2023, had brought in $6.6bn of orders when books were reported on Wednesday afternoon. The yield was fixed at 6.75 per cent, lower than initial pricing expectations of more than 7 per cent. The high levels of demand for the debt came amid strong appetite for risk across capital markets as low interest rates push investors to seek higher returns.\u201d Read more.  RANKS OF WOMEN CEOS GET EVEN SLIMMER \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Joann Lublin: \u201cIrene Rosenfeld\u2019s coming departure as chief executive of Mondelez International Inc. doesn\u2019t just signal a change of leadership at the snack giant. Her move also shrinks the slim ranks of women in command of the biggest U.S. businesses.  \u201cWomen now run 27 of the S&P 500 companies \u2014 or 5.4 percent of the total, reports Catalyst, a research group. Similarly, 32 women led Fortune 500 companies as of early June. That equaled 6.4 percent, the highest proportion in the 63-year history of the Fortune 500 list. The figure soon slipped to 6.2 percent after Marissa Mayer relinquished the helm of Yahoo Inc.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  08/02/2017 08:00 AM EDT  REAL TALK ON THE DEBT LIMIT \u2014 MM spoke with a senior Senate Dem on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s request that Dems carry the load for a clean debt ceiling hike. The gist: Why would we do it?   \u201cChuck [Schumer] told Mnuchin it would be pretty hard to carry water on the debt limit for Republicans to just turn around and pass tax cuts on a party line vote that blows a hole in the debt. Those are two issues we see as related. \u2026 We don\u2019t even know if Mnuchin really speaks for the president on this and we are waiting to see where other Republicans are.\u201d   Story Continued Below  A senior GOP lobbyist on Tuesday said to MM of Dems shouldering the burden on the debt limit: \u201cWhy would they do it? It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d So it\u2019s up to Republicans, who control Washington, to take the lead in lifting the borrowing limit.   And the idea among some conservatives that they will need \u201cconcessions\u201d in order to hike the limit doesn\u2019t make much sense. You can\u2019t hold yourself hostage. This isn\u2019t Blazing Saddles.   MORE on Mnuchin\u2019s quest for a clean debt limit bill is here from John Bresnahan and Seung Min Kim with an assist from MM.   TAX REFORM ROLL-OUT \u2014 The same lobbyist suggested that President Trump will do tax reform events in eight or nine states and could, as Larry Kudlow suggested, do a prime-time Oval Office address on the issue.   The key at the moment, this person said, is for the president to finally give up on health care for now and fully commit to moving on to taxes. \u201cEveryone else is ready for the hard pivot and the President needs to come along as well,\u201d this person said.   NO BIPARTISANSHIP ON TAXES \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cSenate Republicans are sticking to their plans to pass a tax bill with 50 Republican votes, despite Democratic pleas not to be sidelined as they were on health care.   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday reaffirmed the GOP's long-standing intention to shield any tax overhaul from a likely Democratic filibuster by using the procedural protections of budget reconciliation. \u2026 \u2018I don't think this is going to be 1986, when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code,\u2019 McConnell added. Read more.   POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook has more on the big money currently rolling out to push tax reform.  QUITE A TRANSCRIPT \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Hadas Gold hunted down the full transcript of Trump\u2019s interview with WSJ editor Gerard Baker and other Journal staffers last week. Why didn\u2019t the Journal post it? Well that\u2019s a very good and potentially troubling question. Lots to pull out including Trump referring to Jared Kushner as a \u201cgood boy.\u201d   Here\u2019s Trump killing Steve Bannon\u2019s tax hike on the rich idea: \u201cNo, that was not right. That was not a correct statement, no. \u2026 [L]ook, the job producers we\u2019re going to take great care of, but we have to take care of middle-income people in this country.\u201d   Trump on Yellen/Gary Cohn for Fed Chair: \u201cI have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I\u2019ve met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It\u2019s early to make the decision. \u2026   \u201cI do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I\u2019m not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that\u2019s not too strong. I mean, I\u2019ve seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar. \u2026 Yes, she is in the running to stay.\u201d  WSJ: Is Gary a candidate? (Laughter.)  PRESIDENT TRUMP: He doesn\u2019t know this, but yes, he is. (Laughter.)  WSJ: Are there other candidates?  PRESIDENT TRUMP: I actually think he likes what he\u2019s doing right now. \u2026 Gary is somebody that I\u2019ve gained great \u2014 I\u2019ve known Gary for a long time \u2014 but I\u2019ve gained great respect for Gary working with him. So Gary certainly would be in the mix.   \u201cI just don\u2019t know if he\u2019d like \u2014 this is off the record \u2014 if he wants to sit down. Interest rates will be moving up one-eighth of a point \u2026 I don\u2019t know that Gary would want it. I think Gary loves what he\u2019s doing, you know, and he\u2019s doing a very good job\u201d Full transcript.   CFPB\u2019S NEW DIGS \u2014 An avid MM reader emails: \u201cConstruction continues apace at the new CFPB headquarters, across the street from the Eisenhower Building. Is it really possible that the CFPB is going to be allowed to occupy prime real estate a stone\u2019s throw from the West Wing?   \u201cWould have thought West Virginia, or at least Northern Virginia, would be a more likely locale under this Administration, with OMB or some other part of the EOP taking that space.\u201d  GOP PROBES NCUA PAYMENTS \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Victoria Guida scoops: \u201cThe National Credit Union Administration is seeking to renegotiate the terms of a 2009 agreement with two outside law firms under which the agency has paid more than $1 billion to the attorneys, a sum that is raising alarms among House GOP lawmakers.  \u201cThat eye-popping figure was paid to the law firms as part of 26 cases they brought on behalf of NCUA, an independent regulator that oversees thousands of federal credit unions. \u2026 The lawyers, retained on a contingency fee basis, have helped NCUA recoup more than $5 billion from banks that sold faulty securities to the failed credit unions. Their cut is roughly a quarter, according to NCUA\u2019s website.\u201d Read more.

Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon have dissented.  President Donald Trump\u2019s business brain trust \u2014 originally these executives, plus some 50 other chief executive officers chosen to help shape White House policy \u2014 has so far come up short on big ideas.\u201d Read more.

MOOCH SPEAKS \u2014 Anthony Scaramucci to HuffPost\u2019s Vicky Ward on his infamous and fatal Ryan Lizza call: \u201cThe Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship. Most of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off.

Scott Garrett \u2014 one of the most vocal opponents of the Export-Import Bank while he was in Congress \u2014 agreed to speak with us about his nomination, but during the meeting, he wouldn\u2019t discuss his personal thoughts about the Bank and its mission \u2026   \u201cHe refused to confirm that he would unequivocally support reauthorizing the Bank \u2026 And he clearly knew very little about the critical work the Bank is doing to support small businesses and expand opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, which was both surprising and concerning\u201d   LEWANDOWSKI HAS DEAL WITH COMMUNITY CHOICE \u2014 Perhaps explaining his unprompted attack on CFPB Director Richard Cordray on TV this past weekend, NYT\u2019s Nick Confessore and Ken Vogel: \u201c[I]n July, after Mr. Lewandowski left Avenue, Community Choice Financial offered Mr. Lewandowski a $20,000-a-month retainer in return for \u2018strategic advice and counsel designed to further the goals of Community Choice Financial\u201d Read more.   STRONG PROJECTION FROM APPLE \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Webb: \u201cApple Inc. projected revenue in the current quarter that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, signaling strong sales of new iPhones scheduled for release later this year.

DEVOS DROPS STUDENT LOAN EFFORT \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Michael Stratford: \u201cEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos is abandoning her plans to overhaul how the federal government collects payments of student loan borrowers amid growing opposition from congressional Republicans and Democrats.  \u201cThe Education Department announced Tuesday that it halted the process of hiring a single company to manage all federal student loan payments \u2014 and plans to come up with a \u2018more innovative approach\u2019 after gathering feedback from the student loan industry and \u2018various stakeholders.\u2019\u201d Read more.   NEW GLASS-STEAGALL REPORT \u2014 Via CEI: \u201cCEI has a new Glass-Steagall report on why policymakers should reject calls by both Democrats and Republicans to bring back government rules separating commercial and investment banking.   \u201cThe report explains how the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 held back Main Street banks and their customers for most of the 20th Century and should not be allowed to similarly wreak havoc today\u201d Full report.   BANK STOCKS HIT POST-CRISIS HIGH \u2014 FT\u2019s Nicole Bullock, Eric Platt and Joe Rennison: \u201cU.S. financial stocks closed at the highest level in nearly 10 years on Tuesday as hopes for deregulation of banks grow and investors ditch technology stocks for the previously unloved banking sector.\u201d Read more.  DOW NEARS 22K \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Noel Randewich: \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average racked up a fifth straight record high on Tuesday and neared the 22,000 mark, powered by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other banks.  \u201cApple rose 0.89 percent as Wall Street awaited the largest publicly listed company's quarterly report after the bell, with the iPhone maker expected by analysts to post a 6-percent rise in revenue.

AUGUST COULD BRING BACK VOLATILITY \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Oliver Renick: \u201cForget Mayweather vs. McGregor. The real summer showdown may happen in the U.S. equity market: a battle between a seemingly impervious stretch of calm and the historically chaotic month of August.   \u201cAugust has brought the biggest monthly jumps in the VIX on record, with the gauge averaging a 12 percent climb over its 31 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back 20 years.\u201d Read more.  JULY SEES DECLINE IN AUTO SALES \u2014 AP\u2019s Dee-Ann Durbin: \u201cJuly saw the biggest year-over-year decline in U.S. vehicle sales so far this year, leaving automakers to hope that consumers are just waiting to pounce on Labor Day deals. U.S. sales of new cars and trucks fell 7 percent to 1.4 million in July, according to Autodata Corp. It was the seventh straight month of lower sales, and the biggest percentage drop so far this year.\u201d Read more.  EURO\u2019S BIG MONTH \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Alexandria Arnold: \u201cAfter the euro surged through a critical technical level last week, analysts who study charts to help guide their predictions are looking back to 2010 for perspective on how high it could rise  \u201cEurope\u2019s common currency traded at about $1.18 Tuesday, holding above the key $1.1714 mark that it breached July 26 for the first time since August 2015. The euro is coming off a five-month rally, its longest since 2013, propelled by interest-rate differentials that have gone in its favor and broad dollar weakness.\u201d Read more.  BITCOIN SPLITS \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Anna Irrera and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss: \u201cBitcoin's underlying software code was split on Tuesday, generating a new clone called \u2018Bitcoin Cash,\u2019 but the new virtual currency got off to a slow start due to lackluster support for its network.  \u201cThe initiative was headed by a small group of mostly China-based bitcoin miners \u2014 programmers who essentially operate the bitcoin network - who were not happy with scheduled improvements to the currency's technology meant to increase its capacity to process transactions\u201d Read more.  INSIDE GOLDMAN\u2019S STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF LAST PLACE \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Liz Hoffman: \u201c[In July] Goldman reported quarterly trading numbers that were the worst on Wall Street. Those followed a disappointing first quarter in which Goldman failed to catch an upswing in debt trading reported by rivals. A 40 percent second-quarter decline in fixed-income activity, which includes bonds traded by Pimco and its ilk, left Goldman with first-half trading revenue that trailed its major banking rivals \u2014 a first since Goldman went public in 1999.  \u201cThe slump has rattled executives, sparking a charm offensive designed to showcase a more customer-friendly Goldman, focused on solving clients\u2019 problems rather than steering them into trades that benefit the firm\u2019s bottom line.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  08/01/2017 08:00 AM EDT  BYE, BYE MOOCH \u2014 Well that was quick! We told you Monday that Anthony Scaramucci was is in deep, deep trouble. Not so much because of what he said about Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon but because the reaction to it was so strongly negative and drove President Donald Trump out of the spotlight, usually a death sentence. So it\u2019s not surprising that Trump put up no resistance when new chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine general, made his first order of business showing Mooch the door.   What we don\u2019t know for sure at this point: Whether Scaramucci will get his Ex-Im Bank job back. All Sarah Huckabee Sanders said was Mooch doesn\u2019t have the job \u201cat this time.\u201d Because if Scaramucci doesn\u2019t get the job back, he loses any shot at tax deferral for his sale of SkyBridge. HNA said Monday that the sale remains on track to close. But keep your eyes on that. Scaramucci did not return MM\u2019s calls and texts for comment on his status.   Story Continued Below  One source close to the Ex-Im bank said of Scaramucci coming back: \u201cLikely but not confirmed.\u201d   THE MOOCH\u2019s WILD RIDE via POLITICO\u2019s Josh Dawsey, Annie Karni, and Tara Palmeri: \u201cBy late in the weekend, Scaramucci knew his job could be in jeopardy. One person who spoke to Scaramucci before he showed up to work Monday said he was concerned about his job security but continued to think the New Yorker comments might blow over and his job might be saved, this person said. He was planning to announce communications hires soon\u201d Read more.   NOT GONNA BE MISSED \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepherd: \u201cVoters won\u2019t miss Anthony Scaramucci \u2026 In his brief tenure he made a mostly negative impression, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted last Thursday through Saturday\u201d Read more.   IS THE HARD PIVOT FINALLY HERE? \u2014 White House legislative director Marc Short on Monday laid out yet another super ambitious timetable for tax reform at a Koch Brothers network event, saying a bill would be introduced at the beginning of September, move through the House in October and the Senate in November. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans made clear they have no plans to try again to repeal Obamacare, which would theoretically make Short\u2019s timetable possible. But \u2026   There are the small matters of funding the government in September and raising the debt limit by October. Not to mention passing budget resolutions to set up a reconciliation vehicle for tax reform. And then there are the remaining issues to be resolved on taxes including the pass-through rate, expensing, the corporate and individual rate levels and the elimination of fiercely guarded deductions. Not easy. Not at all easy.   One senior administration official working on tax reform said of Short\u2019s timetable: \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d   One senior DC lobbyist on the timetable: \u201cProbably not doable. But not impossible. All the dominos would need to fall perfectly.\u201d   KUDLOW MORE SANGUINE \u2014 MM spoke with informal Trump adviser Larry Kudlow about the timetable: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good very good schedule. I think they have to decide whether to go big or small, whether to do the entire package including individual rates or skinny it down to just business rates and maybe increase the standard deduction. But they will figure that all out pretty fast \u2026   On if they don\u2019t do individual rates: \u201cBusiness taxes include pass-throughs that are often small businesses so they have to make that case. They have to make the cast that corporate tax cuts in general, the benefits are 70 percent to wage earners \u2026 You have to make the middle class part of this.\u201d   On making the sale: \u201cThe good news is they are going to sell it on the road. The president may do an Oval Office speech to the nation on it. The White House is much more prepared for a tax discussion than they were six months ago for a health care discussion. The spadework has been done and everyone is much more conversant on this. There are some issues to be resolved but they know their stuff.\u201d   NOT SO HOT ON PASS-THROUGH RATE CUT \u2014 American Bridge\u2019s Andrew Bates: \u201cNothing says 'populism' like a Treasury secretary from Goldman Sachs, who reports to an NEC director from Goldman Sachs, promising to crisscross the country with a Koch Brothers organization to sell a massive, veiled tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. This tax plan is shaping up to be a scam that'll rig the economy for the rich at everyone else's expense.\u201d   SO LONG O\u2019CARE REPEAL? \u2014 Per Reuters, Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch \u201csaid on Monday that senators for now are too divided to keep working on healthcare overhaul legislation and that he and other senior Republicans will take that message to the White House\u201d   And per POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201cSenate Republicans have no plans to revive their party-line attempts to repeal Obamacare this summer, despite \u2026 Trump\u2019s increasing frustration over the chamber\u2019s failed attempts last week to gut the law. \u2026   \u201cPrivately, Republican aides said there was essentially no chance that McConnell will take another shot at repealing Obamacare soon. On Monday, there was discussion among Senate staffers of a \u2018hard pivot to tax reform,\u2019 one Senate aide said.\u201d Read more.   U.S. SANCTIONS VENEZUELA \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt: \u201cThe Treasury Department announced \u2026 it is targeting Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro with sanctions, accusing him of widespread human rights abuses. Treasury said in a release that all of Maduro's assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction were frozen and that U.S. persons were prohibited from dealing with him\u201d Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY \u2014 Trump keeps up the tax reform push at an event this afternoon with small businesses \u2026 Senate Finance at 10:00 a.m. holds a hearing on \u201cAmerica's Affordable Housing Crisis: Challenges and Solutions\u201d \u2026 FHFA Director Watt speaks at 7:30 p.m. to the NAREB Annual Convention in New Orleans.  MORE ON McWILLIAMS FOR FDIC \u2014 Cowen\u2019s Jaret Seiberg: \u201cThis should be broadly positive for banks by providing the missing cog needed to advance regulatory relief proposals next year. If there is downside, it could be for the biggest banks as we suspect [Jelena] McWilliams will be a supporter of leverage capital rather than risk-based capital\u201d   HENSARLING PUSHES CORDRAY PROBE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Lorraine Woellert: \u201cHouse Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has asked for an investigation into whether CFPB Director Richard Cordray violated a ban on political activity by federal employees.  \u201cCordray might be weighing a run for governor in his home state of Ohio next year, a move that would require him to leave his post at the watchdog agency before his term expires. Cordray has not publicly stated his intention, and his bureau continues to publish rules and take enforcement actions\u201d Read more.   MNUCHIN: RAISE DEBT LIMIT BY SEPT. 29 \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt: \u201cTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told House and Senate leadership today that it's \u2018critical\u2019 for Congress to increase the nation's borrowing authority by Sept. 29. \u2018I urge Congress to act promptly on this important matter,\u2019 Mnuchin said in a letter.  WHAT IF TRUMP FIRED CORDRAY \u2014 Cowen\u2019s Jaret Seiberg: \u201cWe believe there would be a strong Democratic backlash if \u2026 Trump fired Richard Cordray as CFPB director. This backlash may make it impossible for Democrats to agree to even common sense changes to banking rules as part of the year-end spending bills. It also would provide little immediate relief given the time needed to confirm a Trump nominee.\u201d   WALL STREET LIVID OVER WELLS FARGO\u2019S LATEST SCANDAL \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Tae Kim: \u201cAnalysts are angry over the latest Wells Fargo scandal where hundreds of thousands of the bank's customers were overcharged. Wells Fargo shares fell 2.6 percent Friday after The New York Times first reported the news. The stock closed 1.2 percent higher Monday, meanwhile.  \u201cThe article cited a 60-page internal report, which revealed more than 800,000 of Wells Fargo's auto loan customers were charged for car insurance they did not need. Wells Fargo estimated the mistaken auto insurance sales would cost the bank $80 million in damages. Piper Jaffray said the true cost is likely understated.\u201d Read more.  INVESTORS DITCHING TECH STOCKS \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Luke Kawa: \u201cPigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Such a risk-averse adage appears to be front of mind for investors, who fled high-flying technology names at the fastest pace in nearly a decade last week. Outflows from PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index topped $3.7 billion for the five sessions ending July 28, the most since early November 2007\u201d Read more.  DOLLAR\u2019S FALL THREATENS FOREIGN STOCK MARKETS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Riva Gold and Mike Bird: \u201cA surprise fall in the U.S. dollar is taking the fizz out of international stock markets and prompting investors to damp overseas expectations for the months ahead.  \u201cEuropean and Japanese benchmarks \u2014 which were among the world\u2019s best performers in the spring \u2014 have lagged behind the S&P 500 since the dollar fully erased its postelection rally two months ago. Analysts are cutting their earnings forecasts for companies in these regions as the dollar\u2019s unexpected drop has upended more optimistic projections.\u201d Read more.  PENDING HOME SALES RISE \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Lucia Mutikani: \u201cContracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rebounded in June after three straight monthly declines, but the housing market remained constrained by a shortage of properties available for sale. Other data on Monday showed that factory activity in the Midwest slowed this month after hitting a three-year high in June, with manufacturers reporting declining orders\u201d Read more.  APPLE + INFLATION = BIG DEAL FOR MARKETS \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Patti Domm: \u201cAugust trading kicks off Tuesday on what could be one of the more important market days of the summer. The PCE inflation data report, which is closely watched by the Fed and a key to its decisions on interest rates, leads a series of major economic reports, including personal income and spending, and car sales.  \u201cBefore the bell, there are dozens of earnings reports, from companies such as Pfizer and Under Armour, but the market is really waiting for Apple earnings after the bell. Apple is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.57 per share, a nearly 11 percent gain, on a six percent jump in revenue to $44.89 billion in the June quarter, according to analyst-consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters.\u201d Read more.  GREENSPAN: NO BUBBLE IN STOCKS \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Oliver Renick and Liz McCormick: \u201cEquity bears hunting for excess in the stock market might be better off worrying about bond prices, Alan Greenspan says. That\u2019s where the actual bubble is, and when it pops, it\u2019ll be bad for everyone.  \u201c\u2019By any measure, real long-term interest rates are much too low and therefore unsustainable,\u2019 the former Federal Reserve chairman said in an interview. \u2018When they move higher they are likely to move reasonably fast. We are experiencing a bubble, not in stock prices but in bond prices. This is not discounted in the marketplace.\u2019\u201d Read more.  WORLD BANK\u2019S EXPANDING REMIT SPARKS DEBATE \u2014 FT\u2019s Kate Allen: \u201cThe World Bank is best known as a lender to emerging economies, but what is less widely appreciated is its substantial role as an asset manager \u2014 just one part of a much broader remit it has adopted in recent years.  \u201cNow, as it marks this month the 70th anniversary of its first loan, the institution finds its expanding operation attracting both praise and criticism. The bank, which was set up to fund postwar reconstruction in Europe, handles $184bn of assets for 65 clients including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and central banks and manages a $567bn derivatives portfolio.\u201d Read more.  LATE CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS STOKE FEARS FOR BANKS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s AnnaMaria Andriotis: \u201cCredit-card losses are mounting, a reversal from a six-year trend that could be a warning sign for markets and the broader economy.  \u201cThe average net charge-off rate for large U.S. card issuers \u2014 the percentage of outstanding debt that issuers write off as a loss \u2014 increased to 3.29 percent in the second quarter, its highest level in four years, according to Fitch Ratings.\u201d Read more.  ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014   BANKING IN SAMOA \u2014 American Banker\u2019s Rob Blackwell emails: \u201cI wrote a story about banking in American Samoa. It\u2019s more complicated than it might seem. The only U.S.-based institution pulled out three years ago, and the island\u2019s leaders have struggled to form their own institution.\u201d Read the piece.   FOXCONN\u2019S SWEET WISCONSIN DEAL \u2014 IBT\u2019s David Sirota and Jay Cassano: \u201cApple supplier Foxconn has in recent years been accused of poisoning waterways near its facilities in China. Now Republican Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is not only proposing to give the company a $3 billion taxpayer subsidy, his administration has also quietly slipped language into a bill that would exempt the Taiwanese conglomerate from state environmental protection laws.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/31/2017 08:00 AM EDT  FORGET ABOUT A TOP RATE TAX HIKE \u2014 MM spoke with a senior administration official late last week about White House senior strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s idea for a 44 percent top tax rate (up from the current 39.6 percent). This might not be a terrible idea and could help offset rate cuts for others. But it\u2019s completely contrary to GOP orthodoxy. This is not the party that raises taxes.   Per the senior official: \u201cThis is not something the president or anyone else in White House supports. It's what Democrats do.\u201d   Story Continued Below  THE MOOCH STUMBLES \u2014 Newly minted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci may have won his battle with ousted chief of staff Reince Priebus. But Priebus was on his way out anyway. And the Mooch becoming the story with his wild and expletive-ridden New Yorker tirade did not improve his standing with the boss.   Said the official: \u201cIt was a terrible week for Scaramucci there's no other way to put it. You went from being a fresh face and a breath of fresh air to saying all this nasty stuff about staff on the record. It couldn't have been much worse.\u201d The biggest problem is Scaramucci upstaged the president and that\u2019s a major no-no, even if Trump basically agreed with the thrust of Mooch's remarks.   Much More from Josh Dawsey and me here on the health care failure, Scaramucci and the arrival of retired Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff.   PATH AHEAD FOR TAX REFORM \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm: \u201cHouse Speaker Paul Ryan told conservative activists Friday that the Republicans\u2019 plan on tax reform is to create as many permanent changes as possible, while making others temporary to comply with budgetary rules.  \u201cAccording to multiple individuals present at a meeting in his office, Ryan said the top priority is to lower, as quickly as possible, overall business and individual tax rates, as well as some sort of enhanced write-offs (\u2018expensing\u2019) for businesses, with the aim of reaping the economic benefits headed into the 2018 midterm elections\u201d Read more.   ECONOMY STILL NOT ROARING \u2014 My piece from Friday on Q2 GP: \u201cThe U.S. economy bounced back to decent 2.6 percent growth in the second quarter, offering a modestly positive headline for \u2026 Trump after a stinging loss on health care and fresh turmoil inside the West Wing.  \u201cThe GDP report comes as Trump hopes to pivot away from Thursday night\u2019s health care debacle and turn his attention to tax reform and the economy. \u2026 But the number isn\u2019t nearly strong enough to blow those headlines off the front pages. And economists warn that even this modest boost could be short-lived\u201d Read more.   McWILLIAMS LEADS FOR FDIC \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Victoria Guida: \u201cRegional banker and former Senate aide Jelena McWilliams is under consideration to be the Trump administration\u2019s pick to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp \u2026 If nominated, McWilliams would round out \u2026 Trump\u2019s bank regulatory team. \u2026   \u201cThe importance of the FDIC chair has grown as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which gave the agency a key role in determining how banks should plan for the possibility of bankruptcy. \u2026   McWilliams, the executive vice president at Fifth Third Bank, is a former counsel to both Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), now the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and onetime Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)\u201d Read more.   LEWANDOWSKI TAKES ON CORDRAY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhem for MM: During an interview with NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 Sunday about Gen. John Kelly\u2019s ascendance to White House chief of staff, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski slipped in a shot at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray.  \u201cI think the general should re-look at firing Richard Cordray of the CFPB, he\u2019s a person that is now all but running for governor in the state of Ohio, he\u2019s sitting in federal office right now \u2026 \u201d Lewandowski said during the segment.  RANDOM TANGENT \u2014 Meet the Press host Chuck Todd pressed Lewandowski about the tangent, asking, \u201c[T]hat was sort of a random thing you just introduced there. What\u2019s with the focus on Mr. Cordray, how is that at the top of the agenda there?\u201d  Lewandowski cited three items on Trump\u2019s agenda: tax reform, the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, and building of a border wall, before pivoting to Cordray again. \u2018It\u2019s my recommendation to the president of the United States to fire Richard Cordray,\u2019 said Lewandowski, who reportedly has bragged to lobbying clients about his access to Trump.  CONFLICT? \u2014 Todd pressed Lewandowski on whether he represents clients with a bone to pick with the CFPB right now, and Lewandowski said \u201cno\u201d.   But the firm he co-founded with other Trump campaign alumni, Avenue Strategies, reported receiving $160,000 in lobbying fees from Community Choice Financial, Inc., an Ohio-based financial services firm whose business includes payday lending, an industry squarely at odds with the CFPB due to its proposed rulemaking in that area.  AN MM REMINDER \u2026 That the White House doesn\u2019t want to fire Cordray too soon and give him a blast of publicity ahead of a possible gubernatorial bid.

DRIVING THE WEEK \u2014 The administration is expected to focus on the increasingly dangerous North Korea problem by ratcheting up pressure on China (see Trump\u2019s tweets over the weekend) and engaging with South Korea. Not clear there are any great answers here \u2026 Trump holds a small business event at the White House on Tuesday \u2026   Trump is also expected to make a decision this week on continuing subsidy payments under Obamacare though lawsuits could force his hand on continuing to uphold promises made under the ACA, which remains the law of the land \u2026   Some Senate Republicans also suggest they are not giving up on Obamacare repeal and the White House wants no votes on anything else before health care, something that is not great for tax reform, funding the government past September and lifting the debt limit \u2026   Senate Finance Committee has a hearing on affordable housing at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday \u2026 July jobs report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. expected to show a gain of 180K with the jobless rate ticking down to 4.3 percent and wages up 0.3 percent.   JAVANKA LOOK TO TAMP DOWN EXPECTATIONS \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni and Eliana Johnson: \u201c[I]f Ivanka Trump and [Jared] Kushner, socially liberal former Democratic donors, remain influential voices with Trump on personnel decisions, they have so far had little effect on his policies.  \u201cNow, as Ivanka Trump runs up against some of limits of her power in the White House, she appears to be narrowing her objectives \u2014 and disappointing those progressives who had pinned their hopes on the president\u2019s family members exerting more of a moderating influence on his presidency\u201d Read more.   MEET JOHN KELLY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Andrew Restuccia, Bryan Bender and Josh Dawsey: \u201cWhen he officially becomes chief of staff on Monday, Kelly, a no-nonsense retired Marine Corps general, will be thrust into the center of the West Wing soap opera, where \u2026 Trump's policy agenda regularly gets preempted by feuding advisers and headline-grabbing scandals. \u2026   \u201c\u2018I think this is the best and last shot,' said one person close to Kelly. 'This is it.' \u2026 \u2018Kelly wants to have more of a pecking order among the staff and a more 'traditional' approach, one White House official said. But others in the White House said it's too early to make predictions. 'Everything is up in the air. Anyone who tells you they know anything is lying,' a White House official said\u201d Read more.   WH: NO VOTES BEFORE OBAMACARE REPEAL \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cThe Senate should not vote on anything else until it\u2019s voted again on repealing Obamacare, White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Sunday. \u2026 The House, which has passed an Obamacare repeal, is on its sumer break until after Labor Day, but the Senate plans to work at least another two weeks\u201d Read more.  COMPANIES POST MAJOR PROFIT GROWTH \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Theo Francis and Thomas Gryta: \u201cAmerica\u2019s largest companies are on pace to post two consecutive quarters of double-digit profit growth for the first time since 2011, helped by years of cost-cutting, a weaker dollar and stronger consumer spending.  \u201cEarnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11 percent in the second quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters, following a 15 percent increase in the first quarter. Close to 60 percent of the firms in the index have reported second-quarter results so far.\u201d Read more.  WALL STREET BRACES FOR IPHONE DELAYS \u2014 FT\u2019s Tim Bradshaw: \u201cWall Street is braced for delays to the launch of the next iPhone, as supply shortages and manufacturing problems threaten to push the smartphone\u2019s release later than Apple\u2019s usual September debut. Reports from Apple\u2019s supply chain have caused concern about a short-term squeeze on sales and could leave Apple vulnerable to renewed competition from Samsung.   \u201cInvestors will be examining Apple\u2019s guidance when it reports results on Tuesday for any indication of a delayed launch schedule. The quarterly figures are also likely to confirm that Samsung overtook Apple\u2019s quarterly profits in the three months to June.\u201d Read more.  WELLS FARGO CUTS 69 EXECUTIVE JOBS \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Akankshita Mukhopadhyay and Dan Freed: \u201cWells Fargo & Co said on Friday it is cutting 69 executive jobs at its retail unit, as part of a restructuring in the division. Some of the executives will retire with benefits while others may find positions elsewhere within the bank \u2026 Some of the executives may leave the bank  \u201c\u2019We have just completed the process of consolidating the Regional President and Area President roles into a new position, Region Bank President,\u2019 Mary Mack, senior executive vice president for community banking, said in an internal memo seen by Reuters.\u201d Read more.  ASIAN SHARES MOSTLY DIRECTIONLESS \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Cheang Ming: \u201cMajor Asian indexes were mostly directionless in early Monday trade, after geopolitical tensions in the Korean Peninsula ramped up in recent days and the dollar slipped on the back of U.S. GDP figures Friday.  \u201cJapan's Nikkei 225 edged down 0.07 percent and South Korea's Kospi was off by 0.06 percent in early trade. In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was higher by 0.14 percent, driven by strong showings in its materials and telecommunication services sub-indexes, which were up 0.93 percent and 0.88 percent, respectively.\u201d Read more.  UBER\u2019S CEO SEARCH KEEPS GETTING HARDER \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Greg Bensinger and Joann Lublin: \u201cFive weeks after Travis Kalanick\u2019s surprise resignation as chief executive of Uber Technologies Inc., the board of the now-leaderless company is wrestling with a thorny question.   \u201cShould it negotiate with SoftBank Group Corp. , which has in recent weeks approached Uber with a multibillion-dollar investment offer that could alter the course of the ride-sharing powerhouse? Or should it wait until after it hires a new chief executive to consider the offer?\u201d Read more.  PIMCO BRINGS IN $50B ACTIVE CASH \u2014 FT\u2019s Attracta Mooney: \u201cPimco has staged a \u2018remarkable turnround\u2019 to become the world\u2019s best-selling active mutual fund manager, after investors pulled hundreds of billions of dollars from the investment house following the departure of bond king Bill Gross in 2014.  \u201cA revival for the fixed income specialist also points to a wave of demand for bond funds this year, even as central banks around the world prepare to implement tighter monetary policies which could hit prices for such securities. Pimco attracted almost $50bn to its funds in the six months to the end of June.\u201d Read more.  FACEBOOK\u2019S SANDBERG LOOKS TO BOOST WOMEN\u2019S PAY \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Paul Sandle: \u201cFacebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg called on governments and companies to do more to close the gender pay gap on Sunday and said both girls and boys should be encouraged to become leaders from an early age. \u2018We need to start paying women well and we need the public policy and the corporate policy to get there,\u2019 she told the BBC. \u2018But certainly women applying for jobs at the same rate as men, women running for office at the same rate as men, that's got to be part of the answer.\u2019  \u201cThe issue of women earning less than men arose again earlier this month, when the BBC was forced to reveal the pay of its journalists and presenters. Men earning more than 150,000 pounds ($197,000) a year outnumbered women by two to one, and the broadcaster's top-ranking man received more than four times the amount of its highest-paid woman.\u201d Read more.  TRUMP\u2019S DOLLAR MESS \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Lananh Mguyen and Liz McCormick: \u201cPresident Donald Trump loves to trumpet the record run in U.S. stocks. \u2018Stock market hits another high with spirit and enthusiasm so positive,\u2019 he tweeted on July 12, in one of eight posts about the market this month.  \u201cBut he\u2019s hardly tweeted a word about another, less rosy measure of Trump\u2019s America: the U.S. dollar. The greenback has fallen hard on his watch and currency traders are now betting on even more declines.\u201d Read more.  U.S. WEIGHS SANCTIONS AGAINST VENEZUELA\u2019S OIL INDUSTRY \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Christopher Matthews and Jos de Crdoba: \u201cU.S. government officials are considering stepping up sanctions against Venezuela by targeting its vital oil industry, although an embargo against Venezuelan crude oil imports into the U.S. is off the table for now, people familiar with the deliberations say.  \u201cThe measures could be announced as early as Monday, the people say, after a vote Sunday pushed by embattled Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro to elect a special assembly that will rewrite the constitution. Venezuela\u2019s opposition is boycotting the vote, fearing the assembly could dissolve the opposition-controlled congress or postpone elections.\u201d Read more.  SWEDISH BANKS BREAK OUT THE ROBOTS \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Hanna Hoikkala and Niklas Magnusson: \u201cAida is the perfect employee: always courteous, always learning and, as she says, \u2018always at work, 24/7, 365 days a year.\u2019 Aida, of course, is not a person but a virtual customer-service representative that SEB AB, one of Sweden\u2019s biggest banks, is rolling out. The goal is to give the actual humans more time to engage in more complex tasks.  \u201cAfter blazing a trail in online and digital banking, Sweden\u2019s financial industry is now emerging as a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence. Besides Aida at SEB, there\u2019s Nova, which is a chatbot Nordea Bank AB is introducing at its life and pensions unit in Norway.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By VICTORIA GUIDA and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/28/2017 08:24 AM EDT  QUARTERLY GDP NUMBERS DAY \u2014 If 3 percent economic growth is the ultimate measure of success of the Trump administration, the White House may get a small taste of victory today when second-quarter GDP numbers are released. Actually, economists are expecting the economy to show just under 3 percent growth, but that may be enough for the White House to claim it\u2019s making progress in its pledge to push the country beyond the anemic growth of the Obama years.  The Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDP Now estimate sets an expectation of 2.8 percent, which would still be twice as fast as the first quarter\u2019s expansion. Whether that growth can be sustained through the year is open to question.  Story Continued Below  MUFG Union Bank's Chris Rupkey: \u201cNet, net, the economy still has legs in this long expansion from the end of the recession if [Thursday\u2019s] data on exported goods and durable goods orders are to be believed. Business spending on equipment is still rising at a good clip in the second quarter, and exports of capital goods in June are up sharply. Don\u2019t count this economy out yet is the message of today's economic news as this expansion could make a run at the longest upturn in the economy\u2019s fortunes in modern economic history looking back to the 70s. The only risk we see is that the economy is running out of workers to do the heavy lifting and make us grow with jobless claims hovering just above the lowest levels in decades. The economy's growth profile and outlook for continued expansion is better than you think.\u201d  ICYMI: Brookings Institution\u2019s Aaron Klein on how to achieve economic growth: \u201cWhat will improve economic growth? There are three I\u2019s that can do this: immigration, infrastructure, and investment. However, their ability to bring us up to 3% growth is both doubtful and irrelevant.\u201d Full piece here.  JUST IN: CEOs TO THROW WEIGHT BEHIND TAX REFORM \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook: \u201cThe Business Roundtable is embarking on a multi-million-dollar national TV and radio campaign, beginning in early August, to give tax reform extra momentum over the congressional recess. Done in cooperation with White House, Treasury, and House and Senate leadership, this is BRT\u2019s effort to cast a potential tax overhaul as a once-in-a-generation opportunity.  \u201c\u2018Members of Congress will hear from business leaders \u2014 and more importantly, their constituents \u2014 that tax reform is the single best way to increase investment in U.S. communities, create good jobs and promote a stronger economy,\u2019 said Joshua Bolten, President & CEO of Business Roundtable.\u201d Read more.  \u2019CAUSE THEY\u2019RE THE TAX MEN \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm: \u201cWhite House and congressional leaders officially acknowledged Thursday that a controversial tax on imports would be dropped from tax reform, but otherwise provided no new details on a broader plan they expect to start moving through Congress in the fall.  \u201cThe import tax, called border adjustability, was pushed by House Speaker Paul Ryan as a way to fund tax cuts, but it prompted a fierce backlash from retailers, other import-dependent industries and conservative activists. With that tax off the table, Congress, the White House and advocacy groups hope to present a more united front on tax reform, though other disagreements will surely flare as lawmakers work on a replacement.\u201d Read more.  BANK REG HEARING DEBRIEF \u2014 Federal Reserve nominee Randal Quarles and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Joseph Otting faced the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, and came out with relatively few, if any, scratches. This wasn\u2019t the first rodeo for Treasury veteran Quarles, who seemed relatively comfortable testifying (and therefore kept all his answers highly vague). Otting faced heat from Democrats over his past with OneWest, but more of the focus was on the Fed nominee sitting next to him.  From yours truly: \u201cThe Federal Reserve is set to shift course in its regulation of the nation's banks, but the result won\u2019t look anything like the rhetoric President Donald Trump has used in the past to bash Wall Street. At his nomination hearing Thursday, Randal Quarles, Trump\u2019s nominee for the Fed\u2019s top regulatory post, charted a vision of bank supervision that largely reflected the positions staked out by Fed Gov. Jerome Powell, who currently holds that job at the agency.\u201d Read more.  Transparency for stress tests? Quarles implicitly indicated he might go farther in making information available about the Fed\u2019s annual stress tests, pointing repeatedly to a \u201clack of transparency\u201d that he would like to change. But he added that because he had so few details on the content of the tests, he couldn\u2019t speak to what should specifically be made public.  Otting on regulation: \u201cThe capital structure that we have in place today is highly complex, and I think it needs to be examined. \u2026 Overall, I think the regulatory system we have in place today has resulted in banks understanding their risks much better.\u201d  MM included a regulatory analogy yesterday from an old Quarles speech about how one should be expected to miss two or three planes a year. He was read back that quote during his hearing and said it was \u201cprobably the most unfortunate use of language I\u2019ve ever made, and I do not stand behind that statement.\u201d  THE CFTC\u2019S WHITE WHALE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West and Catherine Boudreau: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s three nominees for the CFTC on Thursday pledged to complete work on a rule aimed at curbing speculation in energy commodities, a controversial regulation that has repeatedly been stalled over the years.  \u201cThe Senate Agriculture Committee\u2019s confirmation hearing for the three \u2014 Republicans Dawn Stump and Brian Quintenz and Democrat Rostin Behnam \u2014 underscored how one of the biggest issues facing the derivatives markets has not advanced since the last time a trio of agency nominees testified in March 2014. During Thursday's hearing, Stump, Quintenz and Behnam agreed that they would work to finalize the so-called position limits rule, which was included in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.\u201d Read more.  FOR THE UHHHHH, WHAT? FILE \u2014 White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza: \u201c\u2018The swamp will not defeat him,\u2019 he said, breaking into the third person. \u2018They\u2019re trying to resist me, but it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong on my financial disclosures, so they\u2019re going to have to go f \u2014 - themselves.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018What I want to do is I want to f \u2014 -ing kill all the leakers and I want to get the President\u2019s agenda on track so we can succeed for the American people.\u2019\u201d Read more.  WHITE HOUSE DRAMA AFFECTING MARKETS? \u2014 Fox Business\u2019 Charlie Gasparino: \u201cThis is not a good time to be rushing to make big bets either way. I can tell you that traders that I speak to, major investors are increasingly skittish about not just the lack of clarity on tax cuts but on the White House dysfunction. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but Reince Priebus, getting rid of Reince Priebus is considered at least a marginal negative on the markets. \u2026 This sort of drama between he and Scaramucci, I\u2019m hearing from traders it\u2019s starting to like bleed over. Like, what the hell is going on over there?\u201d  YOU MADE IT TO FRIDAY \u2014 Thanks for hanging with me this week.

IMPENDING DOOM FOR LIBOR \u2014 POLITICO Europe\u2019s Cat Contiguglia: \u201cFor the first time, a regulator has made it clear that it expects LIBOR to disappear, in less than five years. In a speech on Thursday, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s Chief Executive Andrew Bailey laid out a plan to manhandle the market off of the interbank lending rate by 2021. The overarching narrative was \u2018voluntary\u2019 market cooperation. But the transition would be underpinned by a strong regulatory influence to force banks to support LIBOR for the next four to five years and then to push the market off of it by the end of 2021.\u201d Read more.  VOLCKER TALK \u2014 The Financial Stability Oversight Council meets today and the Volcker rule is on the docket. There\u2019s some momentum behind regulatory relief around the rule, which prevents banks from trying to make money off short-term price changes in financial markets, through trades made on their own behalf. In the last week, regulators have taken a couple of targeted steps to give banks some wiggle room under some very specific provisions.  As for concrete changes to the rule, all of the agencies are actively looking at it, but don\u2019t expect any proposals until next year. If you\u2019re wondering about the realm of the doable, PwC has a new paper out this week that categorizes Volcker revisions based on their likelihood and impact. There are three moves they see as both highly likely and highly likely to have an impact: simplifying the definition of proprietary trading, making it easier to hedge, and reducing \u201ccompliance burden.\u201d The paper is here.  ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Ferris: \u201cThe House passed a $789 billion defense spending package Thursday to fund the Pentagon, veterans\u2019 benefits and nuclear programs, while supporting what GOP leaders have dubbed a "down payment" for President Donald Trump's border wall. In a 235-192 vote, the chamber wrapped up work on the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, H.R. 3219 (115), which bundles four of the 12 spending bills to fund the government beyond Sept. 30.\u201d Read more.  SEC MAKING PROGRESS ON CYBERSECURITY \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West: The Securities and Exchange Commission improved the security controls over its key financial systems and information, the Government Accountability Office said in a report on Thursday. But the agency still has work to do, including consistently protecting its network boundaries from possible intrusions, and identifying and authenticating users, among other things. Read the report.  STOCKS DIP \u2014 AP\u2019s Stan Choe: \u201cU.S. stock indexes pulled back from their record highs Thursday after drops for technology, health care and industrial stocks offset another big gain for telecoms.  \u201cThe Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 11 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,467 as of 3 p.m. Eastern time. Earlier in the day, it had been up by 6 points to extend its record run. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,731, and the Nasdaq composite fell 63 points, or 1 percent, to 6,359. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks fell 11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,431.\u201d Read more.  DOLLAR CLAWS BACK EARLY LOSSES \u2014 FT\u2019s Dave Shellock: \u201cThe dollar clawed back early losses against the euro, and Treasuries gave back some of the previous day\u2019s gains as the markets continued to digest Wednesday\u2019s policy statement from the Federal Reserve.  \u201cIt was the currency markets that grabbed the headlines as the dollar climbed off a two-and-a-half year low against the euro and held above the 111 level versus the yen. Sterling retreated from a 10-month high. Some in the markets pointed to news of a strong rise in headline U.S. durable goods orders last month, although the reading excluding transportation was less impressive.\u201d Read more.  BULL MARKET\u2019S GROWTH PROBLEM \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Justin Lahart: \u201cStocks are hitting records and valuations are at 15-year highs, both signs of confidence. But a closer look at what is driving the rally shows that the eight-year bull market may be nearing its end.  \u201cThe current earnings season makes it clear that investors are paying up for companies that are generating strong growth in earnings and revenues and ignoring or selling stocks where growth is anything less than stellar.

aV \u000a            By VICTORIA GUIDA and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/27/2017 08:00 AM EDT  TRUMP\u2019S BANK REGULATORY NOMINEES UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT \u2014 It\u2019s a big day in bank regulatory land: President Donald Trump\u2019s picks for Federal Reserve vice chair of supervision and comptroller of the currency will have their confirmation hearing this morning, yielding some insight into what the Trump era of bank regulation will bring. And what Trump\u2019s first Fed nominee plans to say about post-crisis rules sounds little different than those from anyone else at the central bank.  From your host, Victoria Guida, and Zach Warmbrodt: \u201cRandal Quarles, President Donald Trump's nominee to become the Federal Reserve vice chair of supervision, will tell the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that his goal is to refine post-crisis regulations while protecting the ability of the financial system to withstand shocks. \u2018Regulatory policies enacted since the financial crisis have improved the safety and soundness of the financial system,\u201d Quarles says in his prepared testimony obtained by POLITICO. \u201cBut as with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefits of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order.\u2019  Story Continued Below  \u201c \u2026 Joseph Otting, who has been nominated as comptroller of the currency, in his own testimony largely highlights his own background, without going into much detail on his regulatory philosophy. But he defends his time as CEO of OneWest, the bank co-founded by Steven Mnuchin, now Trump's Treasury secretary, that has faced criticism for its foreclosure practices.\u201d Read more.  PROGRESSIVE GROUPS JUMP INTO THE FRAY \u2014 Public opposition to Quarles and Otting had been relatively muted up until this past week, but progressive groups have lined up in recent days to oppose both.  Americans for Financial Reform criticized the Fed nominee for failing to take action to prevent the financial crisis. \u201cMr. Quarles was an important part of the GW Bush financial regulatory team that missed the signs of the oncoming financial crisis and failed to take effective action as Wall Street risks grew out of control,\u201d the group said in a letter to senators. \u201cHe has shown no evidence that he has learned sufficiently from this failure.\u201d  Fed Up and Popular Democracy raised warnings about Quarles\u2019 penchant for a strict monetary policy rule, as well as his regulatory attitude. \u201cWhile serving as a Treasury official earlier in his career, Quarles dismissed the notion that regulators should take \u2026 action against speculation and risk, saying, \u201cMarkets are always ahead of the regulators, and frankly that\u2019s how it should be. It\u2019s analogous to the advice that my father provided me that \u2018if you don't miss at least two or three planes a year, you're spending too much time in airports.\u2019 Quarles\u2019 cavalier and simplistic attitude toward regulation raises serious questions about whether he should be entrusted with the top regulatory job at the nation\u2019s foremost economic policymaking institution.\u201d  Public Citizen, meanwhile, blasted the Fed nominee for making money through his stakes in troubled or failed banks, citing a Reuters story that pointed to his role in Carlyle Group\u2019s investments in Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc. and BankUnited.  The group also hit Otting for \u201ctens of thousands of foreclosures, including 35,000 in California alone\u201d during his time at OneWest that \u201cwere concentrated in minority communities.\u201d And it cited OneWest subsidiary Financial Freedom\u2019s $89 million settlement with HUD, which covered claims that the unit had improperly collected government payments it didn\u2019t qualify for.  The California Reinvestment Coalition renewed its criticism of Otting, putting out fact sheets on CFPB complaints against OneWest while he was CEO and on his overall record at the helm of the bank.  QUARLES, IN HIS OWN WORDS \u2014 From his prepared testimony: \u201cI believe I am well qualified to undertake this role. \u2026 I have had experience over my career with the financial sector from many different points of view. \u2026 While this long experience has given me substantive insight into the issues that the Federal Reserve\u2019s Vice Chairman for Supervision will face, it has also reinforced my commitment to what I think is the single most important characteristic of a good policy maker: the need to be humble.\u201d  OTTING, IN HIS OWN WORDS \u2014 From his prepared testimony: \u201cWith the assistance of the many dedicated women and men of OneWest Bank, we were able to create the largest hometown bank headquartered in Southern California. It was able to grow beyond primarily mortgage originations to a bank with a full suite of products and services for local businesses, families and consumers. Helping build this company is something I am and will remain proud of.\u201d  ONE MORE WORD ON OTTING \u2014 From someone who has known him for years. Allan Zaremberg, president and CEO of the California Chamber of Commerce, described Otting as focused, direct and involved in his community.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that he has an inordinate amount of expertise in his industry, but he is also a straight shooter,\u201d Zaremberg told MM. \u201cYou know what he expects of you. And I would say there\u2019s no question that he\u2019s a person who expects people to follow the rules and to be ethical. \u2026 I would expect nothing less of him as a regulator.\u201d  BUSY, BUSY \u2014 Today\u2019s going to be a full morning on Capitol Hill for financial regulatory nerds. Before the hearing for Otting and Quarles, the Banking Committee will meet at 9:45 a.m. to consider the nominations of multiple HUD nominees, two Commerce nominees, as well as Trump\u2019s pick for assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions, Chris Campbell. But the fun doesn\u2019t stop there: The Senate Agriculture Committee at 9:30 a.m. will consider the nominations for three CFTC commissioner seats: Rostin Behnam, Brian Quintenz and Dawn Stump. Meanwhile, Mnuchin will testify before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. on international finance. Here are his opening remarks, obtained by POLITICO.  IT\u2019S ALMOST FRIDAY \u2014 Please send tips to me at vguida@politico.com or @vtg2, and email Aubree Eliza at aweaver@politico.com and follow her on Twitter @AubreeEWeaver. As always, you can reach Ben White at bwhite@politico.com and on Twitter @morningmoneyben.  THIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES \u2014 Patrick Temple-West on Dawn DeBerry Stump, one of the Republicans Trump has nominated to join the CFTC, and her career as a derivatives industry lobbyist.

COMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU \u2014 From your host: \u201cThe Federal Reserve's top policy-making body said [Wednesday] the central bank expects to start allowing some assets to roll off its $4.5 trillion balance sheet \u2018relatively soon,\u2019 signaling that its plan could be put into action as soon as September.\u201d And no rate hike, as expected.  UNIFIED TAX PLAN COMING THIS WEEK \u2014 Scoop from POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook: \u201cThe \u2018Big 6\u2019 tax reform group, composed of White House officials and congressional leaders, plans to release a broad-brush tax proposal [by the end of the week] before the House leaves for its August recess, according to six sources close to the administration, lobbyists and former Republican congressional staffers. More of a messaging document than a detailed policy blueprint, the plan is meant to present a unified front on tax reform after the Republicans\u2019 mixed and often fractured messages on its health care bills.\u201d Read more.  MM sidebar: Think this one will be longer than one page?  MOOCH WATCH, REDUX \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Lorraine Woellert: \u201cAnthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital.  The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. The disclosure form hasn\u2019t been previously reported.\u201d Read more.  Notable tidbit: \u201cScaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, foregoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer.\u201d  A \u2018NO\u2019 FOR GARRETT \u2014 Speaking of Ex-Im \u2026 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt: \u201cSen. Catherine Cortez Masto plans to vote against former Rep. Scott Garrett\u2019s nomination to lead the Export-Import Bank, a spokesman for the Nevada Democrat told POLITICO. The reasons are his views on LGBT issues and his record of trying to shut down the bank. Yesterday, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Nevada Manufacturers Association ran an ad designed to persuade Cortez Masto and her Republican Senate colleague, Dean Heller, to oppose Garrett\u2019s confirmation. A spokeswoman for Heller did not respond to a request for comment.  \u201cSen. Bob Corker, another Banking Committee member, is keeping more of an open mind. \u2018Who knows?\u2019 the Tennessee Republican told POLITICO, \u2018someone like that who\u2019s opposed it but now knows they\u2019re going to lead it could end up being an inspired choice.\u2019 Corker said he wanted to sit down and talk with Garrett, whom he described as a \u2018very knowledgeable guy.\u2019\u201d  WHAT STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT MONEY \u2014 US Bank on Wednesday rolled out a study on college students\u2019 financial literacy. One of the main findings is that students across the board wish they knew more about how to manage their money.  From the bank: \u201cCredit, in particular, stands out as an area where students continue to need more financial education during their college years: Many students believe common myths. For example, 55% of students do not know that their credit score is not impacted by how much money is in their bank account. There is a gap between white and multicultural students; 84 percent of white students say they know what a credit score is, compared with 77 percent of African-American students, 75 percent of Hispanic students and 68 percent of Asian students. There\u2019s a gender gap, too, although male students don\u2019t realize it. Females demonstrated more knowledge than males about what a credit score is used for.\u201d See the full results here.  FINRA GETS A NEW SHERIFF \u2014 Wall Street self-regulator FINRA has named Susan Schroeder as the head of its enforcement division. Schroeder, who joined FINRA in 2011, previously worked as deputy head of enforcement. Before her time at the organization, she was a partner in WilmerHale\u2019s Securities Litigation and Enforcement practice. The change is a result of FINRA360, the regulator\u2019s ongoing effort to optimize its regulatory operations.  ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014   WHY RUSSIA\u2019S MARKET IS RISING AFTER SANCTIONS BILL APPROVAL \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Ksenia Galouchko: \u201cAs it stands now, the most negative aspect of the bill for Russia, according to analysts, is that U.S. President Donald Trump can no longer ease or revoke the sanctions unilaterally, a possibility that boosted appetite for Russian assets after his election last year. Even that\u2019s less of a concern after Russia\u2019s economy \u2018rebalanced and adjusted\u2019 to the penalties, which were originally imposed as punishment for Moscow\u2019s role in the Ukraine crisis in 2014, according to Julian Rimmer at Investec Bank Plc in London.\u201d Read more.  MNUCHIN: CONSERVING CASH COSTING TAXPAYERS \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Kate Davidson: \u201cTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday his agency\u2019s efforts to conserve cash until Congress raises the federal borrowing limit impose a \u2018significant\u2019 cost on taxpayers. Government debt hit the borrowing limit in mid-March, and the Treasury has been using these \u2018extraordinary measures\u2019 since then to raise cash to keep paying the government\u2019s bills on time.  \u201cTestifying before a Senate panel Wednesday, Mr. Mnuchin repeated his previous remarks that the government can keep employing those measures and maintain enough cash to pay its bills \u2018through September.\u2019 But he acknowledged those efforts come with a cost to taxpayers, which one senator estimated to be around $2.5 billion.\u201d Read more.  ENTHUSIASM FOR CORPORATE DEBT NEARS POST-CRISIS HIGH \u2014 FT\u2019s Eric Platt: \u201cInvestor enthusiasm for corporate debt has neared levels not seen since before the start of the credit crisis, in a deepening endorsement of a global economic recovery that has already propelled U.S. stock markets to record heights.  \u201cIn several parts of the U.S. bond markets, companies are now able to raise money at a lower cost, relative to government bonds, than they have for the past decade \u2014 buoyed by quickening global growth and soothing noises from central banks.\u201d Read more.  STOCK INVESTORS CASHING IN ON \u2018SHARING ECONOMY\u2019 \u2014 CNBC\u2019s Rebecca Ungarino: \u201cAs the \u2018sharing economy\u2019 has expanded and morphed into a seeming catch-all term for companies that connect strangers through technology, equity investors may be able to cash in on the technology-driven trend. That\u2019s according to an exhaustive recent report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The report concludes the sharing economy's influence has blown up so tremendously in recent years, touching essentially every aspect of consumers\u2019 lives, that it\u2019s created a host of new business models.\u201d Read more.  AMAZON REACHES $500B \u2014 FT\u2019s Adam Samson: \u201cAmazon\u2019s market value on Wednesday smashed through the half-a-trillion dollar mark for the first time, underscoring the rapid appreciation in the e-commerce giant\u2019s share price. The market value has surged by $146.3bn since the end of 2016, rising as high as $502.6bn on the day. In comparison, Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer by revenues, has seen its market capitalisation tick up by $23bn in 2017 to $235.4bn.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By VICTORIA GUIDA and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/26/2017 08:00 AM EDT  DINGING CFPB, NOT EASY AS 1-2-3 \u2014 The House voted along party lines Tuesday to strike down a landmark rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but the real fight begins in the Senate. The debate over the rule, which bars the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts with financial firms, is the first real battle over CFPB in a Republican-controlled Congress, setting the stage for how the aggressive watchdog agency will fare going forward.   The upper chamber hasn\u2019t set a date for the vote, which is too close to call. Multiple Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, could vote with the Democrats to keep the rule in place. In the meantime, trial lawyers, consumer groups and civil rights advocates are lining up against the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and banking trade groups to save the regulation, issued earlier this month.  Story Continued Below  Consumer Bankers Association\u2019s Richard Hunt: \u201cConsumers\u2019 access to arbitration, which has long provided a faster, more cost-effective, and higher recovery alternative to class action lawsuits, should not be undermined by a harmful rule resulting from an incomplete study by the CFPB. The Bureau\u2019s own study shows the average consumer receives $5,400 in cash relief when using arbitration and just $32 through a class action suit.\u201d  Consumers Union\u2019s George Slover: \u201cRepealing the forced arbitration rule will make it harder for consumers to hold financial firms accountable for breaking the law or treating their customers unfairly. We urge the Senate to stand with consumers and reject this attempt to undo the CFPB\u2019s sensible rule limiting forced arbitration.\u201d  TRACKING THE CFPB \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Lorraine Woellert: \u201cAs both sides gear up for the Senate vote, progressives today rolled out a neat interactive bureau enforcement tracker that shows where CFPB has filed lawsuits, issued fines, who their targets were, and how many consumers were compensated. Allied Progress is behind the tool.\u201d  One more CFPB tidbit from Lorraine: the Native American Financial Services Association holds its first-ever fly-in today, with more than a dozen tribal leaders making the rounds on the Hill and at the White House. High on the group\u2019s agenda: a proposed CFPB rule on payday and small-dollar lending and complaints that the agency is unfairly cracking down on tribal lenders.  REPUBLICANS TO MEET WITH EMBATTLED EX-IM NOMINEE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt: \u201cSenate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and Sen. Richard Shelby said Tuesday they had plans to meet with former Rep. Scott Garrett, whose nomination as president of the Export-Import Bank is increasingly in doubt. A growing number of business groups are trying to block his confirmation, citing his track record of trying to kill the agency while in Congress. Crapo plans to meet with Garrett in the next few weeks.  \u201cShelby, who as the previous Banking Committee chairman tried to undercut the bank by declining to move nominees for its board, has emerged as one of Garrett\u2019s strongest defenders. The Alabama Republican sang Garrett\u2019s praises to Trump last week and is scheduled to meet with the nominee next week. \u2018If they were to drop him and send somebody else up, they\u2019ll have a fight on their hands,\u2019 Shelby said in an interview Tuesday.  \u201cBut Sen. Tim Scott, who also sits on the GOP side of the committee dais, threatened on Tuesday to oppose Garrett\u2019s confirmation \u2018absent a clear, public statement that ensures he will not dismantle the bank.\u2019 The National Association of Manufacturers is running a full-page newspaper ad in South Carolina today designed to put pressure on Scott to fight the nomination.  \u201cSen. Mike Rounds, a committee Republican who supports the bank, said in an interview he had been working out a time to meet Garrett. \u2018The Export-Import Bank is important to continue on, I think it has a reason for existence and I want to make sure that he agrees with me,\u2019 he said.  \u201cSen. Heidi Heitkamp, one of the bank\u2019s most outspoken supporters and one of the lawmakers fighting to reverse the nomination, said she was working with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to set up a time for Garrett to meet with Democrats. Heitkamp rejected Shelby\u2019s claim that there would be a fight if the administration dropped Garrett as the bank\u2019s president, saying there would be enough Republicans and Democrats to confirm someone else. \u2018This is the kind of stuff that they say because they've got all these right-wing groups that are basically trying to dictate the agenda here,\u2019 she said.\u201d  HEALTH CARE REPEAL EFFORT SHOWS LIFE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn, Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett: \u201cSenate Republicans voted Tuesday to open debate on repealing Obamacare, dramatically reviving an effort that many GOP lawmakers left for dead just a few days ago.\u201d But while debate continues on how to best approach repeal substantively, nine Republicans were opposed to the option on the table Tuesday night.  \u201cThe leading idea now is to repeal only a small portion of the health law in order to get a bill to a conference with the House. Republicans would aim to enact a bill repealing three parts of Obamacare: the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax, according to Republican sources. It could be expanded or altered depending on where the bulk of the conference is.\u201d Read more.

HERE COMES THE FED \u2014 Markets aren\u2019t expecting the Fed to announce a rate hike today, but the central bank could set the stage to begin shrinking its nearly $4.5 trillion in asset holdings following its September meeting.  Goldman Sachs\u2019 Daan Struyven: \u201cThe lack of any clear hint from Chair Yellen in her Humphrey-Hawkins testimony suggests that an announcement of balance sheet normalization this Wednesday is unlikely. However, we think it is more likely than not that the FOMC will hint towards an announcement in September, possibly by noting that it will happen \u2018soon\u2019 instead of the \u2018this year\u2019 language used in the June statement. We expect runoff to begin in October, following an announcement in September.\u201d  TRUMP ON FED CHAIR \u2014 In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump was asked whether NEC Director Gary Cohn is a candidate to head the central bank. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know this, but yes he is,\u201d the president replied. Asked about Janet Yellen, Trump said \u201cshe\u2019s in the running, absolutely.\u201d  WSJ\u2019s Kate Davidson: \u201cMr. Trump said there are \u2018two or three\u2019 other contenders in the mix, but declined to name any other potential candidates and said he probably wouldn\u2019t announce a nominee until the end of the year.\u201d Read more.  MM sidebar: MM is pretty sure Cohn is aware that he\u2019s in the running, Mr. President.  VETTING REGULATORY NOMINEES \u2014 President Donald Trump's nominees for two key bank regulatory slots \u2014 Randal Quarles for Fed vice chair of supervision and Joseph Otting for comptroller of the currency \u2014 have released their financial disclosures and ethics agreements. Otting, for example, will receive an accelerated $10.5 million payout from CIT Group. Read more.  CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FLYING HIGH \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Lucia Mutikani: \u201cU.S consumer confidence jumped to a near 16-year high in July amid optimism over the labor market while house prices maintained their upward trend in May, which could boost consumer spending after recent sluggishness. \u2026 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index surged to 121.1 this month, the second highest reading since 2000, from 117.3 in June. The rise in confidence came despite the health care impasse in Washington. The index hit a 16-year high of 124.9 in March.\u201d Read more.  MOOCH WATCH \u2014 Quartz\u2019s Zheping Huang: \u201cBack in January, flamboyant Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci, aka the Mooch, was set to join Donald Trump\u2019s White House as a senior advisor, but the position was later retracted amid concerns over his sale of his hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, to a subsidiary of HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate with deep ties to the country\u2019s ruling Communist Party. Now Scaramucci is back in the spotlight after being appointed White House communications chief last week. So is his secretive Chinese would-be business partner.  \u201cOn Monday (July 24), HNA disclosed a 29.5% ownership stake in the group has moved from a mysterious Chinese investor to a newly founded US-based charity, as the conglomerate faces increasing scrutiny over its aggressive overseas investments. The Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation, whose office address is in Midtown Manhattan, was registered in December, according to New York state records. Under the ownership reshuffle, the New York-registered nonprofit has become the single biggest shareholder of HNA.\u201d Read more.  In case you missed it, the sale of SkyBridge to HNA is reportedly being scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which examines foreign acquisitions or mergers with U.S. companies for potential national security concerns. According to WSJ\u2019s Kate O\u2019Keeffe and Michael C. Bender, Scaramucci could earn between $62.5 million and $125 million from the deal. Read more.  FINTECH CORNER \u2014   FIRST FINTECH STEPS UP TO OCC PLATE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm: \u201cWhile the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has its first fintech applicant for a national bank charter, the startup Varo Money doesn\u2019t plan to pursue the special purpose fintech charter proposed by former Comptroller Tom Curry. Rather, Varo Money \u2014 a startup that provides banking services over mobile phones \u2014 plans to fully become a national bank, like the former employer (Wells Fargo) of its CEO and co-founder Colin Walsh.  \u201cWhile Walsh said that Acting Comptroller Keith Noreika\u2019s remarks last week that the banking regulator would be open to such applications had no bearing on his company\u2019s decision \u2014 \u2018you don\u2019t write a bank charter application in a weekend,\u2019 he quipped \u2014 he acknowledged that the agency\u2019s approach towards innovation influenced Varo\u2019s decision.  \u201c\u2018We certainly seized on that opportunity,\u2019 Walsh told POLITICO. The company has already begun registering as a lender state-by-state but a national charter would allow it to begin offering deposits, credit cards, and home equity loans nationwide. Preliminary approval could happen before the end of the year, Walsh said regulators had told his company, though the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. must also sign off, since Varo plans to take deposits.\u201d  CFTC OKs BITCOIN OPTIONS EXCHANGE \u2014 More from Colin: \u201cThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved the first digital currency derivatives exchange. CFTC commissioners unanimously approved the application of LedgerX to clear digital currency options that are fully backed by collateral. That means eligible contract participants who trade through LedgerX must provide collateral that\u2019s able to cover the maximum possible loss they could have on their trades before a trade can be executed.\u201d Read more.  SEC WARNS ON VIRTUAL CURRENCIES \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West: \u201cIndividuals involved in a 2016 virtual currency offering that was later hacked will not face charges from the SEC, the agency said on Tuesday, while sending a warning to the industry. \u2026 Instead of pressing charges, the SEC fired a warning: People who offer and sell securities in the U.S. must follow the law.\u201d Read more.  BLOCK(CHAIN) PARTY \u2014 Blockchain technology company Bitfury kicked off its third annual blockchain summit last night on Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Necker Island with a number of notable guests, including former Estonian President Toomas Ilves, Afghan Citadel Software Company CEO Roya Mahboob, European Parliament Member Eva Kaili, and musician Imogen Heap. The summit\u2019s goal is \u201charnessing Blockchain technology for global good,\u201d Bitfury COO Jamie Smith said. It lasts until Saturday.  ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014   MANAFORT\u2019S MYSTERY BANKER \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Monte Reel and John McCormick: \u201cDoors opened for [Stephen] Calk, who was named to Trump\u2019s economic advisory panel and whose bank loaned millions to entities tied to Trump\u2019s one-time campaign manager, Paul Manafort. The Federal Savings Bank, where Calk is founder, chairman and chief executive officer, also got a \u2018seven-figure\u2019 investment from a firm run by one of Trump\u2019s closest friends, Howard Lorber, according to court testimony not previously reported. Calk, a former Army helicopter pilot, is now being drawn into various inquiries because of those loans to Manafort.\u201d Read more.  WELLS WANTS ACCIDENTALLY RELEASED CLIENT INFO BACK \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Laura Keller: \u201cWells Fargo & Co.\u2019s attorney who mistakenly released reams of sensitive data about wealthy clients asked a judge to order the records returned to the bank and they not be spread any further, after being leaked to a newspaper.\u201d Read more.  SILICON VALLEY\u2019S VENTURE FUNDS KEEP GROWING \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Eliot Brown: \u201cGiant venture-capital funds are piling up in Silicon Valley, a sign that foundations, pension funds and endowments are still willing to rush money into the risky startup sector despite lingering concerns about overheated valuations. \u2026 The influx of capital has helped startups stay private longer with money that in past eras would have been raised on the public markets.\u201d Read more.   CITI SETS OUT $60B CAPITAL RETURN PLAN \u2014 FT\u2019s Alistair Gray: \u201cCitigroup has signalled it will hand over at least $60bn to shareholders over the next three years as the U.S. bank tries to move on from a protracted period of post-crisis restructuring. Speaking at Citi\u2019s first investor day since 2008, chief executive Michael Corbat recognised that returns had disappointed shareholders but insisted the bank had \u2018crossed an inflection point.\u2019 \u2018Our restructuring is over,\u2019 he said.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By ZACHARY WARMBRODT and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/25/2017 08:00 AM EDT  DEMS\u2019 ECONOMIC PITCH: BIG IS BAD \u2014 House and Senate Democrats this week are beginning to roll out their \u201cBetter Deal\u201d economic agenda, echoing the kind of populist rhetoric that helped President Donald Trump win the White House.   Ideas in the plan include:  Story Continued Below  \u2014 A new crackdown on corporate mega-mergers   \u2014 Limits on prescription drug prices  \u2014 An employer tax credit for worker training  KEY QUOTE \u2014 \u201cOld-fashioned capitalism has broken down to the detriment of consumers,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says. \u201cAdam Smith has lost his way amidst these big corporations.\u201d Watch the Democrats' press conference here.  WHAT ABOUT THE BANKERS? \u2014 Schumer says Democrats will talk about issues dealing with Wall Street and \u201cshort-termism\u201d in \u201cfuture months.\u201d Within the Democratic Party there is a wide range of views on financial regulation, including those who want to ease rules for the industry and those who want to break up the biggest players.  Sen. Jack Reed, a senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, told POLITICO earlier this month that \u201cthere might be some attention\u201d given to improving the 2010 Dodd-Frank law but that the major focus of the agenda would be on boosting middle-class incomes and opportunities.  BEGINNING OF THE END FOR CFPB ARBITRATION RULE? \u2014 House Republicans today are expected to pass legislation that would block a CFPB rule banning mandatory arbitration language in consumers\u2019 contracts with credit card companies and banks.  The White House \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the resolution. It said the CFPB\u2019s rule \u201cwould benefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class-action lawsuits.\u201d Read more.  Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky on what\u2019s next \u2014 "We now peg the odds of the mandatory arbitration rule being reversed through the [Congressional Review Act] at 60 percent. The House will easily clear the measure, but the whip count in the Senate is still fluid at this juncture and appears to be losing its footing."  MORE FLOOD INSURANCE HURDLES FOR HENSARLING \u2014 House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling has agreed to drop a set of controversial proposals in his National Flood Insurance Program reauthorization package, which the House is trying pass before the program expires at the end of September.  But sources tell M.M. that Hensarling has more work to do to satisfy GOP leadership\u2019s request for a bill that the House can pass in an expedited manner under suspension of the rules, which requires two-thirds support.   It\u2019s unclear to what extent he has won over coastal Republicans and Democrats who are putting a priority on maintaining affordable coverage under the program, which helps protect millions of homeowners from the financial risks of flooding. They\u2019ve pushed back on some of Hensarling\u2019s attempts to reduce the government\u2019s exposure to those risks.  Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), who earlier this month led a letter signed by 25 other House Republicans outlining their opposition to the bill, is weighing the revised legislation Hensarling offered and hasn\u2019t endorsed it.  House Financial Services ranking member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) have been gathering signatures for their own letter to House leadership warning that they can\u2019t support the package.  One Republican lobbyist working on flood insurance tells M.M. \u2014 \u201cChairman Hensarling and [Sean] Duffy have bent over backwards trying to placate the flood caucus and have shown real leadership working out a deal that probably goes farther than they would like. I just don\u2019t see what else they can give on. If the flood caucus can\u2019t get on board with this compromise, you have to seriously question their sincerity as a negotiating partner.\u201d  GOOD TUESDAY MORNING \u2014 Thanks for bearing with your guest host.

DRIVING THE DAY \u2014 House Financial Services marks up six bills at 10 a.m. \u2026 The House votes on a Congressional Review Act resolution that would block the CFPB\u2019s arbitration rule \u2026 The Senate votes on whether to proceed on the GOP health care plan \u2026   GARRETT'S NEIGHBORS JOIN CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM \u2014 The New Jersey Business & Industry Association is calling on former Rep. Scott Garrett to withdraw his nomination to lead the Export-Import Bank. The New Jersey Republican is facing opposition from a growing chorus of business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, that want to block his confirmation. Companies that rely on the Export-Import Bank are uneasy with Garrett\u2019s appointment because he fought to shut down the agency while in Congress. Garrett has also faced a backlash for his views on homosexuality.   New Jersey Business & Industry Association President and CEO Michele Siekerka \u2014 \u201cThe Ex-Im Bank supports 243 New Jersey businesses that support 28,834 jobs in our state, so it is important that its leader be someone who believes in its mission to help level the playing field against foreign competitors.\u201d  Last week, POLITICO reported that Trump was reconsidering Garrett\u2019s nomination.  FIRST LOOK \u2014 Habitat for Humanity is joining SmarterSafer, a coalition of environmental groups, taxpayer advocates and insurers lobbying Congress on the National Flood Insurance Program. The group has been pushing lawmakers to expand access to the private flood insurance market, move more properties to risk-based rates and invest in mitigation.  Christopher Ptomey, Habitat for Humanity\u2019s senior director of government relations \u2014 \u201cOur first priority for NFIP reform is to better protect the families living in the affordable homes that Habitat builds in more than 1,300 communities nationwide. We urge the Senate Banking Committee to prioritize mitigation assistance and affordability for low-income households in their measure.\u201d  TRUMP NOMINEE WORKED WITH RUSSIAN BANK \u2014 NYT\u2019s Charlie Savage and Adam Goldman: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, Brian A. Benczkowski, has disclosed to Congress that he previously represented Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s largest financial institutions, whose owners have ties to President Vladimir V. Putin. \u2026 Mr. Benczkowski\u2019s law firm has offices around the world, and it represents many foreign clients. But his association with Alfa Bank in particular could be awkward in this period of heightened scrutiny on ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia.\u201d Read more.  NASDAQ PICKS UP, DOW LAGS \u2014 Reuters\u2019 Lewis Krauskopf: \u201cThe Nasdaq hit a record high on Monday ahead of a big week of technology earnings reports, while the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials lagged behind as losses in healthcare heavyweight Johnson & Johnson took a toll. The major U.S. indexes are trading around record-high levels with a huge batch of second-quarter corporate reports due this week.\u201d Read more.  HOME PRICES KEEP RISING \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Lorraine Woellert: \u201cHome prices have risen for 64 months straight, the National Association of Realtors reported. The last time we saw such an epic run of year-over-year price gains was \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 leading up to the collapse, when prices rose for a record 79 straight months. Few economists are fretting about another price bubble, but plenty are freaking out about the housing shortage that\u2019s driving up costs for buyers and renters alike.\u201d Read more.  One of those fretting economists, Chris Rupkey of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi \u2014 \u201cIt looks increasingly like there is a new housing bubble out there. \u2026 We are keeping our fingers crossed there will be a happy ending, but for the moment home prices are advancing like a runaway train with no brakeman aboard. Fed policy won't start taking away the punch bowl until the year 2020 at the earliest.\u201d  MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX BREAK HAS \u2018NO EFFECT\u2019 ON HOMEOWNERSHIP \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin: \u201cThe mortgage interest deduction, a sacred cow in the U.S. tax code, does nothing to promote homeownership, according to an academic paper released Monday, a finding that undermines one of the core justifications for the tax break. Letting taxpayers deduct mortgage interest encourages them to buy bigger homes and more expensive homes \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t change that fundamental decision about whether to buy in the first place.\u201d Read more.  IMF UPGRADES EUROZONE, JAPAN \u2014 AP: \u201cThe International Monetary Fund upgraded the economic outlook for Europe, Japan and China this year. But the fund left its forecast for global growth unchanged from an April forecast, partly because the United States is unlikely to get much help from tax cuts and higher spending.\u201d Read more.  DEUTSCHE BANK WEIGHS MOVING $350B TO FRANKFURT \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s William Canny and Steven Arons: \u201cDeutsche Bank AG may shift about 300 billion euros ($350 billion) from the balance sheet of its U.K. entity to Frankfurt as client trading and assets migrate to the continent following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, according to a person familiar with the matter.  \u201cThe project, dubbed Bowline, calls for trading in the German city to go live in September 2018 and for the assets to be moved over by March 2019, said the person, who asked for anonymity in discussing internal matters. Shifting 300 billion euros would be equivalent to almost a fifth of Deutsche Bank\u2019s balance sheet, which listed 1.59 trillion euros in total assets at the end of last year.\u201d Read more.

aV \u000a            By BEN WHITE and AUBREE ELIZA WEAVER  07/24/2017 08:00 AM EDT  HERE COMES THE MOOCH \u2014 Busy Friday at the White House with Anthony \u201cMooch\u201d Scaramucci finally getting a gig (and a big one!) and Sean Spicer heading for the exits. Chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon both got humbled by Scaramucci\u2019s appointment as communications director. Don\u2019t believe the spin about Mooch and Priebus being best buds. The chief of staff killed Mooch for other jobs and tried again here. He failed and he\u2019s now basically chief of staff in title only.   As of late Friday, West Wing sources told MM that Bannon was still furious and sulking and about even money to quit. In fact, Bannon seems more likely than Priebus to leave first. Why the animosity toward Scaramucci? For Priebus, he doesn\u2019t want another high-power, high profile adviser who can go straight to Trump, which Scaramucci can.   Story Continued Below  For Bannon, Scaramucci is just another Wall Street globalist who is tight with Gary Cohn and Dina Powell and believes in climate science, generally opposes protectionism and previously backed Scott Walker and Jeb Bush before grudgingly jumping on board the Trump Train.   For Wall Street, it\u2019s probably pretty good news. Mooch is a super smooth operator who has good relationships with both Republicans and Democrats and should be a help in the tax reform push as he understands all the issues at play.   But none of it will matter if Trump continues to sabotage himself with Tweets about presidential pardons or if the various Russia probes produce agenda-crushing revelations.   White House infighting is a real problem and Scaramucci could potentially improve things here. But it\u2019s the guy at the top that matters and so far the new communications director\u2019s main agenda items seem to be to flatter Trump and encourage him to be more like \u2026 Trump. Not sure that will work.   SOME MOOCH HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SUNDAY SHOWS \u2014 To CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: \u201cListen, there's obviously a communications problem, because there's a lot of things that we have done as it relates to executive orders, bills that have been signed, economic progress.\u201d   On briefings: \u201cSo, Sarah Huckabee is the president secretary. If you're asking me for my personal opinion \u2014 and maybe the president will be upset for giving my personal \u2014 we should put the cameras on. That's no problem. I don't think we need to have the cameras off.\u201d   On leaks, to Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday": \u201cOne of the first things I want to do, as was just mentioned, we got to get the leaks stopped \u2026 If we don't get the leaks stopped, I am a businessperson, and so I will take dramatic action to stop those leaks. \u2026   \u201cI'll be traveling with the president this week and we're going to focus and refine the messaging from the White House. He's one of the most effective communicators that's ever been born, and we're going to make sure that we get that message out directly to the American people\u201d   ICYMI, I wrote about Mooch\u2019s long journey to the White House communications director job on Friday.   OLD TWEETS \u2014 Mooch spent some of the weekend killing old Tweets (and being upfront by announcing he was doing it.) Via WaPo's Kristine Phillips: \u201cIn previous tweets, the Wall Street financier called Hillary Clinton 'incredibly competent\u2019 and appeared to be at odds with his new boss on issues such as gun control, climate change, Islam and illegal immigration.\u201d Read more.   MORE ON WHAT WE LEARNED from Mooch (who has had that nickname since 1978) on the Sunday shows.   TOUGH JOB AHEAD \u2014 Via CNN: \u201cThe President's approval rating has fallen 6 percentage points to the lowest at the six-month mark of any president since the dawn of modern public opinion polling, according to this week's ABC News/Washington Post poll. And Democrats lead Republicans when Americans are asked who they would vote for on a generic congressional ballot for 2018.  \u201cBut it's certainly not all positive news for the party opposing the White House. While history points to likely Democratic victories in the upcoming midterm elections, the numbers show a few Achilles' heels that threaten the opportunity\u201d Read more.   GOP NOT GIVING UP ON HEALTH CARE \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Brianna Ehley: \u201cIf the Senate\u2019s latest Obamacare repeal efforts collapse this week, Republicans will \u2018go back to the drawing board\u2019 and try again, Senate GOP conference chairman John Thune said on Sunday.   \u201cAs Republicans' efforts to undo the 2010 health care law hit seemingly insurmountable roadblocks, members of the party have floated working with Democrats to stabilize insurance markets or moving on to other priorities. But Thune, a Republican senator from South Dakota, insisted Sunday that the GOP is committed to dismantling the law\u201d   LAUNCHING TODAY: START-UP ADVOCACY GROUP \u2014 John Dearie emails: \u201cI left the Financial Services Forum at the end of June to launch a new 501(c)(3) organization called the Center for American Entrepreneurship (CAE), which will launch [Monday] \u2026 CAE\u2019s purpose is to work with policymakers in Washington, and the state and local levels across the country, to enhance policy circumstances for new business formation, survival, and growth. \u2026   \u201cThere are remarkable people from all over the country involved on CAE\u2019s board and Advisory Council, and we currently have funding from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Visa,Wells Fargo, UPS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, and are talking with many others\u201d Read more.

DRIVING THE WEEK \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to hold a vote Tuesday to begin debate on Obamacare repeal but at the moment he is short of the votes \u2026 Even if debate begins it\u2019s not clear what bill will get a vote \u2026 Trump is scheduled to make a \u201cstatement\u201d on health care Monday afternoon.  Trump hits the road (with the Mooch) for \u201cAmerican heroes\u201d week beginning Monday in West Virginia and continuing Tuesday in Ohio \u2026 Senate Banking on Thursday holds confirmation hearings for Joseph Otting to be Comptroller and Randy Quarles to be vice chairman of supervision at the Fed.  Senate Appropriations has a hearing Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. on the Treasury budget \u2026 Pew Charitable Trusts, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Senate Economic Mobility Caucus hold a forum on Monday at noon on \u201cEconomic Mobility, Economic Security, and the Future of Employment.\u201d   House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows, R-N.C., speaks at the Nat\u2019l Press Club \u2026 FOMC meets Tuesday and Wednesday but there are no projection updates and no press conference and no big changes are expected.   WALL STREET WAKING UP? \u2014 Stan Collender in Forbes: \u201cJamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, is one of the most powerful people on Wall Street and, therefore, in the world. That's why it was both amusing and frightening to hear that he was extremely unhappy about what's happening \u2026 or, more correctly, not happening \u2026 in Washington. \u2026   \u201cFor at least one glorious moment, everyone who is frustrated with Donald Trump and Congress had their feelings validated by one of Wall Street's brahmins. The scary part is that Dimon and his colleagues should have realized long before now that they had seriously misread the impact of the 2016 election\u201d Read more.   REGULATORS HEARING PREP \u2014 Cap Alpha\u2019s Ian Katz on Thursday\u2019s nomination hearing: \u201cQuarles and Otting will both get tough questions about their views on regulation, especially on rules affecting big banks. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) will almost surely get in a few zingers.   \u201cOtting in particular will take some heat because of his past as CEO of OneWest. But we expect both to get through the Senate confirmation process. It\u2019s likely that Quarles will pass with a more comfortable margin than Otting.  CLICK \u2014 Newt Gingrich sat down to talk Trump, tax reform and Obamacare with Larry Kudlow. Hear it here.   RAND PAUL: NOT ALWAYS BEST TO BUY AMERICAN \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Brent Griffiths: \u201cKentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Sunday that there\u2019s a reason why buying American-made goods is not always the best the option: cost. \u2018You know, I think all of us have this goal to buy American, but we have to think this thing through,\u2019 Paul told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s "State of the Union."  \u201cTapper was pressing Paul on why \u2026 Trump touted Made in the USA goods all week, but still hires foreign workers at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida and his company manufacturers a bevy of Trump-branded clothing products abroad.

aV \u000a            By ADAM CANCRYN (acancryn@politico.com)  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  CONGRESS LEAVES, OBAMACARE LIVES \u2014 Well, this certainly isn\u2019t where Republicans thought they\u2019d be after seven months with full control of Washington.   Obamacare is still the law of the land. Each of the many GOP repeal-and-replace plans is dead in the water. And as Congress officially heads home for August recess, there\u2019s renewed talk \u2014 against all odds \u2014 of bipartisanship on health care.   Story Continued Below  The last seven months have served as a master class in the difficulties of translating a simple mantra into complex legislation, particularly in doing it quickly and with almost no margin for error.   The result is a White House still searching for its first major legislative win and a Republican-controlled Congress that\u2019s rudderless on how to handle what\u2019s been the GOP\u2019s defining domestic policy issue for nearly a decade, Pro\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn and Paul Demko report.   "I still think something gets through, just because there's families that are not going to be able to afford their insurance, middle income families," said Bill Cassidy (R-La.). "It's going to be a lot of effort."  The August recess state of play. Obamacare is still standing, but it\u2019s mighty wobbly. President Donald Trump is mulling cutting off funding for the law\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies, a decision that would upend the already-anxious Obamacare markets, driving premiums up and some insurers out of the market altogether.  Even without that, there are currently 19 counties at risk of having no options for Obamacare coverage in 2018. And congressional Republicans are split between clinging to their repeal pledge, despite seeing no clear legislative direction, or working to fix Obamacare, and betraying their biggest promise to their base. More from Jen and Paul here.  LIBERTARIANS SCORE BIG ON 'RIGHT-TO-TRY' BILL \u2014 The Obamacare fight may be intractable, but Congress just advanced two major bills that could have much further-reaching effects on the nation\u2019s health care system.   First, the Senate voted unanimously to approve \u201cright-to-try\u201d legislation giving people with life-threatening disease access to unapproved experimental drugs, in what Pro\u2019s Sarah Karlin-Smith writes is a victory for libertarian advocates.   Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) shepherded the bill through the chamber, overcoming initial opposition from the pharmaceutical lobby to advance a proposal that would pave the way for patients to get drugs that haven't received FDA approval.   There\u2019s still some healthy skepticism of the bill; the legislation doesn\u2019t require drugmakers to make experimental treatments available, and the FDA\u2019s own compassionate use program already approves 99 percent of requests. But Johnson and libertarian backers like the Goldwater Institute have sold the measure as giving patients a \u201cright to hope.\u201d  "Opposing right-to-try laws is akin to opposing motherhood, apple pie, and the American flag; you just don't do it and expect to be re-elected," Wayne State University oncologist David Gorski wrote. More from Sarah here.   Senate clears FDA user fee reauthorization. The Senate also voted 94-1 to reauthorize the FDA's user fee programs for five years, clearing the way for the agency to continue collecting fees from the industry that make up roughly half its yearly budget. More for Pros here.  TRUMP TO GOP: GET BACK TO WORK ON REPEAL \u2014 Congressional Republicans might not know what to do about Obamacare, but the message from the White House couldn\u2019t be clearer: Dismantle Obamacare by any means necessary. Trump at a rally in West Virginia criticized Republican senators for falling short on repealing and replacing the law, and urged them to keep trying until they succeed.  \u201cCongress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they\u2019ve been talking about for seven years,\u201d he said, encouraging his supporters to pressure the GOP until it finds the votes. \u201cCall your congressmen, call your senators, call everybody. Get them to have the guts to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a disaster."  In between lamenting the failed health care vote, Trump did single out one senator for praise: West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito, who voted to open debate on Obamacare after weeks of holding out over concerns about the state's Medicaid expansion population.  What didn't get a mention. Trump held the rally in Huntington, W. Va., one of the towns hardest-hit by heroin and opioids in a state that's suffered most from the crisis. The president railed against drug dealers, gangs and narcotics pouring across the border from Mexico. But the opioid crisis itself never got a mention, nor did Trump offer any ideas for addressing a nationwide problem that he pledged during the campaign to solve.   \u000a                            President Donald Trump continues to criticize congressional Republicans for failing to send him an Obamacare repeal bill | Darron Cummings/AP Photo  THANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we're kicking off the August recess with a few days of substitute PULSErs.

Orrin Hatch, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a busy fall.\u201d A short list of health care items awaiting Congress when it comes back in September:  \u2014 Reauthorization of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  \u2014 CBO scores of a raft of repeal proposals, including the Graham-Cassidy plan and Ted Cruz\u2019s amendment letting states waive Obamacare protections  \u2014 Bipartisan HELP Committee and Finance Committee hearings   \u2014 Another White House decision on funding the cost-sharing subsidies  \u2014 Negotiating, and then passing (maybe), the first major bipartisan Obamacare bill stabilizing the market  ONE MORE AGENDA ITEM: TAX REFORM \u2014 Republicans are intent on overhauling the tax code when they return to Washington, a monumental effort that requires the GOP's full attention if it hopes to push a partisan tax bill through Congress in just the next few months.   But here's the big problem: Republicans just can't quit on trying to tear down Obamacare. The will-they-won't-they dance on repeal that consumed seven months of work and political will isn't likely to end any time soon, complicating GOP hopes of speeding through a rewrite of the nation's tax code, POLITICO's Bernie Becker and Aaron Lorenzo write.   SENATE WHIPAROUND: THE FLURRY OF FINAL HEALTH CARE VOTES  New mental health chief confirmed. Elinore McCance-Katz will be installed as HHS\u2019 first assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse, after the Senate voted to confirm her among a series of outstanding nominees across the administration. A clinical psychiatrist, McCance-Katz returns to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration just two years after she quit the agency amid disagreements with leadership.   Now, she\u2019s the SAMHSA\u2019s top official, Pro\u2019s Brianna Ehley reports. The assistant secretary for mental health post was created by the 21st Century Cures legislation, which aimed to elevate mental health issues within HHS. More for Pros here.

The Senate\u2019s final round of votes included unanimous consent for legislation aimed at ensuring doctors know when they\u2019re treating patients with opioid addiction. The bill backed by Sen. Joe Manchin requires HHS to develop best practices for docs and hospitals to note painkiller sensitivity in patients\u2019 charts, our eHealth colleague David Pittman writes, so they don\u2019t prescribe drugs to patients susceptible to overdose.  The legislation passed after revisions this week that maintain patient control over the sharing of addiction histories, a concession to privacy concerns. More for Pros here.  Hearing aid bill passes. Folded into the FDA user fee bill was a measure making hearing aids available over the counter. The legislation allows those with mild to moderate hearing loss to buy hearing aids without a prescription, a change that the AARP had championed as a way to drive down costs. It passed over the opposition of the hearing aid industry, which has argued that diagnosing the need for hearing aids should be left to professionals.  ** A message from PhRMA: ICYMI: National Sheriffs\u2019 Association says importation proposals \u201cwould jeopardize law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect the public health; threaten the safety of our drug supply; and endanger law enforcement officers, their canines, other first responders.\u201d http://onphr.ma/2hl5WFY **  WELCOME HOME GOP: 80 PERCENT OF VOTERS DISAPPROVE OF REPUBLICAN HEALTH CARE AGENDA \u2014 Voters surveyed in a Quinnipiac University poll overwhelmingly oppose the way congressional Republicans handled health care in their first seven months on the job \u2014 a period dominated by the failed bid to repeal and replace Obamacare. That includes 60 percent of self-identified Republicans, amid a broader sea change in support of preserving the current law, POLITICO's Jake Lahut writes. Just 22 percent still want to see a full repeal of Obamacare, while only 25 percent of respondents liked any of the GOP\u2019s replacement solutions.  What is getting support: Single payer. A narrow majority \u2014 51 percent \u2014 favor replacing Obamacare with a Medicare-for-all system, versus 38 percent opposing it. More from Jake here.  NEW PROBE INTO ZINKE-MURKOWSKI CALL ON HEALTH CARE \u2014 The Interior Department inspector general\u2019s office is investigating \u201cpotential legal and ethical violations\u201d tied to Secretary Ryan ZInke\u2019s call to Sen. Lisa Murkowski over her vote against opening debate on Obamacare repeal, it said in a letter to two House Democrats.   Zinke reportedly hinted that public land and energy projects in Alaska could suffer over Murkowski\u2019s opposition to the health care effort. Murkowski maintains she didn\u2019t take Zinke\u2019s call as a threat, and representatives for both say they maintain a good relationship.  New Jersey to let insurers refile 2018 rates \u2014 State regulators are giving insurers on the Obamacare markets another shot to submit their rates for 2018, in the latest sign of the anxiety tied to Trump's threats to end payments for cost-sharing subsidies.   The original rate-filing deadline was June 21, but the Christie administration opened the process back up after acknowledging that they may no longer reflect the risk insurers are taking on. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the state's largest insurer, said in a statement that "were it not for uncertainty surrounding the future of the [Affordable Care Act], Horizon would be proposing a single-digit rate increase." More for Pros here.  Texas House okays abortion reporting requirements for minors. State lawmakers tentatively approved a measure requiring doctors performing abortions on minors to report how the patient received consent for the procedure. Doctors would have to report where parental consent took place. If the patient received a judicial bypass, allowing her to waive parental consent, the report would have to include whether a doctor or another advocate helped her through the process. In case of an emergency abortion, the doctor would have to report whether there was time to obtain consent.  The Texas Medical Association, which rarely weighs in on abortion legislation, didn\u2019t take a formal position on the bill, but did provide testimony saying it \u201ccalls for details on deeply personal decisions and on medical care, and reporting that does not contribute to public health.\u201d  A similar measure already passed the state Senate earlier in the special session.  \u2014 House lawmakers also voted unanimously to restore funding to disabled children\u2019s therapy providers in Medicaid. The issue has become a lightning rod in a state with an already lean Medicaid program.  Two years ago, Texas cut the rate that pediatric providers received in Medicaid, saying that the rates were too high compared with other states. During the regular session earlier this year, state lawmakers drew repeated fire from disability and children\u2019s health advocates. The Senate tempered the House\u2019s call to fully reverse the cuts, restoring about 25 percent of the funding.  While the measure wasn\u2019t on the special session agenda laid out by Gov. Abbott earlier this summer, House lawmakers argued it was too important to ignore. After final approval in the House, the measure will head to the Senate.  The nonstop nature of the Trump era is keeping politicians from their regular nip-and-tuck sessions, Vanity Fair's Kenzie Bryant writes.  The New York Times editorial board examines Republicans' turn toward bipartisanship \u2014 and away from Donald Trump \u2014 on Obamacare.  HealthInsurance.org contributor Wendell Potter argues that Trump's threat to destroy Obamacare could inadvertently pave the way for a single-payer health care system.  Forget deciding whether Obamacare is a success or failure \u2014 we first need to agree on what we expect the law to actually accomplish, Bloomberg View's Megan McArdle writes.  The Atlantic's James Hamblin knows how to simultaneously make a dent on climate change and improve the nation's health: Eat beans instead of beef.  ** A message from PhRMA: Myth About Drug Importation: U.S. government would make sure medicines are safe. Fact: The government has authority to allow drug importation if the secretary of HHS certifies imports would not threaten the health and safety of Americans and would generate cost savings for consumers. No secretary has been able to do that. Proposals to allow the importation of drugs into the U.S. would expose Americans to unregulated drugs that U.S. officials cannot guarantee are safe. To date, no HHS secretary \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 has certified that imports would not threaten the health and safety of Americans or would generate cost savings for consumers. Allowing the importation of drugs from other countries into the U.S. would lead to potentially dangerous outcomes for patients and increase the burden on law enforcement to prevent unregulated medicines from harming Americans.

In fact, they could remain in place indefinitely, some officials told POLITICO's Josh Dawsey and Jennifer Haberkorn.  The administration has slowed its decision in order to hear from lawyers, who are studying how the payments could be ended and what legal liabilities the administration could face if the payments stop, according to administration officials. Lawyers and some administration officials have raised questions about ending the payments but are expected to offer an analysis later in August, West Wing officials said.   Story Continued Below  ... One official said the analysis could arrive as soon as next week. A different official said the White House was in no hurry and wanted to consider all factors before making a decision. Another payment is due approximately Aug. 22. More.  PULSE CHECK: Looking at Trump's legal threat to the ACA. Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor and expert on the ACA legal fight, breaks down the subsidy battle and Trump's legal predicament on this week's episode of POLITICO's health care podcast.  "This is the single biggest and most urgent question facing the Affordable Care Act, and how Trump resolves it will have political consequences for years to come," Bagley said. Listen here, starting at the 22:45 mark.  THE EMERGING BIPARTISAN PUSH ON ACA FACES STEEP CLIMB \u2014 Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and ranking Democrat Patty Murray of Washington are up against both time and history in their race to stabilize the shaky Obamacare markets and solidify their status as the chamber's top dealmakers.  The pair has just a few weeks before a self-imposed deadline to bridge deep partisan divisions over the health care law and pass a bill by the end of September, when insurance companies make their final decisions on 2018 Obamacare plans. And that's assuming they can first unite their own committee \u2014 a patchwork of political interests that includes iconoclastic conservative Rand Paul, moderate Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and liberal firebrands Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, POLITICO\u2019s Jennifer Haberkorn and Adam Cancryn write. More for Pros.  \u2026 Meanwhile, several conservative senators, as well as President Donald Trump, haven't given up on repealing the law outright. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Paul have balked at any proposal that aims to fix Obamacare rather than roll it back. "I think it would be a serious mistake to bail out the insurance companies instead of honoring our promise to repeal Obamacare," Cruz said.  CHIP debate could reopen Obamacare fight. Political fallout from Republicans' failed Obamacare repeal effort could complicate reauthorization of the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program covering millions of kids, POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan writes.  Lawmakers wrapped up in the bitter, monthslong fight over Obamacare repeal have made little progress on legislation extending CHIP, which is set to expire after September. Republican and Democratic lawmakers say lingering issues from the Obamacare debate could spill into CHIP negotiations with precious few days left on the legislative calendar before Sept. 30.  "People want to use CHIP for everything," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee that will spearhead the chamber's legislation. More for Pros.  \u2026 State officials and other groups tracking the issue believe Congress will eventually extend CHIP funding, due to the program's popularity, but they're still worried by the lack of legislative progress so far. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has held just a single hearing this year on reauthorizing CHIP. The Senate Finance Committee in May canceled its only scheduled hearing on CHIP as it started work on an Obamacare replacement.  AARP thanks Collins, Murkowski and McCain.

The Senate came to an agreement to vote on a clean version of the bill passed by the House earlier this year, H.R. 2430 (115), after agreeing to let Sen. Ron Johnson get a separate vote on an updated version of his right to try bill. Lawmakers are also expected to vote on two other drug related bills: Jessie's law and the Benefit Act.   Bipartisan leadership of the Senate HELP Committee worked on a compromise version of Johnson's bill which will allow seriously ill patients in all 50 states to skirt FDA when requesting access to experimental medicines. It added some new safety protections for patients to satisfy skeptical public health advocates. However, their response Wednesday was lukewarm.  Patti Zettler, a former FDA associate chief counsel, called the bill an \u201cimprovement,\u201d but she still takes issue with its underlying premise. \u201cThe fundamental problem with the bill is not resolved in that it still envisions removing, or drastically reducing, FDA's role in expanded access," said Zettler, referring to FDA's program for granting patients access to experimental drugs outside of clinical trials.

The shift finalized in a 2018 payment rule will incorporate additional data submitted by hospitals to determine how much each facility receives in payments to cover charity care. CMS had proposed the new requirements in the past, but held off on implementing them until this year, saying it\u2019ll continue to tweak the process to ensure hospitals accurately report their data.  \u201cGNYHA believes CMS has made an egregious error in implementing this policy,\u201d the Greater New York Health Association said in a statement. \u201cDespite this setback, we will continue to pursue an administrative remedy and go to Congress to mitigate this extremely unwise policy decision.\u201d  CMS will distribute roughly $6.8 billion to cover uncompensated care costs, up $800 million from the prior year.  Tom Price celebrates Part D premium decline. The HHS secretary in a statement on Wednesday noted that it's the first time in five years that Part D premiums have gone down, a development that PULSE first flagged in Wednesday's newsletter.  "Lowering drug costs is a key principle of President Trump\u2019s efforts to address the challenges in our healthcare system, and HHS is committed to doing all we can to increase the affordability and accessibility of care," Price said in a statement.  \u2026 PhRMA also praised the Medicare news as "further evidence that Part D continues to provide beneficiaries with access to affordable prescription drug coverage. Year after year, the monthly premiums have been and continue to be regularly stable."  Molina Healthcare drops out of two states. The insurer is exiting the Obamacare marketplaces in Wisconsin and Utah and is seeking to hike premiums by an average of 55 percent in the seven remaining states where it sells coverage, the company announced on Wednesday.  The changes are part of a restructuring designed to improve the company's finances following a major leadership shakeup earlier this year. Molina, which has 950,000 exchange customers, reported $230 million in losses in the second quarter of this year, compared to a $33 million profit during a comparable period in 2016. More for Pros.  Texas: Women not able to access family planning services. After Texas removed Planned Parenthood from its women\u2019s health program, the number of women accessing contraception in the state declined 41 percent from 2011 to 2016, according to a new report from the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities. Women getting health care services in the state declined 39 percent over that time.  Texas is now asking the Trump administration for an 1115 family planning waiver to help fund its Healthy Texas Women program, which doesn\u2019t include abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, POLITICO's Renuka Rayasam reports from Austin. But the CPPP report says that the state hasn\u2019t been able to fill the absence left by Planned Parenthood, which once served 40 percent of clients in the women\u2019s health program before it excluded abortion providers.  Texas: State still dead last when it comes to overall health care access and affordability. A report from the Episcopal Health Foundation found that 23 percent of Texas adults and 10 percent of children in the state still lack health insurance.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned he may yank key Obamacare payments if the law isn't repealed, but a court ruling on Tuesday throws a wrench into that plan.  NO RESOLUTION ON SUBSIDIES YET \u2014 There's still no announcement about whether the White House will continue funding Obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies, even after a scheduled administration meeting on Tuesday on the payments.   Story Continued Below  Trump has increasingly threatened to pull the payments and let the law implode \u2014 especially if the Senate refuses to vote on Obamacare repeal again. The administration soon faces a deadline to declare whether it will continue fighting a court ruling that the previous administration illegally made the payments without a congressional appropriation.   \u2014 If Trump nixes Obamacare subsidy, legal fight could drag on. That's because more than a dozen Democratic state attorneys general can intervene in the case, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. The AGs argue the Trump administration, by planning to dismantle Obamacare, doesn't represent their states' interests and therefore their residents could be harmed by its decisions. More for Pros.   Some experts like Jonathan Turley, who was the House's lead counsel at the lower court level but is no longer directly involved in the case, had argued that if the Trump administration dropped the appeal, the case should end.  \u2014Trump's own comments hurt him. The president's threats to eliminate the payments helped support the AGs' case, the court ruled. "In other words, President Trump\u2019s loose lips have once again created problems for his lawyers," Nicholas Bagley writes at The Incidental Economist. "Go figure."  \u2014 One other legal concern. John Bies, who was a top official in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration, says that the issue for insurers isn't whether the funds were legally appropriated \u2014 it's whether the government made the commitment. \u201cThe only impact of not paying them up front is the headache and additional cost of litigation \u2026 if the insurers sue, they're going to win," Bies said.  \u2014 Lamar Alexander to Trump: Pay the subsidies for now. The chairman of the Senate HELP Committee on Tuesday said he\u2019s urged Trump to pay the subsidies through September so Congress has time to craft a bipartisan stabilization plan that would include one year of funding for the payments.  \u201cWithout payment of these cost-sharing reductions, Americans will be hurt,\u201d Alexander said, adding that any stabilization legislation would need to be narrow and also include greater flexibility for states.  MEANWHILE \u2014 No significant movement on repeal, but some signs for repair. Senate Republicans continued to rebuff the White House's talking points and inch toward possible compromise.  \u2014McConnell: 'Our problem on health care was not the Democrats.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell again pushed back against Trump\u2019s pleas to kill the legislative filibuster to pass health care legislation, pointing out that the GOP didn't have sufficient Republican votes for a simple majority.   \u2026 McConnell added that the party still could repeal Obamacare on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, although didn't suggest the GOP would immediately take up health care again.  \u2014Alexander, Patty Murray plan bipartisan hearings to shore up Obamacare. The chairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee are planning a series of hearings aimed at crafting bipartisan legislation to shore up the markets by mid-September. Alexander emphasized that the work will be bipartisan and that the hearings will feature a range of health policy experts, including state insurance commissioners, patients and insurance industry representatives. More for Pros.  \u2014Lawmakers unmoved by Trump threat to ax money for their insurance. The president has said that if the Senate doesn't repeal the ACA, he'll take away their own health benefits.  "If that's what he wants to do, he ought to just do it," Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told POLITICO. But as "probably he's learned over the last couple of weeks, threats don't really go over particularly well. My advice would be to either do it or don't do it."

McCONNELL MOVES FDA BILL FORWARD \u2013 The Senate majority leader filed a motion to proceed to the FDA user fee reauthorization bill Tuesday night, meaning a procedural vote on the bill should come by Thursday, POLITICO's Sarah Karlin-Smith reports. However, GOP aides said leadership is working on an agreement that could speed up a vote on the bill, H.R. 2430 (115), so it could come sooner this week.  FIRST IN PULSE: MORE INSIDE LOOKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE's HEALTH STRATEGY \u2014 Budget chief Mick Mulvaney helped strategize around the Republican bill's CBO score and HHS Secretary Tom Price's team chipped in to provide political cover as the administration pushed forward on its health care strategy this spring, according to internal documents shared with PULSE.  The documents, which were obtained by the nonpartisan government transparency group American Oversight through a FOIA request, offer a look into how the Trump White House approached Obamacare repeal between January and May.  Among the takeaways from the 2,760-page document dump:  \u2014Mulvaney actively helped coordinate strategy. For instance, Mulvaney traded emails with House Speaker Paul Ryan's policy director about the bill's CBO score \u2014 a week before the CBO issued its devastating initial analysis on Republicans' replacement bill. Mulvaney also held a conference call with Anthem CEO Joe Swedish in mid-March, less than a week after Swedish broke with much of the health care industry to endorse the GOP bill.  \u2014Price and HHS provided cover. With the House's initial vote looming in March, the HHS secretary scheduled a series of one-one-calls that included Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) and other skeptical Republicans. Price also scheduled one-on-one calls with Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, who were openly concerned about the impact on their state.  The GOP Doctors Caucus also reached out to Price, scheduling a morning meeting a week before the initial vote and seeking to learn "how the Docs Caucus can be helpful in messaging the ACA replacement.\u201d  \u2026 The emails show how Price and his team were actively involved in providing political cover. \u201cYou and Lance [Leggitt] and the Secretary have been incredibly helpful to us in this process and I want to keep you very looped,\u201d the chief of staff for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Kristin Skrzycki, one of Price's top deputies. About two hours later, after Price issued letters of support for the reconciliation bills, McCarthy's chief of staff wrote to Skrzycki again: "Super, super helpful. Thank you, thank you."  \u201cIf you could convey your pleasure to the [White House], our operation would appreciate it,\u201d Skrzycki responded. \u201cWe\u2019ll sing praises from the Capitol balcony,\u201d McCarthy's staffer told her.  \u2014The administration redacted a lot. Hundreds of pages of the OMB-related documents were heavily redacted under a statute claiming that the messages were protected as inter-agency or intra-agency communications \u2014 even though the communications were with Congress. For instance, Mulvaney's communications with Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi were largely blacked out.  "We're very confident that the law will not support these redactions," said Austin Evers, the head of American Oversight who worked as a top lawyer in the Obama administration. "You're not allowed to use redactions to prevent embarrassment, and \u2026 these are deliberations between the administration and the Hill on a catastrophic legislature failure. I can imagine they don't want to show the public how the sausage was not made."  ** A message from PhRMA: ICYMI: National Sheriffs\u2019 Association says importation proposals \u201cwould jeopardize law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect the public health; threaten the safety of our drug supply; and endanger law enforcement officers, their canines, other first responders.\u201d http://onphr.ma/2hl5WFY **    SURGEON GENERAL NOMINEE: GUNS 'AREN\u2019T INHERENTLY A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM' \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s pick for surgeon general defended gun ownership at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, arguing that it\u2019s violent criminals \u2014 not the guns they use \u2014 that are the problem.   \u201cWhat we have to do is separate the tool from the perpetrator,\u201d Jerome Adams told the Senate HELP Committee. \u201cGuns and gun owners aren\u2019t inherently a public health problem, but the violence certainly is.\u201d  Adams\u2019 view differs sharply from his predecessor, Vivek Murthy, who had called for stronger gun control efforts.

Assistant secretary for health nominee Brett Giroir dodged on whether he thinks all qualified providers should receive Title X family planning funding, saying only that he\u2019ll implement whatever laws Congress passes.

But Giroir said he\u2019s \u201cobliged\u201d to enforce any restrictions placed on the program.   Senate HELP Committee reviews nominations of Adams, Giroir and three others today. Their nominations will be considered in executive session.  WSJ interview: Trump focused on speed of deal as benchmark for health plan success. The full transcript from Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal, which was conducted last Tuesday and scooped by POLITICO's Josh Dawsey and Hadas Gold, featured several asides about the speed of passing a bill, a recurring theme in the president's comments about health care.  The president \u2014 confident that Republicans' health bill would pass, ahead of Sen. John McCain's imminent return to Washington \u2014 bragged that he was far ahead of the pace of former President Barack Obama, who needed "a year and a half" to pass the Affordable Care Act. (It was actually 14 months into his first term.)  Trump also took a similar swing at his one-time presidential rival. "Hillary Clinton, smart person, she was the first lady of the country, her entire life was spent \u2014 her entire eight years was spent trying to get health care. Never even came close," Trump said in the interview. More.  ... Yes, Clinton took a leading role in the failed effort to reform the health system in the early 1990s as a first lady, not an elected politician. But she also played a substantial role in the creation of the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers millions of kids.   Part D premiums drop slightly. The average base monthly premium is $35, CMS announced this week, and it's the first time in five years that the average plan premium will drop, consulting group Avalere pointed out on Tuesday.   CVS implements new value-based drug programs. The nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager announced new programs for several types of cancer, obesity treatments and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder drugs as part of its 2018 prescription drug formulary.  The programs will require drug companies to provide CVS with \u201cadditional value\u201d if certain targets aren\u2019t met; manufacturers would be required to offer additional value if patients don\u2019t achieve a minimum level of weight reduction on obesity medicines, for example.   \u2026 It wasn't immediately clear what CVS means by \u201cadded value\u201d and how drug companies would compensate CVS and health plans in these instances, Sarah Karlin-Smith points out. But CVS says the programs are designed to align reimbursement to a pre-defined outcome (outcomes-based management) or establish a cost threshold based on expected utilization of a drug (cost cap-based contracting.) CVS excluded 17 new drugs on its standard formulary in 2018.  California: Obamacare rate hike would be 12.5 percent, but 24.9 percent if Trump kills Obamacare payments. Exchange officials warn the price of some plans would even double if the federal government stops funding critical Obamacare cost-sharing payments that defray the cost of covering low-income residents.   In what Covered California head Peter Lee called the "best worst-case scenario," the exchange will add a 12.4 percent surcharge on benchmark silver-tiered plans to reflect the lost federal payments. Consumers on those plans would then receive higher subsidies to offset the added cost. And insurers will offer comparable coverage outside the exchange for people who don't qualify for subsidies. More for Pros.  \u2026 Although all 11 plans offering coverage in the exchange will continue to sell next year, industry giant Anthem Blue Cross is dramatically shrinking its footprint.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  08/01/2017 10:03 AM EDT  The White House and Congress are increasingly far apart on their health care strategies, with the president continuing to threaten the individual insurance market and harangue the Senate on health care.  TRUMP'S DECISION ON SUBSIDIES LOOMING \u2014 President Donald Trump at any time could make good on a threat to scrap crucial Obamacare payments to insurers \u2014 a decision that could raise Obamacare customers\u2019 costs and potentially leave tens of thousands more without any coverage options next year, POLITICO's Paul Demko writes. And that decision could come as soon as today.  Story Continued Below  Insurers are incredibly skittish and may hike rates if Trump yanks the subsidies. "We should call this the sabotage surcharge, because that\u2019s literally what this is," said John Gorman, a health care consultant who works with many insurers. "The insurance industry should tattoo this on Trump\u2019s forehead." Some Republicans in Congress also are talking about the need to shore up the market, not destabilize it. More for Pros.  Monday's issue of PULSE explained how Trump's strategy to defund the Obamacare payments could backfire.  WHITE HOUSE URGING SENATE: DON'T QUIT ON HEALTH REFORM \u2014 The administration is trying to rebuild momentum for Obamacare repeal, and hosted a meeting Monday between Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, HHS Secretary Tom Price, several GOP governors and top aides to Trump.  Attendees left the meeting saying that it was positive and productive. "I am encouraged that there is a new commitment to finding a solution that is inclusive of the governors," Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. More  \u2014 How the latest plan, Graham-Cassidy, would work. The plan authored by Cassidy and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham would send billions of dollars in federal funding set aside for Obamacare directly to states in the form of annual block grants, and give them near-complete control over how to use the money. States could pour funds into ensuring Obamacare continues to function, the senators said. And those states that don't would also be free to scrap their health care systems and start anew with little federal interference, POLITICO's Adam Cancryn reports.  More for Pros. | See Graham-Cassidy bill text  GOP SENATORS TO WHITE HOUSE: THANKS, BUT NO THANKS \u2014 Leaders say they lack the votes on health care and don't see a path to getting them, with Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins remaining hard no's on repeal proposals and Sen. John McCain out for weeks to treat his brain cancer.  "Until somebody shows us a way to get that elusive 50th vote, I think it's over,\u201d said Sen.

ON TAP TODAY \u2014 The Senate HELP Committee holds a 2:30 p.m. hearing on the nominations of five senior HHS appointees: Lance Robertson to be assistant HHS secretary for aging; Brett Giroir to be assistant HHS secretary for health; Robert Kadlec to be assistant HHS secretary for preparedness and response; Elinore McCance-Katz to be assistant HHS secretary for mental health and substance use; and Jerome Adams to be Surgeon General.

COMMISSION TELLS TRUMP: DECLARE OPIOID EPIDEMIC A 'NATIONAL EMERGENCY' \u2014 A presidential commission on opioid addiction is recommending that the federal government ramp up federal funding to address the crisis, just as congressional Republicans look to cut Medicaid funding as part of Obamacare repeal efforts, POLITICO's Katie Jennings reports.  The commission's interim report calls for more money for substance abuse treatment, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and helping states enhance their prescription monitoring programs. The first step would be for Trump to declare drug addiction, which kills more than 142 Americans a day, a national emergency.  More. | Read the interim report.  CBO: DRUG IMPORTATION AMENDMENT COULD SAVE $6.8 BILLION \u2014 A drug importation bill introduced by Sens. Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Bob Casey in February would save the government $6.8 billion over 10 years, per a CBO analysis. Sanders may try and force a vote on the bill as an amendment to FDA user fee reauthorization, when the upper chamber takes up the must-pass funding bill later this month or in early September.   And the bill has a good shot of passing, POLITICO's Sarah Karlin-Smith notes. While a drug importation amendment failed 46-52 in January, that legislation got the support of 12 Republicans. Although Booker and Casey were among the 13 Democrats who opposed it, the two men joined Sanders to craft a proposal to more thoroughly address safety concerns surrounding importation.   The Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act (S. 469 (115)) would require HHS to issue regulations permitting wholesalers, licensed U.S. pharmacies and individuals to import drugs from licensed Canadian sellers that are manufactured at facilities inspected by FDA. Eventually, HHS could expand the rules to allow importation from other countries. Drug importation has been a politically popular solution to address the high cost of U.S. drugs and has been endorsed by Trump.  Rand Paul says Trump studying 'executive action' on health care. The Kentucky senator said the president is weighing some form of executive action after the Senate's failure on health care last week, Reuters reported.  \u2026 Paul said that he told the president that he believed Trump had the authority to create association health plans. The concept \u2014 a pet topic of the Kentucky senator \u2014 would allow small businesses to band together through trade associations and other groups to negotiate for health insurance. Insurance commissioners have raised questions about who would regulate plans that span state lines.  Obamacare shoppers mistakenly warned that coverage at risk.

CMS rolls back data penalty on inpatient rehab facilities. CMS is eliminating a 25 percent penalty levied on inpatient rehab facilities that are late in reporting certain patient data, it said on Monday.

Covered California today will release its 2018 insurance rates, a highly anticipated bellwether showing how a state that fully embraced Obamacare is faring under the market uncertainty. What to expect: the release of two sets of rates \u2014 one that assumed the cost-sharing subsidies will continue to be funded, and a second, presumably higher set of rates without the CSRs.  Covered California has come up with a potentially ingenious plan to help mitigate the impact of losing the funds, POLITICO's Victoria Colliver writes from Sacramento. The exchange will allow insurers to artificially load the rate increases onto the Silver-tier plans, where consumers will receive higher subsidies to offset those increases, while making insurers offer consumers who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies comparable options outside the exchange.   \u201cThis announcement will show if Covered California\u2019s creativity will be successful to hold consumers harmless, if the Trump Administration in fact carries out its threat,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California.  Texas: Efforts to address maternal mortality hit political realities. The House tentatively approved a handful of bills on Monday afternoon that would extend the sunset date of the state\u2019s maternal mortality task force from 2019 to 2023 and direct the body to look more closely at related factors like economic disparities.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  MUST-READ: "How Republicans got stuck on repeal," by POLITICO's Jennifer Haberkorn, who offers a sweeping look at how a promise to repeal-and-replace the ACA on Day 1 turned into a six-month morass that they still don't know how to get out of. More.  DECISION ON OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES COMING \u2014 MAYBE BY TOMORROW. Senior administration officials are meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss the billions of dollars that are owed to insurance companies through Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program, two administration sources tell POLITICO. A decision could be made at that meeting and announced shortly thereafter.  Story Continued Below  Trump has repeatedly threatened to yank the subsidies as leverage to force Congress to act on repeal. But \u2014 so far \u2014 the administration has made the monthly payments.  HOW THE SUBSIDY THREAT COULD BACKFIRE \u2014 If Trump does pull the subsidies now, the ACA markets could swiftly implode as insurers pull out, rather than risk massive losses, or they could hike their prices to make up for the lost funding. Either outcome would have immediate effects for the 10 million Americans who shop the exchanges and the millions more who shop off of them.  But canceling the subsidies could trigger multiple problems for Trump.  \u2014 Problem #1: The feds might end up spending more next year. Even if the subsidies get pulled, "we expect most [insurers] who have filed an initial application for 2018 to remain in the marketplace," Standard and Poors wrote on Friday. But the plans would look for ways to offset the lost funding, most likely hiking the prices of their benchmark silver plans. That means the value of the ACA's tax credits would go up dramatically and the federal government would spend more.  "If issuers loaded the cost of unfunded CSRs onto their silver plans, as we think they will, lower-income people could qualify for very low cost or free bronze coverage and for gold plans at relatively low premiums," Kurt Giesa of Oliver Wyman told PULSE. That could lure new customers, Giesa added, and "this could cost the federal government a substantial amount in new premium subsidies."  An earlier Kaiser Family Foundation estimate projected that defunding the CSRs would cost taxpayers an additional $2.3 billion.  \u2014 Problem #2: There would likely be lawsuits. Insurers have signaled that they'd sue over CSRs and there's precedent to believe them.  There already are nearly two dozen active lawsuits over the ACA's risk corridor payments, which Republicans in Congress significantly restricted, POLITICO's Paul Demko writes. \u201c[The Obama administration] repeatedly assured us it was there and it would be a clear obligation of the government,\u201d said Tom Policelli, CEO of Minuteman Health, which is among those suing the government. \u201cEven the federal government is subject to the rules.\u201d More for Pros.  \u2014 Problem #3: There could be more momentum on Capitol Hill to address CSRs. Bipartisan lawmakers in both chambers have said the payments need to be made, and funding was included in the now-abandoned Obamacare repeal-and-replacement bill.  "I\u2019m troubled by the uncertainty that has been created by the administration," Maine Sen. Susan Collins \u2014 a key holdout on the ACA repeal bill \u2014 said on "Meet the Press" on Sunday. "That\u2019s one thing that Congress needs to end. We need to make very clear that that subsidy is important to those very low income people and we need to appropriate the money to ensure that it continues." But the eagerness to prop up ACA markets isn't shared by all Republicans.  CENTRIST LAWMAKERS WANT TO FUND CSRs \u2014 The Problem Solvers caucus, a bipartisan group of 43 House lawmakers that includes notable names like GOP Rep. Fred Upton, will release a package of proposals today that include funding Obamacare's subsidies, POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Paul Demko scooped last night.  The group also wants to:  \u2014 Change Obamacare's employer mandate so that it applies only to companies with more than 500 workers.  \u2014 Create a federal stability fund that states can tap to reduce premiums and other costs for people with extremely expensive medical needs.  \u2014 Scrap Obamacare\u2019s medical-device tax, an idea that has received bipartisan support in the past.  More.  \u2026 The proposal got plaudits from Andy Slavitt, who led CMS during the Obama administration. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really serious and good start that can be worked through,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it becomes the basis for further conversations and agreement.\u201d   \u000a                            President Donald Trump is weighing a strategy to gut key pieces of Obamacare. | Getty  TOM PRICE DANCES AROUND TRUMP's 'LET IT IMPLODE' COMMENTS \u2014 The HHS Secretary was repeatedly asked by ABC's Martha Raddatz to clarify: Will the president take actions to make the ACA collapse?  "'Let Obamacare implode, then deal,'" Raddatz said, referencing Trump's tweets and comments. "What does that mean?"  "I think what that does is punctuate the seriousness with which he understands the American people are having to deal with the current situation," Price responded.  \u2026 Price did say on "Meet the Press" that he would "follow the law of the land" \u2014 but added that Americans' "health and wellbeing is being harmed right now by the current law."  REGULATORS CALL ON CONGRESS TO FIX MARKETS BEFORE AUGUST RECESS \u2014 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners on Friday also urged lawmakers to immediately fund the CSRs through 2018 and appropriate other funds long-term to help states shore up their markets.  Their statement: "We are deeply concerned that Washington's preoccupation with the political ramifications of this debate distract from the real-world implications being felt, as we speak, by Americans who are simply trying to go to the doctor, get care, or battle illness and find a way to pay for it all for themselves and their loved ones."

Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy and Dean Heller met with the White House on Friday in an attempt to write legislation that could get 50 Republican votes, POLITICO's Burgess Everett, Josh Dawsey and Rachael Bade reported.   The proposal would block grant federal health care funding to the states and keep much of Obamacare\u2019s tax regime.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT'S NEXT  Senate Republicans' years-long push to repeal Obamacare is dead \u2014 for now \u2014after a shocking late-night defeat. And that will put the short-term focus back on HHS and the Trump administration, which again face looming decisions about the fate of the ACA markets.  Story Continued Below  49-51. That was the margin of the Senate vote and at 1:38 a.m. today, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared defeat and pulled the Obamacare repeal reconciliation measure from the floor.   Republicans left the Capitol in the early hours of Friday morning disappointed in the defeat. Some said they were privately relieved now that two months of high drama are over. But what's next is uncertain.  The GOP thought they had the votes; Senate leadership was optimistic throughout the day and Vice President Mike Pence made a near-midnight trip to the Capitol to break a tie if Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined with Democrats as expected. But Sen. John McCain \u2014 after cryptically telling reporters "watch the show" \u2014 broke with his party and withstood furious lobbying. His vote against the bill provoked audible gasps and scattered applause. Watch that moment.  POLITICO's John Bresnahan, Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim have details from the gripping floor drama. More for Pros.  McCONNELL: 'A DISAPPOINTMENT INDEED' \u2014 Speaking after the failed vote, the majority leader blamed Democrats for not engaging "in a serious way" in efforts to patch the health care law. "I imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are celebrating, probably pretty happy about this," a seemingly stunned McConnell said from the floor.   'IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON' \u2014 McConnell quickly pivoted to possible fixes. "The American people are hurting and they need relief," he said, adding that Democrats needed to play a constructive role after months of blocking Republicans. "What are their ideas?" McConnell said. "It'll be interesting to see what they suggest as the way forward."  While members of both parties have called for stabilizing the fragile individual insurance market, McConnell didn't explicitly endorse that plan in his brief remarks. "[The] bailing out of insurance companies, without any kind of reform, is not something I want to be part of," McConnell said.  McCAIN: 'I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO' \u2014 That's what the Arizona senator said as he left the Capitol, although he didn't want to get into his reasoning for joining Collins and Murkowski, who have consistently held out against Republicans' efforts. But he also criticized the ACA as a flawed law and again urged the Senate to return to regular order and hold hearings on health care.   Thursday afternoon, McCain had called for bipartisanship as the only way to avoid years more of destructive conflict.  Before voting no, McCain was lobbied in-person by Pence and spoke with President Donald Trump by phone, rebuffing them both.  MUST-READ: 'How McCain upended Obamacare repeal' by Seung Min Kim, Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn.  TRUMP WEIGHS IN: 'LET OBAMACARE IMPLODE' \u2014 "3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down," Trump posted on Twitter at 2:25 a.m., about an hour after the vote. "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"  WHAT ABOUT TOM PRICE? \u2014 Trump had said, only part-jokingly, that the HHS secretary's job was in jeopardy if the bill didn't pass.  And even if Price stays, there are real questions about the role that he and his agency will play now that the avowed opponent of Obamacare is stuck \u2014 again \u2014 with overseeing the law's fragile markets. Industry leaders have said they've had productive conversations with Price in private, but his public attacks on the ACA have contributed to waning confidence in the program's future.   The GAO is reportedly investigating if HHS broke the law by using government resources to promote Republicans' repeal plan.  AND WILL HHS PAY OUT COST-SHARING REDUCTIONS? \u2014 The next payment to insurers participating in the ACA markets is looming in three weeks, and the administration has played high-stakes chicken with the payments for months.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  A Trump administration Cabinet secretary reportedly threatened Alaska over Sen. Lisa Murkowski's holdout on health care, and a bipartisan group of 10 governors has come out against the Senate GOP's latest repeal plan.  But first \u2014 the fight over Obamacare in the Senate has increasingly centered on two questions: Will Republicans support a "skinny" repeal bill, and what will be in it?  Story Continued Below  'SKINNY' BILL NOT GETTING HEFTY SUPPORT YET \u2014 Both centrist and conservative Republican senators are raising concerns about the so-called skinny repeal, which would roll back the ACA's individual and employer mandates and a handful of other provisions while leaving much of the rest of the law intact.  \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, a reliably conservative member. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know where we end up. This whole [health care system] holds together or falls apart in totality. We\u2019ve got a system that is collapsing.\u201d  Centrist GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia were undecided. Another Republican from a Medicaid expansion state, Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada indicated he would back it. POLITICO stalwarts Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim go deeper: More.  \u2014 House GOP isn't a fan of idea. Leaders privately worry that vulnerable House Republicans have already taken tough votes \u2014 cutting $800 billion from Medicaid, for instance \u2014 that their Senate GOP colleagues refuse to support, exposing those House members to serious political jeopardy in November 2018, POLITICO's John Bresnahan reports. More.  \u2014 Conservative groups aren't embracing it, either. \u201cA skinny repeal just kicks the can down the road,\u201d Andy Roth of Club for Growth told POLITICO's Adam Cancryn. \u201cAnd then what? They will find their principles and courage then? Doubtful.\u201d More for Pros.  DEMS THREATEN TO SIT OUT UNTIL 'SKINNY' BILL RELEASED \u2014 The minority party says it won't offer amendments in the interim, POLITICO's Seung Min Kim reports. \u201cOnce the majority leader shows his hand, reveals what his bill will actually be, Democrats will use the opportunity to try and amend the bill," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Wednesday night. More.  Meanwhile, wonks and the CBO took a crack at modeling what a skimpier version of repeal would mean for the markets.  'SKINNY' REPEAL'S OUTSIZED IMPACT \u2014 Dropping the individual mandate would almost certainly mean young and healthy people will drop coverage and take their chances, while older and sicker people stay in Obamacare markets and drive up insurance prices. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it would increase premiums,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation, even if experts don\u2019t agree on quite how much.  CBO ESTIMATE: 16 MILLION MORE UNINSURED NEXT YEAR \u2014 That's according to an estimate of a mockup bill requested by Senate Democrats and shared Wednesday. Under the projection, 44 million Americans would be uninsured by 2024, up from 28 million under current law.  The mockup included repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates, medical device tax, community health center funding and prevention fund, in addition to defunding Planned Parenthood \u2014 all changes that the GOP is reportedly considering.  \u2014 Another estimate: Premiums go up by 20 percent. That's according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress, which offered a state-by-state projection of the impact.  \u2014 But a death spiral is unlikely for the Obamacare markets, experts say. Why? Because generous subsidies would remain in place, which more than 80 percent of Obamacare customers receive, POLITICO's Paul Demko writes. That means they\u2019re largely protected from big premium increases and would have little incentive to drop their coverage. More for Pros  The final bill will almost certainly be different from the mockups that CBO and analysts are reviewing, partly in order to meet budget reconciliation requirements, which is one reason why Republicans said \u2026   GOP: DON'T READ INTO CBO ESTIMATE \u2014 Senate Republicans downplayed the estimate as preliminary. "It's speculation written up by some [Democratic] staffers," said one Republican aide. "That's embarrassing on their part. CBO hasn\u2019t issued any new score."  PESKY BUDGET CONCERNS \u2014 While there had been speculation that amendments authored by Sens. Ted Cruz and Rob Portman might be included in skinny repeal, CBO's estimate of Democrats' mockup suggests it wouldn't be possible to add those amendments and still achieve the $133 billion in deficit reduction from the House bill.  "This achieves less deficit reduction than I expected and would not comply with Senate rule requiring [that] amendments to reconciliation bill not reduce deficit reduction because on-budget savings are less than House bill," said Ed Lorenzen of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, reviewing the estimate. CBO projected $130 billion in net deficit savings and just $78 billion in on-budget savings over the next decade, based on the mockup of the Senate GOP bill.   WHITE HOUSE REPORTEDLY THREATENS ALASKA OVER MURKOWSKI VOTE \u2014 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called both of Alaska's senators on Wednesday to alert them that Murkowski's opposition on this week's motion to proceed vote was putting projects at risk across the state, Erica Martinson reports for the Alaska Dispatch News. Alaska leaders have been working with the administration on priorities like new drilling opportunities and building a major road.  Zinke's call was a "troubling message," said Sen. Dan Sullivan. "I'm not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop," he added.

With help from Paul Demko (@PaulDemko), Brianna Ehley (@BriannaEhley) and Victoria Colliver (@vcolliver)  WHAT'S ON TAP TODAY \u2014An amendment offered by Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) that would expand Medicare to the entire U.S. population is currently teed up for a vote at 2:15 p.m. ET. While Daines doesn't support the single-payer measure, it would force Democrats to cast a much-watched vote on single-payer health care, an emerging issue for their progressive supporters.  About 10 hours of debate are still remaining, which means that unless either side gives up time, the earliest that vote-a-rama could start is at 8 p.m. tonight.  PULSE CHECK: Ben Wikler says 'the Resistance' isn't futile. The Washington director of MoveOn.org defends progressives' fight against the Trump agenda and says they've already won a major victory by simply delaying the health care repeal process.

Those GOP governors: Nevada's Brian Sandoval, Massachusetts' Charles Baker, Ohio's John Kasich, Maryland's Larry Hogan and Vermont's Phil Scott. See the letter.  SKIMPY BILL IS 'TROJAN HORSE' FOR BIGGER CHANGES\u2014 That's according to Bob Greenstein at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, who argues that Senate Republicans who vote the measure through will enable House Republicans to make deeper health cuts during conference negotiations. More.  "The 'skinny repeal' bill is a Trojan horse designed to resuscitate the effort to repeal large parts of the ACA and impose big Medicaid cuts that would jeopardize coverage for millions of the nation\u2019s neediest people," Greenstein writes. "By contrast, if the Senate rejects [it] this week, the bipartisan process that \u2026 both parties are advocating could finally commence."  \u2014Study: ACA reduced health disparities. A new study published in Health Affairs shows the Affordable Care Act significantly reduced the gap in health disparities among low-income and high-income earners.   Boston University School of Public Health researchers found that states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the ACA saw the insurance coverage gap between people with incomes below $25,000 and people earning more than $75,000 annually fell by 46 percent between 2013 and 2015. In states that did not expand their Medicaid programs, that coverage gap fell by 23 percent. The study also found income gaps in access to primary care doctors. More here.  Value of health care transactions soared in second quarter. The health care industry completed 219 deals totaling nearly $50 billion in the second quarter of this year, according to the latest figures from consultancy PwC.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  WHAT'S NEXT: COMPLICATIONS, UNPREDICTABLE CHOICES AND NO GUARANTEES \u2014 Though the GOP succeeded at bringing their health repeal effort to the floor, there's no guarantee they'll emerge from a multi-day effort with a full or partial repeal of Obamacare, POLITICO's Paul Demko points out.   One point of evidence: Last night's failed vote on the Senate GOP's revised repeal-and-replace package. Nine Republicans joined with Democrats to defeat the measure \u2014 and it only gets trickier from here.  Story Continued Below  Here's what to watch in the days ahead.  \u2014 Today: Vote on the repeal-only bill. The bill will almost certainly fail, given objections by moderates who worry about striking down the ACA's coverage expansion without a replacement.   But allowing the straight repeal vote is necessary to get legislation to the floor, Paul Demko points out. It allows conservative hardliners like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee to tell voters they followed through on campaign promises to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.  It will also give conservative advocacy groups, still crusading for repeal, a chance to hold accountable any senators who vote no on the bill. The advocates may seek to sic primary challengers on senators who fail to back straight repeal.  \u2014 Probably tomorrow: Vote-a-rama begins. Both parties will get a chance to offer amendments to the bill and, theoretically, the process allows for unlimited amendments as long as they are relevant. (Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy reportedly has "100 amendments" ready to go.) At least a few dozen will likely be voted on.  Here's where Democrats get to offer a laundry list of ideas and force Republicans to take tricky votes. That could include efforts to stabilize the Obamacare markets, such as seeking funding for cost-sharing subsidies that the Trump administration has threatened to eliminate \u2014 which could make the markets implode.  \u2014 Parliamentarian review. To keep provisions flagged by the parliamentarian as a no-go, the GOP could try to get 60 votes \u2014 a nonstarter with every Democrat opposed. Or Republicans can try to modify the language to past muster. For instance, the party already tweaked language about defunding Planned Parenthood that the parliamentarian had flagged.  Earlier on Tuesday, the parliamentarian ruled against two key provisions in the GOP plan \u2014 to change age rating and ease the creation of "association health plans" for small businesses. More for Pros.  \u2014 Fallback: A 'skinny' repeal. As a last-ditch effort, Republicans are floating a stripped-down package that would scrap the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax. While no senators would like the measure, they might vote for it to keep the repeal drive going \u2014 and to negotiate with the House on a compromise package. It's not clear that even the fallback measure can garner the 50 votes needed to pass. More.  \u000a                            Sen. Mitch McConnell brought a defunct ACA repeal bill back from the dead. | Getty  HOW THE GOP BROUGHT ACA REPEAL BACK \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fed a steady diet of reminders to holdout senators that boiled down to a simple message: A vote against even debating Obamacare repeal is a vote to keep it in place.  That won over conservatives like Rand Paul and even a vulnerable incumbent like Sen. Dean Heller. Once Sen. John McCain announced he'd be returning to the chamber for the vote, GOP leaders say they knew they had momentum and a chance to win.  POLITICO's Burgess Everett, Seung Min Kim and Jennifer Haberkorn tell the story from inside the caucus. Keep reading: More.  \u2014'He played good cop, bad cop all by himself.' McConnell used a combination of hardball politics, personal persuasion and lots of money \u2014 hundreds of billions of dollars were available to pay for more add-ons to the bill in order to get some votes \u2014to round up 50 Republicans to support the motion to proceed to the bill. POLITICO's John Bresnahan goes inside the victory. More.  RON JOHNSON WAS A KEY HOLDOUT \u2014 By the end, the Wisconsin senator, who had accused McConnell of a "breach of trust" over plans to cut Medicaid, was the last Republican to decide on the motion \u2014 and the final member of his party to cast a vote.  The tensions were on full display: When Johnson finally emerged on the Senate floor on Tuesday afternoon, he headed to McConnell\u2019s desk and the two engaged in a tense, 10-minute face-to-face talk. McConnell\u2019s face turned increasingly red, and the GOP leader threw up his hands multiple times.  "He was expressing some of his frustration," said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, who watched the fiery colloquy with his arms crossed and a grimace on his face. "But I\u2019m glad he voted to proceed to the bill."  WHAT MIKE LEE'S TEXT MESSAGES REVEAL \u2014 The Utah senator, returning on a flight to Washington on Monday, was spotted texting his concerns by an eyewitness who described the messages to POLITICO.  In one text, Lee told a recipient that he might still vote to proceed to the repeal debate, but that it was \u201cstill too early to do so in good conscience because we\u2019re not being told anything.\u201d  \u201cThis leadership line of pass something, anything, is dangerous and potent,\u201d Lee typed out in another message, written in large enough font that fellow passengers could easily read his words, according to the eyewitness. In another text, Lee wrote: \u201cThis bill is nothing more than bailing out insurance companies with a few minor reforms thrown in for good measure.\u201d  Lee's office didn't dispute the messages when asked.  MEANWHILE \u2014the nine Republicans who voted against BCRA. Sens. Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Dean Heller, Jerry Moran, Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Bob Corker, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins joined Democrats in opposition to the modified bill. It included a proposal from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz allowing insurers to sell plans that don't comply with several Obamacare rules for coverage, and a proposal from Sen. Rob Portman adding $100 billion to the replacement plan to help Medicaid expansion enrollees purchase private insurance. More for Pros.  McCain \u2014 hours after vowing, in an attack on the Senate's health care process, that he couldn't vote for the bill as written \u2014did vote for this modified version of BCRA.

"As senators consider their votes on any legislation, ensuring the sustainability and stability of markets should be front of mind," said Cori Uccello of the American Academy of Actuaries, urging the Senate to permanently fund cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers and increase funding to help defray the cost of premiums.  The actuaries also urged the GOP to use their insights as they seek to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. \u201cLegislators can draw on the actuarial profession\u2019s expertise during this consequential moment for the health care system,\u201d Uccello reminded lawmakers.  ** A message from PhRMA: ICYMI: National Sheriffs\u2019 Association says importation proposals \u201cwould jeopardize law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect the public health; threaten the safety of our drug supply; and endanger law enforcement officers, their canines, other first responders.\u201d http://onphr.ma/2hl5WFY **  Senate Dems plan to drop nominations blockade if health effort fails. While Democrats have dragged out confirmations while the chamber remained mired in the health care debate, they\u2019re pledging to drop their blockade if the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort fails, POLITICO reports.

Medicare proposes slight cut for home health agencies. CMS is planning a slight pay cut for home health agencies in 2018, the agency said in a proposed rule published on Tuesday. The proposal would reduce Medicare payments to the agencies by 0.4 percent next year, saving the federal government an estimated $80 million. That change is driven in part by CMS' planned phase out of a provision boosting pay rates for certain home health services delivered to rural patients.  Missouri: Lawmakers send abortion regulations to governor. After state Democrats filibustered, the GOP-led legislature moved a series of regulations to Republican Gov. Eric Greitens for his expected signature.

Texas: Hospitals sound their frustration with federal government. Hours after the U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to open debate on ACA repeal, Texas hospitals and other health care providers testified to the state\u2019s House Appropriations Committee meeting that Congressional proposals to cut Medicaid would hurt Texas, POLITICO's Renuka Rayasam reports from Austin.  \u201cWhen the federal government starts limiting investment, where do those dollars go? said Stacy Wilson, president at Children's Hospital Association of Texas, at the evening hearing. Wilson told state lawmakers, many of whom are championing the idea of getting more flexibility to run Texas\u2019 Medicaid program, that flexibility would come with a price: \u201cYou will have to make some tough decisions about very vulnerable populations,\u201d she said.  \u2026 During the hearing, Texas\u2019 health commissioner Charles Smith estimated that the ACA will cost Texas $316 million in state funds over the next two years. Most of those costs come from requirements that make it easier for people to maintain Medicaid enrollment such as moving from six month to 12-month certification, getting rid of the asset test and changes to income requirements.  But when pressed by lawmakers, Smith pointed out that repeal wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that the state gets that money back. He said that those costs would likely get shifted to other programs and that savings from ACA offset other health care costs in the state.  \u201cIt\u2019s like a plate of spaghetti,\u201d said Smith. \u201cYou pull on one string and get a whole lot more.\u201d  Texas: Hospitals also worry that repeal debate is delaying an HHS decision on 1115 waiver funds. Last October, the Obama administration extended the state\u2019s 1115 waiver through December 2017. But at the hearing state lawmakers and hospitals said they were worried about the slow-moving negotiations to further extend the waiver, a crucial source of funding for Texas hospitals.  \u201cThe D.C. situation has gotten very problematic,\u201d said John Hawkins, senior vice president at the Texas Hospital Association. HHS and CMS have been too busy with ACA repeal policy to focus on the state\u2019s application, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think CMS understands how this money shores up the safety net in Texas.\u201d  Without the waiver, about half the rural hospitals in the state will have to close, said Don McBeath, of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals.

The vote to start debate on their health bill is today, and the Senate GOP is sounding more confident.  The dramatic announcement Monday night that Sen. John McCain, who underwent brain surgery just 10 days ago, would return to Washington for the Tuesday vote added to the surge of momentum \u2014 although with several senators still publicly undecided, the outcome isn't yet completely certain.  Story Continued Below  President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday engaged in a furious campaign to pressure holdouts, and they further stressed that the first vote is just to get legislation to the floor, where it can then be amended.   \u000a                            Sen. John McCain will return for Republicans' health care vote. | Getty   McConnell spent the day cajoling his members and meeting with Vice President Mike Pence to plot strategy. The majority leader was still short of the votes to even open debate, and Republicans still don't know what they'd be voting to allow debate on if they agree to go along with McConnell on the procedural vote.  If McConnell manages to round up the 50 votes, it would be a huge political victory for him and for the Republicans who have seen their legislative agenda stalled.  POLITICO's Jen Haberkorn, Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett have more on the late-breaking developments \u2014 and remaining uncertainties. Keep reading: More.  \u2014 Publicly undecided on the procedural vote as of late Monday: Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman, Cory Gardner, Lisa Murkowski, Mike Lee, Dean Heller and Jerry Moran. What they're seeking: clarity on whether repeal and replace, or just repeal, is the ultimate end game. But McCain's return to Washington suggests that GOP leaders see the gap closing \u2014or closed.  \u2014 Seemingly against the vote: Sen. Susan Collins said she was opposed to proceeding to a litany of possibilities and seems like the firmest \u201cno\u201d vote on Tuesday \u2014 unless, she added, \u201cit's going to be a brand-new bill, in which case I can't tell you.\u201d  Trump to Tom Price: If vote fails, 'I'll say, Tom, you're fired.'

More.  Some conservatives remain deeply leery. Policy analyst Chris Jacobs says it's a "sucker's bet" for Republicans to vote on a motion to proceed, arguing that the bill already is flawed and will only get worse given the parliamentarian's rulings and likely compromises.  "If senators have objections to the bill now, they should vote down the motion to proceed, for the bill \u2014 likely on substance, and certainly on process \u2014 isn\u2019t going to get much better, and almost assuredly will get worse," Jacobs writes. More.  \u2026 Jacobs also shared a letter with reporters, sent by McConnell in 2009, where Republicans asked for a number of courtesies related to Democrats' health care legislation that year \u2014 including "full text and full CBO scores on a health care bill publicly available for 72 hours prior to a vote on the motion to proceed," Jacobs points out.

Organizations lobbying on MACRA spent just over $18 million in the last three months, compared to more than $27 million for the same period in 2016. Those dropping the issue include Humana, AARP and Premier, along with several state hospital associations.  Public health groups petition courts over FDA deeming lawsuits. Six organizations are seeking permission to intervene in the lawsuits \u2014 brought by the e-cigarette and cigar industries against the FDA \u2014 warning that the Trump administration may not sufficiently defend the agency's 2016 rule on e-cigarettes and other tobacco products.

Massachusetts is exploring Obamacare waivers. The waivers would set up a premium stabilization fund in lieu of the health law's cost-sharing reductions \u2014 which Trump has threatened to gut \u2014 and revive a state employer mandate instead of having to comply with the federal requirement, according to a draft proposal released Monday.   The proposal includes six requests that Massachusetts wants the Trump administration to approve, including asking for federal permission to administer the ACA's small business tax credit to boost how many employers obtain them. Massachusetts will accept comment on the proposal until Aug. 25, and changes, if approved, would go into effect starting in 2018. See the notice | See the proposal.

aV \u000a            By DAN DIAMOND (ddiamond@politico.com; @ddiamond)  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  Republicans' zombie bill limps into a key week, with a major vote looming even though GOP leaders don't appear to have the support, know the order of amendments or have a reconciliation-proof bill ready yet.  HOW THE WEEK COULD GO  Story Continued Below  Motion to proceed still expected for Tuesday. After two canceled votes, Republicans say they'll finally hold a vote on whether to bring a bill to the floor, no matter what.  There's still confusion about which bill will be voted on, however \u2014 the unpopular Obamacare replacement bill or a resurrected version of the 2015 straight repeal bill \u2014 and leaders' comments on Sunday didn't clarify that.  "Ultimately, that's a judgment that Sen. McConnell will make at some point this week before the vote," said Sen. John Thune on "Fox News Sunday."  Will McCain appear in time for the vote? It's not clear whether Arizona Sen. John McCain will make a dramatic return after his invasive medical procedure just nine days ago and subsequent diagnosis of brain cancer. But without McCain, the calculus is against Senate Republicans, whose effort fails if two members break ranks and vote against advancing the bill.   And as of this weekend, six Republicans were on record against the replacement bill and three were against the straight repeal bill, which is why \u2026   Pressure is being ramped up on moderates. Vice President Mike Pence stumped with Ohio Sen. Rob Portman on Saturday and President Donald Trump will be with key holdout Sen. Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia today.  IF THE MOTION TO PROCEED IS SUCCESSFUL ... Then the Senate moves into 20 hours of debate on the bill, while Republican leaders will rush to win over holdouts and ready their amendments.   But as of now, it doesn't appear they have the votes.  McCONNELL's POSSIBLE STRATEGY: WIN BY LOSING \u2014 A defeat on the motion to proceed could spark a conservative backlash and a new round of dealmaking \u2026 or at least that's what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is hoping, POLITICO's Jen Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim report.  Top Republicans also are acknowledging that they could lose this week. \u201cWhat will happen is, if and when that were to occur, we\u2019ll go back to the drawing board and get a bill up,\u201d Thune said on Sunday. \u201cWe are going to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. It\u2019s not a question of 'if,\u2019 it\u2019s a question of \u2018when.'\u201d More.  ALTERNATE OUTCOME: A PIVOT AWAY FROM OBAMACARE \u2014 It's possible that a failed vote could establish a decisive end to the public Obamacare repeal debate \u2014 at least for now. That would allow the Senate to move on after two months to other priorities, like tax reform, and possibly notch some legislative wins.  Meanwhile, a handful of Republicans have loudly called for open hearings on health care and there are other pieces of unrelated health legislation \u2014 like the FDA user fees bill \u2014 that have been tabled until ACA repeal is done. If we finally see movement on those priorities, it's a sign that the Obamacare fight is officially on hold.  MORE COMPLICATIONS   Big chunks of the bill were seemingly knocked out on Friday, when the Senate parliamentarian ruled that major provisions didn't comply with Senate rules on reconciliation, including:  \u2014 Defunding Planned Parenthood for one year   \u2014 Banning coverage of abortion in Obamacare insurance plans  \u2014 Appropriating funds to pay for the cost-sharing reductions to subsidize insurers' participation in ACA markets  \u2014 Instituting a six-month lockout on consumers who fail to maintain continuous coverage  \u2014 Changing the way New York funds Medicaid (widely viewed as a way to win over GOP holdouts from the Empire State for the House bill)  Democrats and progressive groups loudly celebrated, noting that some key conservatives' votes seemingly rested on including those provisions. They added that knocking out the New York-specific provision would make it harder for the GOP to craft state-specific deals to win over holdout senators.  More for Pros | See Senate Democrats' release  However, conservative groups said they still support the motion to proceed, noting that Republicans say they have replacement language ready to go \u2014 or that the GOP could simply overrule the parliamentarian.  More parliamentarian rulings are coming. One to watch: the parliamentarian's decision on the Consumer Freedom amendment, authored by Sen. Ted Cruz, which would allow insurers in specified circumstances to sell plans that don't comply with ACA regulations. That provision has been crucial to winning over conservatives, although the insurance industry and others have said that it would be unworkable.  An overlooked loophole that would benefit Democratic governors too? Liberal wonks don't like the Senate replacement bill, but they're quietly discussing one possible upside: The bill would fast-track state innovative waiver applications, which could allow governors to go around their legislatures and get near-automatic approval from the HHS secretary, so long as their proposals don't increase the federal deficit.  That provision has been seen as a vehicle for conservative governors to make dramatic overhauls to their insurance markets, Nicholas Bagley wrote at Vox last month. But it also could unlock quick action on progressive priorities in some states, such as expanding coverage to undocumented Americans (like lawmakers in California have explored) and subsidizing insurers to provide services like contraception, wonks believe.  THIS IS MONDAY PULSE \u2014 Where we continue to watch 2009 and 2017 unfurl like distorted reflections of each other. Eight years ago on Sunday: then-President Barack Obama was stumping for his health bill in Cleveland, visiting the city's biggest hospital and hosting a two-hour town hall. See video.  PULSE remembers watching (and writing) about that town hall as a fledgling health policy analyst. Where were you eight years ago this summer?

With help from Adam Cancryn (@AdamCancryn)  \u000a                            President Donald Trump is openly pressing senators to move on the health bill, but it's not clear if anyone's yet swayed. | AP photo | AP Photo  WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS TELLING CONSERVATIVES \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence and HHS Secretary Tom Price assured conservative groups on Friday that the ACA repeal effort is in good shape, an upbeat meeting meant to rally the groups to put pressure on GOP senators to open debate.  \u2014 Pence said that he doesn't expect any last-minute surprises from GOP leaders if they take up the straight repeal bill, such as voting down that bill and then pivoting to a compromise bill that\u2019s not acceptable to conservatives, according to a source in the room.   \u2014 Price talked up his agency's report showing that the Cruz amendment would drive down premiums and boost enrollment \u2014 conclusions that budget and policy experts have roundly panned as faulty and misleading. Price didn't mention that criticism, and instead encouraged groups to use the report in their campaigns to get GOP senators to support the motion to proceed.  He also hinted that HHS is looking for ways to tweak the Cruz amendment after the fact to make it more workable and allow for split risk pools \u2014 a change that would be aimed at winning over conservatives who say the proposal wouldn't be effective unless the individual market is split into two groups: sick, higher-cost people and healthy, lower-cost people.  Attendees included social conservative groups including Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council and Faith & Freedom, as well as other conservative grassroots mainstays like Heritage Action and Club for Growth.  ** A message from PhRMA: ICYMI: National Sheriffs\u2019 Association says importation proposals \u201cwould jeopardize law enforcement\u2019s ability to protect the public health; threaten the safety of our drug supply; and endanger law enforcement officers, their canines, other first responders.\u201d http://onphr.ma/2hl5WFY **  Trump makes veiled threat to Republicans. "If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!" the president stated on Twitter on Sunday evening. Earlier in the day, Trump went after members of his own party, saying Republicans "do very little to protect their President."  Scaramucci: Trump will gets health care done. The new White House communications director vowed on CBS's "Face the Nation" that the president would ultimately succeed, even if this week's vote fails.  "He always gets what he wants," Scaramucci said. "He's got very, very good karma." Watch video.  To watch today: Trump making 3:15 p.m. statement on health care. The president is scheduled to be speaking from the White House.  Murray and Wyden want a briefing with HHS and contractors. Sens. Patty Murray and Ron Wyden, the respective ranking members of the Senate HELP and Finance committees, are out with a letter to HHS Secretary Tom Price this morning, asking for an explanation behind the agency's evaluation of Sen. Ted Cruz's Consumer Freedom amendment. HHS issued a glowing report of the amendment's impact \u2014a conclusion that was at odds with external analyses \u2014but the agency didn't release a full explanation of how it arrived at that conclusion. POLITICO first reported that the analysis was produced in conjunction McKinsey.  "We write to request a briefing on this analysis with representatives from HHS and McKinsey or any other contractors or subcontractors whose data or analyses were used to produce HHS's report," Murray and Wyden write. Read letter.  Schumer: No more 'namby-pamby' Dems. The Senate Majority Leader said on ABC's "This Week" that the Democratic agenda being unveiled on Monday is "bold" and will win over voters who deserted the party for Trump.  "We were too cautious, we were too namby-pamby," Schumer said, vowing to be more ambitious on economic issues.  Among the agenda items that Democrats are considering or will consider:  \u2014 Drug pricing fixes. Schumer said the agenda would include ideas to "just go after these drug companies when they raise prices so egregiously and people can't afford these drugs."  \u2014 Single-payer health care. Schumer said that Democrats would take a look at the idea, although he stopped short of full endorsement and said that lawmakers needed to "stabilize" the current health system first.  \u2014 Medicare and Medicaid expansion. Schumer also said that Democrats would look at these programs, too. "Medicare for people above 55 is on the table. A buy-in to Medicare is on the table. Buy-in to Medicaid is on the table," he offered.  David Durenberger: 'There are no do-overs.' Writing in USA Today, the Minnesota Republican who served three terms in the Senate urges current GOP senators to vote against the health bill, warning that they'd be running the risk of passing a bill with unclear impact on their state budgets and residents.  "Take it from me: A no vote on the Motion to Proceed this week is the only one that will be defensible in the years to come," Durenberger writes. "The good news is we haven\u2019t run out of time to ask questions and to work together to fix what needs fixing if we take the time to return to regular order and hold hearings." More.  Tiberi will tackle ineffective Medicare regulations. Rep. Pat Tiberi, the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee chairman, will announce an initiative today intended to eliminate red tape in the Medicare program.  Under the Provider Statutory & Regulatory Relief Initiative, Tiberi is soliciting suggestions to "reduce legislative and regulatory burdens on Medicare providers" and improve efficiency and quality for beneficiaries. See the form and submissions can be sent to WMProviderFeedback@mail.house.gov.  Tea Party Patriots activists are delivering 1.5 million signatures, calling for ACA repeal. They'll be delivering them to McConnell's office this morning, with supporters urging congressional Republicans to keep their health care promises.  Covered California releases three reports on reform-related issues. The exchange dropped three reports late on Friday, POLITICO's Victoria Colliver reports from Sacramento, including:  (1) An analysis that shows how Senate Republicans' plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would destabilize the individual insurance market. The analysis argues the bill\u2019s proposal of a new, lower \u201cbenchmark plan\u201d with a 58 percent actuarial value would provide \u201clittle to no value\u201d for the vast majority of Americans.  (2) A report on why funding subsidies for insurance companies is not a "bailout," and   (3) An explainer about how risk stabilization or reinsurance funding is necessary to keep the markets from collapsing. \u201cReinsurance programs could be administered virtually overnight and the pay-off for consumers could be to immediately reduce premiums for 2018," argues John Bertko, Covered California\u2019s chief actuary.  STATE WEEK: More states eye waivers to stabilize insurance markets. Alaska earlier this month became the first state to win a waiver from the Trump administration to help prop up its lone Obamacare insurer. Last week, New Hampshire announced it will seek a waiver for a state-run reinsurance program to keep its individual insurance market from collapsing.  It's a realization that states must deal with market turbulence regardless of what Congress does, and that policymakers in Washington clearly want to make it easier for states to devise their own solutions, as long they don't drive up the federal deficit.

Fact: The government has authority to allow drug importation if the secretary of HHS certifies imports would not threaten the health and safety of Americans and would generate cost savings for consumers. No secretary has been able to do that. Proposals to allow the importation of drugs into the U.S. would expose Americans to unregulated drugs that U.S. officials cannot guarantee are safe. To date, no HHS secretary \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 has certified that imports would not threaten the health and safety of Americans or would generate cost savings for consumers. Allowing the importation of drugs from other countries into the U.S. would lead to potentially dangerous outcomes for patients and increase the burden on law enforcement to prevent unregulated medicines from harming Americans.

Congress is officially out for recess. The Senate passed a bill funding the FDA and approved dozens of nominees before bolting for the exits Thursday afternoon. But Republicans heading back to their constituents have no major legislative achievements to tout, despite the GOP controlling Congress and the White House. It\u2019s a far cry from January, when GOP lawmakers received socks with President Trump\u2019s face on them and were promising to do big things in the coming months.   Remember the GOP\u2019s 200-day plan? Republican leaders said the GOP-controlled Congress would repeal Obamacare, fund Trump\u2019s border wall and overhaul the tax code, all by August. None of those things have been done.

Elana and Seung Min: \u201cThe GOP delivered an unstated declaration of independence from their own Republican president by passing a Russia sanctions bill he resisted, rebuffing his demands they try again on health care after the spectacular implosion of Obamacare repeal, even taking steps to head off any attempt by Trump to fire the special counsel investigating him, Robert Mueller.\u201d More: http://politi.co/2uqv3Is   HAPPY FRIDAY Y\u2019ALL.

aV 08/03/2017 07:48 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  GONE UNTIL SEPTEMBER \u2014 Good Thursday morning Huddle readers. The Senate could leave town as early as today, joining the House for a month-long break. But fear not, we\u2019re already looking ahead to battles in September.   Story Continued Below  Showdown looming? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), knowing they\u2019ll need Democratic votes anyway, are begrudgingly on board with the White House\u2019s request for a clean debt ceiling increase in September, Seung Min and Rachael report this morning. But some rank-and-file Republicans have other plans, calling for any debt ceiling hike to be accompanied by spending cuts or fiscal reforms. \u201cMeanwhile, Democrats, who time and again have coughed up votes to allow the GOP to avoid crises, are mulling their own demands with a Republican now in the White House,\u201d they report.   For now, House Republican leaders are looking to the Senate to move first with plans to push through the House whatever is first passed by the upper chamber. \u201cGOP leaders under their current strategy will, in essence, ignore conservatives because they can\u2019t give them what they want and expect it to clear the Senate\u2019s higher, 60-vote threshold.\u201d The state of play: http://politi.co/2umFCwk   FOR YOUR RADAR: MUELLER BILL \u2014 Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) plan to introduce a bill today that would give special counsel Robert Mueller recourse if he is fired by the White House. \u201cThe bill would allow any special counsel for the Department of Justice to challenge his or her removal in court, with a review by a three-judge panel within 14 days of the challenge,\u201d the AP reports. And the legislation would be retroactive to May 17, 2017 \u2014 the day Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian meddling and any potential involvement by the Trump campaign. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are also working on a similar bill, USA Today previously reported.   TRUMP SIGNS SANCTIONS BILL \u2014 President Donald Trump signed a sweeping Russia, Iran and North Korea sanctions package into law Wednesday, but not before saying he thinks parts of the bill are unconstitutional. The accompanying signing statement prompted a quick response from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who said Trump\u2019s comments raise \u201cserious questions about whether his administration intends to follow the law, or whether he will continue to enable and reward Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression.\u201d Matt Nussbaum and Elana with more: http://politi.co/2u51noU   Related read: \u201cCongress is moving to force the Pentagon to violate a nuclear arms treaty with Russia \u2014 in yet another effort to box in President Donald Trump on relations with Moscow,\u201d Bryan Bender reports.

OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES SAFE, FOR NOW \u2014 The White House has put the brakes on deciding whether to yank Obamacare subsidies that are critical to keeping the market functioning. Facing blowback from Republicans on the Hill, who are pushing to keep the cost-sharing reduction payments in place for now, the White House is not expected to immediately end the subsidies, despite previous threats. \u201cLawyers and some administration officials have raised questions about ending the payments but are expected to offer an analysis later in August, West Wing officials said,\u201d Josh Dawsey and Jen Haberkorn report.

McCAIN UPDATE: \u2018FEELING GOOD\u2019 \u2014 In his first interview since starting cancer treatment this week, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he\u2019s \u201cfeeling good\u201d and plans to return to the Senate in September. "It's a tough challenge, of course, but [I'm] getting the best care you can possibly have. I'm eating well and feeling fine, getting plenty of exercise," McCain said on Phoenix talk radio station KFYI. McCain said he\u2019s been keeping a regular schedule of meetings and plans to travel around the state during recess.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told Jen Haberkorn. But as \u201cprobably he\u2019s learned over the last couple of weeks, threats don\u2019t really go over particularly well. My advice would be to either do it or don\u2019t do it.\u201d   President Trump could follow through with his threat \u2013 although it would take months to actually enact \u2013 but given that the median net worth of a member of Congress is $1 million, the people who would feel the hurt are congressional staffers.

His remarks came after Democrats sent a letter to the GOP leader Tuesday morning laying out their priorities for a tax rewrite.   One thing that will be different from the health care debate? Republicans plan to hold hearings in both chambers on tax reform after recess. But don't get your hopes up: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to be 1986, when you had a bipartisan effort to scrub the code,\u201d McConnell said.

And Heller\u2019s latest effort, signing onto the Graham-Cassidy repeal bill that doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere, could hand critics even more ammunition. \u201cHeller's latest push may only exacerbate the notion that he has followed a too-complicated and contradictory path on health care, one that has infuriated conservatives and made Democrats privately cocky about their chances of snatching his seat next fall,\u201d Seung Min reports this morning. \u201cIf his intent is to get reelected, he\u2019s completely botched it,\u201d said Chuck Muth, a conservative activist in Nevada and former executive director of the state GOP.

But raising the debt ceiling will be a tough vote for both parties \u2013 Democrats will likely have to deliver a big chunk of the votes \u2013 and neither side is agreeing to Mnuchin\u2019s request to leave policy sweeteners off the bill, at least not yet.

Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), a co-chair of the caucus, on a call with reporters Tuesday. Leaders of the group cited Sen. Lamar Alexander\u2019s announcement Tuesday that the Senate HELP Committee will hold bipartisan hearings on the issue as a sign that support is building for their approach.   But the blueprint put forth by the caucus faces major hurdles: There\u2019s no plan to pay for it and partisan gridlock on health care is deeply entrenched after nearly a decade of Obamacare wars. \u201cSome folks just want to kind of play the shirts and skins game and just move on from this issue,\u201d acknowledged Rep.

Williams, a well-known auto dealer, faced scrutiny after pushing an amendment to the 2015 highway bill that benefited car salesmen. \u201cThe ethics panel said neither Lujan nor Williams violated House rules, but cautioned that both lawmakers acted in ways where mistakes are possible,\u201d the AP\u2019s Matthew Daly reports.

aV 08/01/2017 07:59 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  With an assist from Daniel Lippman   Story Continued Below  REPUBLICANS GIVE TRUMP REALITY CHECK \u2014 Senate Republicans have no plans to revive their Obamacare repeal effort this summer, despite Twitter taunts from President Donald Trump, who called them \u201ctotal quitters\u201d over the weekend. "Until somebody shows us a way to get that elusive 50th vote, I think it's over,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican. \u201cMaybe lightning will strike and something will come together but I'm not holding my breath."  McConnell, notably, did not bring up health care in his opening floor remarks Monday afternoon. And Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) pushed back on comments from OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, who said the Senate shouldn\u2019t do anything else until it votes on health care again. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Mulvaney\u2019s] got much experience in the Senate, as I recall,\u201d Cornyn said, reported the Washington Post. \u201cAnd he\u2019s got a big job. He ought to do that job and let us do our job.\u201d  The White House is still trying to rebuild momentum, pushing a proposal from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to block grant health care funding for states. Cassidy met with top Trump aides, GOP governors and HHS Secretary Tom Price about the idea on Monday. But many Republicans are ready to move on, with \u201cthe idea of taking another heart-stopping vote with little chance of success\u201d not high on their priority lists, Burgess and Jen Haberkorn report. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s the appetite to have a vote in the next two weeks," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).   What\u2019s next: \u201cTrump is threatening to cut off health insurance subsidies for low-income people, which could spur Congress to act \u2014 though Trump could veto any bill providing funding for that assistance,\u201d Burgess and Jen report. Trump is expected to decide as soon as today whether to continue making the payments.

The New York Times: http://nyti.ms/2tZUJAw   GONE TIL NOVEMBER \u2014 Republican leaders are ready to pivot to something they feel is a little bit more in their control (albeit not much easier): tax reform. And the White House has its own ambitious agenda for overhauling the tax code, with legislative liaison Marc Short saying Monday the administration wants to see markups in September with floor action in the House and Senate finished by the end of November. That\u2019s an aggressive timeline to say the least. In September alone, Congress will have to keep the government running, lift the debt ceiling and reauthorize critical programs for flood insurance, children\u2019s health insurance and the FAA. Aaron Lorenzo has more: http://politi.co/2ufOgwn   Side note: Remember earlier this year when Republican leaders insisted they\u2019d have tax reform and health care finished by August? Those were the days.   Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are urging Republicans to go the bipartisan route on tax reform and are already laying out the conditions to secure their votes. \u201cIn a letter to Trump and GOP leaders Tuesday, 45 of the 48 members in the Senate Democratic caucus urged the GOP not to use arcane budget reconciliation procedures to shield any tax reform bill from a filibuster,\u201d Elana reports.

MONDAY\u2019S MOST CLICKED: My story with Paul Demko on centrist lawmakers backing a bipartisan health care bill was the winner to start off the week.   IF YOU LEAD, WILL I FOLLOW? Democrats rolled out their 2018 agenda to much fanfare last week. But what remains to be seen is who in the party will go along and who will peel off and do their own thing. Not every incumbent wants to be associated with the party\u2019s message, Gabe, Elana and your Huddle host report. And many of the party\u2019s influential groups \u2014 including the Democratic National Committee and individual state party committees \u2014 are busy preparing their own, independent lines of messaging. \u201cJust as there isn\u2019t one kind of Democrat, there are not just one kind of message that works,\u201d said Rep.

The staffer, Imran Awan, was fired last week after he was arrested on one count of bank fraud during an attempt to leave the country. FACT, the watchdog, says Wasserman Schultz may have violated House rules by continuing to employ Iwan as an IT staffer over the last six months even though he was barred from using the House network.

Jimmy Duncan, the Tennessee Republican who has been in Congress since 1988, won\u2019t run for reelection next year, he told the local CBS affiliate Monday. But it's unlikely Duncan\u2019s Knoxville district will be a top target for Democrats. As Kevin points out, the seat has been in Republican hands since 1859.   BIG ISSUES IN THE BIG TENT? Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), chairman of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, caused a little stir Monday when he told the Hill that the DCCC wouldn\u2019t shy away from financially supporting candidates who oppose abortion. The news shouldn\u2019t come as that big of a surprise \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made clear earlier this year that there wouldn\u2019t be a \u201clitmus test\u201d for Democratic candidates. And the DCCC has been working closely with Blue Dogs, who already count three pro-life Democrats as members, on recruitment. But former DNC Chairman Howard Dean tweeted the news would prompt him to withhold support from the DCCC if true.   POLICE DIRECTED TO WRONG SITE IN SCALISE SHOOTING \u2014 The Capitol Police has opened an internal investigation after its officers initially responded to the wrong site during the congressional baseball practice shooting that severely wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) in June. The Capitol\u2019s elite tactical team was initially sent to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s house in Georgetown, several miles away, Billy House reports. \u201cThe tactical squad did make it to the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Virginia, where the shooting took place and it\u2019s unclear how much time the unit lost because of the mix-up. It also wasn\u2019t clear whether the squad arrived at Pelosi\u2019s house or was redirected en route.\u201d Bloomberg: https://bloom.bg/2tZU95H   MOVIN\u2019 ON UP \u2014 Natasha Hickman, longtime aide to Sen.

The plan aims to stabilize Obamacare and make changes to the law backed by both sides, multiple sources told your Huddle host and Paul Demko. Roughly 40 centrist House Republicans and Democrats have signed onto the effort, which is being led by the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.   Story Continued Below  The House plan: The most significant proposal is funding for Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) on Friday to talk about ways to revive the repeal push, including a block grant idea floated by Graham. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) also met with White House officials. Burgess, Josh and Rachael with more: http://politi.co/2ubDAim   That\u2019ll go over well: OMB Director Mick Mulvaney (a former House guy, mind you) said the White House is taking the official stance that the Senate shouldn\u2019t vote on anything else until Republicans revive their Obamacare repeal. \u201cIn the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate,\u201d Mulvaney said Sunday on CNN.

The Republican leader is trying to thwart Rep. Mo Brooks and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, both of whom are campaigning against McConnell and recently appointed Sen. Luther Strange.   The deets: McConnell\u2019s super PAC is set to spend as much as $8 million to boost Strange.

aV 07/28/2017 08:07 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  SENATE REJECTS OBAMACARE REPEAL \u2014 In a dramatic floor vote that unfolded after midnight, three Senate Republicans joined with all 48 Democrats to sink the GOP's seven-year effort to repeal Obamacare. Sen. John McCain -- who returned after a cancer diagnosis to give Republicans the vote they needed to begin debate at the start of this week -- was the pivotal third GOP vote that killed the bill. McCain\u2019s no vote was met with audible gasps from colleagues inside the chamber. "I don't think we all knew until he actually did it," Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said after. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) also voted against the plan.  Story Continued Below  \u201cWatch the show,\u201d McCain told reporters as he was heading into the chamber. The unexpected turn of events capped at bizarre day that involved several Republicans only agreeing to vote for the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d after receiving assurances from Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that the House wouldn\u2019t pass the bill and instead would go to conference. "I do my job as a senator," McCain said after he left the Senate chamber, saying he voted against the Obamacare repeal bill "because I thought it was the right vote."   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reacts: \u201cYes, this is a disappointment. A disappointment indeed,\u201d he said after the vote failed around 1:40 a.m. Bres, Burgess, Jen and Seung Min with the play-by-play: http://politi.co/2tPdYfK   The video: Watch McCain give the pivotal thumbs down, via NBC: http://bit.ly/2tOU8Sb   THE MAVERICK IS BACK \u2014 McCain\u2019s decisive vote \u201cwas a shocking \u2014 yet fitting \u2014 coda for the Senate\u2019s health care battle, starring the veteran senator with a well-polished maverick streak. Within days he went from Obamacare repeal\u2019s savior to its executioner,\u201d Seung Min, Burgess and Jen write. Even a late night call from President Trump couldn\u2019t change the independent senator's mind. \u201cHe's now become a hero for Democrats, effectively voting to protect the chief legislative achievement of President Barack Obama, his opponent in the 2008 presidential campaign.\u201d Much more from our terrific health care trio (posted at 4:52 a.m.!): http://politi.co/2tOGOgq   OUR BUREAU CHIEF ON WHAT\u2019S NEXT: \u201cHealth-care fight is over, and it was a disaster for GOP.

Tax overhauls live and die on details \u2014 and their absence, after months of weekly meetings aimed at achieving consensus, showed that the GOP\u2019s dream of achieving tax reform may be years from completion.\u201d More: http://politi.co/2tPpUhW   FINALLY FRIDAY, FREE AGAIN.

SANCTIONS BILL HEADS TO THE PRESIDENT \u2014 The Senate voted 98-2 Thursday to send a sweeping Russia, Iran and North Korea sanctions package to the White House, essentially daring the president to reject an accord that ties his hands on the Kremlin and has received overwhelming bipartisan support on the Hill. The White House has avoided taking any clear position on whether Trump will sign the bill into law but Congress has more than enough votes to override a presidential veto if needed.

aV 07/27/2017 07:56 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  BRING EXTRA SNACKS TODAY and wear your comfy shoes, Huddle readers. It\u2019ll be a long night in both the House and Senate as the lower chamber tries to wrap up work on a multi-bill spending package and senators kick off a vote-a-rama related to the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal.   Story Continued Below  VOTE-A-RAMA DRAMA \u2014 Senate Republican leaders still don\u2019t have the votes to pass some kind of anti-Obamacare bill this week, despite pushing a bare-bones repeal that avoids divisive issues like Medicaid cuts but leaves key centrists and conservatives undecided. So far Senate Republicans have rejected both the GOP\u2019s repeal-and-replace plan and a repeal-only bill. GOP leaders are aiming for a final vote, likely on their \u201cskinny repeal,\u201d tomorrow following a long night of unlimited amendments known as the vote-a-rama. Burgess, Jen Haberkorn and Seung Min: http://politi.co/2u1idQA   -Related: CBO: \u2018Skinny\u2019 repeal could boost uninsured by 16 million, Dan Diamond reports.   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats say they\u2019re done offering amendments until Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) unveils the GOP\u2019s ultimate repeal plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Democrats aren\u2019t ready to go for a vote-a-rama with an arsenal of amendments,\u201d Seung Min reports. \u201cBut Democratic senators say they see no point in offering up their proposals if they\u2019re amending what they say is a shell of a health care bill. \u2018This is a joke, and we\u2019re not going to participate anymore,\u2019 said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).\u201d More: http://politi.co/2u1u6pN   Not so fast, the House says: House Republicans are eyeing the Senate\u2019s skinny repeal plan warily. First, the possibility of a House-Senate conference to hash out differences means the health care debate could drag on for months, further delaying other parts of the GOP\u2019s agenda. Second, House leaders already forced members to take a tough vote on their repeal plan that the Senate is refusing to support, potentially putting GOP lawmakers in political jeopardy in November 2018. Bres and Jen report from the House: http://politi.co/2u1mkMU   Juicy read: Don\u2019t miss this scoop from Erica Martinson about how the Trump administration threatened Alaska after Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted against starting debate on health care. By Wednesday afternoon, \u201ceach of Alaska's two Republican senators had received a phone call from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke letting them know the vote had put Alaska's future with the administration in jeopardy,\u201d she reports. "I'm not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop," Sen. Dan Sullivan said. More from the Alaska Dispatch News: http://bit.ly/2tMjkZe   WARNING SHOTS FIRED: BACK OFF THE AG \u2014 Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) fired off a warning seemingly aimed at President Donald Trump Wednesday, saying the panel\u2019s schedule is set for the rest of the year and they have no plans to confirm another attorney general. Grassley\u2019s tweet came just after the Washington Post reported Trump has mused about replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a recess appointment (sidestepping Senate confirmation) during the August break. The Senate can block recess appointments by not formally adjourning during the break.   With friends like these: Sessions\u2019 allies on Capitol Hill and in the conservative world continued their drumbeat of support Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get Sessions to quit and I hope Sessions doesn\u2019t quit,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said about Trump\u2019s tweets and statements criticizing the AG and calling him \u201cweak.\u201d Josh Gerstein and Josh Dawsey: http://politi.co/2u11I7t   TAKE ON THURSDAY, Y\u2019ALL. Welcome to July 27 and thanks for tuning into POLITICO\u2019s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill.   WEDNESDAY\u2019S MOST CLICKED: Paul Demko\u2019s story on what could happen next in the Senate\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort won Wednesday.   SANCTIONS CRISIS AVERTED \u2014 After a day of last-minute GOP jousting over the Russia, Iran and North Korea sanctions bill, a deal has been reached that will likely send the bill to the president\u2019s desk before August recess. "The House has committed to expeditiously consider and pass enhancements to the North Korea language, which multiple members of the Senate hope to make in the very near future," Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Thursday night. Earlier in the day, Corker rattled House negotiators by saying he planned to strip the North Korea language out, which leaders in the lower chamber feared could delay the bill\u2019s passage until September. Elana with the play-by-play: http://politi.co/2u0Wt7J   White House reacts: WH communications director Anthony Scaramucci said on CNN this morning Trump may veto the sanctions bill, implying it isn't tough enough on Russia. Remember, Congress beat back attempts from the White House to water down the bill. Also, the sanctions package is overwhelmingly supported in Congress, meaning lawmakers could easily override the president's veto.   THE TUESDAY GROUP FLEXES ITS MUSCLE \u2014 For years, centrist House Republicans like the Tuesday Group have been dutiful backers of whatever plan House leadership is pushing. But after watching the rabble-rousing Freedom Caucus bigfoot the agenda time and again, the centrist pack is starting to flex some muscle. The group has left its mark in recent months, including resisting the initial GOP Obamacare repeal, sinking controversial amendments on transgender troops and Islam and scuttling a plan to pass a massive, partisan spending package. But the get-tough approach further complicates things for Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his team, who \u201cfind themselves twisted in knots trying to find 218 votes to pass almost anything of consequence,\u201d Rachael reports.

So they asked the White House to help settle a dispute over whether the Pentagon should pay for gender reassignment surgery. Except Trump took it much further Wednesday, announcing on Twitter \u2013 without giving Congress a heads up \u2013 that he was banning transgender troops from serving in the military.   Quote du jour: "This is like someone told the White House to light a candle on the table and the WH set the whole table on fire,\u201d said one senior House Republican aide. Rachael and Josh Dawsey with much more: http://politi.co/2tDcOA4   Many Republicans did not respond warmly to Trump\u2019s plan, with folks like Iowa Sen.

aV 07/26/2017 07:59 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  With an assist from Daniel Lippman   Story Continued Below  GOP LEADERS EYE \u2018SKINNY\u2019 REPEAL \u2014 With a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence and a dramatic return from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Republicans finally agreed to open up debate Tuesday on their Obamacare repeal efforts. So now what? The leading idea is to roll back a small portion of Obamacare, called a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d by some, just to get a bill out of the Senate at the end of this week and into a conference with the House, Jen, Seung Min and Burgess report.   \u2018Whatever gets to 50\u2019: The skinny repeal would roll back three parts of Obamacare: the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax, according to Republican sources. "Whatever gets to 50," said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.). But there\u2019s still no guarantee the fractured GOP conference can unite around the plan.   Remember, there\u2019s still a lot of votes to get to that point. Late Tuesday night, nine Republicans joined with Democrats to oppose the GOP\u2019s latest repeal and replace plan, which had a controversial amendment from Rep. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) attached. Today, senators will vote on Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s (R-Ky.) \u201crepeal only\u201d idea \u2013 also expected to fail \u2013 and a long vote-a-rama on dozens of other amendments is expected Thursday. More: http://politi.co/2tJ7dMv   Related reading: \u201cWhat\u2019s next in the Senate repeal saga? Good question.\u201d Paul Demko breaks it down: http://politi.co/2tJagoa   SO HOW DID THEY GET TO YES? Just the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was able to get 50 of his members to vote in favor of starting debate is a remarkable feat. The saga involved a tense floor exchange between the GOP leader and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) \u2013 who has accused McConnell of a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d in negotiations \u2013 and a furious round of mid-flight texts from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) Monday about leadership pressure. \u201cThis leadership line of pass something, anything, is dangerous and potent,\u201d Lee typed out during a flight from Salt Lake, according to an observer. Burgess, SMK and Jen again: http://politi.co/2tIFZG9   Bres keeps it real: McConnell got a huge win Tuesday but now he faces an even harder test \u2014 getting something passed. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee McConnell can pull an Obamacare repeal rabbit out of his hat by the end of this week. But at least the show has finally started after nearly two months of delays,\u201d Bres reports. \u201cI think his blood pressure\u2019s about 90 over 50, with about a 40 pulse, OK? He\u2019s very calm through the storm,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said about the GOP leader. More on McConnell\u2019s work behind the scenes: http://politi.co/2tJcFPI   McCAIN\u2019S TRIUMPHANT RETURN \u2014 Sen. John McCain, recently diagnosed with brain cancer and now sporting a lengthy scar above his eye, was welcomed back with a standing ovation in the Senate chamber. And then he did the most McCain thing ever. Elana explains: \u201cMcCain waved spiritedly to a throng of reporters as he entered the chamber he\u2019s called home for 30 years, served as the crucial 50th vote to proceed to a repeal debate, and delivered a passionate speech undercutting the \u2018shell of a bill\u2019 he had just agreed to take up,\u201d she reports. "I have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me," McCain said.

GOP RALLIES BEHIND SESSIONS \u2014 \u201cCongressional Republicans and conservative activists rallied behind Jeff Sessions on Tuesday, as President Donald Trump continued his public humiliation campaign against the embattled attorney general,\u201d Austin, Seung Min and Kyle report. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called Sessions \u201cone of the most decent people I\u2019ve ever met\u201d and several other GOP senators offered similar statements of support. But some Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), had a different take. Ryan said it was Trump\u2019s \u201cprerogative\u201d who he hires and fires in the executive branch. More: http://politi.co/2tJeOL1   Some lawmakers are warning Trump not to fire Sessions, saying they fear it could be the first step in an attempt to kill the federal Russia investigation. "All hell would break loose," Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, told David Drucker with the Washington Examiner. More: http://washex.am/2eNiGUL  Sessions has been under fire from Trump over the last week for recusing himself in the Russia probe months ago, a move that led to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment. The two men are not currently on speaking terms and Sessions has sent word to the White House that he has no plans to resign. Josh Dawsey: http://politi.co/2tYldNG   SANCTIONS BILL MOVES TO SENATE \u2014 The House overwhelmingly approved new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea Tuesday, teeing up the bipartisan package to be cleared by the Senate before the August recess. The White House has yet to say if Trump will sign the bill, possibly triggering the first veto override of his young presidency.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) was arrested Monday at Dulles airport before boarding a plane to Pakistan. Imran Awan pled not guilty to one count of bank fraud Tuesday and was released with \u201chighly-supervised\u201d conditions. Awan and several of his family members, who were also House Democratic staffers, have been at the center of a criminal investigation on Capitol Hill for months. Other lawmakers cut ties with the staffers but Wasserman Schultz has kept Awan on her payroll until yesterday, even though he was barred from accessing the House computer network. Awan\u2019s lawyer said the case is a \u201cring-wing media driven prosecution\u201d because his client is Muslim. Your Huddle host and Bres: http://politi.co/2tXpEbx   JUDICIARY DROPS MANAFORT SUBPOENA \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee has dropped a subpoena compelling Paul Manafort to testify today about a meeting he, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner had with a Russian lawyer last year. Manafort, who along with Kushner was on the Hill Tuesday meeting with congressional investigators on the Intel committees, has agreed to a transcribed interview with Senate Judiciary members in the future.

Carolyn Cavaness admitted to helping create false FEC reports disguising the fact that Brady's campaign agreed to pay $90,000 in expenses for her boss, Jimmie Moore, who was challenging Brady. \u201cNo charges have been announced against Moore or Brady. However, one court filing made public Tuesday indicates prosecutors believe Brady attempted to influence the testimony of at least one witness in the investigation.\u201d More: http://politi.co/2tZ0PMA   NEW YORK STATE OF MIND \u2014 Democratic Rep.

IS IT TOO LATE NOW TO SAY SORRY? Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has apologized after being caught on a hot mic Tuesday calling Rep. Blake Farenthold \u201chuge\u201d and \u201cso unattractive, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Her remarks to Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) \u2013 who colorfully said Collins could most certainly kick Farenthold\u2019s butt \u2013 came after the Texas Republican made a remark Monday about challenging Collins and other female GOP senators to an Obamacare-related duel, if only they were men. \u201cNeither weapons nor inappropriate words are the right way to resolve legislative disputes,\u201d Collins said in a statement, noting Farenthold also sent her a handwritten apology.   COMING TO A BOOKSHELF NEAR YOU \u2014 Sen. Jeff Flake, up for reelection next year and facing a possible primary challenge from the Trump-wing of the party, is writing a book, the New York Times reports. \u201cWorking privately, and largely without the knowledge of political advisers, he has written a book that amounts to an ideological manifesto for his own version of conservatism, according to three people briefed on the manuscript,\u201d Alex Burns reports. \u201cAll three said it would likely inflame debate about the direction of the Republican Party.\u201d No word on when it will be released.

aV 07/25/2017 07:47 AM EDT  By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope)  With an assist from Elana Schor  Story Continued Below  McCAIN COMING BACK TODAY \u2014 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer just days ago, will make a dramatic return to the Senate today. McCain\u2019s decision to come back, announced Monday night, could help deliver GOP leaders enough votes to open up debate on their Obamacare repeal later today. The vote is expected some time after lunch.   "The whip count is still in question with several GOP senators publicly undecided, but Republicans feel a surge of momentum heading into the high-profile vote after a furious pressure campaign by President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday,\u201d Burgess, Seung Min and Jen Haberkorn report.   Fishing in the dark: The crazy thing is most Republican senators don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re agreeing to debate if today\u2019s vote is successful. \u201cRepublican leaders are being as vague as possible about what the final bill to replace Obamacare would include, after two recent drafts met fatal opposition. McConnell is reminding his members that there will be a price to pay for inaction after the GOP railed against Obamacare for seven years.\u201d  Quote du jour: \u201cThe sight of the gallows focuses the mind,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). More from the team: http://politi.co/2uqDcQp   From the president\u2019s desk this morning: @realDonaldTrump: \u201cBig day for HealthCare. After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!\u201d  HOUSE SET TO PASS SANCTIONS AS WH DODGES \u2014The House will vote today on a bipartisan package of sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The accord, which is expected to garner overwhelming bipartisan support, also empowers Congress to block President Trump from easing sanctions against Moscow. At first the White House appeared to nod to the political reality that any veto would get overridden by claiming that the bill\u2019s largely technical changes since last month assuaged its concerns, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders telling ABC on Sunday that Trump supported the bill.   But Sanders backpedaled on Monday, telling reporters on Air Force One that Trump would have to \u201cstudy that legislation\u201d before weighing in definitively. \u201cHe has no intention of getting rid of\u201d sanctions on Moscow, Sanders said, \u201cbut he wants to make sure we get the best deal for the American people possible.\u201d Stay tuned.

DEMS SIDESTEP SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN NEW AGENDA \u2014 Democratic leaders descended upon the rural town of Berryville, Va., Monday to unveil their new agenda, a progressive-leaning economic plank that noticeably sidesteps the many social issues threatening to further divide the party. \u201cThere is not that divide on economic issues,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose anti-corporate agenda influenced Democrats\u2019 new strategy, worked a small but adoring crowd in a county that went for Donald Trump by more than 55 percent last year.

Trump went on another tweestorm this morning blasting his attorney general for being \u201cweak\u201d amid ongoing speculation the president is looking to replace Jeff Sessions just months into the job. Some of the names being floated, according to the Washington Post, are Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who Trump has frequently referred to as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d in the past, and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Nunes stepped aside from the House Russia probe earlier this year but has inserted himself into the investigation a few times since. Kushner denied any collusion with the Russians in the 2016 campaign during a brief statement at the White House Monday after he was interviewed by Senate Intel members. The president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser didn\u2019t take any questions.

Scalise was in good spirits, according to sources in the room, and said he\u2019s getting ready to start rehab, a huge milestone in his recovery. Scalise told his colleagues he was eager to get back to work and jokingly asked: "Has the Senate passed the health care bill yet?" Rachael reports: http://politi.co/2tW2N0d   Startling stat: Ed O\u2019Keefe reports many lawmakers were unsettled about security even before the shooting due to a significant rise in threats against members this year. \u201cStill, this year, more than 1,650 threats have been made against lawmakers, or the U.S. Capitol or Congress, said senior congressional aides familiar with the figures who were not authorized to share them publicly.

Democrats banded together to oppose an intelligence authorization bill \u2013 arguing GOP leaders were trying to sidestep debate over Trump and Russia \u2013 and a veterans\u2019 health care bill, with funding for the program set to run out in mid-August.

Brooks was also at the field during the shooting. Scalise's chief of staff, Brett Horton, tweeted that the spot made his "stomach turn.\u201d But Brooks said his ad is not out of line because Sen.

CRITICAL HEALTH CARE VOTE THIS WEEK \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is going ahead with a push to begin debate on the GOP's health care plan, even though it appears Republican leaders will fall short of the 50 votes needed to move forward. Some senior Republicans think the high-profile vote, which is expected Tuesday, could provoke enough backlash to bring senators back to the negotiating table. But senators don\u2019t even know what bill they\u2019d be moving on to \u2013 the 2015 repeal or the GOP\u2019s repeal and replace plan \u2013 if enough members agreed to start debate. With two senators on record against proceeding and Sen. John McCain\u2019s absence, the vote is on track to fail without last minute changes, Jen Haberkorn and Seung Min report. More: http://politi.co/2tDtFXD   Further complicating things, the Senate parliamentarian on Friday afternoon ruled against key provisions in the GOP\u2019s repeal and replace plan, including language targeting Planned Parenthood and restricting health care plans that provide abortion coverage, Jen and Seung Min report. The ruling against the abortion language is a huge hurdle in the House, report Jonathan Cohn, Laura Bassett and Matt Fuller for HuffPost. \u201cFreedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows suggested that, without that prohibition, the bill could not pass the House on the way back from the Senate.\u201d More: http://bit.ly/2tDgzcH   WE\u2019VE GOT A CASE OF THE MONDAYS TOO, Y\u2019ALL. Welcome to July 24 and thanks for tuning into POLITICO\u2019s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. And a very special happy birthday to my dad Ricky, who can give a wedding toast that's outta this world and cut a rug like you've never seen.   FRIDAY\u2019S MOST CLICKED: The latest on the Russia sanctions package, via Elana, was the winner.   DON\u2019T CALL IT A COMEBACK \u2014 The Blue Dog Coalition, a small group of conservative House Democrats, is eyeing an aggressive comeback in the 2018 election, arguing candidates that back their platform are the key to taking back the House next year. \u201cPeople want to purify,\u201d Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), one of the Blue Dog\u2019s three co-chairs, said about the Democratic base\u2019s surge to the left. \u201c[But] without Blue Dogs, we don\u2019t have a majority. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d With only 18 members, the group has a long way to go. But the Blue Dogs are working closely with House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on recruitment, a relationship the group says hasn\u2019t been this good since Rahm Emanuel ran the DCCC a decade ago. My story: http://politi.co/2tDrm6L   SANCTIONS PACKAGE HITS HOUSE FLOOR \u2014 A package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea is set for a House vote Tuesday after lawmakers reached a final deal late Friday night following weeks of negotiations. The legislation, which does not include many of the changes sought by the White House to make it easier for Trump to ease penalties against Russia, is expected to pass by overwhelming majorities in both chambers. The accord \u2013 a remarkable thumb in the eye to Trump from a Republican-led Congress \u2013 gives GOP leaders a major bipartisan achievement to tout heading into August recess. Elana and your Huddle host with more: http://politi.co/2ujnDbH   Even with the sanctions deal, here\u2019s a helpful reality check from Playbook\u2019s Anna Palmer, Jake Sherman and Daniel Lippman: \u201cCONGRESS is likely to leave for August recess without passing a budget, spending bills, an infrastructure package, a bill to lift the debt ceiling and tax reform. 52 DAYS in session between now and the end of the year.\u201d  DEMS PROTEST CUTTING INTEL DEBATE SHORT \u2014 House GOP leaders moved late Sunday to sidestep a lengthy debate over the intelligence community's budget by teeing up the bill for fast-track passage. Republicans\u2019 decision to bring up the intel authorization bill under suspension of the rules, which requires two-thirds support for passage, \u201cprompted howling from Democrats that the GOP was attempting to limit discussion about \u2026 ongoing investigations into election interference by Russia,\u201d Kyle reports. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is urging Democrats to vote against the bill. More: http://politi.co/2gWPNWJ  CLYBURN MAKES HIS CASE \u2014 Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn turned 77 last week, but he\u2019s showing no signs of slowing down and says folks would do better not to focus too much on his birth date or the age of others in the top tier of leadership. \u201cWe\u2019d do much better up here as a party if people stop worrying how old [Nancy] Pelosi is, and [Steny] Hoyer, and yours truly, and start figuring out how they can be of service in these communities where we\u2019re trying to win elections,\u201d Clyburn told Emma Dumain with the Post and Courier.

AVOIDS PUBLIC HEARING \u2014 Senate Judiciary leaders have agreed to let Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort avoid testifying publicly about a meeting they had with a Russian lawyer last year. The two will now be interviewed behind closed doors and not under oath. Committee leaders did issue a subpoena Friday for Glenn Simpson, founder of the firm that commissioned the dossier on President Trump, after Simpson's lawyer said he is on a lengthy vacation and can\u2019t testify.

FERC IS BAAAAACK: Just before slipping out for August recess Thursday night, the Senate confirmed Republican FERC nominees Neil Chatterjee and Rob Powelson, effectively restoring a quorum at the agency after nearly six fallow months, during which billions of dollars in shovel-ready energy infrastructure projects have stalled.  Story Continued Below  Even as President Donald Trump has touted plans for a major infrastructure overhaul and cleared hurdles for high-profile pipeline projects like the Keystone XL, his biggest and most tangible impact on infrastructure so far may well be the $13 billion in projects, expected to generate more than 23,000 construction jobs, that went on hold during the bureaucratic morass that was partly of his making, Eric Wolff and Darius Dixon report this morning. For many of these projects, the loss of the quorum in February, shortly after Trump demoted FERC\u2019s former chairman, may have cost them a year of work, thanks to the limited construction season in much of the country.  No small matter: "I would not begin to minimize even the passage of another month," former FERC Commissioner Colette Honorable told Eric and Darius, "because there are high stakes in the matters that come before FERC each and every day \u2014 vast amounts of capital at issue, vast amounts of consumer cost or savings at stake."  Once Chatterjee and Powelson are sworn in \u2014 expected to happen in the next few days \u2014 the agency can begin working through the backlog. That\u2019s a win for project backers but a setback for anti-pipeline advocates, who accuse FERC of ignoring the climate and environmental implications of its decisions. Lena Moffitt of the Sierra Club blasted the confirmations Thursday night, arguing that the two soon-to-be commissioners are too aligned with the fossil fuel industry. \u201cAs the gas industry is threatening a massive expansion of fracked gas projects, it is more important than ever that our FERC Commissioners put the health and safety of the public and our climate first, not rubber stamp any project the industry puts in front of them,\u201d she said in a statement.   It's not just infrastructure: We previously laid out a lot of the policy work also piling up for FERC \u2014 and that was three months ago!  More hands coming: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a September hearing for Trump's next two FERC nominees: Glick, a Democrat, and Kevin McIntyre, Trump's pick for the agency's chairmanship.   FINALLY FRIDAY! I'm your fill-in host, Annie Snider, and it's my last day with you. Susan Lafferty with Eversheds Sutherland US was first through the door answering that Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, because she is originally from Taiwan. Here's Susan's question for today, inspired by a book she's reading with her kids: Which president is rumored to have been stuck in his bath on his Inauguration Day, and in what year did that inauguration take place?

BASKING IN THE APPALACHIAN LOVE: After a rough couple of weeks for Trump in which Republicans failed to achieve their years-long bid to repeal Obamacare, a new communications director imploded and Russia allegations continued to dominate the news, the president turned to a friendly crowd Thursday night in Huntington, W.Va., where his favorite energy talking points drew roaring applause. After waving a supporter's "Trump digs coal" sign on his way to the podium, Trump touted his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and "the job-killing Paris climate accords" and took credit for an upswing in coal exports, which have seen a bump compared with 2016 but remain far below shipments in previous years.   West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a former coal businessman and the richest person in the state, also got a turn at the mic to announce that he will leave the Democratic Party to become a Republican. "I can\u2019t help you anymore as a Democrat governor," he told the crowd before lavishing praise on Trump's children and declaring, "Have we not heard enough about the Russians?" Justice said he's been in the Oval Office twice in two weeks to present ideas on coal and manufacturing.  MANCHIN OUT ON A LIMB: The announcement meant further political isolation for Sen. Joe Manchin, the sole Democrat in West Virginia's congressional delegation, as he faces reelection in 2018. The Senate Leadership Fund, a deep-pocketed GOP super PAC, launched a digital campaign Thursday attacking the Democrat. Manchin has refused to change parties and resisted entreaties to join Trump's Cabinet, a move that could have given Republicans one additional vote in the Senate (coincidentally, that's how many extra votes they needed on Obamacare last week). In a statement Thursday ahead of Trump's West Virginia rally, Manchin welcomed the president and said he is "particularly excited" to work with him on tax reform. "Our job is to fix things, not fight," Manchin said.  WIND AT GREENS\u2019 BACKS \u2014 BUT FOR HOW LONG? Environmentalists hope that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's deregulatory agenda is beginning to crumble after he hit two roadblocks this week, Alex Guilln reports: First a federal court reinstated an Obama-era methane regulation, and then Pruitt backed off on his attempts to delay implementation of a sweeping ozone rule. "This week's been a reality check for Pruitt and Trump that when they ignore the law, they're going to lose, and I think that may be starting to sink in," said Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign.  But Pruitt supporters aren\u2019t hanging their heads yet. For one thing, this week\u2019s losses were relatively minor, with the biggest battles over the most contentious Obama-era rules yet to come. Moreover, argued Christi Tezak of ClearView Energy Partners, Pruitt has multiple paths to victory. \u201cYou can certainly win by vaporizing a rule, no doubt. You can win by putting in place a different rule that makes it harder to do a stricter rule later. You can win through delays, even if courts reverse you later," she told Alex.  INTERIOR IG LAUNCHES PROBE OF ZINKE-MURKOWSKI CALL: The Interior Department's inspector general has begun a preliminary investigation into Secretary Ryan Zinke's call to Sen. Lisa Murkowski in which he conveyed the administration's dissatisfaction with her vote against a motion to proceed on the GOP health care bill. IG Mary Kendall told Reps. Ral Grijalva and Frank Pallone in a letter Thursday that she is looking into "potential legal and ethical violations" by Zinke during the July 26 call. But the Alaska Republican has said she didn't take the call as a threat, and Zinke posted a photo Thursday on Twitter of the pair sharing a beer. "My friends know me well," he wrote. Esther Whieldon has all the details.  SCHWARZENEGGER FLEXING CLIMATE MUSCLES AGAINST TRUMP: Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger today will announce an ambitious national effort aimed at countering Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord by providing state and local lawmakers with a toolbox for passing substantive climate change legislation, POLITICO California\u2019s Carla Marinucci reports.   The project, dubbed a "digital environmental legislative handbook," offers a curated list of legal and legislative research, voting records, bill language and data to help lawmakers prepare bills on everything from air quality to renewable energy to climate change. "With his decision on the Paris agreement, it is even more so important to make this information available \u2014 because it shows the kinds of wonderful things states can do \u2014 without waiting for the federal government,\u201d Schwarzenegger told Carla. He's set to unveil the toolbox before the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators.   GREEN GROUPS PRESS COURT ON CPP RULING: Environmental groups are asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals not to hold off on ruling on the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, arguing that the White House's Unified Agenda indicates that it could be at least 12 months before the Trump administration will propose its repeal of the contentious rule. The classification of the CPP repeal as a "long-term" action "demonstrates that even the preliminary step of a proposed rule may be delayed for at least another year," the green groups wrote in a court filing Thursday, arguing that the court should not hold off on a fully-briefed case "for a period far longer than the Supreme Court presumed when it issued its stay pending this Court's disposition of the merits." Here's Alex with more.  ANOTHER SAGE GROUSE REBELLION? The team of Interior politicals and career staff assigned to review the agency's land-use conservation plans for sage grouse in Western states could send Zinke their recommendations as soon as today. The Obama administration's plans, which sparked ire across the West, aimed to avoid an Endangered Species Act listing by boosting protections on broad swaths of federal land. The new recommendations, due to Zinke by Sunday, could include ideas for easing the path for fossil fuel development on federal land in the bird's range.  EPA REMAINS QUIET IN METHANE APPEAL: EPA is staying mum in the ongoing legal battle over Pruitt\u2019s 90-day stay of the methane rule for new oil and gas wells. The agency did not file any brief taking a position on requests from industry groups and states that support the stay seeking a rehearing before the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a spokesman had no comment on the record. The stay\u2019s supporters made one last argument Thursday for an en banc review, saying the court didn\u2019t have the jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place. It\u2019s not clear when the D.C. Circuit will decide whether to hear the appeal, but time is of the essence: Pruitt\u2019s stay would have expired in 27 days anyway.   EPA, DOT READY TO TAKE COMMENT ON MPG REVIEW: EPA and the Department of Transportation could move to reopen comments on a review of the 2022-2025 mileage standards as soon as today, a source tells ME. As part of setting vehicle emission requirements for both 2017-2021 and 2022-2025, EPA agreed to review the second set of standards for appropriateness. The review was completed over a year early under former Administrator Gina McCarthy, and she affirmed the mileage standard of 54.5 miles per gallon. Under pressure from the auto industry, Pruitt and Chao revoked that affirmation in March, and now the agency will announce that it will take the next step in the review by reopening the docket for further input.   GAO SEES ROOM FOR IMPROVING PHMSA'S SAFETY CALCULATIONS: The Government Accountability Office recommended Thursday that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration take steps to ensure that the formula it uses to identify which pipelines pose the greatest safety risk is effective. PHMSA uses the formula to set its priorities each year and decide how often it checks on parts of the nation's 2.7-million-mile pipeline network. GAO said the agency needs to document its reasoning behind each component of its formula and create a process to periodically review its effectiveness.   SPRING'S COMING SOONER IN THE HIGH NORTH: Snow is melting earlier in the spring and coming later in the fall on the North Slope of Alaska, according to a study by NOAA and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Between 1975 and 2016, the researchers found the snow-free season was growing by about one week per decade, with major ecosystem implications. Native birds have been laying eggs earlier, and rivers have broken through the ice to flow earlier in the season, the researchers found.  ENVIROS PLAN BORDER WALL RALLY: Dozens of environmental and social justice groups are planning a two-day rally and walk in southern Texas on Aug. 12-13 aimed at highlighting the potential social and environmental impacts that Trump's plan to expand the border wall could have on nearby towns and wildlife. The rally, which will include speakers such as Sierra Club President Loren Blackford, will also take aim at Trump's anti-immigration policies. The move is part of a new strategy by environmental groups to combine forces with social justice groups on this issue.  QUICK HITS  \u2014 On environment and energy, Trump often picks his own facts.

FERC QUORUM SO CLOSE YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE IT: Late Wednesday, the White House officially sent the nominations for FERC nominees Rich Glick and Kevin McIntyre to the Senate, raising the prospect that the agency\u2019s six-month stretch without a quorum will finally get resolved, Darius Dixon reports.  Story Continued Below  FERC has been unable to make major decisions on everything from interstate natural gas pipelines to liquefied natural gas export terminals to anti-market manipulation cases since early February. With the paperwork delivered, particularly for Democratic nominee Glick, the industry\u2019s Eye of Sauron-like attention is trained entirely on the Senate. GOP nominees Neil Chatterjee and Rob Powelson received approval from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in June, but their confirmations were stalled by Democrats amid battles over Obamacare and the tradition of molding bipartisan nomination packages for the agency. The calculation happening now is determining whether Glick\u2019s nomination \u2014 rather than his actually confirmation \u2014 is enough for Democrats to accept Chatterjee and Powelson being confirmed before the Senate skips town for recess. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to structure a package that gets both sides interested enough to get everybody behind it,\u201d Sen. John Thune, the GOP No. 3, told ME. \u201cI know that the FERC absences are on everybody\u2019s radar screen.\u201d Other senators said they expect a plan for FERC action to materials today.  Nominations across the federal government have been piling up for potential 11th-hour action ahead of the Senate\u2019s plans to depart for its abbreviated August break, no later than next week. The White House also officially delivered nominations Wednesday for John Henderson to lead the Air Force\u2019s energy, environment and installations program and Ryan Nelson to be Interior Department Solicitor.  In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell teed up a noon vote today on Dan Brouillette\u2019s nomination to be Deputy Secretary of Energy.   Optimistic Yucca foe: Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who held up the nomination to protest Brouillette's support for a nuclear waste repository in his home state, lifted that hold after making progress on Yucca Mountain, his office told ME, declining to elaborate.  PRUITT REVERSES COURSE ON OZONE IMPLEMENTATION DELAY: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has dropped his plan to delay a key step in implementing the 2015 ozone standard \u2014 deciding which areas hit the air quality target. Pruitt had originally said he didn't think EPA had the necessary data to decide on the designations by the Oct. 1 deadline, a move that drew lawsuits from environmental groups and blue states. But a pre-publication Federal Register notice Pruitt signed Wednesday says that "the information gaps that formed the basis of the extension may not be as expansive as we previously believed."  The notice hints, however, that there may yet be regional delays made on a case-by-case basis. "The Administrator may still determine that an extension of time to complete designations is necessary, but is not making such a determination at this time," it states. Here's Alex Guilln with more.  YOU MADE IT TO THURSDAY! I'm your fill-in host, Annie Snider, and I know it's not surprising, but I am still impressed with y'all's knowledge of nuclear history. Dan Meyer of the Duberstein group was the first across the finish line with yesterday's trivia, correctly answering that the August 2, 1939 letter written by Leo Szilard and signed by Albert Einstein warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt that Germany could develop an atomic bomb and urged the U.S. to begin its own nuclear program \u2014 which eventually became the Manhattan project. Dan has today's question: Name the official currently in the line of presidential succession who is ineligible to be president. Send your guesses \u2014 and your tips, energy gossip and comments to asnider@politico.com or follow us on Twitter @AnnElizabeth18, @AnthonyAdragna, @Morning_Energy and @POLITICOPro.  THE GLASS IS NOW 40 PERCENT FULL: EPA put out an annual report Wednesday touting decreased emissions amid a growing economy over the last quarter-century \u2014 old news to those following the issue. But as Mother Jones reporter Rebecca Leber pointed out Wednesday on Twitter, the 40 percent non-attainment rate for ozone EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has used in the past to attack the Obama administration\u2019s environmental record is now an EPA win. \u201cDespite this success, there is more work to be done,\u201d Pruitt said in a statement. He vowed to work with states to improve air quality. Environmentalists also noted a changed tune. EPA\u2019s report credits the pollution reductions to \u201cimplementation of the Clean Air Act and technological advancements.\u201d As the NRDC\u2019s John Walke pointed out, many innovations came about because of demand created by regulations. \u201cIt's not like electric utility sector was clamoring for scrubbers prior to any Clean Air Act rules warranted using them,\u201d he wrote.  ANNIVERSARY GETAWAY: Pruitt is scheduled to tour the Gold King Mine with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) on Friday, just ahead of the 2-year anniversary of the 2015 spill of 3 million gallons of wastewater by an EPA crew, the Denver Post reports. The disaster has become a favorite example for congressional Republicans of EPA ineptitude.   Gina McCarthy, who was EPA administrator at the time of the spill, visited command centers and people affected by the toxic wastewater that eventually reached the Colorado River, but did not visit the actual mine. EPA said at the time that the area was too remote and difficult to access, and that they did not want to interfere with emergency operations underway.  Road-trippin': Already on the road, Pruitt swung through Indiana Wednesday, where he spoke Wednesday with Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) and farm interests about the Waters of the U.S. rule, which EPA is in the midst of withdrawing and rewriting, and also visited Liberty Mine. Next week he'll be back on the topic of the water rule while in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports.   INTERIOR NO. 2 CALLS OUT EMPLOYEES WHO "PARROT" SPECIAL INTERESTS: After being sworn in as Deputy Interior Secretary on Tuesday, David Bernhardt sent a missive to department employees calling out "a few people" who he said "parrot comments of special interests rather than carry out their governmental duties." Bernhardt, who was opposed by most Senate Democrats, in part over potential conflict of interests concerns related to his former job as a lobbyist and lawyer for various industries, warned employees in the email obtained by POLITICO that such people "often avoid grounding their views in the actual facts or the law." Esther Whieldon's got the rundown here.  FALSE ALARM? Some climate change information disappeared from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s website late last week before reappearing late yesterday, according to a report from the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative. The missing pages from USDA's "Climate Hubs," which provide tools to help farmers and land managers adapt to climate change, "were the result of the site being migrated to a new server," an agency spokeswoman said.   Agriculture Secretary Sony Perdue and the nominee to be his chief scientist, Sam Clovis, have both questioned human-caused climate change. But Perdue has said he\u2019s committed to \u201cdigging ever deeper\u201d into research about agricultural production in a changing climate.   NOTHIN' TO SEE HERE: Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning spent Wednesday morning trying to squash speculation that the Vogtle nuclear project is facing a similar fate to the two-reactor project slated for shutdown in South Carolina. On a call with analysts, Fanning argued "there are a host of differences" between the two projects, with project backers on track to decide by the end of this month how to proceed. Here's Darius Dixon with more.   SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATING OBAMA-ERA WHISTLEBLOWER FIRING: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has launched a whistleblower investigation into the Obama administration's firing of an Interior Department employee who raised concerns over the agency's plan to approve Shell's Arctic offshore drilling lease, Esther Whieldon reports. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board this week granted the counsel's request to require the agency to reinstate Jeffrey Missal as the regional environmental officer with the agency's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement in Anchorage, Alaska while the office of special counsel investigates.  A MONIZ FOR THE AGES: Former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz returned to old stomping grounds at the Energy Department Wednesday as a guest of honor for the unveiling of his official portrait to an auditorium of current and former agency employees. NNSA Administrator Frank Klotz presided, and Moniz\u2019s successor, Rick Perry, gave speech. Both Moniz and Perry got plenty of laughs out of the attendees, which included ex-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, former DOE deputies Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall and Dan Poneman, and Obama Health and Human Services chief Sylvia Burwell, who is now president of American University.  Moniz quipped that he was honored so many people gathered for his \u201cofficial designation as a historical artifact\u201d before engaging in an extended explanation of everything in Chris Saper\u2019s painting, which included \u201cThe Future of Natural Gas\u201d report he led while at MIT, a DOE Quadrennial Technology Review, the Obama administration\u2019s Quadrennial Energy Review \u2014 an effort he pushed for well before he was secretary \u2014 and the Iran nuclear agreement he helped negotiate. DOE\u2019s Flickr account has dozens of photos.  GREENS, DEM STATES URGE COURT AGAINST HEARING METHANE APPEAL: The coalition of Democratic states and environmental groups that challenged EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's 90-day stay of the methane rule for new oil and gas wells yesterday urged the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals not to hear an appeal. The full court on Monday reinstated the rule while it considers requests from industry groups and Republican states for an appeal heard by all 11 judges. The stay\u2019s opponents argued yesterday that the case \u201cdoes not come close to satisfying the demanding standards for granting en banc rehearing.\u201d EPA has remained silent on the matter so far, but may weigh in by this afternoon\u2019s final brief deadline, along with the stay\u2019s industry and state supporters. The court could decide whether to hear the appeal as soon as Friday.  EPA PANEL ON PRUITT CO2 REMARK: OPINIONS DON\u2019T VIOLATE INTEGRITY POLICY: After a letter circulated in conservative news outlets Tuesday clearing Pruitt from scientific integrity allegations for his controversial remark that carbon dioxide is not the primary driver of climate change, the agency released a four-page report Wednesday compiled by five senior career staffers. The panel found Pruitt\u2019s comment did not violate the agency's scientific integrity policy because it was not a "significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant scientific or scholarly community.\u201d However, the report did not discuss how the remark diverged from scientists\u2019 consensus, and concluded \u201cexpressing an opinion\u201d does not violate the integrity policy.  ZINKE TAKES ANOTHER MONUMENT OFF CHOPPING BLOCK: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Tuesday announced he will recommend Trump leave intact the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument in central Montana. \u201cThe monument is one of the only free-flowing areas of the Missouri that remains as Lewis and Clark saw it more than 200 years ago," Zinke said in a statement. Zinke has until Aug. 24 to send his recommendations on the remaining monuments on his list.   BIODIESEL'S DC TEAM MOTORS AWAY: The National Biodiesel Board, which is based in Missouri, is losing two of its three Washington staffers. Anne Steckel, the head of the D.C. office, and Sandra Franco, the head of regulatory affairs and general counsel, are both leaving the group, NBB spokesperson Rosemarie Calabro Tully told ME. Chief Operating Officer Doug Whitehead will come to D.C. to run the office. The move comes at an awkward time, as lobbying is ramping up to get a biodiesel producers tax credit into any future tax overhaul bill, the group's members want EPA to increase the biodiesel requirements in the Renewable Fuel Standard, and they're looking to the Commerce Department to slap sanctions on Argentina and Indonesia.   MAINE LEGISLATURE SUSTAINS VETO ON SOLAR BILL: The Maine Legislature on Wednesday did not override Gov. Paul LePage's veto of L.D. 1504, a measure that would have had utility regulators formulate new recommendations on the future of net metering in 2019. The Legislature passed the measure in June with a veto-proof majority but on Tuesday the House fell short of the votes needed to override the veto.  REPORT SAYS STATES ILL-EQUIPPED TO TAKE ON ESA: A report out Tuesday by University of California Irvine School of Law suggests that most states are legally and financially ill-equipped to take over protecting and recovering threatened and endangered species. It notes that state expenditures on conservation of federally listed species make up only about 5 percent of total national spending on ESA, and found that compared with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, some state laws fall short.   MOVER, SHAKER: Monica Trauzzi, managing editor and anchor of E&E News' video operation, is heading to the Nuclear Energy Institute in September as senior director of external communications.  Joan Card, a Western water expert who served as senior policy advisor in EPA's Region 8 office until January, has joined the natural resources consulting firm Culp & Kelly, LLP.

PRUITT'S CLIMATE COMMENTS CLEARED BY SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY PANEL: A panel of EPA employees has concluded that Administrator Scott Pruitt's controversial assertion that carbon dioxide is not the primary driver of climate change during a television interview in March did not violate the agency's scientific integrity policy. That policy "specifically encourages employees to express their opinion should the employee disagree with scientific data, scientific interpretations, or scientific conclusions," the panel of high-ranking EPA officials wrote, noting that Pruitt "did not suppress or alter Agency scientific findings."  Story Continued Below  Lost in the mail? The panel's conclusion was included in a letter from Thomas Sinks, director of EPA's Office of the Science Advisor, addressed to the Sierra Club, which had formally complained about Pruitt's climate comments. But the green group said Monday evening that it had not received that letter, which first appeared in conservative media outlets. For its part, EPA's press office circulated an article from the Washington Free Beacon to publicize the letter.  Elena Saxonhouse, a senior attorney with Sierra Club, said in a statement that her group was told by EPA staff that the proper process is for the complaining party to be informed first. Moreover, she added: "Pruitt's 'opinions' can have especially weighty consequences for the many scientists working below him, yet the letter treats him like any other employee."  HAPPY WEDNESDAY.

Summer nuclear project in South Carolina appears to be on its last legs after the two owners announced plans to ditch the effort, the nuclear policy universe turns its attention to Southern Co., which holds its quarterly earnings call today. Southern, through its Georgia Power unit, is the lead owner of the two-reactor Vogtle plant expansion facing a lot of the same struggles Summer did: cheap natural gas, cost overruns, anxious investors, and the bankruptcy of their primary contractor, Westinghouse. Taxpayers also have a stake in Vogtle. The Energy Department has provided loan guarantees for $3.4 billion to Georgia Power, $3.1 billion to Oglethorpe Power Co., and $1.8 billion to the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. More than $5.3 billion of that money has been advanced to the firms since Feb. 2014, according to Treasury Department records. SCANA, the majority owner of the Summer project, saw its stock rise 5 percent each day since announcing plans to abandon the reactors.   But many came to Vogtle\u2019s pre-defense since Monday, including two top members of Georgia\u2019s utility regulator (its vice chairman, Tim Echols, has tweeted on the subject more than a dozen times). It goes something like this: Georgia Power has more than three times as many customers (making the cost impacts of the project lower), Vogtle is getting a $3.7 billion payout from Westinghouse parent company Toshiba ($1.5 billion more than Summer is getting), and the Georgia project has been seen as being better managed. Still, every month of indecision costs the Vogtle co-owners about $100 million. Rather than steal Southern\u2019s thunder, an Oglethorpe spokesman told ME the Vogtle co-owners are still working \u201cto develop a detailed schedule and cost-to-complete for the project.\u201d Southern CEO Tom Fanning will hold court with investors starting at 1 p.m.  Meanwhile, in the Sunshine state nuclear critics see the South Carolina shut down as a signal that the supposed "nuclear renaissance is over, Politico Florida's Bruce Ritchie reports. Florida Power & Light Co. told the state's Public Service Commission regulators in May planning to continue its "pause" of two new nuclear units at its Turkey Point power plant south of Miami while it seeks to learn from efforts further north.   FAREWELL, DREAMS OF SUMMER RECESS: August got a whole lot sweatier when John Cornyn told reporters Tuesday that the upper chamber will, indeed, stay in session through next week, cutting its precious August recess time in half.   Minibus idling in the driveway: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell started the process to fast-track the House-passed appropriations measure funding the Defense and Energy Departments, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers, Veterans Administration and Legislative branch. But don't get your hopes up yet \u2014 leaders use the "Rule 14" process, which allows a measure to bypass committees and head straight to the floor, for dozens of bills each month that go exactly nowhere. Moreover, both McConnell spokesman Don Stewart and a Senate appropriations aide warned not to read too much into the majority leader's gesture (h/t Budget & Appropriations Brief).  But what about the noms? Odds aren't looking good for most (any?) of the energy nominees awaiting confirmation moving during that extra time either. ME caught up with Sen. Dean Heller about his hold on deputy Energy secretary nominee Dan Brouillette and the Nevada Republican said there's no deal, \u201cjust conversations and discussions.\u201d The two Republican FERC nominees also don't look like they'll be gaining any momentum before recess, in part because the White House still hasn't coughed up the Democratic nominee Trump announced in June.   When asked about the two GOP picks for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, EPW Chairman John Barrasso said he generally wants "every one" of the Senate's pending nominees confirmed. But Barrasso also said he hasn't talked to his ranking member, Sen. Tom Carper \u2014 which is a big red flag. Carper has been saying for months that he wants NRC Commissioner Jeff Baran, a Democrat, to get reconfirmed alongside the new commissioners, both of whom he supports. Without Carper's blessing, it's hard to see how they get into a big package that needs unanimous support.   BUT SOMEONE IS CONFIRMED: The Senate approved Lucian Niemeyer to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations and Environment Tuesday. Niemeyer, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, previously oversaw military installations and federal energy and environmental programs as a staffer on the Senate Armed Services Committee.   OLD PROBLEM, NEW HEADACHES: Another battle in the long-running war over the Renewable Fuel Standard may be ready to break out in the wake of last week\u2019s D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision voiding EPA\u2019s use of a waiver to lower the amount of ethanol that refiners had to blend into the gasoline supply in 2016, as compared with targets set by Congress more than a decade earlier.   The issue, Eric Wolff reports, is that the court offered little guidance on how to correct that problem for a year that is already in the history books, leaving EPA to decide whether to force refiners to spend up to a half a billion dollars on additional compliance credits for fuel that they\u2019ve already sold, or find a way to let refiners off the hook.  The obvious solution \u2014 requiring additional Renewable Identification Numbers \u2014 has drawn protests from refiners. Instead, they argue the agency could simply rewrite the rule to reflect the actual amount of biofuels used in 2016, just as it did in previous years. But ethanol producers argue the agency should not be able to simply paper over its mistake. Here\u2019s Eric with more.  DEEPWATER, TESLA TEAM UP ON OFFSHORE WIND PROJECT: Tesla and Deepwater Wind are proposing an offshore wind project that would be paired with battery storage. The 144-megawatt "Revolution Wind" project Deepwater wants to build offshore Massachusetts would be paired with a 40 megawatt-hour battery storage system from Tesla. The companies were among dozens of wind, solar, hydropower and even high-voltage transmission line developers that last week bid for 15-year to 20-year "clean energy" contracts with utilities in Massachusetts. The commonwealth posted the bids online Tuesday. Deepwater Wind in December brought the nation's first offshore wind project online offshore of Rhode Island.  WEDNESDAY IS FOR WATER: Get ready for some Senate Energy and Natural Resources water wonkery this morning, when Arizona Republican Jeff Flake's Water and Power subcommittee will look at how infrastructure, management and innovation can improve water security in the arid West. The hearing will set the stage for the inclusion of Western water issues in the infrastructure package some lawmakers are still holding out hope for. With Arizona's top water official testifying, the hearing could also shed light on an emerging deal between the U.S. and Mexico to share in shortage along the over-allocated Colorado River.  If you go: The hearing is at 10 a.m. in 366 Dirksen.  DEMS QUESTION ZINKE'S REVENUE GOALS: Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Maria Cantwell and House Natural Resources Committee top Democrat Raul Grijalva in a Tuesday letter to Interior Secretary Zinke questioned whether he is keeping his pledge to ensure the American people receive their fair share when companies use public land to extract oil, gas and coal resources. The agency's "actions so far this year have served to do the exact opposite, reducing the return that taxpayers receive instead of increasing it," they wrote. Cantwell and Grijalva asked Zinke to answer a number of questions, including how his reinstated and expanded royalty policy committee would address these fiscal issues.   EPA APPROVES FLINT LOAN FORGIVENESS: The city of Flint is off the hook for $21 million in federal drinking water loans, EPA said Tuesday. The move, requested by GOP Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, frees up more money for the city's efforts to replace lead service lines and upgrade its infrastructure in the wake of a major lead contamination crisis. "Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure is one of the President's top priorities, and EPA is especially focused on those communities, like Flint, that need it the most," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.  LEGAL FILING OF THE DAY: The American Civil Liberties Union's West Virginia chapter wants to defend TV comedian John Oliver in the lawsuit over his recent segment on coal magnate Bob Murray. The ACLU's "friend of the court" brief filed on Tuesday argues that Oliver had various constitutional rights to air the segment, which among other things referred to Murray as a "geriatric Dr. Evil." Murray's suit is an attempt "to chill protected speech and silence the marketplace of ideas," the ACLU told a federal court in a brief which includes sections titled "Anyone Can Legally Say 'Eat S---, Bob!'" and "You Can't Sue People for Being Mean to You, Bob.\u201d   The group notes that while its brief \u201cpokes fun at the absurdity of this case, the legal issues raised by it are anything but comical.\u201d (Still, the ACLU included a photo comparison between Murray and the fictional Dr. Evil on page 14.) Murray and his company are currently trying to get the case sent to a state court and secure an order stopping HBO from sharing the segment further.   GREENS CALL FOR SCRUTINY OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: In a report out this morning, Clean Water Action is calling for increased environmental protections around the common practice that uses fluids or gasses to push oil to the surface. Enhanced oil recovery is regulated under a Safe Drinking Water Act program that hasn't seen its regulations updated in decades, requires little monitoring and data collection, and is targeted for a 30 percent cut under Trump's budget proposal, the report finds. It argues that it's difficult for state and federal agencies to push for stricter oversight without evidence of violations or proven cases of drinking water contamination, but that with meek budgets, these are almost impossible to collect.  MAINE LEGISLATURE VOTING ON VETOED SOLAR BILL: The Maine Legislature is slated to vote today on an override of Gov. Paul LePage's veto of L.D. 1504, a measure that would have utility regulators formulate new recommendations on the future of net metering in 2019. The bill does not stop the state from starting to phase out its net-metering program in the meantime. The Legislature passed the measure in June with a veto-proof majority but it remains unclear whether lawmakers will hold their ground.

aV \u000a            By ALEX GUILLN  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Wolff, Doug Palmer, Annie Snider and Esther Whieldon  RFS HEARING WILL BE POPPING LIKE CORN: EPA is throwing its annual Renewable Fuel Standard bash today, an all-day hearing for the agency to get feedback on its proposed rule that will set the amount of biofuel that must be blended into the nation's fuel supply. The agency kept the ethanol mandate at the legal maximum of 15 billion gallons, but it dramatically cut the amount of advanced biofuels, and it will surely get an earful on that.   Story Continued Below  A-listers of biofuels: EPA will hear from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, Chris Bliley of Growth Energy, Bob Dinneen of the Renewable Fuels Association, Frank Macchiarola of the American Petroleum Institute, and Donnell Rehagen of the National Biodiesel Board. Reynolds, whose state leads the nation in ethanol production, will tell EPA she's glad they're on track for an on-time rule (they're actually a bit behind schedule). But "I urge the EPA to raise the advanced biofuel, biodiesel and cellulosic volumes. The RFS is a bold policy, and Iowans and the industry as a whole have always risen to the challenge," she plans to add.  If you go: L'affaire du RFS will be at the Hyatt Regency Washington, 400 New Jersey Avenue NW. It will start at 9 a.m. and end when everyone who wants to has had their say.  COURT REVIVES EPA METHANE RULE, AGAIN: The full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ordered EPA to resume enforcing its methane rule for new oil and gas wells, a potentially temporary but important loss for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s deregulatory agenda. A three judge panel reversed Pruitt's stay, but gave EPA time to appeal. The agency hasn't done so, but industry groups have. The court's order was issued by a 9-2 vote. Judges Janice Rogers Brown, who will retire from the court effective Aug. 31, and Brett Kavanaugh voted against reinstating the rule immediately. More here.  For those keeping track at home: EPA\u2019s methane rule has been on, off, on again, off again, and now back on again. Plus, it\u2019s likely to be off again within a couple months, once Pruitt's proposed two-year hold is finalized \u2014 and then possibly back on following a new judicial review.  TRUMP STRUGGLES TO BOOST BOTH COAL, NUCLEAR: President Donald Trump has promised to revive the nuclear industry and put more coal miners back to work, but he is already finding it difficult to do both at the same time. Dueling announcements on Monday illustrated how difficult it will be for the Trump administration to square its support for nuclear power \u2014 whose main attribute is its ability to deliver reliable, carbon-free electricity \u2014 with its position that reducing carbon emissions are no longer a priority for the federal government. A pair of South Carolina utilities said Monday that they would be pulling the plug on two unfinished new nuclear reactors; Santee Cooper, one of the companies, pointed out that "the current political landscape has reduced the urgency for emissions-free base load generation\u201d among the reasons for the decision. That announcement came just a few hours after Trump Cabinet members trumpeted newly announced exports from a Pennsylvania coal mine to Ukraine, a deal the administration said it helped to negotiate. Darius Dixon explains it all.  HAPPY TUESDAY AND WELCOME TO AUGUST. I'm your special guest host Alex Guilln. The NRDC's Joan Matthews was first to correctly name all five former presidents who were the same height as Trump (6 feet, 2 inches): George Washington, Chester A. Arthur, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. For today: How many presidents were born in August, and how many have died in August?

MNUCHIN WON\u2019T RULE OUT BLOCKING VENEZUELAN OIL IMPORTS: After taking the dramatic step Monday of slapping sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro, the Trump administration kept open the possibility of also shutting down oil trade with the South American country to punish Maduro\u2019s government. The U.S. \u201cwill continue to monitor the situation and consider additional sanctions,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said told reporters at a White House briefing Monday, one day after what U.S. officials called a sham election to give the Venezuelan government sweeping new powers.   The United States imports about 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan heavy crude oil to refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. It also exports about 30,000 barrels per day of oil to Venezuela for blending with the heavier product. Mnuchin deflected questions on whether the Trump administration could impose an embargo on oil imports from Venezuela or shut down U.S. oil exports to the country. \u201cThis president is not going to advertise what he\u2019s going to do in the future. So, all options are on the table and we will consider everything,\u201d Mnuchin said.  BERNHARDT STARTS AT INTERIOR TODAY: Today is former lobbyist David Bernhardt's first day as Interior Deputy Secretary. Bernhardt had worked at Interior in several roles, including solicitor, during the George W. Bush administration and was a lobbyist for Westlands Water District.  TRUMP PICKS HEALTH COMPANY LAWYER FOR KEY INTERIOR POST: President Donald Trump plans to nominate Ryan Nelson to be the Interior Department's solicitor, its top lawyer and third in command. Nelson since 2009 has been general counsel for Idaho-based Melaleuca, an online "wellness shopping club." Nelson previous was the deputy assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and a lawyer at the Office of Management and Budget. Melaleuca CEO Frank VanderSloot is a noted GOP donor who at first clashed with Trump on the campaign trail (even garnering a scornful tweet when he initially backed Marco Rubio) before backing Trump after he secured the GOP nomination. Donald Trump Jr., who has shown influence over and interest in Interior nominees, then visited the company last September.  Trump will also nominate John Henderson to be assistant secretary of the Air Force for installations, environment and energy, the White House said. Henderson previously commanded the Army Corps of Engineers' Omaha district, where he oversaw work related to the Dakota Access pipeline \u2014 and recommended its approval under the Obama administration.  API: BORDER TAX, SHMORDER TAX, AS LONG AS WE PROMOTE GROWTH: API CEO Jack Gerard told ME Monday he was pleased Republicans in Congress and the White House had agreed to drop a border adjustment tax from plans to rewrite the tax code. He instead wants tax writers to give oil and gas companies the means to recoup their investments quicker with tools like accelerated depreciation. "We\u2019re encouraged they listen to the public and the consumers, leaving behind the border adjustment tax," he said. Gerard believes a pro-growth tax policy would replace the lost income from the proposed BAT. "The best tax policy is a job creation policy. If you want to grow taxes, you want people who are in a position to pay taxes." Gerard was touting a report sponsored by API that showed the oil and gas industry supported millions of jobs and added billions of dollars to the economy.  KOCH BACKS PRO-MORRISEY SUPER PAC IN WEST VIRGINIA: Koch Industries has been a major early contributor to a super PAC supporting West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey\u2019s campaign to challenge Sen. Joe Manchin. The group, 35th PAC, which was formed to boost Morrisey against his key Republican opponent, Rep. Evan Jenkins, reported to the FEC Monday that $10,000 of the $20,500 it raised as of the end of June came from Koch Industries. Koch is a contributor to the Republican Attorneys General Association, where Morrisey is currently chairman, and Morrisey is one of the most frequent challengers of Obama-era environmental regulations. Morrisey\u2019s actual campaign was only formed a couple of weeks ago and hasn\u2019t filed any FEC reports yet. Jenkins' campaign, meanwhile, has about $1.2 million thanks to his previously existing House campaign chest and more than $680,000 in donations this year.  CONTENTIOUS ASIAN CARP STUDY COMING NEXT WEEK: The Army Corps of Engineers has alerted lawmakers it will release a draft plan for halting the spread of dangerous Asian carp into the Great Lakes on Aug. 7. The study was originally due out Feb. 28, but was put on hold by the Trump administration amid concerns from the barge industry that it could hamper navigation between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been pushing for the study\u2019s swift release, through methods including policy riders inserted in pending appropriations measures.  THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS THRICE: Letters from ME\u2019s mailbag.  FERC quorum: The Electric Reliability Coordinating Council would very much like the Senate to approve the nominations of Robert Powelson and Neil Chatterjee to seats on FERC to get the commission back to a quorum. The group says $50 billion in capital is "hamstrung" in projects requiring FERC approval, with another $25 billion starting applications. "Every week\u2019s delay compounds the problem as seasonal windows for pipeline analyses close and potential for energy price spikes increase," wrote ERCC Director Scott Segal.  \u2018Red team\u2019 climate science review: The American Association for the Advancement of Science and 15 other science groups have asked for a meeting with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to talk over his forthcoming "red team" climate science review program. The existing peer review system is already "a multi-dimensional, competitive \u201cred team/blue team\u201d process whereby scientists and scientific teams are constantly challenging one another\u2019s findings for robustness," they write.  Monuments: The Northwest Guides and Anglers Association wants Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to leave the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in Oregon and California intact.  GROUP LAUNCHES ZINKE-TARGETED ADS: The watchdog group Center for Western Priorities is launching a six-figure ad buy today pressuring Zinke against shrinking or revoking any national monuments. The spot will air in Washington starting today, with an online campaign running through the month.  Another watchdog group, the Western Values Project, will launch a website today cataloguing \u201cthe revolving door between special interest lobbyists and political appointees at the Department of the Interior.\u201d WVP\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Influence\u201d site has found 21 political appointees with backgrounds in oil, gas, coal or another resource extraction industry and three with conservation or recreational backgrounds. A dozen served in the Trump campaign.  INTERIOR SAW 79 NEW EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS: The Interior Department on Monday posted its fiscal 2017 third quarter report on employee and job applicant discrimination complaints. In the last quarter, during which Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was in office, the agency received 79 new complaints, 58 percent of which involved retaliation allegations. A former Interior senior staffer filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint earlier this month. The agency has received 260 discrimination complaints thus far this fiscal year. The numbers are largely in line with the data from the past five fiscal years.  ENVIRO ATTORNEY RUBIN DIES: Noted Washington energy attorney Jim Rubin died Friday just weeks after being diagnosed with cancer, reports Greenwire. Rubin spent almost 15 years at DOJ working on environmental trial issues and on a Clinton-era climate change task force. He spent the last decade at several D.C. law firms, most recently Dorsey & Whitney.  LOS ANGELES OLYMPICS PUT PRESSURE ON CITY POLLUTION: Los Angeles reached a deal with the IOC to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, giving the city about a decade to work on its historically high levels of smog and other pollution the world\u2019s athletes will be sucking into their lungs. The American Lung Association says Los Angeles has the worst smog pollution of any U.S. city, and despite significant strides in recent years, the area has a long way to go, ALA\u2019s Bonnie Holmes-Gen told ME. \u201cIn some parts of LA, we have over 140 bad air days every year,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is there are a lot of important initiatives underway. But the state of California and the South Coast air district need to step up the work to move away from polluting fossil fuels, which is the No. 1 cause of pollution in the LA region.\u201d  Smog-choked cities have hosted Olympics before \u2014 Beijing in 2008, for example. But China resorted to some serious steps to clear the skies for the games, including shutting down factories and construction projects and limiting car usage, none of which would likely go over well in La La Land. That may help temporarily, but Los Angeles\u2019 smog chronically plagues millions of residents. Coincidentally, Beijing organizers learned some of their smog reduction techniques from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, when car-crazy L.A. implemented new vehicle restrictions and longtime residents were astounded to see haze clear and reveal mountain ranges.  MOVER, SHAKER: Vince Griffin is the new executive director of Indiana Advanced Energy Economy, the state branch of the national group with a similar name that promotes renewables and other advanced energy technologies. Griffin retired last year from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, where he was vice president of energy and environmental policy.

aV \u000a            By ALEX GUILLN  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Darius Dixon, Annie Snider and Esther Whieldon  AUGUST: O-SENATE COUNTY: Senators are back in town this week rather than kicking off their traditional August recess, but with the GOP\u2019s health care repeal effort underwater (for now, anyway) there may be an opportunity for lawmakers to get something done on energy \u2014 which, almost unbelievably, is often a less contentious issue these days. Here\u2019s a look at energy issues on the Senate\u2019s backburner that might get renewed attention soon.  Story Continued Below  Energy bill: Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski said earlier this month that she would push to get the bipartisan energy bill, S. 1460 (115), onto the floor in these extra weeks. It\u2019s largely the same as a version that passed the Senate overwhelmingly last year, and would offer the chamber an opportunity to do something concrete. However, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not have much interest in moving Murkowski\u2019s bill after she helped tank the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal efforts last week.  Appropriations: The last of the four major energy appropriations bills \u2014 the Senate\u2019s Interior-EPA package, overseen by Murkowski \u2014 has yet to be released. If it follows the recent tradition of Senate leniency on EPA spending, the agency would find itself in line for even fewer cuts than under the House version (which wielded the ax must less sharply than President Donald Trump's proposal). However, eyeballs will definitely be scouring the Interior side to find out whether Murkowski includes any payback against Secretary Ryan Zinke, who infamously tried to turn up the heat on her last week about her Obamacare stance.  Hearings: The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has an oversight hearing on EPA\u2019s Superfund program scheduled for Tuesday morning. Witnesses are Steven Nadeau of the law firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn; Jeffery Steers, director for regional operations for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality; and independent consultant Katherine Probst, who recently wrote a paper on Superfund's accomplishments and challenges.  HOW MANY NOMINATIONS PASS GO? Shortly after Friday's collapse of the latest Obamacare repeal effort, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said \u201ca whole lot\u201d of nominees may begin marching through the upper chamber. Plenty of energy nominees are hoping to get off the bench and into the game, including Trump\u2019s picks for EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, FERC and the Energy Department, who have already gotten committee approvals. As far as Senate politics go, there are two tracks of nominees: standalone picks, such as deputy Energy secretary nominee Dan Brouillette, and those who can be sewn into bipartisan packages, like the FERC hopefuls.   Much of the energy world has been waiting for Trump\u2019s FERC nominees to be confirmed, given the agency\u2019s months of paralysis. But don\u2019t expect too much movement there until the White House formally sends the nomination of Democratic pick Rich Glick to the Senate. Glick\u2019s nomination was announced June 28 but not much else has happened since, except Trump\u2019s plans to nominate Kevin McIntyre for agency chair. That has left GOP picks Neil Chatterjee and Rob Powelson on ice. At this point, even if the Glick and McIntyre paperwork came over today, there wouldn\u2019t be enough time for Murkowski to shuffle them through her committee before the Senate\u2019s abbreviated recess kicks off. A big question mark still hangs over Brouillette, who was approved by the energy panel on June 6. He\u2019s not a particularly controversial figure, but Sen. Dean Heller has had a hold on his nomination and it\u2019s unclear how or when that will be resolved.   More than 50 people are waiting for floor time, including NRC nominees Annie Caputo and David Wright and EPA enforcement pick Susan Bodine, and many may be good candidates for getting quietly approved in the final minutes before the Senate goes on recess.   HAPPY MONDAY AND GOODBYE TO JULY. I'm your special guest host Alex Guilln, and while I am one of the last people on Earth not watching \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d I can report that the pop-up bar on Seventh Street makes some tasty cocktails (especially the What Is Dead May Never Die).

ZINKE, PERRY RETURN FOR CABINET MEETING: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry have canceled travel plans in order to attend a quickly organized Cabinet meeting at 10 a.m. Zinke is wrapping up a trip out West and had to pull out of several meetings on Nevada monuments, and Perry has postponed a trip to visit DOE\u2019s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio. It was not immediately clear last night whether EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt will attend, but ME thinks it\u2019s a good bet. The agenda seems likely to include Obamacare repeal (which now enjoys a starring role for Zinke) and the shake-up at the White House\u2019s top echelons.  Less likely to rate Cabinet attention today is Zinke\u2019s monument review. He was in Nevada on Sunday to tour Gold Butte National Monument and Basin and Range National Monument. Zinke told reporters that he hadn't made any decision about downsizing the two monuments, both of which were created last year, according to the Associated Press.   The nuclear angle: The Basin and Range monument has been of particular interest to people on both sides of the debate over the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project, and axing or altering the monument could remove a significant hurdle for those hoping to build the site. Obama\u2019s vast 2015 monument designation was made in an area where a proposed rail link to Yucca was eventually supposed to go.  MY INTERIOR SECRETARY HAS A FIRST NAME, IT'S R-Y-A-N: Zinke (a noted hot dog aficionado) posted a Twitter photo in front of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on Sunday. He gave the vehicle two thumbs up. That followed a Saturday horseback ride with New Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich through BLM-owned Sabinoso Wilderness.  ELGs \u2014 TELL ME ABOUT IT: EPA staffers are poised for an earful today as community activists from around the country head to the agency for a hearing on EPA\u2019s proposed delay of new standards for toxic water discharges from power plants. But first, environmental leaders from Illinois to New Mexico to Tennessee, along with the Sierra Club and Waterkeeper Alliance, will hold a presser this morning before marching to the public meeting.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt moved in April to reconsider the 2015 rule, following industry requests, and in May proposed delaying compliance deadlines during that reconsideration. The rule, which is the first update in more than three decades to limits on discharges of metals like mercury, lead and arsenic into waterways, has been cast by industry and Pruitt as part of a war on coal.  EFFICIENCY GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO BE SPECIFIC ON SPENDING INSTRUCTIONS: A coalition of energy and water efficiency groups, including the Alliance to Save Energy and the U.S. Green Building Council, wants Congress to be crystal clear in how it wants money spent on energy efficiency programs and projects during fiscal year 2018. In a letter to key lawmakers, the groups say they are "increasingly concerned" that a continuing resolution or omnibus bill could give the Trump administration the discretion "to suspend or discontinue programs, activities, or projects in the absence of clear direction from Congress." Specific programs they are concerned about include Energy Star and WaterSense at EPA, both targeted for cutting under the White House's budget. The groups said any spending bill should include instructions for the Trump administration to continue those programs specifically, and they suggested ways for lawmakers to keep more detailed track of how agencies spend the money.  USDA CHIEF SCIENTIST PICK SKILLED AT INFLUENCING POTUS: Helena Bottemiller Evich from Pro Agriculture has a timely profile on Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s choice for the Agriculture Department\u2019s chief scientist post. Clovis doesn\u2019t appear to have the scientific credentials required of the job \u2014 and the ag sector is OK with that. \u201cBack in April, when Trump was on the verge of withdrawing the U.S. from NAFTA, it was widely reported that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped walk the president away from the ledge by showing up at an Oval Office meeting with a map of the U.S. that pointed out areas that would be most harmed by an abrupt withdrawal \u2014 many of them counties and states that voted for Trump, and many of them rural,\u201d Helena writes. \u201cIt was actually Clovis who prepped Perdue for the meeting and Clovis who suggested the secretary take along the map to drive home his point in a visual, high-impact way, multiple sources with knowledge of the exchange said.\u201d  SAGE GROUSE RECOMMENDATIONS DEADLINE AHEAD: The team of Interior political and career staff assigned to review the agency's land-use conservation plans for sage grouse in Western states has until Sunday to send Zinke their recommendations, which may include ways to reduce barriers to fossil fuel development. Given that the deadline lands on a Sunday, the team is likely to submit the report before the end of this week.  NEXT STEP IN TRUMP ATTEMPT TO END CLIMATE SUIT: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday said the Trump administration's request to stop a trial over the federal government's culpability for climate change "raises issues that warrant an answer." A three-judge panel, which earlier this week paused the lower court's ongoing trial preparation, said in a two-page order that the children and young adults who are suing the federal government in an Oregon federal court have 30 days to reply to the Trump administration's complaint. This appeals could decide whether the kids\u2019 climate lawsuit gets to trial at all. More here.  WHAT EPA WANTS YOU TO READ: EPA\u2019s press office on Sunday sent out a release touting an editorial in the Tulsa World yawning over last week\u2019s news that Pruitt frequently returned to Oklahoma throughout the spring.   \u2014 House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats on Friday asked EPA's inspector general to review Pruitt's travel. At least one environmental groups has already made such a request to the IG.  QUICK HITS  \u2014 Tensions mount over contested coal mine ahead of decision.

aV \u000a            By ANTHONY ADRAGNA  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Esther Whieldon, Ben Lefebvre and Eric Wolff  ALASKA-SIZED FALLOUT FROM ZINKE CALL: Swift pushback continues after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke threatened repercussions for Alaska\u2019s energy priorities in light of Sen. Lisa Murkowski's vote against taking up Obamacare earlier this week. Two House Democratic ranking members \u2014 Energy and Commerce\u2019s Frank Pallone and Natural Resources\u2019 Raul Grijalva \u2014 sent requests for investigations into Zinke\u2019s actions to GAO and Interior\u2019s inspector general. In addition, the Western Values Project filed a FOIA request for all records related to Zinke\u2019s calls with Murkowski and Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, promising to sue for them if they don\u2019t get the response within statutory limits.   Story Continued Below  The White House didn\u2019t deny the phone calls occurred with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders instead declining to \u201cspeak about conversations between Cabinet members and other individuals.\u201d But as POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor and Ben Lefebvre report, Sullivan urged his senior senator and the Trump administration return to harmony. \u201cFrom my perspective, the sooner we can get back to that kind of cooperation between the administration and the chairman of the [energy] committee, the better for Alaska and the better for the country,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not telling Sen. Murkowski anything. I work super closely with Sen. Murkowski, but that\u2019s my statement.\u201d  Murkowski responds: In an interview with the Alaska Dispatch News\u2019 Erica Martinson (who broke the story), Murkowski confirmed she had a \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d with President Donald Trump before the vote and spoke with Zinke, who "shared with me that the president was not pleased\u201d afterwards. But she said she didn\u2019t feel pressured at all and didn\u2019t feel like her Interior priorities were at risk. "I certainly hope that those in the administration will continue to work with all of us \u2014 all of the Alaska delegation \u2014 on priorities that are not only important to Alaska, they're important to the country," she said.   Some Republicans said Zinke\u2019s pressure wasn\u2019t unusual: Sen. Lindsey Graham said lawmakers feel pressure from the administration all the time. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter one bit,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to do what she likes. If you\u2019re in the Senate you get threatened all the time by everybody.\u201d And House Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop agreed: \u201cThat is not unprecedented, [he] has a right to do that," he told reporters in the Capitol. As Pro\u2019s Esther Whieldon reports, Bishop said former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell would call him "complaining about some things that we were doing."  Why this could backfire: Murkowski chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which controls among other things how quickly Zinke may get personnel in place, and also holds the gavel of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Interior\u2019s funding. Also, she\u2019s tough as nails and unlikely to be intimidated by anyone. She proved it early this morning, when she joined Sens. Susan Collins and John McCain to help Democrats defeat the last-ditch, slimmed-down Obamacare repeal bill, killing the effort for now.  TGIF EVERYBODY!

ENERGY AND WATER TITLE CLEARS HOUSE: It will almost certainly be substantially reshaped by the Senate \u2014 if not ignored altogether \u2014 but House lawmakers passed $789 billion mini-spending package, H.R. 3219 (115), that included energy and water infrastructure funding, Pro Budget and Appropriations Brief\u2019s Sarah Ferris reports. The $37.6 billion energy and water title includes funding for Yucca Mountain and a rider protecting the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of the Waters of the U.S. regulation from legal challenges, while zeroing out DOE\u2019s ARPA-E program and blocking any new loan guarantees. Senate appropriators cleared their own $38.4 billion energy spending package on July 20 with large differences compared to the House version.   The House package came together as centrist Republicans told leadership they would not back a massive 12-bill spending package sought by others in the caucus, POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade reports. It comes as moderate GOPers are increasingly banding together to undermine leadership as they take from the Freedom Caucus\u2019 playbook.   YOUR MOVE, MR. PRESIDENT: The Senate passed a package of sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea by an overwhelming 98-2 margin Thursday, sending it to Trump\u2019s desk, POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor reports. The White House has worked hard to avoid taking a clear position on the bill, H.R. 3364 (115), with communications director Anthony Scaramucci telling CNN on Thursday that Trump "may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are, or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians." But Congress has shown they can easily override a veto if Trump elects that path. Remember the sanctions only kick in for energy projects in which a Russian company owns 33 percent or a controlling stake.   A former member of Congress with detailed knowledge of the legislation pointed our colleague Daniel Lippman to a provision of the legislation that the ex-member thinks hasn\u2019t gotten enough attention: \u201cA lot of the coverage is about what the bill forces the president to do with the sanctions but what a lot of people are missing is that there is a key discretionary provision [in Section 232] that basically allows the president to avoid meddling in the energy affairs in our European and NATO allies. He can decide to allow to not to punish and not meddle in the affairs of Europe\u2019s energy policy ... [and] he actually has discretion to do absolutely nothing. It is not all mandatory language but it does have some discretionary language. And that could be a key provision.\u201d  WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? White House, Treasury and congressional leaders issued a statement on tax reform Thursday, acknowledging that they were giving up on plans for a border adjustment tax. But the lack of additional details in their six-paragraph statement suggests the GOP's dream of achieving tax reform may be years from completion, POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo report. But Edison Electric Institute President Tom Kuhn applauded the statement and said his organization would work \u201cto find tax reform solutions that will benefit all customers and encourage much-needed investment in critical energy infrastructure by helping to keep the cost of capital as low as possible."  OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY WANTS FULL COURT REVIEW OF METHANE STAY: EPA\u2019s stay of the Obama-era methane rule may be headed to the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. EPA had not filed any petition as of the midnight deadline to decide whether and how to appeal the early July ruling striking down Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s 90-day stay of the methane rule for new oil and gas wells. The court agreed not to order EPA to immediately resume enforcing the regulation, but the judges gave EPA limited time to seek an appeal. While EPA did not file anything on Thursday, a coalition of industry groups did, requesting an en banc review by all 11 judges at the D.C. Circuit. It typically takes the court months even to decide whether to grant en banc review, long past the point at which Pruitt\u2019s 90-day stay would expire, but the court may speed things up under the circumstances. It\u2019s unclear whether the rule will take effect in the meantime, but the three-judge panel indicated it wasn\u2019t comfortable letting EPA keep it on hold indefinitely after Pruitt\u2019s action was found to be unlawful. The groups argued that the stay should remain in place in the meantime.  INHOFE NOT WILD ABOUT RED-BLUE CLIMATE DEBATE: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt didn\u2019t discuss his plans to hold a red team-blue team public debate on the scientific consensus on climate change with him, but one of his normal allies, Sen. Jim Inhofe, thinks it isn\u2019t useful. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be accomplished,\u201d he told ME.  HE\u2019S GOING HOME: Energy Secretary Rick Perry will be in Waller, Texas, at 11 a.m. local time today to tour Daikin Texas Technology Park, which manufactures air conditioning equipment. He\u2019ll deliver remarks to employees and then hold a brief media availability.   Another unusual tweet: After their press shop blasted out a link to Perry\u2019s odd op-ed on Obamacare reform, DOE\u2019s official Twitter account tweeted: \u201cIn the fight between @SecretaryPerry and climate scientists \u2014 He\u2019s winning.\u201d  ICAHN GETS BEAT IN RFS CREDITS MARKET: Carl Icahn's CVR Refining lost $19 million in the second quarter of 2017, and it laid the blame for the loss on spending $106 million on credits needed to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard, according to its income statement released Thursday. Reuters had reported that Icahn had been holding fewer credits than needed on the expectation that RIN prices would drop, a move that worked in the first part of the year. But prices have jumped from roughly 34 cents a credit to 80 cents a credit, and CVR took it on the chin. "As I\u2019ve said many, many times before, RINs continue to be an egregious tax on independent refiners and small retailers," CVR CEO Jack Lipinski said on the earnings call. "RINs prices have been extremely volatile this year, which only proves the fact that RINs market is manipulated...EPA continues to ignore this."  FRACKING RULE'S DAY IN COURT: The Trump administration may be having a hard time convincing appeals court judges to suspend the court case brought by the state of Wyoming over the BLM fracking rule. Lawyers for the administration said in court Thursday in Denver that suspension would help Interior as it works to rescind the rule, which went into place in 2015 but got caught up in a legal battle over BLM\u2019s jurisdiction before it took effect. Judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit hearing the argument didn\u2019t seem too impressed, however, saying they were wary of ceding court process to another branch of government.   CORTEZ MASTO TO ZINKE: HANDS OFF: Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto released a video urging Zinke not to alter the boundaries of two national monuments \u2014 Gold Butte and Basin and Range \u2014 as he prepares to tour the sites next week. \u201cSecretary Zinke, the people of Nevada have spoken,\u201d the first-term senator said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want their national monuments rescinded.\u201d  Zinke\u2019s still in New Mexico today where he\u2019ll go on a hike with local veterans and then host meetings with the Mescalero Apache, Fort Sill Tribe, and Friends of Organ Mountains Desert Peaks. All are closed press. Then, on Saturday, he\u2019ll go for a hike and horseback ride with Democratic Sens. (and outspoken public lands advocates) Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich.   MAIL CALL! OUR ADVICE ON ADVISORY PANELS: Three senior Senate EPW Republicans \u2014 John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito and Mike Rounds \u2014 sent a letter to Pruitt Thursday urging him to revamp past Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee \u201cpractices to make them compliant with the statute.\u201d They write the scientific advisory panel has never detailed adverse social, economic, or energy effects stemming from the agency\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards program because it has never requested that information. \u201cCASAC must be constituted of experts who can provide independent counsel to you in all of the above areas,\u201d the senators wrote.   SECOND TIME\u2019S THE CHARM? The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers is still worried about sanctions possibly being placed on Venezuela\u2019s crude oil exports. The trade association sent a second letter to the White House today asking it to consider the economic impact sanctions of Venezuela's heavy crude would have on U.S. refiners. The White House said earlier this week it would sanction more individuals in President Maduro's regime, but left sanctions on the South American country's oil on the table for the future. "AFPM supports the Administration\u2019s goal of bringing stability to Venezuela, but urges you to carefully consider the impact sectoral sanctions will have on U.S. businesses and consumers," the association wrote in its latest letter.   CONSERVATIVES BACK ANTI-SCC BILL: A group of 20 conservative organizations voiced support in a letter Thursday for Transparency and Honesty in Energy Regulations Act, which would halt the use of the social cost of carbon and similar figures in federal regulatory proceedings. \u201cThe problems [with these figures] are too large to ignore, especially since they are being used to justify regulations that make energy more expensive for American families and businesses,\u201d the letter, signed by groups including the American Energy Alliance, Competitive Enterprise Institute and Heartland Institute, states.   MORE PRESSURE AGAINST GARRETT: Four senior House Democrats \u2014 Steny Hoyer, Gwen Moore, Maxine Waters and Denny Heck \u2014 sent a letter Thursday to Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo asking him to join their calls against the nomination of former Rep. Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank.   MORE THAN 2K WIND MEGAWATTS INSTALLED THIS YEAR: The American Wind Energy Association in a new report said 357 megawatts in new wind projects were brought online the second quarter of this year, bringing the annual total to 2,357 megawatts. There are now 84,405 megawatts of installed wind capacity in the US and another 25,819 megawatts under construction or in advanced development. Power purchase agreements with utilities continued to dominate the scene with more than 1,697 megawatts in new contracts in the second quarter.

aV \u000a            By ANTHONY ADRAGNA  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Alex Guilln, Esther Whieldon, Eric Wolff and Annie Snider  ESCAPE PLAN FOR COAL PLANTS? EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is ready to let coal-fired power plants off the hook for their contribution to climate change, based on a novel legal argument that the Clean Air Act bars him from further regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants because a separate Obama-era regulation on toxic mercury emissions already applies to them, Pro\u2019s Alex Guilln reports, citing multiple sources with knowledge of his plan. That approach echoes a novel interpretation of the statute Pruitt leaned into as Oklahoma attorney general, but it would avoid an all-out brawl over the established science on climate change.   Story Continued Below  The argument, known throughout Washington\u2019s legal circles as the \u201c112 exclusion,\u201d says EPA cannot regulate carbon emissions from power plants under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act because section 112 already goes after hazardous air pollutants from those sources. A federal appeals court never ruled on the matter before pausing the case in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s election, but several judges on the D.C. Circuit appeared skeptical of it during oral arguments last year. Environmental groups, meanwhile, are ready to fight the planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan, including the 112 exclusion argument, and Pruitt's broader claim that the Clean Air Act does not give EPA the proper tools to fight climate change.   Pruitt\u2019s approach won\u2019t be enough for some: Conservatives want Pruitt\u2019s EPA to go further still by overturning the agency\u2019s 2009 endangerment finding that classified carbon dioxide as a pollutant. That approach has divided coal companies, with one industry source saying entities are split over whether Pruitt should repeal the endangerment finding or pursue more lenient rules that would not force plants to shut down. "The more they look at it, the more they\u2019re going to realize they need to re-open and revise the endangerment finding," said Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Trump administration's EPA transition team leader. Pruitt is not expected to repeal the endangerment finding in the near term, though he has announced plans for a \u201cred team/blue team\u201d debate of the consensus on climate change.  WELL FOLKS, IT\u2019S THURSDAY! I'm your host Anthony Adragna, and former Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (a former reindeer rancher) won a general election while losing a special one on the same day back in 2014. For today: Who holds the record for shortest tenure as House Speaker? Send your tips, energy gossip and comments to aadragna@politico.com, or follow us on Twitter @AnthonyAdragna, @Morning_Energy, and @POLITICOPro.  NOT TOO SUBTLE: One day after Senate Energy Chairman Lisa Murkowski voted against beginning debate on Obamacare repeal, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called both Alaska senators to warn their energy priorities were suddenly at stake, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan said. \u201cThe message was pretty clear.\u201d Among the priorities now at risk, according to the paper: the nominations of Alaskans to Interior Department posts, a long-sought one-lane gravel road from the isolated southwestern Alaska village of King Cove, and expanded drilling opportunities throughout the state.  MOVING THAT MINI-BUS! Lawmakers moved their way through dozens of amendments on the Energy and Water-filed mini-bus package H.R. 3219 (115) late Wednesday night. Expect lawmakers to finish two remaining votes on Energy and Water amendments today ahead of a final vote on the mini-spending package on Friday. Among the measures of interest to ME readers:    \u2014 Lawmakers approved by voice vote Rep. Paul Gosar's amendment barring the development of any rule or guidance document related to the social cost of carbon.    \u2014 A bid by Democrats to strip a rider insulating the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of the Waters of the U.S. regulation from legal challenges failed by voice vote.    \u2014 Rep. Scott Perry\u2019s amendment adding $15 million to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by taking away from DOE\u2019s administration fees and Rep. David McKinley\u2019s amendment restoring fossil energy funding to fiscal 2017 levels passed by voice vote. \u2014 A bid to add $921 million to EERE by pulling from the nuclear weapons program failed by voice vote, as did several smaller efforts.    \u2014 Ohio Republican Steve Stivers\u2019 push to block any funding for Cape Wind, the offshore wind project in Massachusetts' Nantucket Sound that has been stalled for years, passed by voice vote.    \u2014 Efforts by Nevada Democrats to remove language barring the closure of Yucca Mountain flopped by voice vote.    \u2014 Seventh time's the charm? Rep. Michael Burgess' perennial light bulb rider blocking enforcement of DOE efficiency standards passed by voice vote again.   Before they adjourned Wednesday night, lawmakers set up a vote on Rep. Marsha Blackburn's push for a 1 percent across-the-board discretionary cut and two Michigan Republicans withdrew an amendment barring the Corps from slow-walking a controversial study related to keeping Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes.  LIKELY TRUMP WATER PICK HAS AG GROUP, RED STATE CRED: The likely nominee to run EPA's water office is David Ross, director of the Environmental Protection Unit at Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Justice, according to multiple sources close to the decision. Before heading to Wisconsin last year, Ross was in the Wyoming Attorney General\u2019s office, where he worked on the 13-state lawsuit challenging that Obama administration\u2019s Waters of the U.S. rule that won an early injunction from a North Dakota District Court judge in 2015.   Ross also spent more than a decade in private practice, largely in Crowell & Moring\u2019s environment and energy group, where he worked on a number of hot-button water lawsuits. He was part of the team that represented the American Farm Bureau Federation in its challenge to the landmark Chesapeake Bay cleanup plan \u2014 a suit that Pruitt joined as an intervenor while serving as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, although he now says he supports the effort \u2014 and represented agricultural groups and fertilizer companies in litigation brought by environmental groups in a bid to force stricter pollution limits in the sprawling Mississippi River basin.  FROM \u2018MONEYBALL\u2019 TO ... DOE? Financial writer Michael Lewis, known for books like \u201cMoneyball\u201d and \u201cFlashboys,\u201d explores the convoluted past, present and future of the Energy Department in a lengthy piece for Vanity Fair. Much like we\u2019ve explained the agency\u2019s many important \u2014 and thankless \u2014 tasks, Lewis tells the story of what DOE does, that no one seems to get it, and how fraught with risk it all is. And he hits the highlights: the loan program, nuclear security, physical and cyber threats to the electric grid, and (paging Sen. Maria Cantwell) an extended section on the Hanford nuclear cleanup. He interviewed Arun Majumdar to talk about DOE\u2019s ARPA-E program, which he launched and is under threat from Trump.  MASSIVE WIND FARM GOING UP: American Electric Power announced Wednesday it would invest $4.5 billion into a massive 2,000-megawatt wind farm that will provide power to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas once completed. It would be the largest wind farm in the country, and AEP says customers will save $7 billion over 25 years once the wind farm is online. The effort includes a 350-mile dedicated, extra-high voltage power line designed to serve up to 1.1 million customers, according to developer Invenergy.   TRUMP TRANSITION OFFICIAL THINKS WHITE HOUSE SHOULD DO CLIMATE ASSESSMENT: Former Trump Transition official David Schnare argued in an op-ed for Inside EPA that the White house Office of Science and Technology Policy, and not EPA, should conduct a re-evaluation of climate science. Schnare, who decried the "alarmist" views he said dominated the Obama administration's approach, calls Pruitt's proposal for a red team/blue team debate "silliness" and "not how science works." He argues that under the 1990 Global Research Act, only OSTP, and not EPA, has the authority to conduct such a review. "EPA can play, but it isn\u2019t in charge and doesn\u2019t have the authority," he writes. Schnare was an attorney with EPA for 30 years, though he is now general counsel for the anti-climate action Energy and Environment Legal Institute.  EU TAMPED DOWN SANCTIONS BILL: The legislation still faces some obstacles before it reaches Trump\u2019s desk, but European officials actually managed to blunt the initial scope of the proposed Russian sanctions through last-minute tweaks last weekend, POLITICO Europe\u2019s Anca Gurzu and Lili Bayer report. Officials are especially worried provisions in the measure could deliver an economic blow to EU companies involved in Russian energy export pipelines or that partner with Russian companies on energy projects. \u201cWe do a lot under the radar because we wanted to avoid the appearance that we are split with the U.S. on the sanctions,\u201d a Commission official said.   NOT SO FAST, REX: Critics are not down with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's plan to slash dozens of positions known collectively as special envoys, POLITICO's Nahal Toosi reports. The administration has already indicated it plans to eliminate a special envoy for climate change. But today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider legislation that will give lawmakers a greater say over how special envoy jobs are filled.   MAIL CALL! WE\u2019RE WITH YOU ON OFFSHORE DRILLING PLAN: A group of 36 Senate Republicans, led by Lisa Murkowski, sent a letter to Zinke Wednesday voicing support for his agency\u2019s new Outer Continental Shelf Five-Year Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019-2024. \u201cWe encourage you to carefully review those areas that were not included in the 2017-2022 Five-Year Program to ensure that opportunities are not missed,\u201d they wrote. BOEM is currently accepting comment on a new five-year drilling plan through Aug. 17 that would replace the plan developed under the Obama administration.   PERRY\u2019S BAD TUESDAY GETS WORSE: Top House Energy and Commerce Democrat Frank Pallone asked GAO Wednesday in a letter to probe whether Energy Secretary Rick Perry misused taxpayer funds in writing an op-ed criticizing the Affordable Care Act and if the agency improperly promoted that piece through social media channels. \u201cI have significant concerns as to why DOE is using official agency resources to weigh in on the health care debate, and am troubled that recent DOE actions may represent a broader effort by the Administration to inappropriately use agency resources on matters well beyond an agency\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d Pallone wrote, asking for an opinion on whether Perry\u2019s actions violated Antideficiency Act, the Anti-Lobbying Act, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017.  TASTE OF WHAT\u2019S TO COME IN SEPTEMBER: House Energy and Commerce lawmakers today vote on Drinking Water System Improvement Act H.R. 3387 (115). The measure cleared subcommittee on July 13 after the addition of amendments requiring states to spend a minimum share of federal dollars on disadvantaged communities, boosting the popular Drinking Water State Revolving Fund's authorization to $8 billion over five years and encouraging removal of lead service lines. Be on the lookout for a manager\u2019s amendments with further tweaks when the session begins at 10 a.m. in Rayburn 2123.   ICYMI: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources shelved a vote originally planned for today at 9:30 a.m. on half a dozen Interior and DOE nominees \u201cuntil a date and time to be determined,\u201d Pro\u2019s Esther Whieldon reports. A committee aide chalked it up as a casualty to the chamber\u2019s vote-a-rama on healthcare repeal.   PRUITT MET CANADA\u2019S HARPER: The EPA confirmed late Wednesday that Pruitt met with former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper back in March. \u201cThe purpose of the meeting was to extend a courtesy visit to the former Prime Minister of Canada and thank him for past bilateral cooperation on environment,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cIt was not intended, nor was it, a policy meeting.\u201d The Huffington Post first reported the meeting, which it said was arranged by a top Comcast lobbyist.   MONUMENT REVIEW ROLLS ON: Zinke continues his visits to national monuments today as his swing takes him to New Mexico. He\u2019ll have a closed-press helicopter tour of the Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument in the morning, followed by a meetings with local elected officials, ranchers, academics, border security experts, and others (also off-limits to the press).   It hasn\u2019t been announced yet but a rural Nevada county commissioner told the Las Vegas Review-Journal Zinke will be in the area next Monday to hear input on the Gold Butte and Basin and Range National Monuments in the state. Nye County Commission Chairman Dan Schinhofen told the paper Zinke would hear from him about former President Barack Obama\u2019s designation of the Basin and Range. \u201cWe don\u2019t object to national monuments, but to take 700,000 acres to protect private property that represents less than one percent of that land seems excessive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it can be pared down.\u201d  Speaking of monuments, the Commerce Department announced it would give the public an additional 15 days to comment on the status of 11 marine national monuments and sanctuaries through August 14, Pro\u2019s Esther Whieldon reports. A spokesperson declined additional comment on why the public comment period was extended.   REPORT: APPLIANCE EFFICIENCY COULD SAVE BIG BUCKS: The Appliance Standards Awareness Project and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy released a report Wednesday recommending 21 appliance standards states could adopt on a variety of products, from computers to portable air conditioners. The groups say those standards would save $113 billion through 2035 assuming they go into effect by 2020.   MORE STATES JOIN GREEN CONTRACT TREND: Two states, Minnesota and Nebraska, this year joined the ranks of about a half dozen states that have allowed their utilities to offer direct-sale, long-term supply contracts for renewable generation, according to a report out today by the Advanced Energy Economy. Under these so-called green tariffs, big companies like Facebook and Google since 2012 have signed deals for more than 8 gigawatts of renewables.  CHANGING THE FACE OF THE GREEN MOVEMENT: Environmental advocates and lawmakers gather today at 10 a.m. in Cannon 421 for a discussion on the need for diversity in the mainstream environmental movement. Reps. Donald McEachin and Pramila Jayapal, along with representatives from Green 2.0, the Hip Hop Caucus, Defenders of Wildlife, LCV and GreenLatinos, participate.   MOVERS, SHAKERS:   Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, chief of staff at EPA under Gina McCarthy from 2013 to 2015, has joined the law firm Van Ness Feldman in its environmental practice. She\u2019ll focus on environmental litigation and national security issues. Before becoming chief of staff, Fleming was EPA's regional administrator for the Southeast, and before that she was an elected district attorney in Georgia's DeKalb County. After leaving EPA, Fleming spent nearly two years as the top legal adviser for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In recent months DeKalb County had employed Fleming as a consultant to advise it on relations and negotiations with EPA and state regulators.  Cynthia Giles, EPA\u2019s top enforcement official during the Obama administration, has joined the University of Chicago\u2019s Energy & Environment Lab as executive fellow and director of strategic initiatives. The organization aims to work with governments to design and test environmental policies that can be scaled up.   Mike Godwin has joined the Niskanen Center as a senior fellow; He was most recently the director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute (h/t Playbook).

aV \u000a            By ANTHONY ADRAGNA  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Esther Whieldon and Annie Snider  LET THERE BE MINI-BUS! The House takes up its first spending package today, with nearly four dozen amendments to the Energy and Water title rounding out a list of the first 72 approved by the House Rules Committee. Here are some of the items that caught our eye:  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Democrats will try to strip a rider protecting the Trump administration's withdrawal of the Obama-era Waters of the U.S. rule from legal challenges.  \u2014 Another Democratic amendment seeks to restore $921 million to DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy account, paid for with cuts to nuclear weapons programs.  \u2014 Republican Rep. Paul Gosar\u2019s amendment would block work on the social cost of carbon.  \u2014 Nevada Democrats are trying to block pro-Yucca Mountain language with an amendment that's sure to fail.  \u2014 Ohio Republican Steve Stivers wants to block any funding for Cape Wind, the offshore wind project in Massachusetts' Nantucket Sound that has been stalled for years.  \u2014 Florida Republican Ron DeSantis proposed an amendment effectively eliminating the position of director of Civil Works of the Army Corps of Engineers.  \u2014 Michigan Republicans Paul Mitchell and Bill Huizenga will get a vote on their amendment aimed at keeping the Corps from slow-walking a controversial study related to keeping Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes.  \u2014 New Jersey Democrat Bonnie Watson Coleman proposed defunding any work in conjunction with President Donald Trump\u2019s January executive order aimed at speeding the environmental review of high-priority infrastructure projects, like the Keystone XL pipeline.  \u2014 And, of course, the perennial light bulb rider blocking enforcement of DOE efficiency standards returns from Rep. Michael Burgess.  Meanwhile, the League of Conservation Voters urged House lawmakers to reject the mini-spending package, H.R. 3219 (115). The bill \u201cseverely cuts federal investment in clean energy, abandoning the research and development that has led to economic growth, job creation, and numerous public health and environmental benefits,\u201d the group writes. It also blasts the inclusion of policy riders in the package.   WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY! I'm your host Anthony Adragna, and former Commerce official Randy Mye was first to identify 19th-century Colorado Sen. Henry Teller as the first to win reelection after switching parties. For today: Who won a general election to the House but lost a special election to fill out the remainder of a term on the same day back in 2012? Send your tips, energy gossip and comments to aadragna@politico.com, or follow us on Twitter @AnthonyAdragna, @Morning_Energy, and @POLITICOPro.  CUOMO WINS ROUND ONE: A federal judge on Tuesday tossed out a challenge from non-nuclear generators in New York over Gov. Andrew Cuomo's multi-billion dollar nuclear subsidy, POLITICO New York\u2019s David Giambusso reports. Judge Valerie Caproni of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said the "zero emission credits" going to four flagging nuclear reactors upstate did not interfere with wholesale energy markets. Instead, she ruled, the program advanced a state policy goal that was within New York's purview and stopped short of treading on FERC's terrain. "Although FERC has substantial authority over interstate wholesale energy sales, the regulation of retail rates for sales of electricity belongs to the States," Caproni wrote in her ruling. "A whole host of measures that States might employ to encourage clean energy development \u2014 such as tax incentives or direct subsidies \u2014 involve propping up the operation of a generator that might otherwise be unprofitable."  Plaintiffs vow to appeal: Non-nuclear generators argued the subsidy, estimated to cost state utility customers between $2.8 billion and $7.6 billion, interfered with FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, and they plan to appeal the ruling, David and Marie J. French report. \u201cThe New York Public Service Commission failed ratepayers last year when it instituted a $7.6 billion bailout for uneconomic nuclear plants with almost no public input,\u201d New Yorkers for Fair Energy Coalition, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. "We will continue to oppose the bailout in the courts and other public forums.\u201d   Cuomo praised Caproni\u2019s ruling in his own statement: "At a time when the federal government has abdicated its leadership on climate change, New York will continue to do all that we can to ensure that current and future generations have a clean and safe environment in which to live and prosper,\u201d the governor said.   9th CIRCUIT PAUSES KIDS CLIMATE SUIT FOR NOW: Three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday hit the pause button on the kids\u2019 climate lawsuit asking for an order forcing the government to take immediate and dramatic action on greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration has made an emergency request for the 9th Circuit to stop the proceedings after a federal judge in Oregon said the lawsuit from a group of children and young adults could move to trial. The 9th Circuit\u2019s one-page order only says that the pause is temporary and another forthcoming order will address the Trump administration's request more fully. It was issued by Judges Alfred Goodwin, a Richard Nixon appointee, Alex Kozinski (Reagan) and Marsha Berzon (Clinton).  SANCTIONS SAIL THROUGH: House lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday 419-3 to approve new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor reports. Arguably the biggest outstanding question is whether Trump will force Congress to override a veto. \u201cThe White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the President\u2019s desk,\u201d Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday.   MORE NOMINATIONS SENT OVER: After being nominated last week, the White House sent over to the Senate the nominations of Joseph Balash to be an assistant secretary of Interior and Sam Clovis to be USDA\u2019s top scientist on Tuesday. But we're still waiting for the White House to send over the paperwork for Trump's last two nominees for the quorum-less FERC, Democratic Senate staffer Rich Glick and Republican lawyer Kevin McIntyre, whose nominations were announced June 28 and July 13.  ANOTHER WEIRD DAY! Energy Secretary Rick Perry\u2019s odd Tuesday started when he published an op-ed on Obamacare repeal in an Ohio newspaper (nothing going on in the energy world, Mr. Secretary?), but it took an even more bizarre turn when DOE confirmed Russian pranksters successfully got a 20-minute conversation with him last week, Pro\u2019s Darius Dixon reports. The trickery occurred July 19 but got published Tuesday in a story in the Pravda Report, a Russian publication, that linked to the audio. Topics discussed on the call, which Perry thought was with a Ukrainian official on behalf of Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, included the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and possibility of a biofuel devised from home-brewed alcohol and manure.  Another day, another rally: Perry and Zinke, along with Trump aide Kellyanne Conway and VA Secretary David Shulkin, traveled with the president to Youngstown, Ohio on Tuesday night for a rally. Picture here.   CARBON TAX PUSHES GOES ON: Two of the Senate\u2019s biggest climate hawks \u2014 Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse and Brian Schatz \u2014 are taking another shot at their carbon tax legislation and will unveil their latest proposal today at the American Enterprise Institute at 3 p.m. Last Congress, the duo proposed legislation they said would curb carbon dioxide emissions by more than 40 percent by 2025 compared to 2005 levels and return revenue collected through the tax to the U.S. public. Details on today\u2019s event here.   SUPERFUND RECS ARE OUT: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s push to speed the cleanup of Superfund sites got a major boost Tuesday with the release of 42 recommendations from a task force, Pro\u2019s Alex Guilln reports. Pruitt also signed a memo with a number of immediate actions, including identifying as many sites as possible for deletion from the National Priorities List and prioritizing sites "where the risk of human exposure is not fully controlled.\u201d   WHAT\u2019S IN THAT TAP WATER? Just because your drinking water utility gets a passing grade from federal regulators doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t dangerous chemicals in your drinking water \u2014 that\u2019s the message the Environmental Working Group is underscoring with a massive update to its database compiling monitoring records from nearly 50,000 public water systems across the country. EWG found that between 2010-2015, utilities tested for about 500 different contaminants and found 267 at varying levels in Americans\u2019 drinking water, including 93 linked to cancer, 78 associated with brain and nervous system damage and 63 suspected of causing harm to children or fetuses. More than half of the chemicals found are not federally regulated, meaning the federal government has not decided what constitutes an unsafe level of exposure.  BOARDROOM BATTLES ON CLIMATE AT RISK? Business groups, led by the U.S. Chamber, are pushing to make it harder for shareholder activists to push resolutions on issues like climate change onto companies for consideration, Pro Financial Services\u2019 Patrick Temple-West reports. The Chamber released seven recommendations Tuesday for SEC consideration that would limit investors' ability to pressure public companies on matters like climate change. Environmental and religious activists hailed a major victory earlier this year when Exxon Mobil investors in May approved a resolution calling for the company to publish annual assessments of the impact of climate change on its business. But the Chamber argued that "no small subset of activists should be able to commandeer longstanding SEC rules for their own parochial purposes."  ALL AROUND THE HILL \u2014  IT\u2019S A MEGA-MARKUP! The House Natural Resources Committee will today vote on 21 bills covering various topics. Among the most interesting: H.R. 825 (115), a bipartisan bill that calls for streamlined permitting for wind, solar, and geothermal energy generation on federal land, and H.R. 2199 (115), which calls for a searchable, online record of federal land ownership and management. A full list of bills being considered is available here.   WILDLIFE BILL SET FOR EPW VOTE: EPW senators consider legislation S. 1514 (115) today that would reauthorize a number of popular conservation programs, including the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and Chesapeake Bay Program, through 2023. While provisions in the package blocking Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in Wyoming and the Great Lakes region have drawn some Democratic criticism, it\u2019s expected to clear the panel at a business meeting.   PUBLIC LANDS BILLS BEFORE ENR: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining holds a hearing this morning on a slew of public lands bills, including a measure S. 941 (115) from Montana Democrat Jon Tester to make permanent a 20-year mining ban imposed by the Obama administration last year for roughly 30,000 acres of national forest outside Yellowstone National Park, and Barrasso's \u201cWater Rights Protection Act" S. 1230 (115), barring the federal government from requiring that water rights be transferred before an entity can receive a lease, permit or other use agreement.  LAST CALL! Today\u2019s the last day for the public to comment to the Commerce Department on 11 National Marine Sanctuaries and Marine National Monuments designated since 2007. The review is separate \u2014 but related \u2014 to Interior\u2019s review of nearly two dozen national monuments designated under the Antiquities Act. Ahead of the deadline, 65 House Democrats sent a letter voicing strong support for the existing designations. Nearly 44,000 comments have already poured in, and you can contribute here. The Center for American Progress has questioned whether Interior will share comments mentioning the marine monument review with Commerce, though an agency spokeswoman told ME they would.   MAIL CALL! MORE CALL FOR GARRETT WITHDRAWAL: Three senior House Democrats \u2014 Steny Hoyer, Gwen Moore and Denny Heck \u2014 sent a letter to Trump Tuesday calling on him to withdraw Scott Garrett\u2019s nomination to run the Export-Import Bank. They join various business groups imploring the administration to pull the plug on the former New Jersey congressman, one of the biggest critics of the bank. The White House has resisted those calls to date.  CONCERNS RAISED OVER EFFICIENCY PROGRAM: Rep. Ken Calvert, the top EPA and Interior appropriator, raised concerns about the Property Assessed Clean Energy program, which helps private customers implement energy efficiency upgrades on their properties, in a letter obtained by ME. The California Republican asked HUD Secretary Ben Carson and VA Secretary David Shulkin to look into whether the program is being used to \u201cmislead and defraud\u201d citizens into risky loans that might ultimately cause them to default.   TIME TO ACT ON HYDROPOWER: A collection of more than a dozen groups, including the Edison Electric Institute, National Hydropower Association and National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, sent a letter to senior House and Senate energy leaders urging them to push for the passage of bills modernizing the hydropower licensing process. \u201cWe believe the hydropower provisions in S. 1460 (115), the Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017, and H.R. 3043 (115), the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017, can provide a framework for final legislation to implement this new direction in a way that protects environmental values, public participation, and all existing authorities of federal and state decision\u2010makers in the licensing process,\u201d they wrote.   OIA RELEASES STATE OUTDOOR RECREATION SPENDING FIGURES: The Outdoor Industry Association is today releasing data on state-by-state outdoor recreation spending. California boasts $92 billion in annual outdoor recreation consumer spending but most other states bring in more modest amounts. New York sees about $41.8 billion in recreational spending, Colorado sees $28 billion, and Utah and Nevada bring in close to the same levels at $12.3 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively.  CLIMATE SOLUTIONS CAUCUS HITS 50: Reps. Steve Knight (R-Calif.) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) announced Tuesday they\u2019ve joined the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, bringing its total membership to 50. \u201cNow 50 members strong, the Climate Solutions Caucus is evidence that there is a growing, diverse, and bipartisan coalition of members of Congress ready to put petty politics aside and find meaningful solutions to the challenges posed by sea level rise and climate change,\u201d Carlos Curbelo said in a statement.

aV \u000a            By ANTHONY ADRAGNA  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Esther Whieldon and Darius Dixon  RUSSIAN SANCTIONS GETS HOUSE VOTE TODAY: House lawmakers vote today on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, but it remains an open question what President Donald Trump would do once the measure reaches his desk. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday appeared to walk back earlier indications of support. \u201cHe's looking over where it stands exactly at this point and we'll keep you posted on the decision,\u201d she told reporters on traveling with the president on Air Force One. The bill, H.R. 3364, includes language sought by the U.S. energy sector that would allow companies to participate in projects as long as sanctioned Russian firms do not have a controlling interest or more than a 33 percent stake in them. It is expected to easily clear the House.   Story Continued Below  Speaking of sanctions, any new penalties currently being considered against Venezuela won\u2019t start with the country\u2019s oil exports, Pro\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports, citing a senior administration official. "Everything is definitely on the table" as far as sanctions targets, the official told Ben. But "round one will definitely not" target the country's oil sector, the official added. Analysts have said that targeting Venezuela's oil sector would crash its economy and make the human rights situation there worse. U.S. refiners have also scoffed at the idea.   SUMMER BREAK DELAYED? Frustrated with their leadership's decision to pursue a slimmed-down, mini-spending package this week, House GOP Appropriators are urging the cancellation of the first week of August recess so they can pursue a full, 12-bill omnibus, POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan report. \u201cThe whole purpose of whipping is to be able to make your case so the fact that we did all this work and it\u2019s not going anywhere is really frustrating,\u201d steamed appropriator Tom Rooney said last Thursday. Sources close to GOP leaders said Monday they were considering reversing course and pursuing the broader spending package. But by Monday night it appeared they still sorely lacked the votes.  In the meantime, the House Rules Committee is expected to finalize the structure of the debate for the mini-bus later today. Lawmakers filed 79 amendments to the Energy and Water title of the package H.R. 3219 (115) on everything from funding for Yucca mountain to increasing funds for DOE\u2019s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to barring a rider related to the Waters of the U.S. regulation. Many of those are unlikely to actually see floor time, but we\u2019ll have to wait until the committee finishes up its work to see the full list of what made the cut.   In a statement of administration policy Monday, the White House backed the underlying spending bill but strongly condemned "continued construction\u201d for the MOX project in South Carolina, which the administration called \u201cunaffordable and risky.\u201d In addition, the White House voiced concern with a prohibition on using other funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund on interim nuclear waste storage activities and called for lawmakers to "further reduce funding for costly later-stage development, commercialization, and deployment activities\u201d on energy research.

BERNHARDT WINS SENATE CONFIRMATION: Senators voted 53-43 Monday evening to confirm David Bernhardt\u2019s nomination as deputy secretary at Interior, Pro\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports. Five members of the Democratic caucus \u2014 Michael Bennet, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, Angus King and Joe Manchin \u2014 joined all Republicans in supporting his bid to serve as Secretary Ryan Zinke\u2019s No. 2. \u201cDavid's extensive experience serving under previous Interior secretaries, his esteemed legal career, and down-right love of our land and resources is exactly what is needed to help streamline government,\u201d Zinke said in a statement after the vote.   Green and good governance groups, which criticized Bernhardt as having too many conflicts of interest to fill the position, vowed after the vote they would closely watch his actions at the agency. \u201cBernhardt is ethically compromised on issues ranging from national monuments to offshore drilling; we expect timely recusals from these decision-making processes,\u201d Kelly Mitchell, Greenpeace's climate and energy director, said in a statement.   SPOTTED: Energy Secretary Rick Perry and fellow Eagle Scout Zinke (in a Scout uniform) traveled with Trump to the 2017 National Scout Jamboree in Beaver, W.Va., and stood behind the president on stage as he delivered remarks. Picture of the two Cabinet secretaries here. Trump tweeted video of them boarding Air Force One as well.   DEEP DIVE INTO USDA SCIENCE PICK: All major farm groups are lining up behind Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s pick to be USDA\u2019s chief scientist who lacks scientific experience and has criticized mainstream climate change science, Pro Agriculture\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich reports. \u201cSome have suggested that Dr. Clovis is not qualified for this position due to his lack of hands-on science and research experience,\u201d a coalition of nearly two dozen industry groups wrote. \u201cWe do not share this point of view." But environmental and scientific groups say he\u2019s not qualified for a position that, by law, must be drawn from \u201camong distinguished scientists with specialized training or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.\u201d Despite criticism of his credentials, Clovis has been quietly winning over rank-and-file at USDA, which was not seized by the chaos that engulfed other agencies, like EPA, during the first few months of the Trump administration.   DEMS READY TO ROLL ON ENERGY BILL? Whatever shot the Senate\u2019s energy package S. 1460 (115) has for movement in the near term likely hinges on today\u2019s healthcare vote, but Energy and Natural Resources ranking member Maria Cantwell says her side is good to go. \u201cWe hotlined it on our side and everybody\u2019s ready to go,\u201d she told reporters. Should the healthcare vote fail, the measure\u2019s backers hope it could be slotted in for floor time as the chamber plans to stick around into August. But a Democratic committee aide was less equivocal about where things stand later Monday: \u201cWe're still working through the amendment process right now,\u201d the aide said.   CARPER BASHES PRUITT: Amid disclosures showing EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt spent nearly half his first three months atop the agency on trips to Oklahoma, Senate EPW ranking member Tom Carper called for \u201cincreased transparency\u201d from the administrator but delivered quite the burn. \u201cMr. Pruitt has spent more days in Oklahoma at this point than President Trump has spent at his golf courses, which is no minor feat,\u201d he said in a statement.   PROBE SOUGHT OVER INTERIOR REASSIGNMENTS: Eight Senate ENR Democrats, led by ranking member Maria Cantwell, asked Interior\u2019s inspector general to look into recent moves to reassign senior career staff, Pro\u2019s Esther Whieldon reports. The move follows the highly publicized transfer of Joel Clement, who was moved from a managerial position involving climate change issues to a job collecting royalties from oil and gas companies. In a letter to Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, the senators said moving career staff to jobs "where their talents are wasted would constitute a serious act of mismanagement, a gross waste of public funds, and an abuse of authority.\u201d   FIRST STEP TOWARD CLIMATE \u2018RED TEAM\u2019? The Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Myron Ebell says EPA might tap Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science from 2009 to 2011, to run its "red team" review of climate science, Pro\u2019s Alex Guilln reports. Koonin, who wrote in 2014 the science behind climate change \u201cis not settled,\u201d floated the formation of a red team in an April Wall Street Journal piece, where he said such a review "would shine much-needed light on the scientific debates" surrounding the issue. Critics say such an exercise would give the minority disputing the scientific consensus on climate change an outsized public voice.   WOTUS TOURS ROLLS ON: Pruitt headed to South Carolina Monday for further discussion with local officials about the Waters of the U.S. regulation. Attendees included Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rep. Joe Wilson and state Attorney General Alan Wilson. \u201c#WOTUS fails common sense test and proven to be government overreach at its worst,\u201d Graham tweeted.   ANOTHER PANEL WADES INTO BIOFUELS DEBATE: Two House Science subpanels dip their toes into the ongoing debate over biofuels policy with a hearing at 10 a.m. that the committee says will \u201cexamine federal funding of biofuels projects and how it affects the private market.\u201d Witnesses include representatives from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and University of Michigan\u2019s Energy Institute, as well Growth Energy\u2019s CEO Emily Skor and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nicolas Loris. More info here.   NUCLEAR, CCS TECHNOLOGIES EXAMINED: The Senate EPW Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety today hears from experts on the research, development, and deployment of advanced nuclear and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies. A committee aide said the session would \u201cinform potential future legislative proposals and review of regulatory activities.\u201d Lamar Alexander, the top Energy appropriator, testifies first. The hearing kicks off at 10 a.m. in Dirksen 406.  HOTTEST TAKE: House Science Chairman Lamar Smith published a piece on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal Monday arguing \u201cthe benefits of a changing climate are often ignored and under-researched.\u201d Read it here.   HEITKAMP DISHES ON CCS BILL: If you, like ME, hadn\u2019t known previously that Sen. Heidi Heitkamp has a podcast, her latest episode features Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Shelley Moore Capito discussing their efforts to enact legislation boosting carbon capture and sequestration technologies. \u201cI\u2019m a very strong believer in an all-in strategy,\u201d Whitehouse said, describing why he\u2019s pushing the bill. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not going to be what it was in the past \u2014 we know that and accept that \u2014 but we do see it as a baseload energy provider, but if we don\u2019t get it cleaner, we\u2019re going to have much rockier roads in front of us,\u201d Capito said of coal.  LBNL REPORT SAYS STATE RPS PLAYING DIMINISHED ROLE: A new report by DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory finds that overall state renewable portfolio standards are playing less of a role in renewables growth, particularly where wind generation is concerned. Across the U.S. last year, RPS drove 44 percent of all renewable capacity additions whereas from 2008 through 2014 it accounted for up to 70 percent of new projects. In 2016, only 21 percent of all wind additions were because of state requirements, although 59 percent of new solar was thanks to state RPS. The report attributes the changes partly to corporate contracts for renewable power and growth of utility-scale projects in states that do not have renewable standards.   REPORT: NEW REACTORS COULD MAKE INDUSTRY COMPETITIVE: Advanced reactor tech could make nuclear-generated electricity competitive in the power markets where the industry has states bending over backward to rescue the existing fleet, according to a report coming out today. The study, being released by the Energy Innovation Reform Project, estimates that the technology under development at eight companies could generate electricity at an average of $60 per megawatt-hour, nearly 40 percent below what the Vogtle and Summer nuclear expansions will be producing at. \u201cAt these costs, nuclear would be effectively competitive with any other option for power generation,\u201d the report says. EIRP\u2019s executive director will discuss the report at the Nuclear Energy Institute headquarters at 10 a.m.  FORUM LOOKS AT GRID INNOVATION: The Edison Electric Institute, GridWise Alliance and National Electrical Manufacturers Association today at 9:30 a.m. kick-off an expo looking at the latest technologies and projects transforming the electric grid. Held in conjunction with the House Grid Innovation Caucus, the event takes place in the Rayburn Foyer.   DELAWARE RIVER WATERSHED FRACKING BAN SOUGHT: Environmental groups from New Jersey, New York and other states will submit a petition with more than 60,000 signatures this week to governors and the Army Corps of Engineers asking for a permanent ban on fracking in the Delaware River watershed area, POLITICO New York\u2019s David Giambusso reports.

aV \u000a            By ANTHONY ADRAGNA  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  AGAINST RUSSIA WITHOUT LOVE: House lawmakers are ready to vote this week on a sweeping sanctions deal against Russia, Iran and North Korea that gave the energy sector at least some of the changes it sought from the Senate-passed version. The compromise package unveiled Saturday would bar U.S. companies from participating in projects in which sanctioned Russian entities have at least a 33 percent interest or a controlling stake. That\u2019s lower than the 50 percent threshold the industry lobbied for but a major shift from the Senate-passed bill, which would have barred U.S. participation in any energy project with a Russian stake.   The bill heads to the floor Tuesday under suspension of the rules, meaning House leadership expects it will clear the two-thirds level of support for expedited passage. In a Saturday statement, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce said the legislation would \u201cbolster the energy security of our European allies by maintaining their access to key energy resources outside of Russia.\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders indicated on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d the White House would sign the package if it reaches President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. \u201cWe support where the legislation is now, and will continue to work with the House and Senate to put those tough sanctions in place on Russia,\u201d she said. But new White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci sent a different signal on CNN's "State of the Union": "[Trump] hasn't made the decision yet to sign that bill one way or the other."  Story Continued Below  Europe prepares to fight back: The European Commission intends to respond \u201cwithin days\u201d if the sanctions become law with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker especially worried about the energy-related provisions in the package, POLITICO Europe\u2019s Ryan Heath reports. In a note, Juncker said the Commission would seek a public declaration that discretionary powers in the sanctions wouldn\u2019t be used against E.U. countries, utilize a regulation to state the U.S. law could not be enforced in Europe and consider possible WTO retaliatory measures. The biggest affected interest would be the mooted Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.   RUSSIAN ALLEGATIONS REPUBLICANS LIKE: Amid the ongoing probe about the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia, conservatives are pushing with renewed vigor a theory that Russia has funneled money to U.S. environmental groups to oppose fracking, Pro\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports. GOP House members and Energy Secretary Rick Perry are among those in recent weeks who have breathed new life into charges that Moscow has sought to discourage European countries from developing their own natural gas supplies as an alternative to Russian fuel and suggested that support for anti-fracking activism may have extended to U.S. green groups. There\u2019s little but innuendo to base those allegations on, but Republicans hope the Treasury Department will look into the claims just the same.  Green groups blast allegations: Advocates like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters, named in a letter from House Science Chairman Lamar Smith letter on the matter, slammed the charges as a move to distract from Trump\u2019s own Russian troubles. \u201cIf congressional Republicans are so concerned about Russian influence, they should start seriously investigating that country\u2019s interference in our election, not attacking long-standing environmental organizations,\u201d said Melinda Pierce, the Sierra Club\u2019s legislative director, said. For what it\u2019s worth, Brenda Shaffer, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Eurasian, Russian and Eastern European Studies, said there\u2019s no evidence that Russian money has gone to U.S. green groups nationally and even less evidence that any money would have been well spent given how hard it is to get fracking bans enacted. \u201cIt would be almost impossible to prevent fracking in the United States,\u201d she said.   WELCOME TO MONDAY! It\u2019s a busy sprint this week ahead of August! I'm your host Anthony Adragna, and API\u2019s Khary Cauthen was first out of the gate to identify Fala as FDR\u2019s dog.

MUST BE THE MONEY: DOE\u2019s decision Friday to seek early retirements or buyouts from 35 employees in its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is due to a downward trend in congressional funding, Pro\u2019s Darius Dixon reports. The part of the department\u2019s budget used for salaries and benefits has declined from $170 million in 2011 to $153.5 million now. "In EERE's case, the program direction account decreased for the third year in a row and this adjustment through voluntary separations is necessary to match staffing levels with current appropriations," DOE said in an email.  HOUSE TAKES UP ENERGY APPROPS: Lawmakers today kick off consideration of a mini-bus appropriations package that includes the Energy and Water title. Amendments to the bill H.R. 3219 (115) are due today at 10 a.m. and the Rules Committee then gathers at 5 p.m. to figure out how to structure debate on the measure. House Appropriators cleared the a $37.56 billion fiscal 2018 package back on July 12 that would close out DOE\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy program and cut Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funding in half. Look for potentially hundreds of amendments on the floor and a vote on final passage late in the week. And there's still plenty of work ahead to iron out big differences with the Senate, where energy and water appropriators want to protect ARPA-E and keep EERE's budget about level with this year.  THIS IS HOW WE\u2019LL DO IT: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's energy policy counselor, Vincent DeVito, sat down with Pro\u2019s Esther Whieldon and said he\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d committed to reducing the permitting process for oil and gas projects on public lands to as little as 30 days. \u201cWe do want to shrink it down to 30 days and to make all the processes as short as possible, but at the same time, making sure our environmental stewardship is not breached, all of which is completely doable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe intend to be a better business partner ... by harmonizing the environmental review process across the board, the one-stop-shopping type of model.\u201d DeVito also said he thinks Interior could shrink the timeline for developing the agency\u2019s five-year offshore drilling plan as well.   Another theme for DeVito is returning Interior to being good partner \u201con the business side\u201d without sacrificing environmental protection. He also reasserted the agency could collect billions more in revenues than it is now despite the current slump of the energy sector. \u201cPunitive policies have caused a decline in energy production on federal lands,\u201d he told Esther. \u201cFolks can't say that revenues are down because the markets declined. No, they were investing elsewhere because nobody wanted to do business with the federal government anymore, so federal government revenues went down.\u201d  Speaking of Zinke, in between remarks at the Western Conservative Summit and ALEC, he and Sen. Cory Gardner announced the release of $20 million in federal funds, along with $33 million in private funds, to fund high priority maintenance and infrastructure projects at 42 parks in 29 states. \u201cUsing public-private partnerships to help address the deferred maintenance backlog remains a priority for the Department and the Trump Administration,\u201d Zinke said in a statement Saturday. He also posted some cute pictures of a visit to Rocky Mountain National Park with Gardner\u2019s family.   Send in the reinforcements: Zinke will get a lieutenant later today after the Senate holds a final vote on the nomination of Dave Bernhardt at 5:30 p.m. The deputy secretary nominee cleared a key procedural hurdle last Thursday with seven members of the Democratic caucus backing his selection.   EPA CHIEFS TALK AGENCY WORK: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt gave an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation that went up Saturday. He scoffed at his critics, reasserted the Obama administration was very ineffective at environmental protection and said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about his ability to work with career staff. Pruitt also touted his commitment to working with states and refocusing EPA's activities in the face of tighter budgets. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to reevaluate how those regions are working. Are they working effectively? ... It\u2019s good to go through these kinds of processes to reorganize and restructure," Pruitt tells interviewer Ginni Thomas (Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife).  A NEW, BETTER DEAL? Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer cited the merger of Exxon and Mobil as an example of a merger Democrats will work to prevent as part of their new agenda to be unveiled today. \u201cWe have these huge companies buying up other big companies. It hurts workers and it hurts prices,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHow the heck did we let Exxon and Mobil merge? And that was Democrats.\u201d  MEET THE NEWEST DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES: Scientists aren\u2019t normally known for their political chops but frustrated with Trump\u2019s hostility to climate science and other areas of research, many are launching bids for office for the first time, POLITICO California\u2019s David Siders reports. Former New Jersey Congressman Rush Holt, a physicist and now chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said he began fielding more calls from scientists considering running for public office. \u201cIt\u2019s still not in the dozens [of prospective candidates]. But instead of two or three, it might be 12 or 15,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThere seems to be a general sense that policy is being made without sufficient attention to scientific evidence.\u201d There\u2019s now a group called 314 Action, a political action committee, that helps people with scientific backgrounds run for office.   WHAT\u2019S THE DEAL WITH EPA\u2019S CLIMATE \u2018DEBATE\u2019? Three senior Democrats on the House Science Committee \u2014 Eddie Bernice Johnson, Don Beyer and Suzanne Bonamici \u2014 sent a letter to Pruitt Friday seeking details on his proposed \u201cred team-blue team\u201d debate of climate change science. \u201cYour efforts seem to be divorced from reality and reason,\u201d they wrote, while asking for information on the format of the review, a timetable for its execution and how participants in the exercise would be selected.   Speaking of the House Science panel, its Chairman Lamar Smith on Friday endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks in the heated Alabama Republican primary for Senate. "This is unusual," Smith said in Huntsville, Ala., according to AL.com, given he rarely gives endorsements in primaries. "But then again, Mo Brooks is an unusually good, strong candidate. I have no hesitation at all." Brooks is seen as locked in a close battle with incumbent Sen. Luther Strange and former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore for the two slots in a likely runoff.  MOVER, SHAKER: Kevin Bush, a long-time policy strategist for HUD, has been named Washington\u2019s first Chief Resilience Officer by Mayor Muriel Bowser. He\u2019ll oversee an office dedicated to increasing the city\u2019s resilience to shocks and stresses as part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative.

aV \u000a            By GREGORY HELLMAN  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With Eli Okun, Connor O\u2019Brien and Jacqueline Klimas  EXCLUSIVE \u2014 MEMO: DLA LACKS DOCUMENTATION FOR FULL AUDIT, via our colleague Bryan Bender: \u201cThe Defense Logistics Agency will not be able to undergo a complete audit of its financial statements for fiscal 2017, in another setback for Pentagon efforts to finally undergo a scrub of its notoriously messy books.  Story Continued Below  \u201cIn an internal memorandum dated July 27, Lt. Gen. Darrell Williams, the agency's director, says that the outside accounting firm Ernst & Young has concluded after reviewing both the Working Capital Fund and General Fund that it cannot vouch for \u2018beginning balances,\u2019 the agency lacks \u2018accurate supporting documentation\u2019 and it is not possible to reconcile differences \u2018between the sub-ledger and the general ledger\u2026 \u2019  \u201cThe massive $44 billion agency has been leading Pentagon efforts to undergo a full audit, which Congress has been demanding for years. Experts have predicted that its experience will determine whether it is actually possible for DoD as a whole to ever get a clean opinion on its financial statements.\u201d  CONGRESS BACKS BUYING 747s ABANDONED BY RUSSIAN AIRLINE FOR AIR FORCE ONES, reports Bloomberg: \u201cThe Pentagon moved a step closer to buying two deeply discounted 747 jumbo jets from Boeing Co. for the next Air Force One fleet after four congressional panels approved a request to shift $195 million in funding, according to congressional aides.  \u201cThe deal to buy planes to be used by the U.S. president from Boeing has attracted attention because of the reason the company has them sitting in storage and available: They were originally built for Transaero Airlines, once Russia\u2019s second-largest airline. The carrier never signed for the humpbacked passenger jets before it dissolved in late 2015.  \u201cAir Force access to the $195 million was approved by the Senate and House defense appropriations and authorization committees as part of a Defense Department request to \u2018reprogram\u2019 $2.4 billion in previously approved defense funds for the current fiscal year, according to the aides, who asked not to be identified in advance of a formal notification to the Pentagon.\u201d  U.S. MAY EXPAND NORTH KOREA TALKS, reports Reuters: \u201cThe United States could shortly broaden talks on a push for stronger United Nations sanctions on North Korea to include all 15 Security Council members, signaling a likely deal with China on new measures, diplomats said on Thursday.  \u201cSince North Korea's July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the United States has been negotiating with Pyongyang ally China on a draft resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea, which fired a second ICBM last Friday.  \u201c\u2018We have been working very hard for some time and we certainly hope that this is going to be a consensus resolution,\u2019 China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Thursday.\u201d  Meanwhile, Air France expands its no-fly zone after one of its jets flew past the location where an ICBM splashed down 10 minutes later, Reuters adds.

McCain's statement follows a report from NBC News that President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested in a White House meeting last month that Nicholson should be fired because he was not winning the war.  \u201cThe Arizona Republican, however, pinned U.S. failures in Afghanistan on \u2018a lack of successful policy and strategic guidance from Washington over many years.\u2019\u201d  \u201c\u2018Our commanders-in-chief, not our commanders in the field, are responsible for this failure,\u2019 McCain said.\u201d  Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s top national-security advisers search for a way to overcome his reluctance to send thousands more troops to Afghanistan, officials say via The Wall Street Journal.  \u2014 NATO SOLDIER KILLED IN LATEST AFGHANISTAN ATTACK, reports The Washington Post: \u201cA NATO soldier was killed and six others, including a translator, were wounded when a suicide bomber attacked their patrol Thursday in eastern Afghanistan, marking the second incident in just as many days when insurgent attacks have killed Western troops.  \u201cThe U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan provided few details about the attack and did not release the nationality of the dead soldier. Navy Capt. Bill Salvin, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in an email that the bombing occurred in Kabul province\u2019s Qarabagh district and that the casualties\u2019 \u2018nationalities will be confirmed once we complete our notification procedures.\u2019\u201d  And the Pentagon identifies the two U.S. soldiers killed Wednesday in southern Afghanistan when their convoy was hit by a vehicle packed with explosives, via The Washington Post.  \u2014 U.S. BOMBS SUSPECTED ISIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS FACTORY IN SYRIA, reports The Washington Examiner: \u201cThe U.S. this week bombed a suspected chemical weapons factory in Syria in order to keep increasingly desperate Islamic State fighters from using them on the battlefield, as U.S.-backed Syrian rebels continue to gain ground in the battle to liberate Raqqa.  \u201c\u2018We know that ISIS has proven in Iraq that they are willing to use chemical weapons,\u2019 said Col. Ryan Dillon, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad.  \u201c\u2018We have not seen the use of chemical weapons in Syria, but we don't want to wait for them to use it either,\u2019 Dillon said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday.\u201d  Additionally, the U.S. is now supplying Syrian Kurds with armored bulldozers to defeat improvised-explosive devices as they continue the fight against ISIS in Raqqa, the Military Times adds.  And Russia announces the latest cease-fire in Syria, paving the way for the delivery of sorely needed humanitarian relief to rebel-held areas north of the city of Homs, writes the Associated Press.  TOP DOCS \u2014 HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS PRESS FEDS ON TORTURE ALLEGATIONS, via Greg: \u201cA coalition of human rights organizations is asking the Pentagon, CIA and FBI to make public any reviews of alleged abuses by United Arab Emirates and Yemeni forces against men captured in counterterrorism operations, as well as alleged U.S. involvement in the abuse.  \u201cThe Pentagon began a review at the urging of Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) and ranking Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Their request followed a June report by the Associated Press that Emirati forces and their Yemeni partners tortured hundreds of men captured during operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  \u201cThe AP report also alleged that U.S. military personnel provided questions to Emirati and Yemeni interrogators \u2014 although they were not directly involved in the abuse.  \u201cAccording to the human rights organizations, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis responded to Armed Services Committee in a classified letter. Now, the organizations want the content of the letter made public.\u201d  UAE\u2019s intervention in Yemen has proven a headache for the U.S., and its drive for influence has complicated the two countries\u2019 military relationship, adds The Washington Post.  \u2014 CBO SCORES SENATE NDAA: The Congressional Budget Office has scored domestic and mandatory costs of the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act S. 1519 (115).   The full CBO cost estimate is here.  \u2014 TRUMP\u2019S DEFENSE BUDGET COMES UP SHORT, CSBA SAYS, via our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget increase for defense is \u2018far short of an historic increase,\u2019 according to a new report released today by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.  \u201cIn fact, the CSBA found the budget request would actually result in an annual 2 percent decrease in defense spending over the next five years after adjusting for inflation and the fact that the administration wants to phase out the use of Overseas Contingency Operations funding as a slush fund.\u201d  MCMASTER GETS NEW COVER, write Bryan and POLITICO\u2019S Josh Dawsey and Nahal Toosi: \u201cNational security adviser H.R. McMaster, who has waged a pitched battle with other senior staff for control over policy and personnel on the National Security Council, is taking advantage of the shield offered by the arrival of his old military colleague John Kelly as White House chief of staff.  \u201cKelly told McMaster this week that he wanted him to remain as national security adviser, said two senior White House aides, and has encouraged him to make any staffing changes he deems necessary. McMaster took that as a green light this week to oust top intelligence aide Ezra Cohen-Watnick \u2014 a Michael Flynn hire who has a warm relationship with Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law \u2014 after months of trying.\u201d  Kelly quickly moves to impose military discipline in the White House, adds The New York Times.  And Trump\u2019s generals try to save the world, starting with the White House, via James Kitfield in POLITICO Magazine.  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 TRUMP LAUNCHES DRONE EXPORT-POLICY REVIEW, reports Defense News: \u201cThe Trump administration has officially launched a review of an Obama-era drone export policy, with expectations in industry that the administration will make it easier to export U.S.-manufactured systems.  \u201cFor months, rumors have floated among both the defense industry and arms control communities that the Trump administration plans to change the 2015 export law that controls what unmanned aerial vehicles can be sold to allies.\u201d  MAKING MOVES \u2014 LT. GEN. HOOPER SET TO HEAD DSCA, reports Defense News: \u201cCharles Hooper, a longtime U.S. Army international affairs officer, has been promoted to rank of lieutenant general and named director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  \u201cHooper was awarded his third star Monday as part of a batch of general officers promoted via voice vote in the Senate. He replaces Vice Adm. Joseph Rixey, who had lead DSCA since September 2013.  \u201cContacted by Defense News, a spokesman for the Pentagon confirmed Hooper\u2019s appointment and said he is expected to be in office come Monday.\u201d  \u2014 SENATE CONFIRMS VA DEPUTY SECRETARY AND NATO AMBASSADOR, reports our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cThe Senate [Thursday] confirmed dozens of high-profile nominations, including Thomas Bowman to be the next deputy secretary of Veterans Affairs and former Texas Sen.

aV \u000a            By GREGORY HELLMAN  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With Eli Okun, Connor O\u2019Brien and Jacqueline Klimas  TOP NEWS \u2014 TRUMP SUGGESTS FIRING TOP U.S. COMMANDER IN AFGHANISTAN, reports NBC News: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with his advisers tasked with crafting a new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and recently suggested firing the war's top military commander during a tense meeting at the White House, according to senior administration officials.  Story Continued Below  \u201cDuring the July 19 meeting, Trump repeatedly suggested that Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford replace Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, because he is not winning the war, the officials said. Trump has not met Nicholson, and the Pentagon has been considering extending his time in Afghanistan.  \u201cOver nearly two hours in the situation room, according to the officials, Trump complained about NATO allies, inquired about the United States getting a piece of Afghan\u2019s mineral wealth and repeatedly said the top U.S. general there should be fired.\u201d  But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warns Trump against firing Nicholson and dismissing the advice of his generals.  \u201cI can\u2019t think of a good reason to fire the general. I think he\u2019s doing an admirable job,\u201d Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t listen to the generals like Gen. Nicholson and he goes down the road that President Obama went, Afghanistan\u2019s going to collapse.\u201d  Meanwhile, Blackwater founder Erik Prince wants to boost the Afghan air war with his private air force, reports the Military Times.  \u2014 TALIBAN BOMBER KILLS TWO U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS, reports The New York Times: \u201cA Taliban suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into a NATO convoy in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Wednesday, killing two American soldiers, the Pentagon said.  \u201cZia Durani, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, said the convoy had come under attack while traveling in the area of Shorandam, which lies on the main road from Kandahar Airfield, one of the largest American bases in the country.\u201d  Four American troops were also wounded in the attack, reports the AP.  And the latest attack highlights an internal Pentagon struggle over how transparent to be in releasing troop casualty information, the Associated Press adds.  \u2014 ADMINISTRATION SENDS MIXED SIGNALS ON AUMF, writes POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cThe Trump administration sent mixed messages Wednesday about a new authorization for U.S. military operations in the Middle East, encouraging senators to work on one while also deeming it unnecessary.  \u201cThe administration first asserted in a letter to lawmakers that Congress' 2001 war authorization covers its current military presence in the region, including the U.S. airstrikes against Syrian government-backed forces in May and June.  \u201cBut in a classified briefing with senators later on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, Mattis in particular reiterated his longstanding interest in a new authorization, according to senators in both parties \u2014 as long as lawmakers didn't try to excessively rein in the Pentagon.\u201d  MCMASTER CLEANS HOUSE AT THE NSC: \u201cA top official of the National Security Council was fired last month after arguing in a memo that President Trump is under sustained attack from subversive forces both within and outside the government who are deploying Maoist tactics to defeat President Trump\u2019s nationalist agenda.  \u201cHis dismissal marks the latest victory by National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in the ongoing war within Trump\u2019s White House between those who believe that the president is under threat from dark forces plotting to undermine him, and those like McMaster who dismiss this as conspiratorial thinking.  \u201cRich Higgins, a former Pentagon official who served in the NSC\u2019s strategic-planning office as a director for strategic planning, was let go on July 21. Higgins\u2019s memo describes supposed domestic and international threats to Trump\u2019s presidency, including globalists, bankers, the \u2018deep state,\u2019 and Islamists,\u201d  reports The Atlantic.  And McMaster also axes Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the NSC\u2019s senior director for intelligence, add POLITICO\u2019s Eliana Johnson, Nahal Toosi and Ali Watkins.  Meanwhile, new White House chief of staff John Kelly cracks down on West Wing back channels to the president, writes POLITICO\u2019s Josh Dawsey.

Email us at ghellman@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @greg_hellman, @morningdefense and @politicopro.  SHANAHAN AIMS TO BUILD AN INNOVATION \u2018FARM LEAGUE,\u2019 writes our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cTwo of former Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s key initiatives will report to a new undersecretary under a reorganization that the deputy Defense secretary says will improve the military\u2019s \u2018farm league\u2019 for innovation.  \u201cThe fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act dissolved the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and split it into two new posts: an undersecretary for research and engineering that will focus on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment that will focus on program management.  \u201cIn the bill, Congress asked the Pentagon for a plan to implement the split, which it delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday.  \u201cUnder the new reorganization, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, which previously reported directly to the Defense secretary, will be under the research and engineering undersecretary along with the Strategic Capabilities Office and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\u201d  MATTIS ADVISED THE UAE BEFORE JOINING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, via your Morning D correspondent: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis worked as a military adviser for the United Arab Emirates in 2015 after retiring as a four-star Marine general and before joining the Trump administration, according to Pentagon records obtained by the Project on Government Oversight.  Mattis wasn\u2019t paid for his work, except reimbursement for travel expenses, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told POGO.  \u201cSecretary Mattis\u2019s previously undisclosed relationship with the UAE could also add a new dimension to recent controversies surrounding the UAE\u2019s role in convincing President Trump to support a blockade on Qatar,\u201d POGO concluded.  Among other retired senior officers who received permission from the Pentagon to work with foreign governments, POGO reported, are White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, former National Security Adviser to President Barack Obama retired Marine Gen. James Jones and former Marine Corps Commandant retired Gen. James Amos.  CNN first reported news of Mattis\u2019 work on behalf of UAE.  Meanwhile, Qatar signs a $6 billion deal with Italy to purchase six naval vessels amid an ongoing blockade by Arab Gulf countries against Qatar, adds the AP.  TRUMP SIGNS RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL, report POLITICO\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum and Elana Schor: \u201cPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a bipartisan bill placing new sanctions on Russia \u2014 but in a statement, he claimed multiple aspects of the legislation violate the Constitution.  \u201cThe sanctions, aimed at punishing Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, limit the president\u2019s power to lift the sanctions without congressional approval and were initially resisted by the administration.  \u201cIn one of two statements released almost simultaneously Wednesday morning by the White House, Trump said he supports the law's efforts to crack down on the actions of Iran, North Korea and Russia. But the White House protested what it sees as congressional encroachment on the president\u2019s power in foreign affairs.\u201d  \u2014 AND CONGRESS READIES FOR AN INF TREATY FIGHT, writes our colleague Bryan Bender: \u201cCongress is moving to force the Pentagon to violate a nuclear arms treaty with Russia \u2014 in yet another effort to box in President Donald Trump on relations with Moscow.  \u201cLanguage in key defense bills in both the House and Senate would require the military to begin developing medium-range missiles banned by a 1987 treaty that Ronald Reagan negotiated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the twilight years of the Cold War.  \u201cSupporters say the move is necessary because Russian President Vladimir Putin has violated the pact. But opponents fear it could increase the chances of a nuclear confrontation at a time when relations between the two nations are at a post-Cold War low.\u201d  CONGRESS PASSES GI BILL EXPANSION, reports POLITICO\u2019S Michael Stratford: \u201cThe Senate signed off Wednesday on a sweeping expansion of GI Bill education benefits, sending the bipartisan legislation dubbed the \u2018Forever GI Bill\u2019 to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.  \u201cThe bill, which would increase veterans benefits by more than $3 billion over the next decade, passed the Senate by unanimous consent.  \u201cVeterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin had encouraged passage of the bill, and a White House spokesman told POLITICO that Trump plans to sign it.\u201d  MCCAIN PLANS TO WORK DURING CANCER TREATMENT, reports our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said Wednesday he's \u2018feeling good\u2019 just days after starting treatment for brain cancer and vowed to continue working and return to the Senate in September.  \u201cThe Arizona Republican sounded an upbeat note in an interview on \u2018The Mike Broomhead Show\u2019 on Phoenix talk radio station KFYI, his first since he began treatment Monday.  "\u2019It's a tough challenge, of course, but [I'm] getting the best care you can possibly have. I'm eating well and feeling fine, getting plenty of exercise,\u2019 McCain said.\u201d  IRAN ROCKET LAUNCH \u2018THREATENING,\u2019 U.S. SAYS, via the AP: \u201cThe United States and three Western allies are calling Iran's recent launch of a satellite-carrying rocket \u2018a threatening and provocative step\u2019 that is \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with a U.N. resolution endorsing the 2015 agreement to rein in its nuclear program.  \u201cIn a letter to the U.N. Security Council, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, they complained that Iran's Simorgh space launch vehicle, if configured as a ballistic missile, would have the range and \u2018payload capacity to carry a nuclear warhead.\u2019  \u201cThe U.S., France, Germany and the United Kingdom said this is \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with a provision in the 2015 resolution adopted by the Security Council calling on Iran \u2018not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\u2019\u201d  AIR FORCE LAUNCHES AN ICBM TEST, reports the AP: \u201cThe U.S. Air Force successfully launched an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile from California, the fourth such test this year.  \u201cThe 30th Space Wing says the Minuteman 3 missile launched at 2:10 a.m. Wednesday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles.  \u201cAn Air Force statement said the test would show the effectiveness, readiness, and accuracy of the weapon system.\u201d  Meanwhile, the Missile Defense Agency plans to pursue new technology, including a wide array of radars and sensors, to enhance homeland missile defense, adds Defense News.  And Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), chairwoman of SASC\u2019s Strategic Forces Subcommittee, urges Congress to support missile defense efforts.  \u2014 PENCE REJECTS DIRECT TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA, via The Wall Street Journal: \u201cU.S. Vice President Mike Pence rejected the notion of holding direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at curbing the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program, saying the right strategy doesn\u2019t involve \u2018engaging North Korea directly.\u2019  \u201cInstead, Mr. Pence said he favored economic and diplomatic pressure while pushing China to use its clout with Pyongyang. The U.S. isn\u2019t ruling out military action against North Korea, leaving \u2018all options are on the table,\u2019 said Mr. Pence, who spoke in his cabin aboard Air Force Two as he flew home Wednesday from a trip to Estonia, Georgia and Montenegro.\u201d  And the U.S. travel ban to North Korea will take effect Sept. 1, reports Reuters.  Tillerson plans to press China and the ASEAN states on North Korea when he attends regional meetings in Manila, Reuters adds.   But there\u2019s no simple military solution on North Korea, writes CNN.  POLAND SENDS CONFLICTING MESSAGES ON PATRIOT MISSILES, writes Defense News: \u201cThe secretary of state at Poland\u2019s Ministry of National Defence has threatened to break off an impending deal with the U.S. government to buy Patriot air-and-missile defense systems if certain requirements for technology transfers are not met, according to a letter sent July 15 to the director of the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency.  \u201cThen the Polish government attempted to temper the letter in an Aug. 1 posting on the ministry\u2019s website after the letter went public.  \u201cThe letter was sent just over a week after a memorandum was signed by Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz and DSCA Director Vice Adm. Joseph Rixey that set up a two-phased plan to buy Patriot. The memo signing directly followed a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to Poland where he praised Poland for wanting to buy Patriot.\u201d  ISRAEL BEGINS WORK ON THE NEXT ARROW, reports Defense News: \u201cIsrael\u2019s Defense Ministry and industry developers have begun early work on what could evolve into the Arrow-4, a new missile-intercepting system to defend against much more sophisticated, future threats from Iran.  \u201cIn interviews here, defense and industry sources assess the specter of massive salvo strikes, sub-munition warheads and multiple reentry vehicles, or MRV, as the next major technological challenges that Israel\u2019s integrated, multitiered national defense network may have to contend with a decade down the road.  \u201cTo this end, Israel\u2019s MAFAT Defense Research and Development Authority is working with state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and other firms to evaluate technologies needed to improve the ability to track, target and ultimately destroy such threats.\u201d  SPEED READ  \u2014 The VA fires the head of Washington\u2019s VA Medical Center: News 4 NBC Washington  \u2014 Christopher Wray is sworn in as the new FBI director: POLITICO  \u2014 The Navy\u2019s top lawyer faces an investigation about targeting SEAL commandos: The San Diego Union-Tribune  \u2014 A transgender former Navy SEAL warns on Trump\u2019s transgender ban: \u201cIf this goes through ... it\u2019s going to be a fight\u201d: POLITICO  \u2014 Afghanistan worries about a stronger Islamic State threat: Reuters  \u2014 A Pentagon-funded program to bolster Afghan intelligence capabilities is branded a failure: The Guardian  \u2014 Trump quickly ended the CIA\u2019s covert program to train and equip Syria rebels to overthrow Assad, one of the costliest covert programs in the agency\u2019s history: NYT  \u2014 A top State Department official warns of \u201cgrave\u201d consequences if Syria's al Qaeda dominates Idlib province: Reuters  \u2014 Russian military losses in Syria jump this year: Reuters  \u2014 Militants and refugees return to Syria under a cease-fire deal brokered between Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda: NYT  \u2014 Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan replaces his top military chiefs: NYT  \u2014 Turkey and China pledge close security cooperation: AP  \u2014 The Navy takes specialized stealthy boats out for a ride in the Middle East: The War Zone  \u2014 An arms deal becomes a job deal in Australia: WSJ  \u2014 China joins the U.S. and Japan in searching for a missing American sailor in the South China Sea: Navy Times  \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence accuses Russia of working to "destabilize" the Western Balkans and divide the region from the West: Reuters  \u2014 An early look at the National Museum of the United States Army\u2019s first artifacts: Task & Purpose  \u2014 Sen.

Story Continued Below  Asked about what Mattis will tell senators, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the Defense Department wants, but does not legally need, a new authorization.  \u201cWe don\u2019t require it legally, but it is in our view a signal of our national intent,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as that\u2019s the case, we certainly support a new one, but we certainly wouldn\u2019t want to have a lapse from the old one before a new one came along.\u201d  WAR REPORT \u2014 ATTACKERS LAUNCH DEADLY STRIKE ON AFGHAN MOSQUE, reports Reuters: \u201cA suicide attack on a Shi'ite mosque in the western Afghan city of Herat killed more than 29 people and wounded more than 64 on Tuesday, officials said.  \u201cMore than 1,700 civilians have been killed in attacks in Afghanistan so far this year, hitting confidence in the Western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani.  \u201cAbdulhai Walizada, a local police spokesman, said there appeared to be more than one attacker on Tuesday, with witnesses describing a suicide bomber who detonated explosives and at least one other, a gunman who threw grenades at worshippers.\u201d  \u2014 TWO INJURED IN HARD HELO LANDING, reports the Associated Press: \u201cA NATO statement says a U.S. Black Hawk helicopter encountered a mechanical problem that forced a hard landing in eastern Afghanistan.

SENATE CONFIRMS NAVY SECRETARY AND PENTAGON ACQUISITION CHIEF, in a bloc of eight nominations, breaking a major defense personnel logjam, reports our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cThe Senate [Tuesday night] quickly and quietly confirmed a slew of civilian Defense Department nominees, including President Donald Trump's picks for Navy secretary and Pentagon acquisition chief.  \u201cIn total, eight nominees were confirmed by voice vote. The group includes Richard Spencer to be Navy secretary and Ellen Lord as undersecretary of acquisition, technology and logistics.\u201d  Also confirmed were:  \u2014 Ryan McCarthy to be undersecretary of the Army.  \u2014 Matthew Donovan to be undersecretary of the Air Force.  \u2014 Robert Daigle for director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation.  \u2014 Elaine McCusker for principal deputy undersecretary in the comptroller's office.  \u2014 Lucian Niemeyer to be assistant secretary of Defense for energy, installations and environment.  \u2014 And Robert Hood to be assistant secretary of Defense for legislative affairs.  McCain hails the confirmations, but urges the White House to hasten nominations to the Pentagon.  \u201cI hope the White House will expeditiously send the Senate nominations for the many positions that remain unfilled at the Department of Defense,\u201d the senator said in a written statement. \u201cAt a time when the threats to our country continue to grow, neither the White House nor the Senate can afford to delay any further in giving [Defense] Secretary [Jim] Mattis the leadership team he needs to defend our national security.\u201d  \u2014 AND WRAY IS CONFIRMED AS FBI DIRECTOR, reports POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim: \u201cChristopher Wray on Tuesday was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate to head the FBI, winning bipartisan support for his commitment to remain fiercely independent from any political pressure.  \u201cThe 92-5 vote installs Wray as FBI director at a consequential time. The bureau was rocked by President Donald Trump's abrupt dismissal of James Comey in May as Comey was overseeing the federal investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\u201d  Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says a report that President Donald Trump personally dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement regarding a meeting last summer in New York with a Russian lawyer \u201cbothers me a lot,\u201d via POLITICO\u2019s Louis Nelson.  And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders says the president \u201cweighed in\u201d on his son\u2019s misleading statement about the meeting in Trump Tower, Louis adds.  SENATE SENDS VA CHOICE FUNDING TO THE PRESIDENT: The Senate Tuesday night passed legislation replenishing the Veterans Choice Program for another six months, sending the measure to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it.  The $2.1 billion legislation comes just in the nick of time for the program, which subsidizes outside medical care for vets who face long waits or distances to access the VA system. The VA predicts the emergency program will run out of cash later this month, far earlier than anticipated.   The bill also authorizes 28 leases for major VA medical facilities and includes provisions aimed at beefing up VA's recruitment and retention efforts.  ROMANIA PLEDGES $11.3 BILLION IN DEFENSE SPENDING, reports the AP: \u201cRomania\u2019s top defense body has approved a 9.8 billion-euro ($11.3 billion) spending plan for the next decade and has pledged to spend 2 percent of its GDP on defense as NATO requests of its members. The Supreme Defense Council met Tuesday and agreed to spend the money to upgrade the country\u2019s military from 2017-2026.  \u201cLast week Defense Minister Adrian Tutuianu said Romania would buy Patriot missiles worth $3.9 billion from the U.S.\u201d  But issues with capacity and interoperability still plague missile defense systems in Europe, writes Defense News.  Meanwhile, NATO intercepts Russian jets in Estonian airspace, reports Reuters.  And Vice President Mike Pence pledges support for the country of Georgia, his second stop on a European trip backing nations that feel threatened by Russian aggression, adds the AP.  COAST GUARD CHIEF WON\u2019T \u2018BREAK FAITH\u2019 WITH TRANSGENDER PERSONNEL, via your Morning D correspondent: \u201cThe head of the Coast Guard is pledging he \u2018will not break faith\u2019 with transgender personnel, marking the strongest rebuttal yet by a leader of the armed forces to President Donald Trump's declaration that he wants to ban all transgender troops.  \u201cCommandant Paul Zukunft, in remarks to a Washington think tank on Tuesday, cited the story of Coast Guard Lt. Taylor Miller, who was featured last week in The Washington Post, to express his support for transgender members of his service.  \u201c\u2018I told Taylor I will not turn my back,\u2019 Zukunft told the Center for Strategic and International Studies forum. \u2018We have made an investment in you and you have made an investment in the Coast Guard, and I will not break faith.\u2019\u201d  Additionally, 56 retired generals and admirals criticize Trump\u2019s planned ban, writing that it would \u201cdegrade readiness,\u201d adds Jacqueline.  \u2014 AND THE COMMANDANT IS \u2018VERY CONFIDENT\u2019 A NEW ICEBREAKER WON\u2019T BREAK THE BANK, also via Greg: Zukunft added at the CSIS forum he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d American shipyards can build the Coast Guard\u2019s new icebreaker for less than $1 billion.  \u201cI am very confident we will drive the initial acquisition cost of this platform south of a billion dollars,\u201d Zukunft said. \u201cMake no mistake: This will be built in the United States with U.S. parts\u2026 That signal\u2019s been sent loud and clear.\u201d  The bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee would provide the Coast Guard $19 million towards acquisition of the icebreakers in fiscal 2018.  TOP BUDGET DOCS \u2014 CRS BREAKS DOWN DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, via Connor: \u201cA new report from the Congressional Research Service analyzes the House-passed fiscal 2018 defense appropriations legislation.  \u201cThe report breaks down the bill's ... level of regular base appropriations, war funding and the special National Defense Restoration Fund, which gives the Pentagon broad authority to spend $28.6 billion to implement a new defense strategy.\u201d  \u2014 TRUMP-ERA DEFENSE SPENDING MORE REAGAN THAN OBAMA, Avascent\u2019s Matt Valone writes in an analysis for The Hill: \u201cThe Trump administration came into office boldly promising a turnaround, if not an outright boom, in military spending.  \u201cDefense hawks remained hopeful for a return to fiscally bold Reagan-era outlays on new hardware and personnel. However, for all its potential, a sea change in Defense Department budgeting looks increasingly unlikely based on fiscal 2017 appropriations and the administration\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget request, which represents a high-water mark for possible defense budget outcomes.\u201d  TILLERSON: \u2018WE DO NOT SEEK REGIME CHANGE\u2019 IN NORTH KOREA, via The Washington Post: \u201cSecretary of State Rex Tillerson called Tuesday for a dialogue with North Korea and acknowledged that U.S. relations with Russia have worsened during the Trump administration.  \u201cDuring wide-ranging comments at the State Department marking six months since his confirmation, Tillerson told reporters that the United States does not aim to depose the government in Pyongyang or use military force.  \u201c\u2018We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th Parallel,\u2019 he said.\u201d  Meanwhile, a commercial jet came dangerously close to where last week\u2019s North Korean ballistic missile test landed, reports ABC News.  And here\u2019s how North Korea continues to get what it wants and needs, via the AP.  VENEZUELA\u2019S PRESIDENT CRACKS DOWN ON OPPOSITION, writes The New York Times: \u201cThe government agents barged into the homes of two prominent former mayors, hauling them off to jail in the dark. They dragged one of them into the street in his blue pajamas as witnesses screamed that he was being kidnapped.  \u201cThe two men, both vocal members of the opposition, had been arrested before. But as the doors shut and the cars sped away early on Tuesday, many Venezuelans worried that it marked the start of a new dictatorship in South America.  \u201cPresident Nicols Maduro and his leftist movement have seized control of the country, not through a coup, but through a contentious power grab that has gutted Venezuela\u2019s democratic institutions and effectively eliminated any official political challenges.\u201d  Maduro says he will soon convene an assembly to rewrite the constitution, via the AP.  And Trump \u201ccondemns\u201d his actions, including the arrests of opposition leaders Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma.  \u201cThe United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cWe reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners.\u201d  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 AIR FORCE EYES UNDELIVERED 747\u2019S FOR A FAILED RUSSIAN AIRLINE TO CUT AIR FORCE ONE COSTS, reports Defense One: \u201cPresident Donald Trump said the projected cost of new Air Force One aircraft was too high, so the U.S. Air Force found a way to lower it: by buying a pair of Boeing 747 jetliners abandoned by a bankrupt Russian airline.  \u201cAir Force officials are now finalizing a contract with Boeing for the two planes, according to three defense officials with knowledge of the deal. The Pentagon could publicly announce the deal as soon as this week.\u201d  \u2014 L3 AND AIR TRACTOR JOIN OA-X EXPERIMENT, writes Defense News: \u201cThe Air Force kicked off a demonstration of light attack aircraft on Monday as two companies \u2014 L3 and Air Tractor \u2014 made a last-minute announcement that they would participate in the experiment.  \u201cThe announcement injects a fourth aircraft into the Air Force\u2019s OA-X demo at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. L3 and Air Tractor will put forward the AT-802L Longsword, the companies stated in a press release. The A-29, built by Sierra Nevada Corp. and Embraer, and two Textron aircraft \u2014 the Scorpion jet and Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine \u2014 will also fly.\u201d  MAKING MOVES \u2014 MILITARY ACADEMIC TAPPED AS TOP NSC MIDEAST ADVISER, report Connor and Andrew Restuccia: \u201cRetired Army Col. Michael Bell has been promoted to the top Middle East adviser on the National Security Council, two White House officials said.  \u201cBell, who was most recently the NSC director of Persian Gulf affairs, is now senior director for the Near East. He succeeds Derek Harvey, who was dismissed last week by national security adviser H.R.

aV \u000a            By GREGORY HELLMAN  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With Eli Okun, Connor O\u2019Brien and Jacqueline Klimas  DRIVING THE DAY \u2014 PENTAGON SET TO UNVEIL NEW ACQUISITION STRUCTURE, reports Defense News: \u201cThe Pentagon is scheduled to deliver its new acquisition structure to Congress on Tuesday, a major step toward redesigning how the building researches and procures equipment.  Story Continued Below  \u201cThe 2017 National Defense Authorization Act instructed the Pentagon to devolve the undersecretary of acquisition, technology and logistics, or AT&L, into two separate jobs: undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, or A&S; and a new undersecretary for research and engineering, or R&E, essentially a chief technology officer. Those changes are expected to be in place by Feb. 1, 2018.  \u201cCongress purposefully allowed time for the Department of Defense to come up with its own road map on how the split should occur, which the department is supposed to deliver to Capitol Hill on Aug 1.\u201d  PENTAGON AND STATE DEVELOP PLANS TO ARM UKRAINE, reports The Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe U.S. Pentagon and State Department have devised plans to supply Ukraine with antitank missiles and other weaponry and are seeking White House approval, U.S. officials said, as Kiev battles Russia-backed separatists and ties between Moscow and Washington fray.  \u201cAmerican military officials and diplomats say the arms, which they characterized as defensive, are meant to deter aggressive actions by Moscow, which the U.S. and others say has provided tanks and other sophisticated armaments as well as military advisers to rebels fighting the Kiev government.\u201d  And Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) tweets: \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d  Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence reaffirms NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense following a meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, via The Associated Press.  And Russia urges the U.S. to show the \u201cpolitical will\u201d to repair ties between the two countries after slashing the number of U.S. diplomatic personnel allowed in Russia, the AP adds.  \u2014 RUSSIAN PLANS FOR MILITARY DRILLS NEAR NATO BORDER RAISE FEARS, writes The New York Times: \u201cRussia is preparing to send as many as 100,000 troops to the eastern edge of NATO territory at the end of the summer, one of the biggest steps yet in the military buildup undertaken by President Vladimir V. Putin and an exercise in intimidation that recalls the most ominous days of the Cold War.  \u201cThe troops are conducting military maneuvers known as Zapad, Russian for \u2018west,\u2019 in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The drills will feature a reconstituted armored force named for a storied Soviet military unit, the First Guards Tank Army. Its establishment represents the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union that so much offensive power has been concentrated in a single command.\u201d  HAPPY TUESDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

MORE PENTAGON NOMINEES ON STANDBY: With no votes on health care and the pending National Defense Authorization Act likely before the Senate kicks off its August recess, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to hold confirmation votes on more Trump nominees this week. While no votes have been announced on defense picks yet, 12 civilian nominees are pending in the Senate, including Navy secretary nominee Richard Spencer and Pentagon acquisition chief pick Ellen Lord.  WAR REPORT \u2014 MCCAIN VOWS TO PRODUCE HIS OWN AFGHANISTAN STRATEGY, writes our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cSenate Armed Services Chairman John McCain today vowed to write his own Afghanistan strategy, slamming the Trump administration for not producing one.  \u201cThe Arizona Republican said he would offer his own strategy as an amendment to annual defense policy legislation when the Senate takes up the bill in September ...  \u201c\u2018More than six months after President Trump's inauguration, there still is no strategy for success in Afghanistan,\u2019 McCain said in a statement. \u2018Eight years of a \u2018don\u2019t lose\u2019 strategy has cost us lives and treasure in Afghanistan. Our troops deserve better.\u2019\u201d  Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s plans for Afghanistan are missing as pressure builds in America\u2019s longest war, writes U.S. New & World Report.

Michele Rollins, a spokeswoman for Air Force Global Strike Command, said the test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California will ensure the nation\u2019s stockpile of ICBMs is reliable. While the test launch will be unarmed, ICBMs can deliver a number of different kinds of weapons, primarily nuclear. Four test launches are done each fiscal year. The most recent was on May 3.\u201d  Meanwhile, analysts doubt North Korea\u2019s ICBM re-entry capability, writes the AP.

The OCX program has reportedly racked up an additional $630 million in costs, while the FAB-T program is behind schedule by a year, the congressmen said in a statement.  \u201cOur adversaries have already reorganized their space programs and are reaping the benefits,\u201d the congressmen said. \u201cThose who continue to oppose reform need to explain to the warfighter, the American people, and their elected representatives how the status quo is acceptable.\u201d  Bloomberg first reported the OCX program\u2019s delays here.  MAKING MOVES \u2014 TRUMP TAPS TWO FOR PENTAGON AND VA POSTS: The president has picked John Henderson as assistant secretary of the Air Force for installations, the environment and energy. He had been commander of the Omaha district in the Army Corps of Engineers and has more than 23 years of experience as an Army engineer officer.

Story Continued Below  \u201cUnable to agree on a plan to send up to 3,900 more American forces to help turn back Taliban advances in Afghanistan, the White House is taking a new look at what would happen if the U.S. decided to scale back its military presence instead, according to current and former Trump administration officials.  \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a macro question as to whether the U.S., this administration, and this president are committed to staying,\u2019 one senior administration official said. \u2018It doesn\u2019t work unless we are there for a long time, and if we don\u2019t have the appetite to be there a long time, we should just leave. It\u2019s an unanswered question.\u2019\u201d  A car bomb targets the Iraqi Embassy in central Kabul on Monday, followed by gunfire, Afghan police report, via the Associated Press  REP. BARBARA LEE: AN ARMY OF ONE, writes POLITICO\u2019s Austin Wright: \u201cIt\u2019s a recent Wednesday afternoon, and Barbara Lee\u2019s communications director is trying to find her. She\u2019s scheduled to give a speech in nine minutes, and she hasn\u2019t read it yet.  \u201cThe anti-war congresswoman \u2014 from an ultra-liberal congressional district that includes Berkeley, California \u2014 has somehow managed to spark an uprising, joined by rank-and-file Republicans, against House Speaker Paul Ryan. Their demand: Repeal the 2001 war authorization against Al Qaeda and begin debating a new authorization better suited for the wars of today. This strange alliance is all the more remarkable because Lee, one of the leftmost denizens of Capitol Hill, was famously the only member of Congress to vote against the original authorization of force, a vote held just three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\u201d  COMING THIS WEEK \u2014 MATTIS AND TILLERSON BRIEF SENATE PANEL ON AUMF: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are slated to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday in a closed hearing on the administration\u2019s views on an AUMF.

James McCloughan "is credited with saving the lives of at least 10 men in his company, despite being wounded on three occasions.  \u201cPresident Donald Trump will award McCloughan, now 71, the Medal of Honor at the White House on Monday for \u2018conspicuous gallantry,\u2019 recognizing his \u2018distinguished actions\u2019 during the battle 48 years ago in which an estimated 2,000 enemy forces vastly outnumbered the Americans.\u201d  \u2014 BROOKINGS MULLS \u2018NATO AT A CROSSROADS:\u2019 The Brookings Institution hosts a discussion about \u201cNATO at a crossroads: Next steps for the trans-Atlantic alliance.\u201d  U.S. THAAD HITS TEST TARGET MISSILE, reports Reuters: \u201cThe United States said it shot down a medium-range target ballistic missile in its latest test of the country's THAAD missile defense program, which is designed to protect the country against potential threats from countries such as North Korea and Iran.  \u201cThe test, conducted over the Pacific Ocean, comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea, which on Saturday said it had conducted its own successful test of a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that proved it has the capacity to strike American's mainland. The latest U.S. test of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was planned well before North Korea's latest missile launch, but it comes at a time of rising tension with the country since Pyongyang launched its first-ever test of an ICBM on July 4.\u201d  And the Air Force flies B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula, the WSJ adds.  Meanwhile, the U.S. opens its new base in South Korea, moving its headquarters outside of North Korean artillery range, reports The Washington Post.  \u2014 NORTH KOREA TESTS MISSILE CAPABLE OF HITTING HOMELAND, reports our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cNorth Korea on Friday launched another ballistic missile that experts estimate had the reach to hit practically all of the major cities on the U.S. mainland.  \u201cPentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the Defense Department detected the intercontinental ballistic missile launch at 10:41 a.m. Washington time. Launched from Mupyong-ni, he said, the missile traveled about 1,000 kilometers, or more than 600 miles, before coming down in the Sea of Japan.  \u201cFollowing the launch, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford and U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris called the South Korean Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Lee Sun Jin to discuss \u2018military response options,\u2019 Dunford spokesman Capt. Greg Hicks said.\u201d  South Korea announces it will build more powerful missiles to counter the North, via The New York Times.

TRUMP INTENDS TO SIGN RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL, reports POLITICO\u2019s Madeline Conway: \u201cPresident Donald Trump intends to sign legislation that places new sanctions on Russia and empowers Congress to block him from scaling back the penalties on Moscow in the future, the White House press secretary's office said Friday.  \u201cWhite House officials had earlier left open the possibility Trump would veto the bill, though it was passed with veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate.\u201d  And Russian President Vladimir Putin orders U.S. diplomatic personnel cut by 755, escalating the sanctions fight, writes the NYT.  \u2014 U.S. ARMY EUROPE COMMANDER PUSHES A \u2018MILITARY SCHENGEN ZONE,\u2019 via Defense News: \u201cAs the U.S. Army Europe commander prepares to exit the military stage in September, he\u2019s pushing for better ways for militaries to move freely around the European theater. A military Schengen zone, he thinks, might be the best way to achieve that goal.  \u201cIn addition to improving the speed at which countries recognize an emerging crisis and make decisions on how to respond, the \u2018speed of assembly,\u2019 is also critical to get capability in place to prevent a crisis or react to a crisis, Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges said at the U.S. Army-led Saber Guardian exercise in Romania this month...  \u201c\u2018More than anything we need a military Schengen zone, something that would allow a military convoy to move across Europe as fast as a migrant is able to move across Europe,\u2019 Hodges said. \u2018Right now that is not the case.\u2019\u201d  \u2014 HOW ESTONIA BECAME A TOP U.S. DESTINATION, via our colleague Andrew Hanna: \u201cEstonia, a tiny Baltic nation dwarfed by neighboring Russia, isn\u2019t a premier American tourist destination. But when Vice President Mike Pence arrives there on Sunday he\u2019ll be just the latest in a parade of senior Washington officials to visit in recent months.  \u201cSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) led a congressional delegation to Estonia in December and so did Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) in June. America\u2019s top NATO general dropped by in March, followed soon after by House Speaker Paul Ryan in April. President Barack Obama himself gave a September 2014 address in the Estonian capital of Tallinn.  \u201cWhy all the fuss over a nation of just 1.3 million with a landmass roughly half the size of Maine?

RAND PAUL PRESSES PAUSE ON SENATE NDAA, reports our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cSen. Rand Paul blocked attempts to fast-track debate on the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act in an attempt to secure votes on amendments to bar indefinite detention and repeal the 2002 Iraq War authorization.  \u201cThe move early [Friday] morning drew an indirect rebuke from Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been diagnosed with cancer and sought quick floor consideration today before he begins treatment\u2026  \u201cIn the wake of the late [Friday-] night dust-up, it's unclear when \u2014 or if \u2014 the Senate will consider the NDAA any time soon. Both McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer support quick consideration of the defense bill to accommodate McCain's schedule.\u201d  The path forward on the must-pass NDAA is now up in the air as McCain begins radiation and chemotherapy today in Arizona. The Arizona Republican will maintain a work schedule during treatment and plans to return to Washington following the August recess, his office said.  TOP DOC \u2014 CBO SCORES MANDATORY COSTS OF SENATE NDAA, also via Connor: \u201cThe Senate Armed Services version of the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act ... would increase mandatory spending $621 million over the next decade, according to a CBO analysis. In a letter to Armed Services Chairman John McCain, CBO Director Keith Hall said a full cost estimate for the legislation would be released \u2018shortly.\u2019\u201d  TRUMP NAMES DHS SECRETARY JOHN KELLY NEW WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, write POLITICO\u2019s Bryan Bender, Ted Hesson and Stephanie Beasley: \u201cWhen President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in May, he was presented with a ceremonial sword \u2014 to which Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, standing nearby, quipped, \u2018Use that on the press, sir.\u2019  \u201cNo one thought the retired Marine general, known for a single-minded focus on getting results, was being serious. But the swipe at the news media on which the president so often trains his ire showed how much Kelly has become a kindred spirit to his boss, who announced Friday he was tapping the DHS secretary for White House chief of staff.\u201d  His first task? Stabilize the West Wing, our colleagues Andrew Restuccia, Bryan, and Josh Dawsey also write.  To help out, he\u2019ll bring his DHS chief of staff, Kirstjen Nielsen, with him to the White House, Andrew adds.  WAR REPORT \u2014 U.S. HELICOPTER FIRES WARNING SHOTS AT IRANIAN SHIPS, reports the WSJ: \u201cThe U.S. and Iran on Saturday reported their second confrontation this week in the waters off the Persian Gulf, as political tensions between the longtime rivals flare. The U.S. Navy said several vessels operated by Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the Gulf approached American ships at high speed on Friday.  \u201cAfter failing to contact the ships by radio, a Navy helicopter fired warning flares at a safe distance, according to the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. The Iranian ships subsequently stopped moving toward U.S. ships, it said, describing the interaction as \u2018safe and professional.\u2019\u201d  \u2014 RUSSIA SHOWCASES MILITARY MIGHT OFF THE SYRIAN COAST, writes the NYT: \u201cRussia\u2019s global military ambition was on display Sunday when the country celebrated Navy Day with large military parades not only in St. Petersburg, but also on the banks of Syria.  \u201cThe parades of ships, submarines and aircraft were held at Russian naval bases in Sevastopol, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, and at Tartus in Syria, where Russia is expanding its military presence. The main parade took place in St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s second-largest city and home of the navy\u2019s headquarters.\u201d  \u2014 IRAQI SECURITY FORCES REPORTEDLY FOIL ISIS ATTACK, reports the AP: \u201cIraqi intelligence officials said Sunday they foiled an attempt by the Islamic State group to attack revered Shiite shrines and the sect\u2019s spiritual leader. The IS plan was to launch a series of suicide attacks in Karbala and Najaf that house the shrines as well as the home of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, two officers told The Associated Press.\u201d  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 LOCKHEED BAGS $3.69 BILLION F-35 CONTRACT, reports Breaking Defense: \u201cAfter the markets closed on a sleepy and rainy summer Friday afternoon, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was ousted and DHS Secretary John Kelly named to take his place, and, oh, by the way, a $3.69 billion contract was awarded Lockheed Martin for 50 foreign F-35s and work on the Lot 11 LRIP. What\u2019s in play here?  \u201cMost of the money, $2.2 billion, goes to buy one British F-35B, one Italian F-35A, eight Australian F-35As, eight Dutch F-35As, four Turkish F-35As, six Norwegian F-35As aircraft, and 22 F-35As for Foreign Military Sales customers.\u201d  SPEED READ  \u2014 A foiled terrorist plot in Australia prompts heightened security measures: NYT  \u2014 McCain almost once left the GOP.

aV \u000a            By GREGORY HELLMAN  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With Eli Okun, Connor O\u2019Brien and Jacqueline Klimas  TOP NEWS \u2014 HOUSE APPROVES DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL, our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien reports: \u201cThe House passed annual defense spending legislation Thursday after disposing of dozens of amendments.  Story Continued Below  \u201cThe vote was 235-192. Only five Democrats supported the measure, and only five Republicans broke with their party to oppose it. The defense appropriations were included in a broader national security-themed funding package, which also includes annual Energy, Legislative Branch and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs spending measures.  \u201cThe House bill now goes to the Senate, which has not yet taken up a defense appropriations bill.\u201d  The spending package also contains funding for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Ferris adds.  NDAA ON HOLD IN THE SENATE AFTER HEALTH-CARE DEFEAT: Debate on the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act S. 1519 (115) is hold for now in the Senate, despite the efforts of Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) and leaders of both parties to consider it by the end of the week.  After the Senate narrowly defeated a so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare, with McCain casting the dramatic deciding "no" vote, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) moved to open debate on the defense policy bill beginning at 10 a.m. today. But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) objected.  Instead, the Senate recessed until Monday afternoon. There's no timeline for the NDAA. But McConnell said Thursday he'd move to consider it once the health-care debate ended and urged senators to accommodate McCain, who has been diagnosed with brain cancer, "and give him an opportunity to finish that bill while he is here."  Earlier, on the Senate floor, McCain pressed his colleagues to take "a few hours" out to debate the massive defense policy bill today. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) added Democrats wanted to "move expeditiously" on the bill and that SASC ranking Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island had been working with McCain on a slate of amendments.   More on McCain\u2019s effort here.  Amendments roll in: At Morning D's last count, 131 amendments have been filed to the Senate NDAA.

PENTAGON BRACES FOR WHITE HOUSE TRANSGENDER GUIDANCE, writes our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cThe Pentagon is bracing for White House guidance on enforcing President Donald Trump's decision to ban transgender people from the armed forces \u2014 orders that military and legal experts say could kick out thousands of troops who just a year ago were told they could serve openly.  \u201cThe White House indicated Thursday that the president intends to carry out the decision he announced in a series of tweets that, taken at face value, would mean drumming out all service members who identify as transgender.  \u201c\u2018The White House will work with the Department of Defense and all of the relevant parties to make sure that we fully implement this policy moving forward and do so in a lawful manner,\u2019 press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.  \u201c\u2018They are going to have to work out the details,\u2019 she added.\u201d  A candidate for a top Homeland Security post withdraws because of objections to Trump\u2019s decision to ban transgender people from the military, POLITICO\u2019s Andrew Restuccia and Kyle Cheney add.

BREAKING OVERNIGHT \u2014 COURT ORDERS REMOVAL OF PAKISTAN\u2019S PRIME MINISTER, reports The New York Times: \u201cPakistan\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday ordered the removal of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office over accusations of corruption, delivering a historic ruling that is likely to shift the country\u2019s tumultuous political balance and deal a serious blow to the legacy of a man who helped define the past generation of Pakistani politics.  \u201cThe removal of Mr. Sharif, who was serving his third term in office, comes roughly a year before his term was to end.  \u201cThe verdict means the governing political party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, must choose an interim prime minister to replace Mr. Sharif until the next general election, which is scheduled for mid-2018.\u201d  JAPAN\u2019S DEFENSE MINISTER RESIGNS, reports The Wall Street Journal: \u201cJapanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, a protg of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who was once seen as having a chance to become the nation\u2019s first female prime minister, announced her resignation Friday over a dispute involving peacekeeping operations in South Sudan.  \u201cThe issues surrounding Ms. Inada have contributed to a sharp fall in support for Mr. Abe\u2019s cabinet, which was above 50% earlier this year but has fallen below 30% in some recent polls.  "Mr. Abe said he took responsibility for naming Ms. Inada to the job a year ago. \u2018I would like to apologize for the way this has turned out,\u2019 he told reporters at his office.  \u201cOpposition lawmakers accused Ms. Inada of trying to cover up an internal document that suggested Japanese peacekeeping forces in South Sudan had engaged in combat, something that is barred under Japanese laws reflecting the nation\u2019s post-World War II pacifism. Ms. Inada denied any coverup but acknowledged on Friday that she had handled the matter poorly.\u201d  Meanwhile, the head of Japan\u2019s main opposition party quits for failing to boost its election prospects despite Abe\u2019s unpopularity, the WSJ adds.  HAPPENING TODAY \u2014 ROUND TWO ON INTEL AND VETS BILLS: The House votes for the second time this week on annual intelligence policy legislation and a patch to keep the emergency Veterans Choice Program funded for the next six months. Both bills failed on the House floor Monday after Democrats opposed Republican leaders bringing up the legislation under expedited procedures that shorten debate and don't allow amendments.  \u2014 JAPAN-U.S. MILITARY STATESMEN FORUM WRAPS UP: The Japan-U.S. Military Statesman Forum, the only non-governmental military-to-military dialogue, is set to wrap up today after a week of discussions.  \u2014 PACOM CHIEF: MARAWI \u2018A WAKE-UP CALL,\u2019 via your Morning D correspondent: U.S. Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris Thursday urged greater multilateral cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific to combat the spread of ISIS.  The Philippines is set to receive two Cessna aircraft purchased by the Pentagon and modified for surveillance to assist in the battle against ISIS, he noted.  \u201cMarawi should be a wake-up call and a rallying cry for every nation in the Indo-Asian Pacific region,\u201d Harris said at the Japan-U.S. Military Statesmen Forum. \u201cOnly through multilateral cooperation can we eradicate ISIS ... before they spread.\u201d  \u2018TIME IS RUNNING OUT\u2019 ON NORTH KOREA, MILLEY SAYS, via Reuters: \u201c U.S. General Mark Milley, the chief of staff of the Army, said on Thursday that North Korea's July 4 test of an intercontinental ballistic missile showed its capabilities were advancing significantly and faster than many had expected.  \u201cMilley, in remarks to the National Press Club in Washington, said there was still time for a non-military solution to the crisis caused by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but cautioned that \u2018time is running out.\u2019  \u201c\u2018North Korea is extremely dangerous and more dangerous as the weeks go by,\u2019 he said.  \u201cU.S. media reported this week that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon spy agency, had assessed that North Korea would be able to field a nuclear-capable ICBM by next year, earlier than previously thought.\u201d  WAR REPORT \u2014 RUSSIA SIGNS HALF-CENTURY SYRIA AIR BASE DEAL, reports Reuters: \u201cPresident Vladimir Putin has signed a law ratifying a deal with the Syrian government allowing Russia to keep its air base in Syria for almost half a century, official documents show.  \u201cThe original deal, signed in Damascus in January, sets out the terms under which Russia can use its Hmeymim air base in Latakia Province which it has used to carry out air strikes against forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad. Putin approved the agreement on Wednesday, after the two chambers of the Russian parliament backed it earlier this month, according to the government's official information portal.  \u201cThe document says Russian forces will be deployed at the Hmeymim base for 49 years with the option of extending that arrangement for 25-year periods.\u201d  Meanwhile, U.S. deconfliction with Russia is \u201cworking quite well,\u201d Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, said Thursday, via Greg.

McMaster\u2014 further shrinking the ranks of White House aides hired by McMaster\u2019s ousted predecessor, Michael Flynn.  \u201c\u2018McMaster wants his own guy,\u2019 said a senior White House aide. The White House did not immediately announce a replacement for the job of National Security Council senior director for the Middle East.\u201d  CONGRESS DARES TRUMP TO VETO RUSSIA SANCTIONS, writes POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cThe Senate on Thursday delivered Donald Trump the first big bipartisan rebuke of his presidency, giving final approval to a package of sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea that constrains his bid to defrost relations with Moscow.  \u201cThe Senate voted 98-2 to approve the sanctions bill that cleared the House earlier this week. Trump must now decide whether to sign a measure that allows Congress to block any attempt to ease or end penalties against Vladimir Putin's government and imposes new sanctions in response to a Russian electoral disruption campaign that the president continues to dispute.\u201d  On Friday, in response, Russia ordered a cut in the U.S. diplomatic force there and moved to close a U.S. recreation retreat on the outskirts of Moscow, The Associated Press reports.  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 RAYTHEON BOOSTS ANNUAL PROJECTIONS, reports Jacqueline: \u201cRaytheon announced [Thursday] a 4.2 percent increase in net sales during the second quarter of 2017, compared with the same period last year, leading the company to increase its full-year projections. The company reported $6.3 billion in net second-quarter sales, up from $6 billion in 2016.  \u201c\u2018Global customer demand for our advanced capabilities continues to drive growth, resulting in stronger than expected bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the quarter,\u2019 Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy said.  \u201cBecause of the performance so far this year, Raytheon increased its full-year net sales estimates by $200 million and its earnings for continuing operations by 10 cents per share.\u201d  TOP DOCS \u2013 STATE OFFERS PRIMERS ON ARMS SALES AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE: The State Department has released two fact sheets, one on U.S. arms sales and the defense trade, and a second on the role of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in U.S. security assistance.

Story Continued Below  RULES PANEL APPROVES 54 DEFENSE AMENDMENTS, reports our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien: \u201cThe House Rules Committee [Wednesday] approved 54 amendments to annual defense spending legislation, with House Republicans blocking most controversial proposals from floor debate. The panel approved the rule 7-4 along party lines.\u201d  Here\u2019s a rundown of what did \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 make the cut:  \u2014 CUTTING THE TOPLINE: The rule notably includes an amendment from Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) that would cut the defense funding topline by 1 per cent, excluding personnel accounts.  \u2014 GITMO: An amendment from Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) that would strike provisions that bar the transfer of detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the U.S. and construction of facilities in the U.S. to hold Gitmo prisoners was also made in order.  \u2014 VIRGINIA CLASS SUBS: A proposal from Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) to permit multi-year procurement of up to 13 Virginia class submarines, reflecting a provision in the House-passed defense policy bill, was included.  \u2014 SPACE-BASED MISSILE DEFENSE: An amendment was also included from Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) that would prohibit funding for testing and deployment of a space-based ballistic missile defense layer, which has been pushed by Republican defense hawks.  Some key amendments were also excluded, including cutting a $28.6 billion in broad "restoration" funds in the base and war budgets, targeting federal spending at Trump-owned properties and sunsetting the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.  The House also won't debate a proposal from Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) to block creation of a new Space Corps under the Air Force. HASC Strategic Forces Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), an architect of the Space Corps proposal, told Morning D that Perry elected to drop the amendment after the two lawmakers discussed the issue.   "Freight train's movin' baby!" Rogers said, leaving House votes Wednesday.  The panel also blocked proposals to bar funds for transition-related medical treatment for transgender troops as well as an amendment Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) to block President Donald Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military.  HOUSE BLOCKS BRAC, also via Connor: \u201cThe House [last night] quietly agreed to block a new round of military base realignments and closures for at least another year. Lawmakers adopted by voice vote an amendment from Reps. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) and Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) to prohibit funding for a new BRAC as part of a massive national security appropriations bill. The amendment was adopted for the annual military construction and veterans affairs funding measure included in the bill.\u201d  FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014 RULES PANEL TO TURN TO INTEL AUTHORIZATION: The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon to consider a rule on the fiscal 2018 Intelligence Authorization Act. The meeting follows House Democrats rejection of the bill Monday after Republican leaders attempted to bring it up on the House floor under suspension, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage.  RYAN PROMISES BUDGET VOTE IN SEPTEMBER, reports POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Ferris: \u201cThe House GOP budget resolution is finally headed to the floor \u2014 just not until September. Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker says he has struck a deal with House Speaker Paul Ryan to revive the fiscal blueprint, in exchange for dropping demands for a full GOP omnibus this week.\u201d  TOP DOC \u2014 CSBA: TRUMP DROPS BALL ON DEFENSE BUDGET REQUEST, via your Morning D correspondent: \u201cThe Trump administration made a \u2018strategic mistake\u2019 by not requesting more defense funding for its military buildup in its fiscal 2018 budget proposal, a new analysis says. The administration seeks to \u2018restore readiness\u2019 with its $667.6 billion request for discretionary defense spending in fiscal 2018, according to the analysis by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. And it's expected to start its buildup in its fiscal 2019 request, once it's completed key strategic reviews, the analysis adds.  "\u2019Forgoing a request for additional defense spending in its first budget, when a new administration has the greatest chance of making big course corrections, was a strategic mistake,\u2019 Katherine Blakeley, the analysis' author, concludes.\u201d  IT\u2019S THURSDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

Mark Milley speaks at a National Press Club luncheon, followed by a Q&A session.  \u2014 AND TRUMP COUNTER-ISIS ENVOY TALKS WITH MEI: Brett McGurk, the administration\u2019s envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, joins several leading think tanks analysts at the Middle East Institute for a discussion about the administration\u2019s counterterrorism policy.  TRUMP BANS TRANSGENDER TROOPS, reports Louis Nelson: \u201cPresident Donald Trump announced on Twitter on Wednesday that the U.S. military will not allow transgender individuals to serve \u2018in any capacity,\u2019 reversing an Obama-era policy while sparking bipartisan criticism from some of the nation's most prominent lawmakers on military issues.  \u201c\u2018After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,\u2019 Trump wrote online, breaking his message up into multiple posts. \u2018Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.\u2019 ...  \u201cA Trump administration official said that the president\u2019s decision to announce the military\u2019s transgender policy shift was at least in part motivated by conservatives who had opposed government spending legislation that might put money towards transgender health services.\u201d  Rachel Bade and Josh Dawsey take us inside the president\u2019s decision, including his attempts to mollify House Republicans threatening to blow up the \u201csecurity-bus\u201d spending bill over a ban on Pentagon-funded sex reassignment operations.  \u2014 BUT A TWEET IS NOT POLICY, YET, writes our colleague Jacqueline Klimas: \u201cTrump's surprise announcement that he wants to ban transgender troops will have little practical effect in the short term for those who are already serving, according to legal experts...  \u201cBut without a formal modification to military regulations \u2014 a process that could take months \u2014 the decision does not constitute a change in policy.  \u201c\u2018A statement by a president is not the same thing as formal rule-making process,\u2019 said Tobias Wolff, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \u2018None of the rules currently in place in the Department of Defense and the service branches have changed because of this statement.\u2019\u201d  The ban could turn into a legal landmine, John Culhane, co-director of the Family Health Law & Policy Institute at the Delaware Law School, writes for POLITICO Magazine.  And here\u2019s a primer on key issues surrounding the ban, via our colleagues Jacqueline, Matthew Nussbaum and Connor.  \u2014 SASC REPUBLICANS PUSH BACK: \u201cPresident Donald Trump's new plan to ban transgender people from the military is running into opposition from a key ally: Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst,\u201d writes POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett.  \u201cIn a statement, a spokeswoman for the veteran said Ernst has served with people \u2018from all different backgrounds\u2019 and that gender is not a vital indicator of someone's military prowess.\u201d  SASC Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) urges patience while the Pentagon completes its review of transgender troops in the military, writing in a statement that \u201cthe president\u2019s tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in the military is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter...There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train, and deploy to leave the military \u2014 regardless of their gender identity.\u201d  Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s decision is ammunition for gay rights activists who have long doubted the sincerity of his professed support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, adds POLITICO\u2019s Madeline Conway.  And tech industry leaders reject the ban: POLITICO Pro  GOP MOVES TOWARDS SANCTIONS BILL SOLUTION, writes POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cHouse and Senate Republicans clashed Wednesday over a bipartisan package of sanctions targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea before appearing to resolve a dispute that threatened to delay the bill's arrival on President Donald Trump's desk.  \u201cLess than 24 hours after the sanctions deal passed the House 419-3, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Wednesday morning that his chamber would likely cut out the measure\u2019s North Korea provisions \u2014 which were added to the mix in the last lap of talks on the legislation at the behest of House GOP leaders \u2014 and send it back across the Capitol. House Republican leaders countered by urging the Senate to act quickly on the bill and warning that any changes would postpone Trump's looming decision on a veto until September.\u201d  Iran says it will reciprocate any sanctions, further endangering the nuclear accord reached between the country and the U.S., via Reuters.  And Russia says so, too, Reuters adds.  WAR REPORT \u2014 TALIBAN ROUTS AFGHAN ARMY OUTPOST, reports The New York Times: \u201cIn a bloody overnight attack in Afghanistan\u2019s Kandahar Province on Wednesday, the Taliban routed an Afghan Army outpost, killing dozens of soldiers and raising fears of a concerted insurgent offensive in the province, a former seat of Taliban power that took years of effort by coalition and Afghan forces to secure.  \u201cThe attack happened in Khakrez District, about 30 miles from Kandahar city, and the large number of casualties has raised concerns about new Taliban tactics against an Afghan force already losing men in record numbers.  \u201cOne senior security official said 39 Afghan Army soldiers were killed in the attack, which began at 10 p.m. on Tuesday and lasted for three hours. The official said 17 other soldiers were wounded, and another dozen have not been accounted for.\u201d  Meanwhile, Afghan forces rescue two Pakistani diplomats abducted last month, reports the Associated Press.  \u2014 ADVOCATES PRESS U.S. TO MOVE NUKES FROM TURKEY, writes Stars and Stripes: \u201cThe U.S. should move its nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air Base and start looking for alternatives to the longtime military hub in Turkey, a country that can no longer be fully relied on, analysts and former military officials said.  \u201cThe U.S. military maintains about 50 nuclear warheads at Incirlik, according to nuclear watchdog organizations.  \u201c\u2018It is the worst place possible to be keeping nuclear weapons,\u2019 said Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a prominent nonprofit advocacy group.\u201d  \u2014 U.S.-BACKED FIGHTERS CONTROL NEARLY HALF OF RAQQA, reports the AP: \u201cA spokeswoman for a U.S.-backed Syrian opposition force and a monitoring group say opponents of the Islamic State group have captured nearly half of the extremists' de facto capital of Raqqa.  \u201cNisreen Abdullah of the Women's Protection Units, or YPJ, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the push into the northern Syrian city has slowed down because of massive amounts of explosives laid by IS fighters. She said fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition that includes the YPJ, now controls 45 percent of Raqqa.\u201d  Meanwhile, Syrian government forces capture Deir al-Zor, the last major town once-controlled by ISIS in Homs Province, reports Reuters.  And Hezbollah reaches a cease-fire with the Nusra Front at the Syrian-Lebanese border, Reuters adds.  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 BOEING AND GENERAL DYNAMICS REPORT REVENUE DIPS, BUT UPBEAT OUTLOOKS, via Jacqueline: \u201cBoeing announced [Wednesday] a more than $2 billion drop in revenues in the second quarter of 2017, compared with last year.

Story Continued Below  \u201cThe new assessment by the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which shaves a full two years off the consensus forecast for North Korea\u2019s ICBM program, was prompted by recent missile tests showing surprising technical advances by the country\u2019s weapons scientists, at a pace beyond which many analysts believed was possible for the isolated communist regime...  \u201cThe finding further increases the pressure on U.S. and Asian leaders to halt North Korea\u2019s progress before it can threaten the world with nuclear-tipped missiles. President Trump, during his visit to Poland earlier this month, vowed to confront Pyongyang \u201cvery strongly\u201d to stop its missile advances.\u201d  And House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) is \u201cincreasingly alarmed\u201d by North Korea\u2019s advancing capabilities, our colleague Jacqueline Klimas adds.  \u2014 INTERCEPTOR TEST ATTRIBUTED TO SAILOR ERROR, reports Defense News: \u201cA U.S. Missile Defense Agency review of a failed ballistic missile intercept test showed that a mistaken input into the combat system by a sailor on the destroyer John Paul Jones caused the missile to self-destruct before reaching the target.  \u201cA tactical datalink controller, in charge of maintaining encrypted data exchanges between ships and aircraft, accidentally identified the incoming ballistic missile target as a friendly in the system, causing the SM-3 missile to self-destruct in flight, according to a source familiar with the test.  \u201cThe head of MDA did not comment on the sailor error, but said in a statement that the ongoing review confirmed it wasn\u2019t an issue with the SM-3 Block IIA missile or the Navy\u2019s Aegis combat system.\u201d  MCCAIN RETURNS DRAMATICALLY TO THE SENATE, reports POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor: \u201cIt was quintessential John McCain: a dramatic return to the Senate to salvage the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal effort \u2014 followed by a speech blasting the process his party used to get there\u2026  \u201cMcCain said he plans to remain [here] in the Senate in order to manage floor consideration of the annual defense authorization bill, part of his duties as Armed Services chairman, before returning to Arizona for further treatment of his glioblastoma \u2014 the same type of tumor that killed his friend, the late Sen.

The talk comes as the service seeks to increase the range of its stand-off cruise missile in response to growing threats in Eastern Europe and the Western Pacific, writes Military Times.  \u2014 SENATE VA PANEL MARKS UP GI BILL: The Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee marks up a measure to expand education benefits offered under the GI bill. The full House passed a similar measure 405-0 on Monday.  HOUSE TEES UP FIRST BATCH OF 'SECURITY-BUS' AMENDMENTS: The House Rules Committee approved 72 amendments to a massive national security-themed spending bill, set to hit the House floor today. In all, amendments were made in order to three sections of the bill: the Legislative Branch, military construction-VA and energy funding measures. The Rules panel is expected to approve more amendments for the defense appropriations measure today.  For MilCon funding, an amendment from Rep.Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) would strike limits on constructing facilities in the U.S. to hold detainees from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Another proposal by Reps. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) and Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) would prohibit a new round of military base realignments and closures.   The full list of amendments set for floor votes is here.  And here are some key defense proposals we\u2019re keeping an eye on:  \u2014 KILLING SPACE CORPS: Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) has an amendment to bar funding for the Pentagon to establish a Space Corps, reviving a debate on the House-passed NDAA H.R. 2810 (115) on the creation of a new space service under the Air Force.  \u2014 SLASHING \u2018RESTORATION\u2019 FUNDS: Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) filed two amendments (here and here) to cut $28.6 billion allocated for a new National Defense Restoration Fund. The funding is spread out by major defense accounts and gives Defense Secretary Jim Mattis broad authority to spend the extra cash \u2014 subject to congressional approval \u2014 to implement a new national security strategy, but gives little additional guidance on how the money may be spent.  Fiscal watchdog groups have slammed the account as a slush fund. And eight fiscal groups, \u2014 including Taxpayers for Common Sense, Concerned Veterans for America and Tea Party Nation \u2014 wrote to lawmakers Tuesday, backing Ellison's amendments. In a letter, the groups called the special account "a further step down the path of fiscal irresponsibility."  TRUMP BACKS THE 'SECURITY-BUS,' via Connor: \u201cPresident Donald Trump would sign a massive national security-themed spending bill set for a House vote later this week, though the White House takes issue with a handful of military provisions.  \u201cThe White House laid out its position on the massive appropriations bill \u2014 which combines annual defense, energy, Legislative Branch and military construction and veterans funding measures \u2014 in a Statement of Administration Policy. Chief among the administration's complaints about the defense appropriation is a prohibition on a new round of military base realignments and closures.\u201d  HOUSE HANDCUFFS TRUMP WITH RUSSIA SANCTIONS, reports Elana: \u201cThe House on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved new sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea, with the GOP-controlled chamber advancing a significant new constraint on President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy.  \u201cThe sanctions legislation, which allows lawmakers to block Trump from any attempt to roll back sanctions against Moscow, is expected to pass the Senate in similarly bipartisan fashion before next month\u2019s recess.  \u201cThe White House has yet to say definitively whether Trump would sign the bill, which his administration had criticized for failing to give him necessary \u2018flexibility\u2019 to work on warmer relations with Russia. But it appears the votes would be there for Congress to override any veto from Trump.\u201d  But EU officials are still uneasy about the move, worried it might undermine the continent\u2019s energy independence, The New York Times writes.  WAR REPORT \u2014 TALIBAN WIELDS AMERICAN WEAPONS AGAINST U.S., reports the Military Times: \u201cWeaponry provided to the Afghan military over the last 16 years has slowly trickled down to the Taliban through corruption and battlefield losses. Armored vehicles, night vision devices, M-4s, laser illuminators and scoped optics have all found the way into Taliban hands over the years.  \u201cAnd at times the U.S. has been forced to combat its own armored vehicles and weapons.\u201d  \u2014 SIGAR PROBES AFGHANISTAN PROCUREMENT, writes your Morning D correspondent: \u201cThe Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction [Tuesday] called for a review of the procurement of all organizational equipment and clothing by the Combined Security Transition Command\u2013Afghanistan. John Sopko told the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations that his office will also undertake a criminal investigation related to uniform procurement for the Afghan National Army.\u201d  And Trump finds reason for the U.S. to stay in Afghanistan: minerals, adds the NYT.  \u2014 SYRIAN KURDS SEEK LONG-TERM U.S. SUPPORT, reports The Associated Press: \u201cThe Kurdish-led effort to secure Raqqa once it is liberated from the Islamic State group will require long-term U.S. political and financial support for the battered city\u2019s governance and reconstruction, a senior Syrian Kurdish official said Tuesday.  \u201cIn an interview with The Associated Press in the Kurdish-administered town of Kobani, Ilham Ahmed said the U.S. role in the fight against IS must not end with the liberation of the Raqqa but should continue as a guarantor of stability until a political future for the war-torn country is charted. Ahmed is the co-president of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political wing of the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led force currently fighting to liberate the Islamic State group\u2019s self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa from the militants.\u201d  Meanwhile, Assad hails Trump\u2019s decision to end covert CIA aid to Syrian rebels, via Reuters.  And an ex-Marine is killed battling ISIS after he secretly traveled to Syria to fight with a Kurdish militia group, the AP adds.  MATTIS ORDERS A MILITARY TRAINING REVIEW, via the Military Times: \u201cDefense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered a review of all the administrative and training requirements that prevent trigger pullers and pilots alike from focusing on warfighting.  \u201cIn the memo obtained by Military Times, Mattis on Friday directed the services, the National Guard Bureau and the combatant commanders to determine what changes are needed to give each branch increased flexibility to organize, train and equip more ready and lethal forces.\u201d  ANALYST URGES NAVY NOT TO REINVENT WHEEL FOR NEW FRIGATE, via Jacqueline: \u201cIntroducing a new class of frigate into the Navy will be \u2018critical\u2019 to achieving its 355-ship goal, an analyst told Congress today \u2014 and a "clean-sheet design" is not necessary.  \u201cJerry Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, told members of the Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee that the new frigate should be based on an existing design, like Fincantieri\u2019s FREMM frigate used by Italian and French navies or the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s national security cutter, built by Huntington Ingalls\u201d  CHINA FLEXES GLOBAL MUSCLES: \u201cRussian and Chinese naval warships are holding joint exercises in the Baltic Sea for the first time, underscoring deepening military cooperation between the two powers,\u201d Bloomberg reports.  \u201cChina\u2019s Hefei destroyer, Yuncheng frigate and Lomahu supply vessel are involved in drills with two Russian corvettes that include \u2018artillery fire at surface and air targets\u2019 in the Joint Sea-2017 maneuvers, Russia\u2019s Tass news service reported Tuesday. Helicopters and Su-24 bombers will also be involved in the \u2018anti-aircraft and anti-ship defense measures\u2019 coordinated from the Baltiysk base in Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave, it said.\u201d  Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping is holding up China as a confident global power that can increasingly count on swelling national pride, writes The Wall Street Journal.  And for China\u2019s global ambitions, Iran is at the center of everything, adds the NYT.  MAKING MOVES \u2014 FORMER WITTMAN AIDE MOVES TO THE PENTAGON: Rep.

Story Continued Below  \u201cEarlier Monday, McConnell also teed up the National Defense Authorization Act to come next on the Senate floor \u2014 a major priority for McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman.\u201d  McConnell offered a motion to proceed to the House-passed version of the defense policy bill. In previous years, the House NDAA has been used as a legislative vehicle, with the Senate version of the bill substituted as an amendment, our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien adds.  HOUSE PASSES GI EDUCATION EXPANSION, reports POLITICO Pro\u2019s Michael Stratford: \u201cThe House [Monday] overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation that would expand the education benefits offered to veterans under the GI Bill. Lawmakers voted 405-0 to pass legislation ... that would eliminate, for new enlistees, the current 15-year time limit veterans have to use their educational assistance under the GI Bill.\u201d  \u2014 BUT TURNS BACK INTEL AUTHORIZATION, FOR NOW, via Connor: \u201cHouse Democrats sank two key bills on the House floor Monday, embarrassing Republican leaders who were banking on the noncontroversial legislation sailing through \u2014 in a new sign of the opposition's party's frustration with the majority's approach.  \u201cKicking off a busy week in the House, most Democrats and a handful of Republicans joined forces to deny GOP leaders big-enough majorities to pass an annual intelligence policy bill and legislation to restore funding for a key veterans health care program.  \u201cBoth bills came to the House floor Monday under suspension of the rules, an expedited process that allows for less than an hour of debate and no amendments but also requires a two-thirds majority for passage ...  \u201cFirst, the House voted down the 2018 intelligence authorization bill, which sets policy for intelligence agencies and authorizes funding for classified programs.\u201d  \u2014 AND VA CHOICE FUNDING, Connor adds: \u201cNext, Democrats united to defeat a $2 billion bill to replenish for six months the emergency Veterans Choice Program, which subsidizes private medical care outside the Veterans Affairs Department for veterans facing lengthy wait times and is set to run dry in August.  \u201cDemocrats cited opposition from a large group of veterans organizations that called on Congress to reject the bill because it pays for the program through cuts in the VA.\u201d  HOUSE RULES MEETS FOR DAY TWO ON 'SECURITY-BUS:' The House Rules Committee meets for a second straight day to sift through the hundreds of amendments filed to the House GOP "security-bus," which includes the defense and military construction spending bills. The panel gaveled out after midnight last night without approving any amendments. So far, 325 have been filed.

The president\u2019s proposed budget, though, would slash military aid to Lebanon from $103 million to $19 million.  \u2014 AND KUSHNER MEETS WITH HOUSE INTEL PANEL, via POLITICO\u2019s Kyle Cheney: \u201cHouse intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes \u2014 who stepped aside from the House's Russia probe amid partisan infighting \u2014 is expected to attend Tuesday's highly anticipated closed door interview of Jared Kushner, according to a GOP source.\u201d  WAR REPORT \u2014 SYRIA STRATEGY HINGES ON COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA, writes The Washington Post: \u201cCooperation with Russia is becoming a central part of the Trump administration\u2019s counter-Islamic State strategy in Syria, with U.S. military planners counting on Moscow to try to prevent Syrian government forces and their allies on the ground from interfering in coalition-backed operations against the militants.  \u201cSyria\u2019s once-separate conflicts have moved into close proximity on the battlefield. Part of the plan essentially carves up Syria into no-go zones for each of the players \u2014 President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s fight, with Russian and Iranian help, against rebels seeking to overthrow him, and the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s war to destroy the Islamic State.\u201d  Meanwhile, Trump blasts The Washington Post\u2019s \u201cfabricated\u201d story about his decision to end a covert program aiding Syrian rebels fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad, The Washington Post adds.  \u2014 THE WHITE HOUSE WAR WITHIN, Susan Glasser writes for POLITICO Magazine: \u201cLast week, President Donald Trump\u2019s senior Cabinet officials and top national security advisers met for a contentious meeting to finally agree on a new strategy for America\u2019s longest war. After months of wrangling, they would ask Trump for a modest troop increase and a more intense commitment to the seemingly endless struggle in Afghanistan.  \u201cBut the session of the National Security Council Principals Committee, described by two sources briefed on it as a \u2018s*** show\u2019 that featured what a third source, a senior White House official, confirmed was a heated debate where \u2018words were exchanged,\u2019 proved no more successful than months\u2019 worth of previous Afghan policy debates.  \u201cTrump refused to sign off on the plan they approved, the sources said, instead sending it back to his national security team demanding more work.\u201d  Meanwhile, residents and analysts question if the government can protect Afghanistan's capital after the latest deadly bombing in Kabul, writes the Associated Press.  And Blackwater\u2019s founder defends his controversial proposal to expand contractors\u2019 role in the war in Afghanistan, via NPR.  \u2014 TALIBAN STRIKES IN PAKISTAN, reports the AP: \u201cA suicide bomber struck near a police team in the eastern city of Lahore Monday killing at least 26 and wounding another 54, many of them police officers. An outlawed Taliban faction claimed responsibility.  \u201cSenior police officer Haider Ashraf said a suicide bomber on a motorcycle targeted police guarding a demolition site at Kot Lakhpat's vegetable market on the outskirts of Lahore. Ashraf said it was believed earlier that the bomb was in a car, but it was later discovered that the vehicle belonged to a police officer, among the eight officers killed.\u201d  TOP DOCS \u2014 MATTIS CASTIGATES \u2018CAVALIER\u2019 AFGHAN UNIFORM BUYS, via your Morning D correspondent: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asked Pentagon officials to act upon a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan report that found the Defense Department spent $28 million on ineffective uniforms for the Afghan National Army. SIGAR found the department failed to perform due diligence in approving a \u2018forest\u2019 pattern uniform, despite the fact that forests only cover 2.1 percent of Afghanistan's land area.  \u201cBuying uniforms for our Afghan partners, and doing so in a way that may have wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars ... must not been seen as inconsequential in the grand scheme of the Department's responsibilities and budget,\u201d Mattis wrote in a letter to the chairs of the Pentagon\u2019s Afghanistan Resource Oversight Council, which is comprised of three under secretaries of defense. \u201cIn my view, the key finding of the SIGAR report is not just that it exposes waste...but rather it serves as an example of a complacent mode of thinking.\u201d  \u2014 AND MCCASKILL DEMANDS ANSWERS, also via Greg: \u201cA senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee is pressing the Pentagon on why it spent $28 million on ineffective uniforms for the Afghanistan National Army ...  \u201cSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) wrote [Monday] in a letter to Robert Karem, acting under secretary for policy, that she is concerned the uniform contract violated federal procurement law.\u201d  NATO WADES INTO TURKEY-GERMANY DISPUTE, via Reuters: \u201cNATO's secretary general is offering to broker a visit by German lawmakers to troops serving on a Turkish air base in an attempt to heal a rift between the two allies which is disrupting anti-Islamic State operations.  \u201cThe mediation offer by NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, announced on Monday, came as Ankara itself sought to limit the economic fallout from the damaging row with Berlin, dropping a request for Germany to help it investigate hundreds of German companies it said could have links to terrorism.\u201d  The dispute threatens to disrupt NATO\u2019s counterterrorism mission, The Wall Street Journal adds.  U.S. AND CHINESE PLANES NARROWLY AVOID COLLISION, writes the WSJ: \u201cA U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane was forced to take evasive action to avoid a possible mid-air collision after a Chinese jet fighter came within 300 feet of the American aircraft over the East China Sea, U.S. officials said Monday.  \u201cCapt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said a Chinese J-10 jet fighter rapidly approached under the U.S. EP-3 reconnaissance plane, slowed down and then flew in front of the American pilot, triggering the plane\u2019s collision alarm system and forcing it to take evasive action.  \u201cThe Chinese plane came within 300 feet of the U.S. plane, which was flying in international airspace, according to another defense official.\u201d  The near miss comes as a Chinese intelligence-gathering ship is spotted near a U.S.-Australian military exercise, reports Defense News.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault.  Story Continued Below  \u201cThe attack took place in a western Kabul neighborhood where several prominent politicians reside and at rush hour, as residents were heading to work and students were on their way to a nearby private high school, said Basir Mujahed, the spokesman.  \u201c\u2018The bomber attacked at one of the busiest times of the day,\u2019 the spokesman said. \u2018There were traffic jams with people going to work and to the university and schools. Many of the shops had just opened.\u2019\u201d  And the Taliban advances, taking over two more districts in Afghanistan, adds Stars and Stripes.  \u2014 AFGHANISTAN AUTHORITY IS TACTICAL, NOT STRATEGIC, MATTIS SAYS, via Military Times: \u201cSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis clarified on Friday that while the Defense Department now has authority to set troop numbers for Afghanistan, President Donald Trump is still setting the strategy that will drive those numbers.   \u201c\u2018What he delegated was a tactical decision about what forces to send,\u2019 Mattis said of Trump. \u2018He delegated not one bit of the strategy by the way. Not one bit. That is his and his alone.\u2019\u201d  Meanwhile, a U.S. airstrike in Helmand province kills several Afghan security forces, The New York Times reports.  KUSHNER DEFENDS HIS RUSSIA CONTACTS: \u2018I DID NOT COLLUDE,\u2019 reports POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni: \u201cIn his first public defense of his meetings with Russian officials during Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and transition, Jared Kushner is presenting his encounters with those operatives as innocent interactions, according to testimony submitted ahead of a high-stakes, closed-door grilling session before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.   \u201cIn an 11-page opening statement provided to reporters in advance of his 10 a.m. appointment with the panel, which is part of the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign, Kushner \u2014 now a senior 7/24/2017 Kushner defends his Russia contacts: 'I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government.\u2019\u201d  The full text of Kushner\u2019s prepared statement is here.  IT\u2019S MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we're always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback. Email us at ghellman@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @greg_hellman, @morningdefense and @politicopro.  MORNING DEFENSE TRIVIA: Richard Streeter was the first to correctly recount that in World War II both the USS Tang and USS Tullibee were both sunk by their own torpedoes circling back on them.  Tune in Friday for this week\u2019s question.  DRIVING THE WEEK \u2014 HOUSE TAKES UP NATIONAL SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS PACKAGE: The House Rules Committee opens debate tonight on amendments to the \u201csecurity-bus\u201d package that combines four fiscal 2018 spending bills, including the Defense and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs measures. Last month, the House Appropriations Committee approved a $658.1 billion defense bill. Debate on the House floor will begin later this week. Here\u2019s a rundown of key amendments House Rules will consider for floor debate, including some that mirror those offered to the fiscal 2018 National Defense Authorization Act:  \u2014 PROHIBITING BRAC: Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) has offered an amendment that would prohibit the Defense Department from undertaking a new round of military base realignments and closures. The measure is in line with a provisions of the NDAA that would also prohibit a new BRAC.  \u2014 BORDER WALL: Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) has revived his amendment to reinstate a ban on funding President Donald Trump\u2019s promised border wall. The House Armed Services Committee adopted a ban in June in its NDAA markup, but in a procedural move the House Rules Committee stripped the provision without debate.  \u2014 GITMO: Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) has offered a proposal to strike a provision prohibiting DoD from building facilities in the U.S. to house detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a second to prohibit their transfer to such prisons.  \u2014 PAKISTAN: Reps. Dave Trott (R-Mich.) and Ted Poe (R-Texas) each have amendments related to security aid to Pakistan. Trott\u2019s amendment would transfer $900 million for Pakistan to the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid account. And Poe\u2019s amendment would prohibit the department from using operations and maintenance funding in the country.  The amendments come following a Pentagon decision to withhold $50 million in \u201ccoalition support funds\u201d from Pakistan, potentially signaling a more hard-line approach by the Trump administration toward Islamabad, writes The Washington Post.  FURTHER READING: The House defense spending bill includes $28.6 billion in broad pots of money, known collectively as the National Defense Restoration Fund. Here's an earlier Pro Defense analysis on how appropriators use the unspecified funds to boost Pentagon spending and how that extra cash could be cut with a lower defense topline.  CONGRESS APPROACHES A DEFENSE BUDGET \u2018TRAIN WRECK,\u2019 our colleague Connor O\u2019Brien with a deep dive on the budget debate: \u201cCongressional defense hawks' efforts to boost military spending by tens of billions face a major problem: They run afoul of the law.  \u201cKey bills winding their way through the House and Senate would boost the Pentagon budget well beyond what they've been in recent years. They would even exceed proposals from President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to rebuild the armed forces.  \u201cBut the bills would exceed the limits imposed by a 2011 budget law that caps spending and mandated across-the-board cuts \u2014 known as sequestration \u2014 at the behest of fiscally conservative budget hawks seeking to rein in massive budget deficits.\u201d  ALSO THIS WEEK \u2014 SERVICE CHIEFS TALK SHOP: Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein takes part in an Air Force Association breakfast on Wednesday. And on Thursday, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley speaks a National Press Club luncheon.  \u2014 HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TALKS AUMF: The House Foreign Affairs Committee holds a hearing on Tuesday featuring former government and military officials to discuss a new Authorization for Use of Military Force against terrorism.  \u2014 SASC MULLS OPTIONS FOR 355-SHIP NAVY: The Senate Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee hears on Tuesday from top naval analysts on options for building a 355-ship Navy.  \u2014 SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS EYES MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds a hearing on Tuesday to assess the maximum pressure and engagement policy for North Korea, featuring Acting Assistant Secretary of State of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton.  And Americans should be prepared for the possibility of a military confrontation with North Korea, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford suggests at a forum hosted by the Aspen Institute on Saturday, POLITICO\u2019s Nahal Toosi adds.  Meanwhile, the U.S.\u2019 next missile intercept test could come as soon as next weekend, the Coast Guard says, via the AP.  HAPPENING TODAY \u2014 HOUSE TAKES UP INTEL BILL, BUT DEMS COULD SINK IT: The House is set to vote today on annual intelligence policy legislation, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is urging her fellow Democrats to kill the legislation.   In a letter to Democrats Sunday, Pelosi said the bill itself isn't problematic, but blasted Republicans for bringing the legislation to the floor under suspension of the rules, an expedited process without amendments that requires a two-thirds majority. Pelosi asked Democrats to defeat the bill "so that we can take it up under a rule" and amendments can be offered.  \u2014 KUSHNER FACES CONGRESS, via The Washington Post: \u201c[Jared] Kushner is scheduled to meet behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee [today], then be questioned \u2014 again in private \u2014 by the House Intelligence Committee the following day.\u201d  SENATE PANEL MARKS UP GI BILL EXPANSION WEDNESDAY, reports our colleague Michael Stratford: \u201cThe Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee will hold a vote [this] week on the bipartisan legislation to expand educational benefits under the GI Bill, according to Chairman Johnny Isakson\u2019s office.  "The committee will mark up the bill ... July 26 without making any amendments, Isakson spokeswoman Amanda Maddox said. The legislation is identical to the bill approved [last] week by the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\u201d  2016 PRIMARY RIVAL URGES MCCAIN TO STEP ASIDE, via The Washington Post: \u201cA day after news came out about Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) brain cancer diagnosis, his onetime political opponent urged the ailing senator to think about his political future sooner rather than later \u2014 and expressed interest in the possibility of her taking over his Senate seat.  \u201c\u2018I hope Sen. McCain is going to look long and hard at this, that his family and his advisers are going to look at this, and they\u2019re going to advise him to step away as quickly as possible, so that the business of the country and the business of Arizona being represented at the federal level can move forward,\u2019 Kelli Ward, who lost to McCain in last year\u2019s Republican primary and is now running to unseat U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), said Thursday during an interview with an Indiana radio station.\u201d  CONGRESS REACHES RUSSIA SANCTIONS DEAL, report POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor and Heather Caygle: \u201cNegotiators in both parties on Saturday released a sweeping sanctions deal that does not include changes President Donald Trump's administration sought to make it easier for him to ease penalties against Russia.  \u201cThe accord on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea is set for a House vote on Tuesday, according to the announcement from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office. To resolve a partisan clash over giving House Democrats the power to force a vote blocking Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow, the deal expedites House consideration of any anti-Trump vote that the Senate has already passed.\u201d  But the European Commission plans to hit back \u201cwithin days\u201d at the United States if possible new sanctions leave European energy and other companies vulnerable to U.S. interference, adds POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Heath.  WAR REPORT \u2014 U.S. SOUGHT YPG REBRAND, SOCOM COMMANDER SAYS, via your Morning D correspondent. The United States urged the Syrian Kurds\u2019 YPG, to rebrand themselves because of alleged links to the PKK, a designating terrorist group operating inside Turkey, Gen. Raymond Thomas, the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, said at the Aspen Security Forum Friday.  The YPG currently fights under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces.  \u201cThey were formerly called the YPG, who the Turks would say equated to the PKK, you\u2019re dealing with a terrorist enemy of mine,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe literally replied back to them and said you got to change your brand,\u201d he added.  And Assad-aligned forces recapture territory outside Raqqa from ISIS, reports Reuters.  THE U.S. MILITARY IS \u2018BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER,' the president says at the commissioning of the USS Gerald R. Ford, via CBS News: \u201cPresident Trump officially commissioned the U.S. Navy's newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday, applauding the military's strength.  "\u2019When it comes to battle, we don't want a fair fight. We demand victory, and we will have total victory, believe me,\u2019 Mr. Trump said of the powerful aircraft carrier \u2026  While Mr. Trump urged military members to call their members of Congress and ask them to support his budget, he noted the ongoing health care debate as well, telling service members, \u2018you can also call those senators to make sure you get health care.\u2019\u201d  Afterward, HASC ranking Democrat Adam Smith of Washington state blistered the president for politicizing the military.  \u201cI condemn President Trump\u2019s remarks. We need to be one-hundred percent clear that it is utterly beyond the pale for the commander-in-chief to publicly tell members of the armed services that they should lobby Congress on his behalf,\u201d Smith said in a written statement. \u201cDoing so, puts them in an untenable position and disrespects their longstanding professional practices as well as their duty to remain apolitical. President Trump has done this before, and he cannot be allowed to keep doing it.\u201d  Meanwhile, major questions remain about the Navy\u2019s newest aircraft carrier, CNBC adds.  INDUSTRY INTEL \u2014 TINY SATELLITES LAUNCH SPACE REVOLUTION, writes Bloomberg Businessweek: \u201cA good rocket launch site has a few important characteristics. An unpopulated patch of land near an ocean is preferable, so no one gets showered with wayward bits of flaming metal. It\u2019s also nice if it\u2019s on the equator\u2014like all spheres rotating on an axis, the Earth spins fastest in the middle, which provides rocket boosters with extra oomph. In other words, the best sites tend to be in remote, tropical locations. That such places are also often among the world\u2019s poorest gives many launches a counterintuitive feel: billions of dollars in futuristic machinery rising up over rainforests and shantytowns.\u201d  \u2014 TRUMP ISSUES INDUSTRIAL BASE ORDER, reports Greg: \u201cPresident Donald Trump today issued an executive order directing a "whole of government" review of the defense industrial base.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  08/04/2017 02:49 PM EDT  With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  CHAMBER HILL CO-FOUNDER LAUNCHES NEW FIRM: Michaela Sims, a co-founder of Chamber Hill Strategies, has left to launch her own firm, Sims Strategies. Sims decided to strike out on her own after a conflict of interest between two clients at Chamber Hill that couldn\u2019t be resolved, she said in an interview. \u201cIt just made sense to split off,\u201d she said. Sims is also a veteran of the Bockorny Group and before that worked for former Sens. Ben Nelson and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska Democrats. Ted Prettyman is also leaving Chamber Hill to join the firm as a director.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Sims is bringing five Chamber Hill clients with her, most of them in the health care sector: the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, the National Association for the Support of Long Term Care, WellCare and GlaxoSmithKline. The firm plans to focus on health and tax clients at the outset. (She\u2019s lobbying for the American Academy of Adoption Attorney on preserving the adoption tax credit, among other issues.) \u201cI would say our sweet spot is issues that will go through the [Senate] Finance Committee\u201d and the House Ways and Means Committee, Sims said. She\u2019s undaunted by the prospect of launching a Democratic firm \u2014 Prettyman previously worked for Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) \u2014 in Trump\u2019s Washington. \u201cThe party that\u2019s not in power is always going to be relevant \u2014 particularly in the Senate,\u201d Sims said. \u201cI would be saying the same if it was a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic-controlled Congress.\u201d  UKRAINIAN TYCOONS HIRES A SECOND LOBBYING FIRM: Igor Kolomoisky, a Ukrainian tycoon who once called Russian President Vladimir Putin a "schizophrenic of short stature," has hired a second Washington lobbying firm \u2014 and a second former member of Congress \u2014 to lobby for him. Kolomoisky has signed former Rep. John Sweeney (R-N.Y.) of SMW Partners through a law firm representing him to lobby on \u201cBusiness issues related to investments in the U.S.,\u201d according to a disclosure filing. Sweeney, who worked on Trump\u2019s transition interviewing hundreds of potential administration hires, did not respond to a request for comment.  \u2014 It\u2019s not clear what those \u201cbusiness issues\u201d might be, but earlier filings provide a clue. Kolomoisky hired former Rep. Phil English (R-Pa.) of Arent Fox in January. English and another Arent Fox lobbyist, Alex Manning, have been lobbying for the issuance (presumably to Kolomoisky) of an E-2 visa, which allows foreigners to come to the United States temporarily if they invest in an American business. English declined to comment.  \u2014 Kolomoisky, it\u2019s safe to say, is more colorful than most lobbying clients. According to The Wall Street Journal, he spent millions of his own money to help arm Ukrainian forces fighting Russian-backed separatists while serving as governor of Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region and \u201chas a massive shark tank in his office.\u201d During a local TV appearance, Kolomoisky described Putin as a "schizophrenic of short stature" and "completely incapable, totally insane." \u201cMr. Putin, who stands 5 feet 7 inches, shot back, calling Mr. Kolomoisky a \u2018unique impostor\u2019 and expressing amazement that \u2018such a scoundrel could be appointed governor,\u2019\u201d the Journal reported in 2014.

REPUBLICANS MAY TARGET MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION: \u201cA tax break popular with homeowners and the real estate industry could take a hit as Republicans look for ways to pay for their tax reform plan,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm reports. \u201cDespite promises from the Trump administration in April that it would \u2018protect the homeownership \u2026 deductions,\u2019 multiple sources tracking tax reform said that the cap on the mortgage interest deduction \u2014 currently set at the interest on up to $1 million of mortgage debt \u2014 could be lowered in tax reform.\u201d The National Association of Realtors \u2014 one of the biggest lobbying spenders in Washington \u2014 and the rest of the real estate industry have been working furiously to protect the tax break. Full story.  RAYTHEON ADDS ANOTHER: Raytheon has added another lobbying firm to its arsenal, signing Ethan Cooper of HAKA to lobby on \u201cDefense of Hawaii \u2013 Missile Defense,\u201d per a disclosure filing. It\u2019s HAKA\u2019s first federal lobbying registration. Cooper previously spent eight years as a legal counsel on the Hill, where he specialized in nuclear nonproliferation work, according to HAKA\u2019s website. He did not respond to a request for comment. Raytheon\u2019s other lobbying firms include American Continental Group; American Defense International; BGR Government Affairs; C. Baker Consulting; Capitol Tax Partners; DLA Piper; Etherton and Associates; Holland & Knight; Innovative Federal Strategies; O\u2019Brien, Gentry & Scott; and the Vectre Corporation.   SOFT MONEY STRIKES BACK: The Center for Public Integrity\u2019s Carrie Levine takes a look at the return of \u201csoft money\u201d through joint fundraising committees. When Hillary Clinton\u2019s main joint fundraising committee, for instance, \u201creceived a contribution, it divvied the money up among Clinton\u2019s campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee and a gaggle of state-level Democratic party committees. State Democratic parties then often shifted the money they received from Clinton\u2019s joint fundraising committee right to the Democratic National Committee, allowing the national committee to pocket significantly more cash than federal contribution limits would appear to allow.  \u2014 \u201cRepublicans did the same, an even higher percentage of the time: Republican state parties shifted more than 90 percent of the dollars they received from the Trump Victory committee to the Republican National Committee.\u201d Full story.  BULGARIAN LOBBYING FOR MAGNITSKY ACTION: \u201cA Bulgarian ex-banker is pushing to be the first case considered under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law passed by Congress that allows the government to levy sanctions in retaliation for human rights abuses and corruption,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Megan Wilson reports. \u201cTsvetan Vassilev, once named the most influential man in Bulgaria by Forbes, claims his country is persecuting him with false and politicized charges. He recently hired the Washington firm JWI Inc, signing a $50,000 six-month contract, to help process an application to be considered under the Global Magnitsky Act. That law allows the U.S. government to place targeted sanctions on anyone who, among other things, retaliates against whistleblowers exposing government corruption.\u201d Full story.  HOW TRUMP\u2019S FCC AIDED SINCLAIR\u2019S EXPANSION: \u201cSinclair Broadcast Group is expanding its conservative-leaning television empire into nearly three-quarters of American households \u2014 but its aggressive takeover of the airwaves wouldn\u2019t have been possible without help from President Donald Trump's chief at the Federal Communications Commission,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Margaret Harding McGill and John Hendel report. \u201cSinclair, already the nation\u2019s largest TV broadcaster, plans to buy 42 stations from Tribune Media in cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, on top of the more than 170 stations it already owns. It got a critical assist this spring from Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who revived a decades-old regulatory loophole that will keep Sinclair from vastly exceeding federal limits on media ownership.\u201d  \u2014 Sinclair has succeeded without spending a fortune on lobbying \u2014 and the company \u201cisn't showing signs of massively boosting its bare-bones lobbying operation in Washington, though it's increasing its investment. The company spent roughly $60,000 on lobbying in the first half of this year, nearly the amount it spent in all of 2016, and recently brought back a second, in-house lobbyist who previously lobbied for the broadcaster.\u201d Full story.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  08/03/2017 02:00 PM EDT  With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  SAUDI LOBBYING CONTRACT ENDED THE DAY CROWN PRINCE WAS DEPOSED: When the Saudi Ministry of the Interior signed a $5.4 million lobbying contract in May with SPG, a Washington lobbying firm, it was viewed as the latest move in a power struggle between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who controlled the ministry, and King Salman\u2019s son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. New documents filed with DOJ confirm that view. SPG\u2019s contract with the Saudi Interior Ministry ended on June 21, the same day Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted and just 38 days after it was signed, the filing shows. Because SPG\u2019s contract stipulated that the ministry pay the $5.4 million fee upfront, though, the firm gets to keep the money.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 \u201cSPG was excited about working with the Saudi Interior Ministry to help combat violent extremism,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cDue to internal circumstances in the Kingdom our contract was truncated and SPG was unable to implement our unique strategic services \u2014 including our creative SPG Studios communications, branding, marketing and public relations offerings \u2014 on their behalf. We look forward to again working with our vital ally Saudi Arabia and bringing our global reach to the fold as we do for all our clients."  PODESTA GROUP NO LONGER LOBBYING FOR IRAQ: The Podesta Group is no longer representing Iraq in Washington, according to a DOJ filing. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Al-Monitor, a Washington-based news outlet that covers the Middle East, that budget cuts had forced Iraq to scrap its contract with the Podesta Group as well as Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. With \u201cthe glut in the oil crisis [and] the cost of war [against the Islamic State] the government took measures to reduce financing for certain activities for Iraqi ministries in general and that directly affected us," the official told Al-Monitor. "So we had to cut the spending for the lobbying efforts for the time being.\u201d Neither firm immediately responded to a request for comment.  BOCKORNY GROUP SIGNS TARGET: Target has hired the Bockorny Group to lobby on tax and labor issues. The hire appears to be part of a broader shakeup of Target\u2019s lobbying team. Target had previously retained Jochum Shore & Trossevin and Ogilvy Government Relations, according to disclosure records. But Target parted ways with Jochum Shore earlier this year and with Ogilvy at the end of June. The Minneapolis-based retailer spent $210,000 on Washington lobbying in the second quarter.

ADMINISTRATION WON\u2019T MAKE RULE CHANGE THAT ICAHN WANTED: \u201cThe Trump administration plans to reject a proposal that would let oil refiners off the hook for complying with the federal ethanol mandate, a senior administration official told POLITICO, dashing the hopes of billionaire Carl Icahn and a slew of independent companies,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Eric Wolff reports. It\u2019s \u201ca severe blow for Icahn, a longtime associate and early supporter of Donald Trump who owns the refiner CVR Energy. He was once so confident that the obligation would be changed that he tried to strike a deal with a biofuels trade association.\u201d Full story.   GOLDMAN LOBBIES UP IN FLORIDA: \u201cGoldman Sachs is expanding its political footprint in Florida as its investment ties to Venezuela \u2014 and the broader business community\u2019s connections to the troubled Latin American nation \u2014 draw increasing scrutiny from state lawmakers,\u201d POLITICO Florida\u2019s Matt Dixon reports. \u201cThe firm has hired its first Florida contract lobbying firm and registered in-house lobbyists to advocate with the Scott administration and state Senate. And it\u2019s already met with Gov. Rick Scott to discuss brewing efforts to ban Florida business with the country.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cThe advocacy ramp-up comes as Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro \u2014 who has suppressed pro-democracy rallies and last weekend won an election White House officials called a 'sham' \u2014 faces increased pressure from Scott and others. Goldman purchased $2.8 billion in bonds issued by Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in May, a move that received vocal criticism from both state and federal lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. But it was a July 5 announcement from Scott\u2019s office that the governor was mulling a plan to 'prohibit the state of Florida from doing business' with businesses that benefit the Maduro regime that caught Goldman\u2019s attention.\u201d Full story.  RUSSELL GROUP SIGNS ABBOTT: Abbott Laboratories has added the Russell Group to its stable of Washington lobbyists. Abbott, which spent $860,000 on Washington lobbying in the second quarter, also retains BGR Government Affairs, Chamber Hill Strategies, Forbes Tate, Mayer Brown, OFW Law, Polaris Government Relations, Thorn Run Partners and W Strategies.  ZUCKERBERG HIRES BENENSON: \u201cFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama and the chief strategist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the hire,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni reports. \u201cBenenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy. \u2026 Benenson\u2019s involvement in the group gives them access to someone who was one of the top lieutenants of Clinton\u2019s doomed campaign and Obama\u2019s longtime pollster, just as speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions is mounting.\u201d Full story.  DON\u2019T \u2018PARROT COMMANDS OF SPECIAL INTERESTS,\u2019 BERNHARDT WARNS: \u201cInterior Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a former [Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck] lobbyist, believes a few bad apples within the department have \u2018forgotten their oath\u2019 and \u2018choose to parrot comments of special interests rather than carry out their governmental duties to move the country forward,\u2019 he told employees in an introductory email sent after he was sworn in Tuesday,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Esther Whieldon reports. \u201c\u2018By doing so, they often avoid grounding their views in the actual facts or the law. Such conduct is arbitrary. It is lazy. We must always refrain from taking such a path,\u2019 Bernhardt wrote in the email,\u201d obtained by POLITICO. Full story.  BIODIESEL TRADE GROUP LOSES TWO: \u201cThe National Biodiesel Board, which is based in Missouri, is losing two of its three Washington staffers,\u201d per Morning Energy. \u201cAnne Steckel, the head of the D.C. office, and Sandra Franco, the head of regulatory affairs and general counsel, are both leaving the group, NBB spokesperson Rosemarie Calabro Tully told ME. Chief Operating Officer Doug Whitehead will come to D.C. to run the office. The move comes at an awkward time, as lobbying is ramping up to get a biodiesel producers tax credit into any future tax overhaul bill, the group's members want EPA to increase the biodiesel requirements in the Renewable Fuel Standard, and they're looking to the Commerce Department to slap sanctions on Argentina and Indonesia.\u201d Steckel was the group\u2019s only registered lobbyist, according to disclosure reports.  JOBS REPORT  \u2014 The Clyde Group has promoted Aubrey Quinn to senior vice president. The firm has also hired Sasha Bennett as a senior associate and Daniel Cummins as a junior associate. Bennett previously worked for Edelman and Cummins previously worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.  \u2014 LEVICK has promoted Jennifer Tong to vice president from director.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  08/02/2017 02:30 PM EDT  With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  CHAMBER HILL ADDS WEINSTEIN: Anna Weinstein has left the Podesta Group for Chamber Hill Strategies, where she\u2019ll be a principal. Her clients at Podesta included the American Health Care Association, BMO Financial and Mylan, the pharmaceutical company, as a subcontractor to Hogan Lovells. Before joining Podesta, she worked as a lobbyist for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization.  Story Continued Below  NEW AD ATTACKS CORDRAY: A secretive group called Protect America\u2019s Consumers dedicated to opposing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is out with a new ad attacking Richard Cordray, the agency\u2019s director. The ad, posted on the group\u2019s YouTube page on Tuesday, says that Cordray is rumored to be running for Ohio governor next year, citing a POLITICO story. The ad\u2019s narrator accuses Cordray of using \u201chis power at the CFPB to issue a new regulation that will massively benefit potential donors: the trial lawyers.\u201d The ad directs viewers to cordray2018.com, a fake campaign site set up by the group. The group, which ran a similar ad last year, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on where and when the ad will be running. (The ad was spotted by Allied Progress, a liberal research group.)  \u2014 PI\u2019s Isaac Arnsdorf dug into who was behind the group last year when it first emerged. Here\u2019s what he found: \u201cThe campaign is being run by Lincoln Strategy Group, a political consulting firm in Tempe, Ariz. Its founder, Nathan Sproul, has been linked to several instances of suspected voter fraud and barred from Republican Party contracts. The company also worked with Steve Gates, the only person previously identified with Protect America's Consumers, on the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity's 2009 \u2018astroturf\u2019 campaign, when it was busted for sending fake letters to Congress.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cAt a field hearing on the CFPB's arbitration rule earlier this month in Albuquerque, N.M., a man who identified himself as Chuck Bowman rose to challenge the agency's director, Richard Cordray, on whether the policy would enrich trial lawyers and if he'll renounce support from trial lawyers in a future run for governor or attorney general. The moderator cut him off because the comment forum was not a Q&A. The outburst echoed Protect America's Consumers' talking points, replete with a website posing as Cordray running for office in Ohio. \u2026 \u2018Chuck Bowman\u2019 is most likely Chuck Coolidge, a partner at Lincoln Strategy Group, based on their likenesses.\u201d  MONUMENT SIGNS FRANCHISE ASSOCIATION: The International Franchise Association has added Monument Policy Group to its clutch of Washington lobbying firms. John Mulligan, T.A. Hawks and Ashley Hoy of Monument will lobby for the association, according to a disclosure filing. The association \u2014 which spent a relatively modest $110,000 on lobbying in the second quarter \u2014 also retains Geoffrey P. Gray, Mercury and Prime Policy Group.  Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips: tmeyer@politico.com. Twitter: @theodoricmeyer.  COREY\u2019S NEW GIG: Corey Lewandowski has a new firm, The New York Times\u2019 Nicholas Confessore and Kenneth P. Vogel report. \u201cMr. Lewandowski started his new business, Lewandowski Strategic Advisors, in May, according to corporate documents filed in Delaware, eight days after he announced he would part ways with the Washington lobbying firm he helped found, Avenue Strategies. Mr. Lewandowski has recently discussed expanding the new firm by adding, among others, two more Trump insiders \u2014 the former Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie and George Gigicos, who stepped down Monday as Mr. Trump\u2019s White House advance director \u2014 according to two associates.  \u2014 \u201cAmong the first new clients of Lewandowski Strategic Advisors is an Ohio-based company called Community Choice Financial. The company is a leader in the payday lending industry, which has faced heightened federal scrutiny in recent years.\u201d Full story.  TRUMP\u2019S CEO PANEL HASN\u2019T DONE MUCH: What has President Donald Trump\u2019s advisory panel of chief executives done since he took office? Elon Musk of Tesla and Bob Iger of Disney have quit in protest. But otherwise \u201cthere\u2019s been little activity for the strategy and policy forum and the manufacturing group, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019 Matthew Townsend, Shannon Pettypiece and Joe Deaux report. \u201cAfter initial meetings early in Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 which the White House promoted with great fanfare \u2014 his administration hasn\u2019t convened the groups for months or set firm dates for future meetings, according to the people.\u201d Full story.  MORE BUSINESS FOR KIT: Former Sen. Kit Bond (R-Mo.) will lobby for the St. Louis Zoo Association, according to a disclosure filing. It\u2019s Kit Bond Strategies\u2019 first new client in more than a year.  WHAT OUTSIDE GROUPS ARE SPENDING ON TAX REFORM: \u201cConservative and business-aligned advocacy groups plan to spend millions of dollars boosting tax reform in August, part of a coordinated effort with the White House and lawmakers to avoid the mistakes made during the bruising attempt to repeal Obamacare,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook reports. Consider the ad buys that have already been announced. \u201cThe American Action Network announced on Monday that it planned to spend $5 million in August alone \u2014 when lawmakers are usually back in their districts \u2014 and more than $20 million total on a tax push. The Business Roundtable, a group that represents CEOs of major companies, and the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity have also pledged to spend millions on TV and radio ads and social media campaigns and ensuring grass-roots turnout at town halls over the congressional recess. They would not confirm the exact amounts they will spend.\u201d Full story.  MORE MONEY, FEWER LOBBYISTS: \u201cOverall spending for the first six months of 2017 amounts to $1.66 billion \u2014 the highest it has been since the first half of 2012, which was followed by a roughly $50 million drop in 2013,\u201d OpenSecrets Blog\u2019s Sara Swann reports. \u201cHowever, while money has been pouring in, the number of lobbyists has been dwindling. Since the first quarter of this year, approximately 940 stopped lobbying, but 605 new lobbyists entered the fray. This ebb and flow brought the total number of active lobbyists for the second quarter to 9,460 \u2014 335 less than the first quarter.\u201d Full story.   IF YOU MISSED IT: Sen.

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), as a partner. Makki was previously a lobbyist for Novo Nordisk and before that worked for Murkowski for more than seven years. She was a top aide to Murkowski, a member of the Senate HELP Committee, during the fight over the legislation that became the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI would say that I know Alaska\u2019s health care landscape better than most,\u201d Makki said in an interview.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Now that she\u2019s at K&L Gates, Makki said she expects to lobby on whatever \u201chappens with any kind of repeal-and-replace effort\u201d \u2014 a fight in which Murkowski, one of three senators who brought down Senate Republicans\u2019 \u201cskinny repeal\u201d bill last week, will almost certainly be a critical vote. She also plans to work on drug pricing, medical device reimbursement, Medicare Part D, health care appropriations and provider payment and audit issues.  FIRST IN PI \u2014 SPG SIGNS AFGHANISTAN: The Afghan government has hired a Washington lobbying firm. SPG, a firm that\u2019s worked to cultivate a reputation as a go-to for foreign governments in President Donald Trump\u2019s Washington, signed a three-month contract with Afghanistan on Monday worth $40,000 a month. SPG will provide \u201cExecutive Branch and legislative engagement,\u201d \u201cdefense consultation,\u201d \u201cstrategic advice pertaining to extremism/terrorism\u201d and \u201cpromotion of democracy and foreign direct investment,\u201d according to the contract. The firm appears to be the Afghan government\u2019s first registered lobbying firm in Washington, according to DOJ filings; an Afghan political party had previously hired two Washington firms in 2014.  \u2014 SPG has signed the Czech, Kenyan and New Zealand governments since it began an aggressive expansion in Washington after the election, as well as the Korea International Trade Association and a Saudi government ministry loyal to the now-deposed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.

HOW LOBBYISTS WROTE A MEDICAL-MALPRACTICE BILL: \u201cFor two years, lobbyists for doctors and their insurers met regularly around a conference table a few blocks from the Capitol to draft an overhaul of the nation\u2019s medical malpractice laws,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Kimberly Kindy reports. \u201cThe resulting legislation proposed strict limits on damages for some plaintiffs and sharply lower fees for their attorneys. Last month, with no public hearings and few modifications, the House voted to approve the measure \u2014 outraging victims\u2019 rights advocates, who accused lawmakers of acting in secret to slam the courtroom door on people who have been grievously injured by doctors.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cIt isn\u2019t unusual for industry stakeholders to draft legislation. But in this case, lobbyists were able to rapidly shepherd their bill to House passage with minimal input from the public or even members of Congress. Lobbyists then crowed about the achievement, boasting that the House-passed measure was nearly identical to one they provided to the House Judiciary Committee and that Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced on Feb. 24. \u2018There wasn\u2019t a dramatic change in how we wrote it,\u2019 said Mike Stinson, a lobbyist for the Physician Insurers Association of America. But, he added, \u2018there are always some tweaks.\u2019\u201d Full story.  TECH COMPANIES FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILL: \u201cThe likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google are about to go to war with the U.S. Congress over the most unlikely of causes: human trafficking,\u201d Recode\u2019s Tony Romm reports. \u201cA new bill by Republican Sen. Rob Portman \u2014 backed by 19 other lawmakers from both parties \u2014 would open the door for state attorneys general and victims alike to take legal action against social networks, review websites, advertisers and others that don\u2019t do enough to combat users who post exploitative content. But the proposal is already drawing opposition from Silicon Valley, where tech companies want to put an end to human trafficking \u2014 but don\u2019t want to do so in a way that also subjects them to new lawsuits.\u201d Full story.  CLARK HILL SIGNS UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE: The United Launch Alliance, a joint spaceflight venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has added Clark Hill to its stable of lobbying firms. Kevin Kelly, Charlie Spies, Jasper Thomson and Lauren Lipin will lobby for the alliance on space-related legislation, policies and funding, according to a disclosure filing. The United Launch Alliance is a significant lobbying force in Washington, shelling out $460,000 in the second quarter. The alliance also has FTI Government Affairs, the Madison Group, the S-3 Group, Shank Public Policy and Theodore Kronmiller on retainer.  WHERE THEY ARE NOW: Roll Call\u2019s Kyle Stewart and Griffin Connolly have a rundown of what the 61 lawmakers who left the Hill after the 114th Congress are up to now. Just four have become lobbyists: former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) and former Reps. Charles Boustany (R-La.), Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.) and Jeff Miller (R-Fla.). Former House Speaker John Boehner is a senior strategic adviser at Squire Patton Boggs but hasn\u2019t registered as a lobbyist, and former Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) is a partner at the Pennsylvania law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel but isn\u2019t lobbying, either. Former Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) is the only former member to join a trade association. He\u2019s the chief executive of the National Roofing Contractors Association but isn\u2019t part of its lobbying team.  STOLEN EMAILS CAST UNFLATTERING LIGHT ON EMIRATI AMBASSADOR: \u201cYousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the U.S., is a high-profile power player in Washington, trying to shape American policy toward the Middle East and lobbying over a regional dispute with Qatar,\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bradley Hope and Tom Wright report. \u201cHe\u2019s also being drawn deeper into a major global corruption scandal. Newly released stolen emails show a long-running relationship between Mr. Otaiba and Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who U.S. law-enforcement officials say is at the center of the misappropriation of $4.5 billion from a Malaysian state development fund.  \u2014 \u201cThat relationship is drawing new scrutiny from U.S., Swiss and Singaporean authorities, according to people familiar with the probes. The stolen emails show Mr. Otaiba and Shaher Awartani, his Jordanian partner, discussing inquiries from those countries about transactions they received from entities investigators say is connected to Mr. Low. In one email, Mr. Awartani suggested buying a Ferrari after what Mr. Otaiba described as a \u2018transfer from Jho.\u2019\u201d Full story.  FIRST FILINGS: Dickinson Wright\u2019s Teddy Eynon and Patrick Anderson, who joined the firm in May from Fox Rothschild, filed their first trio of registrations with their new firm. The pair will lobby for Firetrace International, an Arizona-based manufacturer of fire suppression systems, on defense authorization and Pentagon appropriations; for Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority on the Sustainable Water Investment Act; and for U-Wrap, a Miami-based luggage protection company, on Transportation Security Administration regulations, per disclosure filings.   JOBS REPORT  \u2014 Milan Dilal is leaving the Hill to join Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck as counsel. He was previously a senior economic adviser to Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.).  \u2014 Jake Ward is stepping down as president and chief executive of the Developers Alliance, with Bruce Gustafson taking his place. Gustafson was previously a senior policy adviser to the alliance.   \u2014 The Government Affairs Industry Network has tapped Hannah Page-Salisbury of the Brunswick Group as its next secretary and chairwoman of the communications committee.  \u2014 \u201cWal-Mart hired Christian Gomez, Jr. as senior manager for global government affairs, with a focus on Latin America,\u201d per Playbook. \u201cHe was previously economic growth adviser at USAID and is a Council of the Americas alum.\u201d  NEW JOINT FUNDRAISERS:  Gillibrand McCaskill Senate 2018 (Sens.

Former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) and Steve Ryan, a partner at the firm, will head up the lobbying push. Those efforts will \u201cinclude correspondence and meetings with Members of Congress and their staffs, and Executive Branch officials from the Departments of State and Defense,\u201d according to a Justice Department filing. The Qataris are paying the firm a $40,000-a-month retainer.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Qatar has added six Washington lobbying firms in the past two months as its struggles to persuade Washington policymakers to take its side in the standoff \u2014 and that\u2019s not including subcontractors hired by those firm. The Qataris signed Avenue Strategies Global, a lobbying firm co-founded by President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and another former Trump campaign hand, Barry Bennett, last week on a $150,000-a-month retainer. And Playbook reported this morning that \u201cQatar will pay Nelson Mullins $100,000 per month for three months as the country ramps up its K Street presence, according to a draft FARA filing obtained by Playbook. Qatar is facing a blockade from Gulf states and Saudi Arabia. Robert Crowe, Vinoda Basnayake and Christopher Cushing will be representing Qatar.\u201d Qatar has also signed Information Management Services, LEVICK and former Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s firm and is now spending at least $1.7 million per month on lobbying.  SPG STAFFER PENS OP-ED ON TRUMP TOWER MEETING: Daniel Hoffman, the vice president of intelligence and security at SPG, a lobbying firm that has expanded aggressively in Washington since Trump\u2019s election, had an op-ed in The New York Times in Saturday\u2019s print edition giving his take on the meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner and a trio of \u201cKremlin-connected Russians,\u201d as he puts it. While there\u2019s no proof yet that the Kremlin planned the meeting, \u201cto me, the clearest evidence that this was a Russian influence operation is the trail of bread crumbs the Kremlin seemed to have deliberately left leading from Trump Tower to the Kremlin,\u201d Hoffman writes. \u201cThis operation was meant to be discovered.\u201d  \u2014 SPG, also known as Sonoran Policy Group, has positioned itself since the election as a firm that can help foreign governments (among other clients) navigate Trump\u2019s Washington. (The firm helped New Zealand, for instance, throw an inaugural party that drew a number of Trump White House staffers.) The op-ed doesn\u2019t disclose Hoffman\u2019s role at the firm, though, describing him only as \u201ca former chief of station for the C.I.A., worked for over 30 years for the United States government in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and South Asia.\u201d  Good afternoon, and welcome to PI.

Tammy Duckworth, Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are \u201cintroducing legislation to crack down on lobbyists who fail to disclose their work on behalf of foreign governments,\u201d The Associated Press reports. \u201cThe legislation being introduced Monday would ensure the Justice Department has the authority to impose civil financial penalties on lobbyists who fail to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\u201d The legislation is one of several bills in the works that would reform FARA, including efforts by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.). Senators in both parties endorsed tougher FARA enforcement in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week.   AHEAD OF THE FILINGS: Hogan Lovells has signed two new lobbying clients: Lloyd\u2019s, the British insurance giant, and HeartFlow, a California medical device firm. Aaron Cutler, Robert Glennon and Adam Fridman will lobby for Lloyd\u2019s on financial services and insurance issues, including the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program, according to a disclosure filing. Kenneth Choe, Cutler and Fridman will lobby for HeartFlow on Medicare payment issues.  MEANWHILE, ACROSS THE POND: Plenty of former members of Congress register as lobbyists shortly after leaving office. But in Britain, a veteran Labour member of Parliament \u201chas become the first serving politician to be officially registered as a lobbyist\u201d while still in office, The Guardian\u2019s Rajeev Syal reports. \u201cBarry Sheerman, who represents Huddersfield, is listed on the register of consultant lobbyists because of his chairmanship of Policy Connect, a not-for-profit company that has held meetings attended by paying businesses and ministers. \u2026 Sheerman told the Guardian he had reluctantly registered as a lobbyist, but disagrees with the rules governing the register. He maintains that Policy Connect is a social enterprise providing a service for industry experts and ministers.\u201d Full story.  JOBS REPORT  \u2014 \u201cLyft has added some political firepower to its board of directors: Valerie Jarrett, the longtime senior adviser to former President Barack Obama,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Overly reports.  \u2014 The National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions has added Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay as vice president of media relations and communications. She was previously a spokeswoman of the Consumer Bankers Association. The association has also promoted Curt Long from chief economist to vice president of research.  \u2014 Joe Nolan has joined the federal affairs team at SAS. He previously worked for Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).  \u2014 EducationCounsel has added Jamie Pueschel Fasteau as a principal. She was previously director of policy for education at Emerson Collective.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  07/28/2017 02:25 PM EDT  With David Beavers, Aubree Eliza Weaver and Aaron Lorenzo  INSIDE THE LONG LOBBYING PUSH FOR TERRORISM VICTIMS' FAMILIES: Sharp-eyed PI readers might recall that three of the 10 biggest lobbying contracts of the second quarter that we compiled last Friday were for a single client, Victims of Terrorism - East Africa. McGuireWoods Consulting brought in $600,000 from its Victims of Terrorism work, making it the third-largest contract of the quarter, and Monument Policy Group and Morris J. Amitay each brought in $590,000.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 But the hefty sums are a little misleading. The payments are for more than two years of lobbying work on behalf of families of the victims of two terrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, according to Frank Donatelli, the executive vice president and director of federal public affairs at McGuireWoods Consulting. \u201cWe looked at a variety of ways to get compensation to victims,\u201d Donatelli said in an interview. The firm started by trying to secure payments from a Justice Department fund. When that didn\u2019t work, McGuireWoods brought victims\u2019 families to Washington. \u201cWe fanned out over Capitol Hill and met a lot of members,\u201d Donatelli said. But \u201cthat didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d  \u2014 McGuireWoods and the other firms working for the families finally persuaded Congress in 2015 to tuck provisions into a giant spending bill creating a victims compensation fund stocked with money from the $9 billion that BNP Paribas, a French bank, paid in penalties for violating sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. Their clients received around $230 million in payments from the fund earlier this year \u2014 meaning McGuireWoods and the other firms could finally be paid as well. The firms will also receive a small cut of any future disbursements, Donatelli said. But their clients\u2019 advocacy work apparently isn\u2019t done. Victims of Terrorism - East Africa signed Kamins Consulting on Thursday to lobby for them. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  MILLER SIGNS THREE MORE: Former Rep. Jeff Miller, who joined McDermott Will & Emery as a lobbyist this spring after retiring from the House in January, has signed three more clients. Miller, a former chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, will lobby only the executive branch for Ambrosia Treatment Centers, Lumina Analytics and Veterans Evaluation Services. He registered to lobby for Steve Cohen, the billionaire financier, on veterans issues earlier this month. Miller is working for each client alongside an old colleague, former Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.), who served with Miller for more than a decade in the House, along with other McDermott Will & Emery lobbyists.  Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Got a sensitive tip?

BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE READIES PUSH ON TAX REFORM: \u201cThe Business Roundtable is embarking on a multi-million-dollar national TV and radio campaign, beginning in early August, to give tax reform extra momentum over the congressional recess,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook reports. \u201cDone in cooperation with White House, Treasury, and House and Senate leadership, this is BRT\u2019s effort to cast a potential tax overhaul as a once-in-a-generation opportunity. \u2018Members of Congress will hear from business leaders \u2014 and more importantly, their constituents \u2014 that tax reform is the single best way to increase investment in U.S. communities, create good jobs and promote a stronger economy,\u2019 said Joshua Bolten, President & CEO of Business Roundtable.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cThe ad campaign will kick off on Aug. 4. It comes on the heels of the \u2018Big 6\u2019 tax reform group releasing its six-paragraph set of principles on Thursday on broad tax reform goals including eliminating the controversial so-called border adjustment tax. The \u2018Big 6\u2019 includes National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; House Speaker Paul Ryan; Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch; and House Ways & Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady, all of whom have been meeting weekly since the spring to negotiate on potential changes.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 But there\u2019s plenty of skepticism that the drive for tax reform will be any easier than Republicans\u2019 tortured efforts to scrap Obamacare, The Boston Globe\u2019s Victoria McGrane reports. \u201c\u2018No one knows what we\u2019re pushing for,\u2019 one lobbyist involved in the issue said. \u2018We get zero guidance from the White House, we get zero guidance from Treasury. They\u2019re not staffed up.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018To me, it\u2019s looking a lot like what happened with health care,\u2019 featuring an apparent lack of understanding about how to organize such a difficult undertaking, said Eugene Steuerle, a cofounder and fellow of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who was a key architect of the 1986 tax reform effort under President Ronald Reagan.\u201d Full story.  BUT WAIT, THERE\u2019S MORE: Top administration officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to talk tax reform with leaders from the Koch network at a newly scheduled event Monday at the Newseum. If this sounds familiar, it is: Team Koch had already set up a tax reform discussion Wednesday at the Newseum featuring Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, billed as a kickoff to a multimillion-dollar campaign on overhauling U.S. tax laws. The new event \u2014 which will include White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short and Mnuchin as well as James Davis of Freedom Partners and Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity \u2014 will serve as a prelude of sorts. The influence groups are trying to help galvanize support around tax reform \u2014 and they see a clearer path forward now that the divisive border-adjustment tax proposal is off the table.  OUTDOOR RETAILERS MARCH IN PUBLIC LANDS CAMPAIGN: \u201cHundreds of outdoor industry representatives and their supporters took to the streets [in Salt Lake City on] Thursday for a rush-hour hike to the Utah Capitol\u201d as part of a protest against possible efforts to weaken protections for public lands, including the newly designated Bears Ears National Monument in the state, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The march was part of a sustained lobbying campaign by companies include Patagonia, REI, the North Face and Adidas Outdoor. \u201cWe realized somebody had to start making their voice heard,\u201d Greg Thomsen, the managing director of Adidas Outdoor USA, told The New York Times. \u201cIn my 40 years in the industry I have never seen the industry galvanized in such a way before.\u201d  \u2014 REI is also lobbying on the issue in Washington, although it spent a relatively modest $60,000 in the second quarter. The company has Signal Group Consulting on retainer as well as an in-house lobbyist.   THE PERILS OF WORKING IN AFRICA: The Economist has an interesting piece on American and British firms working in African elections, including Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and is largely owned by the Mercer family of GOP megadonors. \u201c\u2018Those who succeed are the ones doing the dark arts,\u2019 says one consultant. Cambridge Analytica refuses to say what it is doing this year in Kenya, but many Kenyans suspect it is helping to craft a vicious campaign. In the 2013 Kenyan election, it claims its research made it \u2018able to draft an effective campaign strategy\u2019 for [President Uhuru] Kenyatta.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  07/27/2017 02:50 PM EDT  With help from David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  QATAR SIGNS LEWANDOWSKI\u2019S FORMER FIRM: The Qatari government has signed Avenue Strategies Global, a sister firm of the lobbying shop co-founded by Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, as it scrambles for favor in Washington in its ongoing standoff with Saudi Arabia and its allies. Lewandowski founded Avenue Strategies with Barry Bennett, another Trump campaign veteran, after Trump\u2019s victory last year but left in May after a spate of unflattering stories. Bennett and Lewandowski started Avenue Strategies Global to focus on international work weeks before Lewandowski quit the firm. (Bennett had initially ruled out working for foreign governments but later said this spring that the firm was pursuing overseas clients.)  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Now Avenue \u201cmay provide counsel to the State of Qatar on matters relating to public diplomacy, strategic communications and government relations services,\u201d according to a disclosure filed with the Justice Department. Bennett and two others \u2014 Ed Brookover, another Trump campaign veteran, and Angus M. Green Jr. \u2014 will represent Qatar through \u201ccommunications with Members of Congress and Congressional staff, Executive Branch officials, the media, and with other individuals and organizations involved in governmental and public policy matters.\u201d Qatar is paying the firm $150,000 a month.  \u2014 Qatar\u2019s hiring of Avenue is part of an expensive effort to beef up the tiny Gulf country\u2019s presence in Washington. "The Qataris are playing catch-up ball," Patrick Theros, a former U.S. ambassador to Qatar in the Clinton administration who now heads the U.S.-Qatar Business Council, told POLITICO earlier this month. "They had a minimal lobbying presence" before the crisis. Qatar has hired three additional firms \u2014 Information Management Services, LEVICK and former Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s firm \u2014 in addition to Avenue, and is spending at least $1.5 million per month on Washington lobbying. Saudi Arabia and its allies, meanwhile, have plenty of lobbying muscle of their own. Six firms \u2014 Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, CGCN Group, Glover Park Group, Hogan Lovells, McKeon Group and Qorvis MSLGROUP \u2014 are taking the lead in Saudi Arabia\u2019s own lobbying push.

SENATORS PUSH FOR A TOUGHER FARA: The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing on the Foreign Agent Registration Act \u2014 which started on Wednesday and continued today \u2014 drew headlines when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) issued and then withdrew subpoenas to Paul Manafort and Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, the firm that compiled the infamous Trump dossier. But the real takeaway from the hearing might have the bipartisan support for toughening up FARA, which requires those working for foreign powers in Washington (and the rest of the country) to register and file regular reports with the Justice Department.  \u2014 \u201cGiven recent Russian and other efforts to influence our elections, this law has never been more important,\u201d Grassley said in his opening remarks. \u201cUnfortunately it appears that the Justice Department and the FBI have been seriously lax in enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration Act and for a long time.\u201d Only nine Justice Department staffers work full-time to enforce FARA, according to Grassley. \u201cWhy comply when the Justice Department clearly doesn\u2019t treat this law as a priority?\u201d he said. \u201cI fear that FARA violations are happening around this town all the time,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), \u201cmeaning foreign governments are attempting to exert undisclosed influence over U.S. policy, and we simply don\u2019t know about it.\u201d He cited Saudi lobbying against a bill last year allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to sue the kingdom.  \u2014 Two witnesses before the panel, Adam Hickey of the Justice Department and Bill Priestap of the FBI, largely agreed with Grassley. Priestap endorsed legislative efforts to \u201cput some teeth into the statute\u201d and make it easier to enforce. \u201cIf there are no consequences to [not] registering, why not wait for the knock on the door rather than come up voluntarily and do it?\u201d he said. The Hill\u2019s Megan Wilson reports that Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) is working on a bill that would scrap a loophole that allows lobbyists to register under the less onerous Lobbying Disclosure Act instead of FARA for some foreign work. And Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) are working on their own FARA reform bill.  KNIGHT AND MNUCHIN CLASHING ON TAX REFORM: \u201cThe White House\u2019s top tax staffer, Shahira Knight, who works for Gary Cohn at the National Economic Council, has feuded in the last few months with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other Treasury officials, according to a senior administration official and four other people familiar with their interactions,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook reports. \u201cThis comes as the administration and congressional leaders prepare to unveil a broad-brush tax proposal, weeks ahead of schedule, as a way to pivot from the grinding debate over health care \u2014 and to show movement on an issue significant to the business community before Congress adjourns for its August recess.\u201d Knight was a lobbyist for Fidelity Investments before joining the administration. Full story.  CFTC NOMINEE LOBBIED FOR TRADE GROUP THAT CRITICIZED THE AGENCY: \u201cDawn DeBerry Stump, one of the Republicans who President Donald Trump selected to join the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission], earned almost $400,000 in the last year working for an industry association that has been critical of the agency's regulations,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West reports. Stump and two other CFTC nominees are testifying today before the Senate Agriculture Committee. \u201cFrom about January 2016 to May 2017, Stump was paid $198,902 by the Futures Industry Association in salary and bonus, according to a financial disclosure form signed in May. Stump worked for FIA from 2012 to May 2016 as an executive. After she left FIA, she made $197,586 lobbying at the firm she founded, Stump Strategic. FIA was her only client.\u201d Full story.  JOBS REPORT:  \u2014 Van Ness Feldman is adding Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming next month as a partner. She was previously a principal legal adviser at the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement and before that worked as chief of staff at the Environmental Protection Agency. She\u2019s expected to devote the bulk of her time to legal work but may lobby as well.  \u2014 The Public Affairs Council has hired Kristin Brackemyre as manager of PAC and advocacy practices. She was previously senior manager for PAC and political affairs at the Consumer Technology Association.   \u2014 First Data has promoted Kim Ford to senior vice president and head of government affairs. She was previously vice president of government affairs.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  07/26/2017 02:02 PM EDT  With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  UBER ON A HIRING SPREE: Uber is hiring two new lobbying firms as the company reels following the resignation last month of its founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Jason Tai and Matt Ginsberg of Chambers, Conlon & Hartwell and Danielle Burr, Jeff Shapiro, Jen Olson, Jay Heimbach, Tim Molino and John Michael Gonzalez of Peck Madigan Jones will lobby for Uber on \u201cthe deployment of self-driving vehicles for commercial purposes\u201d and Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization, among other issues, according to a disclosure filing. The registrations come a week after Uber hired Ballard Partners, the lobbying firm led by Brian Ballard, a longtime Florida lobbyist and top fundraiser for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign who opened a Washington office after Trump won.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Uber spent $430,000 on Washington lobbying in the second quarter, according to a disclosure filing \u2014 more than other top privately held tech companies such as Palantir ($380,000) and Airbnb ($160,000) but far less than publicly held giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon. Its other lobbying firms include Capitol Tax Partners, Invariant and the Doerrer Group. Uber parted ways earlier this month with the Franklin Square Group, which had lobbied for the company since 2013.  WILEY REIN ADDS FORMER SPRINT WASHINGTON HAND: Wiley Rein is bringing on Richard Engelman, who spent the past decade in Sprint\u2019s Washington office, as a consultant. Engelman worked as a director of spectrum resources for Sprint and before that spent three decades at the Federal Communications Commission, where he rose to chief engineer of the international bureau.

CHAMBER PUSHING CHANGES AT SEC: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday \u201cpublished seven recommendations for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] to consider that would limit investors\u2019 ability to pressure public companies on issues ranging from executive compensation to climate change,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Patrick Temple-West reports. It\u2019s the latest shot in a long-running battle between business lobbying groups and shareholder activists. \u201cThe Chamber argued that the SEC\u2019s shareholder proposal system is \u2018broken\u2019 and has been hijacked by activist investors crusading for pet causes that mainstream investors don\u2019t care about. \u2018No small subset of activists should be able to commandeer longstanding SEC rules for their own parochial purposes,\u2019 the Chamber said.\u201d Full story.  NEW ETHICS CHIEF CLASHED WITH SHAUB: \u201cDavid J. Apol, named by President Trump last week as the new head of the Office of Government Ethics, has repeatedly clashed with colleagues over his career at the agency as he sought to roll back or loosen ethics requirements on federal employees, including those in the White House, three former senior officials at the agency said,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Eric Lipton reports. \u201cMr. Apol\u2019s former colleagues praised his intelligence and his experience as a federal government ethics lawyer at a half-dozen different agencies, including the White House, over three decades. But the tension has been building for at least a decade, during two stints Mr. Apol served at the Office of Government Ethics, his former colleagues said.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cMr. Apol has argued that the agency is often too rigid in interpreting conflict-of-interest laws, they said. As recently as this spring, Mr. Apol had a disagreement with Walter M. Shaub Jr., the departing director, when Mr. Apol suggested that Derek T. Kan, a senior executive at Lyft, the car-sharing service, should not be required to sell his vested stock options in the company before he accepted a job at the Department of Transportation as the head of policy.\u201d Full story.  TREASURY NOMINEE HELPED RUSSIAN BANK LOOK INTO POTENTIAL TRUMP CONNECTION: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, Brian A. Benczkowski, said on Tuesday that he helped Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank investigate whether its computer servers contacted the Trump Organization,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charlie Savage reports. \u201cMr. Benczkowski had told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he represented Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia\u2019s largest financial institutions and whose owners have ties to President Vladimir V. Putin. On Tuesday, as Mr. Benczkowski came before the panel for his confirmation hearing, he acknowledged that his work for Alfa Bank directly touched on suspicions related to the bank in connection with the Trump-Russia affair.\u201d Full story.  MEANWHILE, IN MARYLAND: \u201cThe oil and natural gas industry spent more than $1.4 million to influence Maryland lawmakers during this year\u2019s General Assembly session. But lobbyists still lost their fight to allow fracking in Maryland,\u201d The Associated Press reports. \u201cThe Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday that the American Petroleum Institute paid almost three times as much as the next-biggest spender on lobbying. \u2026 Republican Gov. Larry Hogan and the Democratic majority in the General Assembly still agreed to ban the method of extracting natural gas.\u201d Full story.  JOBS REPORT:  \u2014 \u201cMlika Carroll, a policy adviser to Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), will join the Internet Association as senior vice president for global government affairs,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Overly reports. She\u2019ll \u201coversee the state and federal affairs teams that lobby on technology and innovation issues for member companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook and Airbnb, among others.\u201d  \u2014 Mike Godwin is heading to the Niskanen Center as a senior fellow. He was previously director of innovation policy at the R Street Institute.  \u2014 Vien Truong has been named chief executive of Dream Corps, the nonprofit led by CNN's Van Jones.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  07/25/2017 02:00 PM EDT  With David Beavers, Aubree Eliza Weaver and Daniel Lippman  HOW AMAZON IS ACTUALLY LOBBYING ON TAXES: President Donald Trump lashed out at Amazon in a trio of tweets on Monday night, wondering if the company was using The Washington Post \u201cas a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Trump has attacked Amazon, and the basic contours of the fact-check are familiar by now. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive \u2014 not Amazon itself \u2014 owns the Post, and the company exercises no control over the newspaper. \u201cAmazon used to lobby to keep Internet sales free from state taxes, but no more,\u201d the Post\u2019s own fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, wrote this morning. \u201cAs of March, Amazon is collecting sales tax on purchases in every state that has one.\u201d  Story Continued Below  \u2014 While Amazon isn\u2019t pushing for a \u201cno-tax monopoly,\u201d it does do plenty of lobbying on taxes. The company spent $3.2 million on lobbying in the second quarter, according to a disclosure filing, and its roster of dozens of tax lobbyists includes three former members of Congress. They include John Breaux, Matthew Cutts, Trent Lott and Brandon Romn of Squire Patton Boggs; David Lugar, Ralph Hellmann and Nicole Mortier of the Lugar Hellmann Group; Vic Fazio, Ed Pagano and Hans Rickhoff of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld; Elizabeth Frazee, Rachel Wolbers, Debra Dixon, Sarah Dumont-Merchak and Veronica O\u2019Connell of TwinLogic Strategies; Jonathan Talisman and Christopher Javens at Capitol Tax Partners; Amanda Armistead, Casey Duggan, Michael Drobac, Russ Sullivan, Frank Donatelli and Rob Wasinger of McGuireWoods Consulting; Brian Ballard, Sylvester Lukis, Dan McFaul and Rebecca Benn of Ballard Partners; and Stewart Verdery and a dozen other lobbyists at Monument Policy Group, as well as 10 in-house Amazon lobbyists, according to disclosure filings.  LOBBYIT LOBBYING ON CHILD ABDUCTIONS: Here\u2019s a registration that caught our attention last week: Lobbyit.com, a lobbying firm that charges clients as little at $995 per month, is lobbying for Henry Lyden of Wellesley, Mass., on \u201cForeign individual abduction of US citizens,\u201d per a disclosure filing. Lyden, an American living in Japan, is fighting for custody of his 9-year-old son, who lives in Japan with Lyden\u2019s estranged Japanese wife. There is a \u201cdifferent governmental mindset\u201d toward joint custody in Japan, according to John Gomez, the chairman of Kizuna Child-Parent Reunion, a group that advocates for parents like Lyden. The abducting parent is \u201cessentially rewarded\u201d with full custody by Japanese courts \u201cvirtually without exception,\u201d Gomez said.   \u2014 Lyden isn\u2019t the only American caught in a Japanese child-custody struggle, although he may be the only one who\u2019s hired a lobbyist. Japan signed the Hague Abduction Convention, an international treaty governing such disputes, in 2014, but the Japanese have \u201cthumbed their noses\u201d when it comes to enforcement, said Keith Nelson, one of the Lobbyit lobbyists working for Lyden. The Washington Post reported this month on a similar case involving a Minnesota man, noting that \u201cthe U.S. Embassy in Tokyo is dealing with about 70 child abduction cases, 42 of them filed since Japan signed the convention, and 10 of those seeking the return of children to the United States.\u201d Lobbyit will work to raise the profile of child abductions to Japan before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department, Nelson said.

AMAZON ADDS FIVE: Amazon has brought on five new public policy managers in its Washington office: Liz Garner, Dan O\u2019Connor, John Drake, Chris Wilson and Matthew McCardle. Garner was previously a senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Merchant Advisory Group. O\u2019Connor was previously a vice president of public policy at the Computer and Communications Industry Association. Drake was previously a senior vice president of legislative affairs at the American Trucking Associations. Wilson was previously vice president of government affairs at 21st Century Fox. And McCardle was previously a senior director of federal affairs at Boeing.  SENATE CONFIRMS FORMER BROWNSTEIN HYATT LOBBYIST: The Senate confirmed Dave Bernhardt, a former Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck lobbyist, to the No. 2 slot in the Interior Department on Monday, POLITICO\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports. The vote was 53 to 43, with just four Democrats \u2014 Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2014 voting in favor, along with Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cBernhardt\u2019s confirmation came despite environmental and good governance groups criticizing him as having too many conflicts of interest to fill the position.\u201d Full story.  DeMINT WILL FIGHT \u2018POTOMAC FEVER\u2019: Former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), who was ousted from The Heritage Foundation in May, will serve as chairman of a new conservative group called the Conservative Partnership Institute, POLITICO\u2019s Jake Lahut reports. \u201cThere\u2019s a missing piece that has proved costly: shepherding conservatives through the Washington swamps without being infected with Potomac Fever,\u201d DeMint said in a statement. \u201cThe Conservative Partnership Institute will fill this void by providing the resources, expertise and training needed for leaders and staff in Washington to succeed.\u201d Full story.  VENEZUELA, IN CRISIS, STILL SPENDING ON LOBBYING: Venezuela continues to shell out on \u201cWashington lobbyists through its subsidiary Citgo, a Houston-based oil company,\u201d even though its people are starving, McClatchy\u2019s Alex Daugherty and Franco Ordoez report. Three firms \u2014 Avenue Strategies, Cornerstone Government Affairs and VantageKnight \u2014 \u201ccurrently represent Venezuela in Washington, pushing Capitol Hill, the White House and Cabinet agencies on issues like \u2018fuel refining\u2019 and the \u2018potential impact of U.S. energy policies on CITGO\u2019s operation impacting U.S. consumers,\u2019 according to Senate lobbying records.\u201d  \u2014 \u201cCaracas sees its investment in lobbyists as a way to fight possible sweeping sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil. \u2026 \u2018The costs for representation is a drop in the bucket when compared to the potential economic loss\u2019 of oil sanctions, said C.J. Gimenez, the son of Miami-Dade [Mayor] Carlos Gimenez and a lobbyist who left Avenue Strategies, a firm started by Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign aides, after the firm decided to pick up Citgo as a client.\u201d Full story.  JOBS REPORT:  \u2014 Christina McGarry has joined HLP&R Advocacy as a policy adviser. She was previously a legislative assistant to Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.).  \u2014 Chamber Hill Strategies is bringing on Melissa Bartlett as a principal.

aV \u000a            By THEODORIC MEYER  07/24/2017 02:21 PM EDT  With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver  CHARLIE BASS HAS A NEW FIRM: Former Rep. Charlie Bass (R-N.H.) has a new side gig. Bass joined Greenberg Traurig after losing reelection in 2012 and lobbied last quarter for clients including the American College of Rheumatology, Bayer, C&S Wholesale Grocers and Covanta. But Greenberg Traurig last week terminated its registration for C&S Wholesale Grocers, and the next day Bass registered to lobby for the company with a new firm, BASSGLP LLC. He also registered to lobby for Altria, the tobacco giant, which Greenberg Traurig has not represented. Bass wrote in an email that he was traveling and couldn\u2019t talk but that he hadn\u2019t left Greenberg Traurig.  Story Continued Below  END OF THE ROAD: Here are a few lobbying terminations that caught our eye amid the end-of-quarter deluge last week. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld has parted ways with Intel and TripAdvisor (both of which recently signed McGuireWoods Consulting). Covington & Burling is no longer lobbying for Anheuser-Busch. ML Strategies has stopped lobbying for ExxonMobil, Lockheed Martin and Northeast Maglev, a politically connected firm pushing to build a maglev train between Washington and New York. (Northeast Maglev recently signed Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.) And Qorvis MSLGROUP has parted ways with Yamal LNG, a proposed Russian liquefied natural gas plant for which Qorvis was lobbying on U.S. sanctions against Russia, among other issues.  TRUMP FRIEND ADDS ANOTHER CLIENT: Albert J. Pirro Jr., the New York lawyer and old friend of President Donald Trump\u2019s who served almost a year for a 2000 conspiracy and tax evasion conviction, has signed another client. He\u2019ll lobby for SHINE Medical Technologies Inc., a producer of medical tracers and cancer treatment elements, on \u201cmatch funding authorized by the American Medical [Isotopes] Production Act,\u201d according to a disclosure filing. It\u2019s Pirro\u2019s second registration in the health care space this year. The Greater New York Hospital Association, which Pirro signed in May, paid his firm, the Pirro Group, $122,517 in the second quarter. Pirro did not return a request for comment.   Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips? Complaints? Angry, meandering rants about your lobbying rivals? Get in touch: tmeyer@politico.com. You can also follow me on Twitter: @theodoricmeyer.  MORE SECOND-QUARTER ANALYSIS: \u201cSeveral of the country's largest technology companies spent record sums on lobbying during the second quarter of the year as they beefed up their lobbyist rosters and began to navigate Washington under a new and often unpredictable administration, lobbying filings show,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Steven Overly reports. \u201cGoogle had its single largest quarter ever with a lobbying bill that totaled $5.9 million. Oracle also posted a banner quarter with $2.79 million spent on lobbying. Apple shelled out a record $2.2 million, nearly double the amount it spent a year earlier. Amazon, Uber and Palantir also hit new heights between April and June.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 WilmerHale had a good quarter. The firm brought in $2.1 million in lobbying revenue, up from $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2016. The firm\u2019s revenue per lobbyist came in at more than $400,000, according to Jon Yarowsky and Rob Lehman, the co-chairmen of the firm\u2019s public policy practice. \u201cWe are thrilled at the rapid growth of our advocacy practice from its beginning three years ago,\u201d Yarowsky and Lehman said in a statement.   \u2014 While many firms saw upticks in their business and others saw declines, it\u2019s worth remembering that savvy companies don\u2019t ramp up or dial back their efforts just based on what\u2019s going on in Congress. They\u2019re here for the long haul. \u201cMost people who are playing at a meaningful level in Washington know that you don\u2019t just turn your efforts on and off like a light switch,\u201d said Hunter Bates, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who\u2019s now a partner at Akin Gump.   INSIDE MALLINCKRODT\u2019S INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN: \u201cAfter making meager donations in 2015, [the troubled drugmaker Mallinckrodt\u2019s] political action committee began raising its contributions for congressional campaigns last year,\u201d Kaiser Health News\u2019 Jay Hancock, Elizabeth Lucas and Sydney Lupkin report. \u201cLawmakers in both the House and Senate collected $44,000 from Mallinckrodt in 2017\u2019s first quarter, nearly nine times what they got from the company in the same period two years ago. Mallinckrodt also spent $610,000 lobbying Congress, triple the amount of 2015\u2019s first quarter.\u201d And the company is not unique. \u201cThis year, a critical and risky one for drug companies, the industry as a whole is ratcheting up campaign donations and its presence on Capitol Hill, a new database compiled by Kaiser Health News shows.\u201d Full story.  IF MISSED YOU IT: \u201cEmbattled former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has opened a new consulting firm called Resilient Patriot LLC that is advising private equity firms, according to one of his brothers, who says Flynn is \u2018moving on with his life,\u2019\u201d the Associated Press\u2019 Michelle Smith reports. \u201cJoe Flynn said his family also is in the early stages of starting a fund to pay for the legal bills his brother is racking up as he sits at the center of multiple probes into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u2018Mike\u2019s not a millionaire, not even close,\u2019 Joe Flynn told The Associated Press this week. \u2018This situation has put him in a tough spot financially. This is going to cost him a lot of money.\u2019\u201d Full story.  JOBS REPORT:  \u2014 The National Restaurant Association is bringing on Jessica Falborn as a senior adviser and Adam Hasley as director of advocacy research and insights. Falborn previously worked on the business side at The Hill. Hasley previously worked for a consulting firm in China.  \u2014 Tom Koonce will join Rich Feuer Anderson next month, per Morning Money. He was previously a lobbyist for JPMorgan Chase.  \u2014 District Mayor Muriel Bowser has tapped Kevin Bush as the city\u2019s first chief resilience officer. He was previously in community planning and infrastructure as supervisory resilience specialist at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  \u2014 Hemal Shah has moved over to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Global Intellectual Property Center as a senior manager, focused on advocacy in markets including Brazil, India and South Africa. She previously worked for the Chamber\u2019s U.S.-India Business Council.  SPOTTED: At the Indiana Society Hoosier Beerfest (sponsored by the Brewers of Indiana Guild) at Baker Donelson\u2019s offices last week, according to a PI tipster: Doug Wasitis of Indiana University; Jan Powell of Baker Donelson; Jodi Richardson of Holland & Knight; Joel Riethmiller of Imperium Global Advisors; Stefan Bailey of Prime Policy Group (who\u2019s also president of the Indiana Society); Brad Queisser of Bose Public Affairs Group; Jennifer Pike Bailey of the Human Rights Campaign; Tom Jeffers of Hill-Rom; and Rob Ehrich of Slipstream Strategies.

(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)  Story Continued Below  MOUNTAINERS ARE ALWAYS FREE \u2014 \u201cWest Virginia Democratic governor switches to GOP,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matthew Nussbaum, Gabriel Debenedetti, and Daniel Strauss: \u201cWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is expected to announce a party switch in a surprise appearance with President Donald Trump in Huntington, W.Va., on Thursday, according to two sources ... Justice, who seldom worked with other Democrats, recently spent a well-publicized day hunting with Donald Trump Jr. \u2014 a familiar political optic in a largely rural state with a strong hunting tradition. But his move still blindsided his old party, which is now left with control of just only 15 governors mansions. Rumors that Justice was going to make the switch circulated throughout the day but West Virginia Democrats and multiple national Democrats who have worked for Justice in the past said he gave them no advance notice on the party switch."We are sitting here in our office, everyone of us that is capable standing on two feet, looking at each other saying, 'oh my goodness, did anybody see this coming?" said Steve Roberts, president of the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 MANCHIN STATEMENT: \u201cI have been and always will be a proud West Virginia Democrat. I am disappointed by Governor Justice\u2019s decision to switch parties. While I do not agree with his decision, I have always said that I will work with anyone, no matter their political affiliation, to do what is best for the people of West Virginia.\u201d   MORE WEST VIRGINIA \u2014 \u201cSenate Leadership Fund launches digital campaign vs. Manchin,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Kevin Robillard: \u201cSenate Leadership Fund, the deep-pocketed GOP super PAC, is launching a digital campaign attacking Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to West Virginia tonight. The campaign will direct voters to a website labeling Manchin "The Joe You Don't Know," which notes Manchin voted against repealing Obamacare and has voted against 60 percent of Trump's judicial nominees. It's the first of what will be a slew of attacks aimed at pitting the former governor and second-term senator against Trump, who is ultra-popular in the state.\u201d Full story.   NEW THIS MORNING \u2014 EMILY\u2019s List endorses Andrea Ramsey: EMILY\u2019s List is backing Andrea Ramsey in KS-03, one of several Democrats jockeying to take on GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder, per a statement from the group. Hillary Clinton won the district in 2016, putting it atop the list of Democratic targets.   I LIKE MIKE \u2014 Pence to keynote Koch summit: Vice President Mike Pence will address Americans for Prosperity\u2019s annual summit, which is set for Aug.19 in Richmond, Va. The summit offers AFP volunteers a chance to network, attend trainings and hear from a battery of speakers. This year\u2019s summit will have a focus on tax reform, the Koch network\u2019s main focus heading into fall.   CASH FLOW \u2014 Super PACs prep for Aug. 15 special primaries: Senate Leadership Fund raised over $1.5 million in 26 days in July, mostly via a $1 million check from Steven A. Cohen and $250,000 from Phil Ruffin, as it spends heavily to back Sen. Luther Strange in the fast-approaching Alabama Senate special GOP primary. In Utah, where three Republicans are competing in a primary for former Rep. Jason Chaffetz's old 3rd District, Tanner Ainge's mother Michelle gave $250,000 to the super PAC backing him, Conservative Utah. And the Club for Growth transferred $130,000 to National Horizon, which has been backing Republican Chris Herrod.  \u2014 AIR WAR \u2014 The Club for Growth reserved TV airtime in UT-03, a race the conservative group hasn't formally endorsed in yet. A TV tracking source said the ad buy, worth $90,000, will start Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to learn John Curtis is nervous about voters discovering his long record of supporting tax hikes, but we have no formal announcement today," Rachael Slobodien, a spokeswoman for the Club said in a statement.

DAILY WAR EAGLE \u2014 \u201cOne of Mo Brooks' endorsers is also his chief of staff\u201d by AL.com's Howard Koplowitz: \u201cAmong the endorsements U.S. Senate candidate Mo Brooks received on Wednesday was the backing of Mark Pettitt, who identified himself at the event at Hoover Tactical Firearms as an Alabama Strike Force member "who has been a beneficiary of Mo's help." But Pettitt is also Brooks' chief of staff -- and defended omitting his title at the event in an interview with AL.com on Thursday. "We don't like to mix official office with campaigns," Prewitt said. "What I do on my day job is supposed to be independent of what I do on my campaign time." Full story.   \u2014 MORE ALABAMA \u2014 The National Rifle Association of America Political Victory Fund is spending $43,117 in radio ads in support of Sen. Luther Strange according to independent expenditure filings on Aug. 2.   \u2014 EVEN MORE ALABAMA \u2014 \u201cSenate Conservatives Fund endorses Brooks,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Daniel Strauss: \u201cThe anti-incumbent conservative outside group Senate Conservatives Fund has endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks, less than two weeks before Alabama's special Senate primaries. Brooks is one of almost a dozen challengers to incumbent Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed earlier this year to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat ... "We're also proud to help defend Mo Brooks against the false attacks being made by Senator Mitch McConnell and his political machine," SCF President Ken Cuccinelli said in an email to supporters announcing the endorsement.\u201d Full story.  CROWDED HOUSE PRIMARY, GOP EDITION \u2014 NV-03: Tons of Democratic candidates are piling into House primaries around the country, but Nevada Republicans clearly see an opportunity in Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen's seat, which she's leaving open to run for Senate. Via the Nevada Independent's Riley Snyder: "[F]ormer Assemblywoman Victoria Seaman. Seaman, who lost a key state Senate bid by a little more than 1,000 votes in 2016, said on Wednesday that she\u2019s jumping in the race ... Seaman repeatedly expressed her desire to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda on everything from immigration policy to repealing the Affordable Care Act, noting that the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District narrowly swung to Trump." Full story.  STAFFING UP \u2014 Republican Ohio Senate candidate Mike Gibbons added Matt Wills as a political adviser and Chris Schrimpf as senior communications adviser. Wills previously worked for Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor and was executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, while Schrimpf was a top staffer on Gov. John Kasich\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and worked for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens last year as well.  RECESS ADS \u2014 American Bridge attacks 15 House Republicans in digital ads: \u201cAmerican Bridge is launching digital ads that will air throughout the August recess attacking 15 House Republicans on their health care votes. The ads, which will target swing voters through Labor Day, will go after incumbents, including: Reps. Jack Bergman, Tim Walberg, Fred Upton, Mike Bishop and Dave Trott in Michigan; Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Brian Mast in Florida; Reps. Mike Gallagher and Paul Ryan in Wisconsin; Rep. Barbara Comstock in Virginia; Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona; Rep. Darrell Issa in California; Rep. Bruce Poliquin in Maine; Rep. Will Hurd in Texas; and Rep. Rod Blum in Iowa.\u201d Watch the ad here. Full story.  ALL ABOUT 218 \u2014 \u201cDemocrats begin to see Pelosi as a 2018 problem,\u201d by McClatchy\u2019s Alex Roarty: \u201cNancy Pelosi might actually be in trouble. In a survey of 20 Democratic House candidates, only one \u2014 a former Senate staffer from Orange County, California \u2014 would state support for the congresswoman staying on as leader of the House Democratic Caucus. Of the rest, 18 declined to say if Pelosi should keep her job, while one, a political newcomer from a culturally conservative Ohio district, said he would vote for someone other than Pelosi.\u201d Full story.  CODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI can\u2019t help you anymore being a Democrat governor ... So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican.\u201d \u2014 West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who said in May that the health care bill Trump backed would "cripple" his state, explaining his party switch alongside Trump before a crowd in Huntington.

aV \u000a            By DANIEL STRAUSS and SCOTT BLAND  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With Elena Schneider, Maggie Severns, Kevin Robillard and Zach Montellaro  The following newsletter is an abridged version of Campaign Pro's Morning Score.

(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)  Story Continued Below  RETIREMENT WATCH \u2014 August and September 2017 will be key months for the 2018 House landscape: Rep. Diane Black's (R-Tenn.) gubernatorial campaign launch on Wednesday means that there are now 18 House members who have announced they will leave their seats open in 2018 \u2014 a number that is sure to rise. That's partly because some not-quite-official Senate candidates, like GOP Reps. Todd Rokita and Lou Barletta, have not yet made things official, while GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma has said in the past that this would be his last term and is not raising money but hasn't spoken about it recently. But mostly, it's because of the biannual tradition that some members simply come back from recess and decide that they don't want to run again.  \u2014 Retirements will shape the battle for the House more than almost any other factor, apart from the president's approval and the general national environment. Republican incumbents showed much more ability to separate from Trump than open-seat candidates in 2016, and while that could fade now that he's president, their experience (and bank accounts) will come in handy with Republicans facing down a potentially forbidding political environment, especially in the 23 GOP districts that Hillary Clinton carried last year. So far, a plurality of the retirements have come from Republicans in safe seats. Democratic retirements by reps running for higher office have actually exposed two true swing seats (MN-01 and NV-03) versus just one for the GOP so far (FL-27). Whether those numbers shift, and by how much, is the big thing students of the House are watching with the end of summer already on the horizon.  MO-VING CLOSER \u2014 \u201cHawley forms exploratory committee for U.S. Senate run against McCaskill,\u201d by McClatchy\u2019s Lindsay Wise and Bryan Lowry: \u201cMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley is creating an exploratory committee to run for U.S. Senate against Democrat Claire McCaskill. \u2018As part of Josh\u2019s process to consider becoming a candidate for the United States Senate, this week he is filing paperwork to launch an exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission,\u2019 said Hawley\u2019s spokesman, Scott Paradise, in an email...Former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, Republican megadonor David Humphreys and other prominent Missouri Republicans published an open letter months ago urging Hawley to jump into the race for U.S. Senate in 2018.\u201d Full story.   PRIMARY COLORS \u2014 "Justice Democrats raised almost $1M. What\u2019s next?" by Campaign Pro's Maggie Severns: "The anti-incumbent PAC Justice Democrats raised $923,803 during the first six months of this year ... [and] has endorsed a dozen candidates and started pushing a Medicare-for-all platform in Washington that will be a main focus this year. The group has raised enough money to make a big splash in a few selected primaries, if it decided to, but it has not elected to use the money as a traditional outside-spending or bundling PAC. ... Justice Democrats disclosed paying $429,850 for 'strategic consulting' to Brand New Congress, an affiliated LLC that is also led by Chakrabarti, during the first six months of 2016. Chakrabarti said the funds went to payroll and other expenses for Justice Democrats staff who are employed by both organizations. Brand New Congress is also offering itself as a consulting firm and hub for candidates endorsed by Justice Democrats." Full story.   FIRST IN SCORE \u2014 End Citizens United endorses Jacky Rosen in Nevada: The campaign finance reform group End Citizens United is the latest group to throw its support to Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in the race against GOP Sen. Dean Heller. ECU president Tiffany Muller said in a statement the Nevada Senate race will be \u201ca top priority for ECU this cycle.\u201d ECU spent $2 million boosting now-Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in 2016 and spent $150,000 for Rosen during her congressional race. The group found signs it thinks is promising in polling last cycle in Nevada: key groups of Nevada voters, including independents, were more swayed by messages with a money in politics theme than by other generic messaging.

Will Hurd gets first major Democratic challenger for 2018,\u201d by the Texas Tribune\u2019s Patrick Svitek: \u201cGina Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force intelligence officer, is entering the race Wednesday, wading into a potentially crowded primary field for a shot at Hurd \u2026 Jones said she was inspired to come home to San Antonio and run for Congress after witnessing up close the opening months of Donald Trump's presidency as a director in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative \u2026 Jones attended Boston University on a ROTC scholarship and served in the Air Force from 2003-2006, deploying to Iraq.

But he did say that there are people who would like to see him run, and he said he plans to return to public office one day.

Shaken by President Donald Trump\u2019s surprising victory last November and motivated by his actions to undo parts of former President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, former White House and agency staffers have moved home and jumped into crowded suburban House primaries, leaning on advice, endorsements and donations from former bosses and colleagues in Obama\u2019s campaigns and two terms in the White House." Full story.   THE AMBASSADOR \u2014 "Brownback appointment could upend Kobach\u2019s gubernatorial run," by Campaign Pro's Daniel Strauss: "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback for an ambassadorship has triggered a domino effect in the race to replace Brownback, one that could set back the ambitions of one of Trump\u2019s key allies on immigration ... Kobach's campaign has not put out a definitive statement about whether he intends to stay in the race, though it did send out an email Monday asking supporters to volunteer for the campaign. The White House is also staying mum on the possibility of Kobach becoming DHS secretary. "I'm not aware of any movements for him, but as always, when we have a personnel announcement, I'll be happy to share it with you," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday ... Kobach\u2019s gubernatorial prospects hinge on whether he can expand his pool of support beyond his established conservative base. He may be the best-known (and most infamous) secretary of state in the country, known for speaking about voter fraud and, more recently, for serving as the vice-chair of Trump\u2019s voter integrity commission."

HEALTH CARE HAVOC \u2014 Democrats try to keep focus on issue as GOP pivots to taxes: Health care is the top issue for 2018 midterm voters in public polling, and Democrats plan to do their best to keep it that way. The DSCC plans to send out press releases today noting every GOP candidate in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Montana, Indiana, West Virginia, Ohio, Missouri and Wisconsin either voted for or is on record supporting the GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. \u201cEvery potential GOP candidate backs a toxic health care agenda that will spike premiums by 20 percent, impose an age tax on older Americans and strip away coverage for pre-existing conditions \u2014 all to give more tax breaks to big insurance companies and the wealthiest few,\u201d DSCC spokesman David Bergstein wrote. \u201cAs this race develops we\u2019re sure to hear exactly what these Republicans don\u2019t like about each other \u2014 but they all agree on an expensive, unpopular health care agenda that will force working families to pay more for less care.\u201d   \u2014 PPP survey finds Heller and GOP health care plan deeply unpopular in Nevada: A new survey from Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, paid for by Save My Care, finds GOP Sen.

She plans to hold a news conference announcing her candidacy Wednesday," the Miami Herald reported. " ... She claimed Curbelo 'has voted more than 86 percent of the time with Trump,' but also insisted: 'I don\u2019t want to focus my entire energy on what\u2019s happening with the president.' The bilingual Mucarsel-Powell, 46, was born in Ecuador, where she lived until she was 14. ... Last month, Mucarsel-Powell discussed her likely candidacy in private Washington meetings with Emily\u2019s List, which promotes progressive women candidates; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Democratic members of Congress, including Florida Reps. Ted Deutch, Lois Frankel and Stephanie Murphy."

Donna Lynne took a big step this week toward running for governor, telling The Denver Post that she would file the necessary paperwork Tuesday to campaign and raise money even though she still hasn\u2019t committed 100 percent toward pursuing Colorado\u2019s top job. It\u2019s an unusual maneuver \u2014 and one that could complicate her plans to succeed her boss, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper. ... Lynne said she\u2019s taking this route for two principal reasons: to be upfront about her intentions as she continues her job as lieutenant governor and to ensure she can consolidate the necessary support to mount a competitive campaign."

Mr. Cuomo is the second possible Democratic presidential contender that the Republican group America Rising PAC has singled out for scrutiny. The other is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is also up for re-election next year and considered a possible 2020 contender ... For now, America Rising is mostly building up its research file on the governor and has filed more than 50 requests of public records so far this year.

Once we win back the House we can have the conversation as to who we\u2019re going to elect as the new Speaker of the House,' Lujn said.

ADMINISTRATION SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cScaramucci's short, wild ride through Trump's White House,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Josh Dawsey, Annie Karni, and Tara Palmeri: \u201cFinancier Anthony Scaramucci came into his new role as White House communications director threatening \u201cto fire everybody.\u201dTen days later, he was pushed out before lunch by John Kelly, the chief of staff who replaced the chief of staff Scaramucci was instrumental in pushing out...The reality, described in interviews by more than a half-dozen administration officials and others close to the White House, was even more complicated. Scaramucci\u2019s arrival in the West Wing six months into Trump\u2019s presidency seemed to herald a return to the visceral and brash New York ways of the campaign\u2014and a rejection of the clubby, more buttoned-up instincts of Republican operatives brought into the administration by Priebus from the RNC.

(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)  Story Continued Below  BIG MONEY \u2014 \u201cSenate GOP outside groups raised $17M in first half of 2017,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Kevin Robillard: \u201cThe main outside groups backing Senate Republicans have nearly $22 million combined in their bank accounts after raising $17 million in the first six months of the year. The massive war chest, raised with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's help, should aid Senate Republicans as they try to win 10 Democratic-held seats in states President Donald Trump won last November, while playing defense for Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC which regularly launches blistering attacks on Democrats in television and digital ads, raised $8.2 million and had $9.6 million on hand as of June 30. One Nation, which promotes GOP policies and Republican senators who back them, raised $8.7 million and had $7 million in its bank account. \u2026 \u2018The pivotal figure in all this has been McConnell,\u2019 [SLF President Steven] Law said. \u2018What most of the major donors have concluded is that Mitch McConnell is the one guy who steers clear of the chaos and focuses on the Republican agenda.\u2019 This year, McConnell has traveled extensively to meet with potential donors and hear their concerns, visiting Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Dallas, Houston, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla.\u201d Full story.   TWO WEEKS OUT \u2014 \u201cMcConnell wages war down South,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Alex Isenstadt: \u201cThe Republican leader is aiming to thwart Rep. Mo Brooks and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore in a special election in Alabama next month. Both men are campaigning against McConnell as a despised symbol of the establishment \u2014 and both would exacerbate his already stiff challenge wrangling his GOP Conference. \u2026 His super PAC is set to spend much as $8 million to boost his favored candidate, recently-appointed Republican Sen. Luther Strange. McConnell has activated his sprawling donor network and pressed the White House for more resources. \u2026 And in a highly unusual step, one of the McConnell\u2019s top political lieutenants has begun quietly advising a long-shot Republican primary candidate running for Brooks\u2019 House seat. The move is designed to get in the congressman\u2019s head and dissuade him from emptying his campaign war chest \u2026 This past week, Brooks, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he would not vote for McConnell as majority leader and called for him to step down after the failure of the health care bill. Moore, who rose to national fame after he refused to obey a federal order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from an Alabama judicial building, made his feelings clear about the leader in a lengthy fundraising appeal with the subject line, \u2018You & Me vs Mitch McConnell.\u2019\u201d Full story.   \u2014 FIRST IN SCORE \u2014 SLF attacks Brooks on Trump, war funding: A new ad from Senate Leadership Fund features Alabamans attacking Brooks in a series of direct-to-camera interviews. \u201cMo Brooks said we can\u2019t trust Donald Trump. You know what I don\u2019t trust? Career politicians like Mo Brooks,\u201d a woman says to start the ad off. The ad then pivots to Brooks\u2019 votes against continuing resolutions, with military veterans accusing Brooks of \u201cvoting to cut off funding to fight ISIS.\u201d \u201cMo Brooks didn\u2019t have my back, and he won\u2019t be getting my vote,\u201d one of the veterans says. Watch the ad here.   2020 WATCH \u2014 \u201cHow 2018 became the new 2020,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cTop contenders are making endorsements, picking sides in party primaries and aggressively working the fundraising circuit on behalf of 2018 candidates, all the while building their own name recognition. \u2026 The early focus on the midterms is a marked departure from previous practice and a further acceleration of the presidential campaign cycle. Prior to the 2016 presidential primary season, for example, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders largely stayed off the campaign trail and out of elections until late 2014 \u2014 roughly six months before they officially announced their campaigns. \u2026 Booker has been especially active \u2014 his travel itinerary reads like an atlas of at-risk Democratic incumbents. He\u2019s raised money for grateful colleagues in Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Montana and Michigan, among others, according to Democrats familiar with the itinerary. \u2026 Warren, a fundraising juggernaut, has made several California fundraising stops, including one in San Francisco where the Massachusetts senator joined Esprit founder Susie Tompkins Buell, a high-level party donor and close Clinton friend. Another gave Warren face time with Oakland Athletics part-owner Guy Saperstein, who in 2016 offered Warren $1 million to run for president.\u201d Full story.   \u2014 \u201cWhat is John Delaney thinking?\u201d by Campaign Pro's Kevin Robillard: \u201cDelaney, whose district stretches from some of Maryland\u2019s wealthiest D.C. suburbs to rural counties bordering West Virginia, thinks his combination of private and public sector experience, and his faith in both, are the answer. His campaign motto, at least for now, is \u2018Focus on the Future.\u2019 And Delaney is planning a campaign focused on problems caused by globalization, automation and technology, issues he says are getting ignored in a hopeless national political conversation. \u2018You need a villain in politics,\u2019 Delaney said in an interview. \u2018My villain is partisan politics. It\u2019s destroying our ability to govern.\u2019\u201d Full story.   Days until the 2017 election: 99.  Days until the 2018 election: 463.  Thanks for joining us.

Can his family endure one last campaign?,\u201d by the Washington Post\u2019s Roxane Roberts in Rehoboth Beach, Del.: \u201cThe new house is on the edge of Cape Henlopen State Park, just north of the boardwalk: three stories, six bedrooms, three fireplaces and an expansive view of the Atlantic Ocean. The new owners are Joe and Jill Biden, rich for the first time in their lives, thanks to a three-book publishing deal \u2014 two by him, one by her \u2014 that allowed them to purchase the $2 million vacation home in this beachiest of beach towns. \u2026 Since Joe left public life in January, the Bidens have never been more public. The past six months have seen the formation of the Biden Foundation, a way for Joe and Jill to support their pet causes, and the Biden Cancer Initiative to honor Beau. The University of Pennsylvania inaugurated the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement to study international issues, and the University of Delaware the Biden Institute for domestic initiatives. Last \u2014 but not least \u2014 there\u2019s a new political action committee, American Possibilities, a vehicle for raising money for Democratic candidates. \u2026 With Washington in chaos and the Democrats without a standard-bearer, Joe Biden is arguably the most popular former vice president in history.\u201d Full story.  EARLY POLLING DATA \u2014 \u201cPoll shows Mike DeWine still up big in name ID, favorability,\u201d by Cleveland.com\u2019s Seth A. Richardson: \u201cThe poll [of the Ohio Governor\u2019s race] shared with cleveland.com was paid for by the American Freedom Builders and administered by the Washington-based Tarrance Group. The results have DeWine leading Secretary of State Jon Husted, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor and U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. However, DeWine's favorability slipped 10 points from a similar poll in January. DeWine's favorable-unfavorable split was 61-20. That's a dip from the January poll that showed him with a 71 percent favorable rating.\u201d Full story.  PAC HEAT \u2014 "Pence raises $1M for his leadership PAC," CNN's Elizabeth Landers reports: "Vice President Mike Pence raised a cool $1 million for his leadership PAC on Tuesday evening during a summer soire in Washington, according to a source close to Pence. The source told CNN that the event attracted more than 100 lawmakers, including members of the leadership in both the House and Senate. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy were among those who attended after a successful vote for the Republicans earlier that day on health care. The President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, made a guest appearance to introduce the vice president at the event." Full story.  HACK JOB \u2014 \u201cHackers descend on Las Vegas to expose voting machine flaws,\u201d by Kevin Collier in Las Vegas: \u201c[Carten] Schurman, a professor of computer science at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, used a laptop\u2019s Wi-Fi connection Friday to gain access to the type of voting machine that Fairfax County, Virginia, used until just two years ago. Nearby, other would-be hackers took turns trying to poke into a simulated election computer network resembling the one used by Cook County, Illinois. \u2026 They were among the hundreds of cybersecurity experts who descended on \u2018Voting Village,\u2019 one of the most talked-about features of the annual DEF CON hacker conference. In a cramped conference room, they took turns over three days cracking into 10 examples of voting machines and voter registration systems \u2014 a reminder, they say, of the risks awaiting upcoming U.S. elections.\u201d Full story.  THE NEXT FIGHT \u2014 \u201cMajor GOP-aligned group pledges to spend millions on tax reform fight,\u201d by McClatchy\u2019s Katie Glueck: American Action Network \u201cexpects to spend as much as $20 million on a pro-tax reform effort dubbed the \u2018Middle Class Growth Initiative,\u2019 AAN told McClatchy. The program will promote tax cuts for \u2018working families and small businesses,\u2019 as well as a reformed tax code "that will be simpler, fairer and pro-growth," according to the organization. As part of the effort, AAN is pledging to spend $5 million in August alone, and is kicking off the initiative with a $1 million member-specific radio ad buy slated to run in 34 congressional districts, from Rep. Carlos Curbelo's Miami-area district to Rep. Mark Meadows' North Carolina seat to Rep. David Valadao's in California's Central Valley.\u201d Full story.

John Delaney (D-Md.) plans on bypassing runs for governor and reelection and has told associates he is seriously considering a bid for president in 2020, according to two Democratic sources. Five Democratic sources in the state said buzz about the Delaney's intentions for 2018 and 2020 has been building for weeks, with increasing chatter about a presidential bid. Delaney, who could self-fund a run for governor, will skip a challenge against popular GOP Gov. Larry Hogan. He will also leave Democrats to defend his district, which he nearly lost in 2014. Democrats in the state believe he will announce his plans in a Washington Post op-ed on Friday. ... A presidential bid would seem quixotic: Delaney is little-known even among Democratic operatives, and his moderate stances and background in finance don't match a left-leaning Democratic primary electorate.\u201d Full story.  IN THE DETAILS \u2014 "Johnson Amendment changes moving through House, with all sides watching warily," by Campaign Pro's Maggie Severns: "Free speech proponents, campaign finance watchdogs and religious leaders are all closely watching an appropriations rider that would chip away at rules barring churches from participating in politics, divided not only by their politics but by whether the rider would have any effect at all. The language, tucked into a House appropriations bill that recently passed out of committee, strikes at the Johnson Amendment, which bars nonprofits from endorsing or opposing candidates and spending money in elections. President Donald Trump promised to undo the amendment on the campaign trail, but to do so would take an act of Congress. Trump signed an executive order this year that mostly symbolically addressed the issue by instructing the IRS to not take action against churches that take political positions. Full story.  CASH RACE \u2014 \u201cSenate Majority PAC raised $4.5M in first half of 2017,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Kevin Robillard: \u201cSenate Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC controlled by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, raised $4.6 million in the first six months of 2017, its fastest-ever fundraising start at the beginning of an election cycle. The super PAC has spent little, and ended June with $4.5 million in the bank. Senate Majority PAC is expected to play a major role in Senate Democrats' defensive effort in 2018, when ten Democratic senators are facing reelection in states President Donald Trump won last November. In five of those states \u2014 Indiana, West Virginia, Montana, North Dakota and Missouri \u2014 Trump won by more than 10 percentage points.\u201d Full story.

STAFFING UP \u2014 Buckeye Battle PAC adds top operatives: Buckeye Battle PAC, a pro-Mike Gibbons super PAC, has brought on a pair of veteran Republican operatives, Gentry Collins and Eric Woolson. According to the press release announcing the hires: \u201cGentry Collins joins as the senior political advisor, overseeing strategy and coalitions. During the 2010 election cycle, Collins served as the national political director at the Republican National Committee, tasked with building get-out-the-vote infrastructure nationwide. Under his direction the Republican Party made more volunteer voter contacts than any other cycle in history. The unprecedented ground game in 2010 played a major role in returning a Republican majority to Congress ... Eric Woolson joins Buckeye Battle PAC as the director of communications. Woolson is a former communications director for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who was recently confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to China. Best known for managing former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign to a stunning victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, he has served in communications roles for six presidential candidates, numerous state and federal candidates and at three Republican National Conventions.\u201d  ON DEFENSE \u2014 \u201cPelosi defends Brady amid campaign investigation,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Heather Caygle: \u201cHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is defending Rep. \u000a \u000a  Bob Brady\u000a  amid a federal probe into allegations his campaign illegally paid a primary challenger to drop out in 2012. The investigation came to light this week after Carolyn Cavaness, a former campaign manager and fianc of Jimmie Moore, Brady's 2012 challenger, pleaded guilty for her role in helping illegally transfer $90,000 from the lawmaker's campaign coffers to Moore. Pelosi said she has confidence in Brady, who has served in the chamber for nearly two decades and is the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee.\u201d Full story.  CHANGE OF TUNE \u2014 \u201cAs Democrats Lay Into Trump, Cuomo Takes a Different Tack,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Shane Goldmacher: \u201cDonald Trump may be the two most potent words in Democratic politics, but Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, has spent much of the last six months going out of his way to avoid them. Nearly as soon as Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Cuomo began dancing around invoking the president\u2019s name on the stump, skirting attacks in print and sidestepping reporters\u2019 questions about the president. As the Democratic Party\u2019s watchword in 2017 has become \u2018resist,\u2019 Mr. Cuomo, who has garnered attention as a possible presidential candidate in 2020, has instead opted to coexist.\u201d Full story.  POLLING DATA \u2014 Alabama Senate poll shows Strange with lead: A poll from the Raycom News Network and Strategy Research gives Sen. Luther Strange a narrow lead of likely registered voters in the Republican primary. Former Chief Justice Roy Moore is right on his heels with 33 percent and Rep. Mo Brooks has 16 percent, per WBRC. The IVR poll was in the field on July 34 and surveyed 3,000 registered voters with a margin of error of +/- 2 percent.  STEPPING UP \u2014 \u201cNext Kansas governor would be a surgeon, Brownback loyalist,\u201d by the Associated Press\u2019s John Hanna: \u201cJeff Colyer is preparing to become Kansas' next governor after nearly a decade helping fellow conservative Republicans shape health care policy and serving as a loyal lieutenant governor and plastic surgeon, who squeezed in medical relief missions to disaster and war zones. Colyer would be elevated when his two-term running mate, GOP Gov. Sam Brownback, resigns to become President Donald Trump's ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom. \u2026 Colyer would serve the remainder of Brownback's term, which ends in January 2019. The 57-year-old Colyer already was seen as a potential Republican candidate for governor next year because Brownback was term-limited. He was often the administration's spokesman on health issues and served in the Legislature before first running on Brownback's ticket in 2010.\u201d Full story.  ONLINE FUNDRAISING BONANZA \u2014 \u201cDemocratic 'nominee funds' top $100K in 12 districts,\u201d via Campaign Pro\u2019s Scott Bland: \u201cDemocratic small-dollar donors have already poured over $100,000 into escrow funds for the eventual nominee in 12 GOP-held battleground House districts, according to a new tool launched by Swing Left, one of the prominent groups raising money into such funds. Swing Left has launched a leaderboard tool to track district-by-district fundraising by its donors, and to give activists a platform to launch their own fundraising efforts. The tool includes the combined total with other groups, like ActBlue, that have also set up online \u2018nominee funds\u2019 that will flow to Democratic primary winners next year.\u201d Full story.

It's already clear he's a lot more than that. In the span of six days, he has launched a brutally edged campaign to identify White House leakers, threatened to "fire everybody" in the communications shop, and has declared war on chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. Scaramucci, who boasted that he reports directly to President Donald Trump, has described his role as "fixing the place," said one person who spoke with him this week. And he's wasting no time. In a vulgar interview with The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza on Wednesday night, Scaramucci laced into Priebus for trying to \u2018c--- block\u2019 him from a job in the White House, called him a \u2018f------ paranoid schizophrenic,\u2019 and questioned Bannon's loyalty. \u2018I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c---,\u2019 he said.\u201d Full story.

So far, though, House Democratic leaders have adopted a more hands-off approach than in years past as hundreds of candidates across the country flood into potential battleground races. Operatives said that House Democrats\u2019 somewhat laissez-faire attitude is explained by the \u2018embarrassment of riches\u2019 when it comes to the volume of candidates interested in running this cycle, said John Lapp, a Democratic media strategist and former DCCC executive director. ...The committee still has favorites in some seats \u2014 and may signal more in the future. DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Lujan donated to six challengers in the first half of 2017 via his leadership PAC, in an array of districts with unusual primaries, long-shot contenders or particularly notable candidates. But strategists and other observers say the effort to clear primary fields and anoint nominees has been much less aggressive in the early stages of the 2018 election cycle than in past years.\u201d Full story.

Messer\u2019s short Twitter missive \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re in!\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t include the traditional announcement video or many details, indicating there\u2019s probably more to come at Messer\u2019s annual family BBQ on August 12. But Messer did reveal his slogan: \u201cI Like Luke.\u201d  \u2014 The Rokita campaign is working hard to claim the momentum. They released a poll hours after Messer\u2019s entrance into the race showing Rokita leading him 28 percent to 20 percent in a head-to-head matchup, and with a similar lead among a larger field. (Messer had released polling last week showing the pair tied.) And that poll comes a day after a memo from Rokita general consultant Tim Edson arguing Messer is overly reliant on PAC money that will dry up not long after he enters a race against an incumbent Senator. And that memo came after news Rokita massively outraised Messer in the second quarter, which came after a series of hits on Messer\u2019s wife\u2019s high-paid legal work for an Indianapolis suburb and other stories highlighting Messer\u2019s home in McLean, Va.   GETTING IN, PART DEUX \u2014 Nicholson starts Wisconsin field: Iraq and Afghanistan veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson is the first Republican to enter the field to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin after trucking heiress Nicole Schneider and Rep. Sean Duffy both opted against running. Nicholson has obvious appeals: He\u2019s a veteran with no voting record and graduate degrees from Harvard and Dartmouth. But he has one obvious negative: He was president of the College Democrats of America and spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention.   \u2014 Nicholson\u2019s announcement video, which covers his impressive biography, hints at how he\u2019ll handle the College Democrat attacks. \u201cIn my younger days, I was a Democrat. I used to do nothing and know everything,\u201d he says in the 3-minute long video. \u201cBut since then, we\u2019ve had three kids, fought in two wars and worked in businesses around the world. And after you\u2019ve been hit in the face with that much reality, you can not help but become a strong conservative.\u201d Watch it here.   \u2014 Will the Club for Growth endorse Nicholson? The group issued a statement \u201cwelcoming\u201d him to the race. Nicholson already has a super PAC seeded with $3.5 million from GOP superdonor Richard Uihlein, and the Club could provide additional cash for a primary. \u201cThis is the most important development of today,\u201d an advisor close to Nicholson said. \u201cDick Uihlein and the Club for Growth in a primary are a force that alone can match any self-funder dollar for dollar.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Uihlein has donated to the Club for Growth in the past. The self-funder would presumably be 2012 GOP primary runner-up Eric Hovde. State Sen. Leah Vukmir is also considering the race, and has already questioned Nicholson\u2019s conservatism..   BAWITDABA \u2013 Kid Rock launches voter registration nonprofit, says he\u2019s still exploring Senate bid: Kid Rock is continuing to look at a Senate bid in his home state of Michigan, he wrote in a post that went up at midnight, and is starting a voter registration nonprofit in the meantime. \u201cThe one thing I've seen over and over is that although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have over a year left until an actual election, so my first order of business is to get people engaged and registered to vote while continuing to put out my ideas on ways to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians.\u201d But he also notes Democrats \u201care 'shattin\u2019 in their pantaloons' right now\u201d and says he\u2019ll hold a press conference sometime in the next six weeks to discuss a potential bid.

ON THE HILL \u2014 \u201c'Skinny' Obamacare repeal still lacks votes to pass,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim: \u201cEven a bare-bones repeal of Obamacare is no sure thing in the Senate. A handful of key Republican senators who had spurned earlier overtures from GOP leadership endorsed the latest plan to gut Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer coverage mandates and its medical device tax. But several centrists said they\u2019re undecided on the so-called skinny repeal, leaving the GOP in limbo through at least the end of the week.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 \u201cHeller defends health care vote amid Democratic attacks,\u201d via POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett: \u201cDemocrats are escalating their attacks on Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller for voting to open debate on Obamacare repeal and signaling support for a trimmed-down repeal bill. But Heller, who faces a tough reelection contest next year, says he is at peace with his decisions. ...In an interview on Wednesday, Heller said he is satisfied with how he has handled the grueling health care debate, which includes standing with Gov. Brian Sandoval to lash proposed cuts to Medicaid, getting needled by President Donald Trump in front of other colleagues and then aiding Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in moving forward on the repeal effort.\u201d Full story.  DAILY WAR EAGLE \u2014 Not gonna happen, Mo: An odd turn in the Alabama senate race: Rep. Mo Brooks said he\u2019d withdraw from the race\u2014if everyone else did so too, so that the beleaguered Jeff Sessions could get his old seat back. Brooks, in a statement: \u201cIf all Republican candidates collectively agree to simultaneously withdraw from this race, then we clear the way for the Republican Party of Alabama to nominate Jeff Sessions to be the Republican nominee for the December 12, 2017 general election. He can return to the Senate where he has served us so well. President can then appoint whomever he wants as Attorney General.\u201d He also called the president\u2019s treatment of Sessions a \u201cpublic waterboarding of one of the great people Alabama has ever produced.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 Brooks goes after Trump in radio interview: In a radio interview this morning, Brooks previewed his pro-Sessions stance and criticized President Donald Trump. He immediately pronounced he was \u201cdisappointed and chagrined with what what\u2019s happening with Jeff Sessions and President Trump right now.\u201d Asked about his pre-election criticisms of Trump, Brooks declares: \u201cIt looks like a lot of the reservations I had are turning out to be prophetic.\u201d He later says Trump hasn\u2019t been helpful during the Obamacare repeal process, and refuses to say he has confidence in the president. Listen here.   OOPS \u2014 \u201cWatchdogs Say Cuomo Is Skirting Campaign Finance Rules,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Brian Rosenthal: \u201cAt the end of a video promoting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s immigration policies, a disclaimer noted the advertisement\u2019s funding source: an obscure anti-discrimination group called New Yorkers United Together. The fledgling group, which has financed only the one online video, claims it has no ties to any politician. Two of the group\u2019s co-founders said in interviews that the governor had nothing to do with the ad, other than agreeing to appear in it alongside several celebrities. But a closer examination shows otherwise. \u2026 To government watchdogs, the connections are evidence that Mr. Cuomo is again skirting campaign finance rules by using a secretive nonprofit to advance his agenda.\u201d Full story.  FROM THE COURTROOM \u2014 \u201cLawyers for Brady, rival rebut claims of illegal campaign payoff,\u201d by The Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Jeremy Roebuck, Chris Brennan and Tricia L. Nadolny: \u201cU.S. Rep. Robert Brady\u2019s lawyer pushed back Wednesday against federal prosecutors\u2019 claims that the congressman secretly paid a political rival $90,000 to drop a bid to unseat him in the 2012 Democratic primary. Scoffing at the depiction of the money as a covert payoff, attorney James Eisenhower said that the funds were intended in part to acquire exclusive rights to valuable polling data from the primary challenger, Municipal Court Judge Jimmie Moore.\u201d Full story.   PELOSI, PELOSI, PELOSI \u2014 \u201cVoter by voter, GOP super PAC tries to separate the party from Trump,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel: \u201c...The CLF\u2019s multimillion-dollar campaign, unfolding this year in 20 targeted districts and expanding next year to 30, is an ambitious bet that the Republican House majority can be spared from midterm backlash over President Trump. If it works, each endangered Republican will be reintroduced to voters as a post-partisan who delivers on their key issues; each Democratic challenger will be framed as a vote for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to snatch back the speaker\u2019s gavel while empowering an anti-Trump \u2018resistance\u2019 that only wants to wreck the country.\u201d Full story.   ICYMI \u2014 Facebook donates $500,000 to 'secure elections' from meddling, via POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Scola: \u201cFacebook is contributing half a million dollars to getting off the ground a new Harvard project aimed at combating digital interference in democratic elections, the tech company said today.\u201d Full story.  CODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on casting.\u201d \u2014 An ABC spokeswoman, asked to comment on the possibility that "Dancing with the Stars" is trying to recruit former press secretary Sean Spicer, POLITICO reported.   Elena Schneider is a campaign pro reporter for POLITICO, where she focuses on House and Senate races. Before joining the 2016 politics team, Schneider was a news assistant and freelancer for the New York Times\u2019 D.C. bureau.

(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)  Story Continued Below  VOTE-A-RAMA \u2014 \u201cHow the GOP brought Obamacare repeal back from the dead,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett, Seung Min Kim and Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201cAs \u000a \u000a  Mitch McConnell\u000a  strode to the Senate floor on Tuesday, with no votes to spare to keep the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal campaign alive, he knew where everyone in his conference stood. Everyone, that is, except for Ron Johnson. The ornery Wisconsinite had been needling the Senate majority leader for weeks, accusing McConnell of a \u2018breach of trust\u2019 in selling a health care plan to his caucus. So when Johnson sprinted to the Capitol basement after a party lunch for a meeting with FBI director nominee Christopher Wray, just as a critical procedural vote got underway, Republicans had no idea where he would land, said a person who knows the senator well. ...But Tuesday\u2019s dramatic roll call \u2014 capped by Sen. John McCain\u2019s return to Washington less than a week after a cancer diagnosis and a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 allows President Donald Trump and his fractured party to continue their long-shot campaign to scuttle the Democratic health care law they\u2019ve spent seven years railing against.\u201d Full story.  ICYMI \u2014 DSCC launches Nevada, Arizona Pandora ads ahead of health votes: The DSCC has launched digital radio ads against GOP Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake ahead of today's vote on debating Obamacare repeal. The ads, made by Ralston Lapp, are running on Pandora radio and are targeting "key elements of the midterm electorate \u2014 including persuadable voters, seniors and women," the DSCC said. Heller and Flake are considered to be the two most vulnerable Senate Republicans in 2018, and the ads aim to remind voters of their history of voting to repeal Obamacare no matter which way they vote today. Full story.  \u2014 POLLING DATA \u2014 Titus internal poll shows tight Nevada Senate race: Democratic Rep. \u000a \u000a  Dina Titus\u000a  released an internal poll that found her in a dead heat against GOP Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada, signaling that she\u2019s still considering the race and not quietly stepping aside for former Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s preferred Democratic candidate, Rep. Jacky Rosen. In a general election head-to-head, Heller has 47 percent to Titus\u2019s 45 percent, per the poll. It also showed Titus with strength in Washoe County, a bellwether county where Titus trails by one point. The memo didn\u2019t share data on the primary race, but Titus told The Nevada Independent that she felt \u201cconfident\u201d she\u2019d win a primary against Rosen. Anzalone Liszt Grove Research conducted the 600-person telephone poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points. Read the full memo here.   COMING ATTRACTIONS \u2014 Messer finance chair promises 'exciting news' Wednesday: \u201cIndiana Rep.

IN THE STATES \u2014 The DNC is pouring $1.5 million and top staffers into the Virginia gubernatorial race to bolster Ralph Northam, NBC News reports. \u201cIn addition to doubling the number of paid field organizers in the state, the money will be used to beef up the party\u2019s operations in the state, including training, digital and tech. [DNC Chairman Tom] Perez is also sending three of his top political aides, including Chief of Staff Sam Cornale, DNC Political and Organizing Director Amanda Brown Lierman, and DNC political adviser Ramsey Reid, who ran get-out-the-vote operations for the Virginia Democratic Coordinated Campaign in 2016.\u201d Yesterday in Score, we reported that the RGA donated $2 million to Ed Gillespie\u2019s campaign, on top of the $1 million they had already donated.  \u2014 \u201cDeSantis-aligned super PAC gets familiar new head as gubernatorial rumors swirl,\u201d by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Matt Dixon: \u201cIn another sign that Rep. Ron DeSantis is considering a run for governor in 2018, the state and federal fundraising committees tied to the two-term Republican congressman are now both headed by the same person. Erika Alba, an attorney in Foley & Lardner's Jacksonville office, is in charge of Fighting for Florida's Future, a super PAC that raised $1.2 million in support of DeSantis' 2016 run for Senate, according to a recent filing with the FEC. The super PAC was led by Nelson Warfield, a longtime GOP consultant no longer involved with the committee.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 \u201cKennedy quietly reversed Illinois tax break request,\u201d by POLITICO Illinois\u2019 Natasha Korecki: \u201cDemocrat Chris Kennedy has made Illinois property taxes \u2014 among the highest in the nation \u2014 a focus of his campaign for governor. He's railed against an appeal system that he has likened to \u2018extortion\u2019 for kicking lucrative tax breaks to politically connected insiders with high-powered lawyers. But even as Kennedy took to social media and forums to complain about a \u2018rigged system,\u2019 he was actively pursuing a second property tax appeal of his own \u2014 asking for a 20 percent reduction for his personal home in the Chicago suburb of Kenilworth. Kennedy then quietly withdrew his appeal request, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO, seven days after a story surfaced that was critical of property tax reductions won by his chief primary opponent, billionaire J.B. Pritzker.\u201d Full story.  THE END OF THE CASE, OR THE BEGINNING? \u2014 \u201cWoman pleads guilty in scheme to pay off Brady challenger,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Josh Gerstein: \u201cA Pennsylvania pastor pled guilty to a federal felony Tuesday for participating in a scheme that led a challenger to Rep. Robert Brady (D-Pa.) to bow out of a 2012 primary contest. Appearing in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, Rev. Carolyn Cavaness pled guilty to a single charge of making a false statement in a federal proceeding, court records show. Cavaness was a campaign staffer for Jimmie Moore, a Philadelphia judge who entered the Democratic primary against Brady. ... No charges have been announced against Moore or Brady. However, one court filing made public Tuesday indicates prosecutors believe Brady attempted to influence the testimony of at least one witness in the investigation.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 Via the Philadelphia Inquirer's Jeremy Roebuck and Chris Brennan: "Reached for comment after the filings were unsealed late Tuesday, Brady referred a reporter to Ken Smukler, his longtime political consultant. 'You have to talk to Kenny,' Brady said. 'They did all that. That\u2019s five years ago. I don\u2019t remember none of that.' Asked if his campaign sent Moore\u2019s campaign $90,000 to pay debts, Brady said: 'Whatever they did, I don\u2019t know.'" Full story.  TIMELINES \u2014 \u201cHovde says no decision, despite move to end committee,\u201d by the Associated Press: \u201cHovde said Monday that paperwork filing with the Federal Elections Commission earlier this month indicating he plan to close the \u2018Hovde for Senate\u2019 campaign committee was just clean up work from the 2012 campaign. Hovde says he's still considering whether to get into the race next year and won't make a decision until after his youngest daughter leaves for college later in August.\u201d Full story.  READING LIST \u2014 \u201cSenator Jeff Flake, Facing Twin Threats, Is Said to Take On G.O.P. Rift in New Book,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Alexander Burns: \u201cSenator \u000a \u000a  Jeff Flake\u000a , Republican of Arizona, faces political challenges from both sides in seeking re-election next year: On the left, emboldened Democrats are aggressively recruiting candidates to run against him. On the right, allies of President Trump are devising ways to punish Mr. Flake for his outspoken rejection of Mr. Trump last year. Yet Mr. Flake, seemingly undaunted, has secretly planned an unconventional campaign kickoff that risks intensifying both threats: Working privately, and largely without the knowledge of political advisers, he has written a book that amounts to an ideological manifesto for his own version of conservatism, according to three people briefed on the manuscript who discussed it on the condition of anonymity.\u201d Full story.  AIR WAR \u2014 Gillespie launches television ads in Virginia: \u201cVirginia Republican Ed Gillespie has launched the first three television ads of the general election in the state's governor's race. All are positive ads focusing either on his biography or his plans to improve the state's economy.\u201d Watch the ads here, here and here. Full story.   \u2014 Ohio Senate candidate Gibbons releases first TV ad: \u201cOhio Republican Mike Gibbons' Senate campaign released its first statewide TV ad today, attacking "career politicians" for failing to repeal Obamacare and cut taxes.\u201d Watch the ad here. Full story.  PERSONNEL CHANGES \u2014 IMGE, IJR split, adds staff: Phil Musser, IMGE\u2019s CEO who co-founded the Independent Journalism Review, announced to staff in an email that he bought IMGE from MGA Holdings, splitting off from the conservative website. \u201cThis was long in the works, and will allow us to pursue our dreams, and IJR to pursue theirs without the worry of conflicts of interest,\u201d Musser wrote. IMGE also brought on new personnel, including former NRCC executive director Liesl Hickey as a strategic partner and Phil Cox, who runs the bipartisan public affairs firm 50 State, as a senior adviser.   CODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cTrust me. Do you know why he challenged you to a duel? \u2018Cause you could beat the s\u2014 out of him.\u201d \u2014 Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed to Maine Sen. Susan Collins, referring to GOP Rep. Blake Farenthold\u2019s comments that he would challenge Collins to a duel, if she were a man, The Washington Post reported.

Mo Brooks is the center of attention \u2014 and not the good kind of attention \u2014 with three weeks to go until Alabama's special Senate primaries. Sen. Luther Strange and his allies have singled Brooks out of the crowded Republican primary to complete Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Senate term, highlighting inconsistencies in his record and airing ads making Brooks out as a flip-flopper and an opponent of President Donald Trump \u2014 a cardinal sin among Alabama Republican voters. One would be forgiven for thinking Brooks was Strange's only opponent given the intense blast of news, TV ads and other attacks targeting the congressman. But it's a reflection of the theory that while former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore's supporters are fairly locked in, Brooks is the other main competitor for a slot in a September top-two primary runoff, and one of Strange or Brooks is considered most likely to miss out.\u201d Full story.   \u2014 ICYMI \u2014 \u201cBrooks defends campaign ad on Scalise shooting,\u201d by Campaign Pro\u2019s Daniel Strauss: \u201cAlabama Rep. Mo Brooks on Monday defended a new ad from his Senate campaign that used footage of the aftermath of the shooting rampage that wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise last month. Brooks, who is running in the Aug. 15 special Republican primary for Senate in Alabama, told POLITICO that the ad, which features sounds of gunshots and shouts before playing clips of a Brooks interview, was meant to highlight his support for the Second Amendment. ... But Scalise's chief of staff, Brett Horton, tweeted that the spot made his \u2018stomach turn,\u2019 as Brooks faced criticism for politicizing a tragedy.\u201d Full story.  IDENTITY ISSUES \u2014 \u201cDemocrats sidestep social issues in new economic push,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Heather Caygle and Elana Schor in Berryville, Va.: \u201cCongressional Democratic leaders descended upon this rural Virginia town Monday to unveil a progressive economic package they say can win back working-class voters next November, even in red states. And noticeably missing, amid the talk of raising wages and reining in corporate interests, were the left-leaning stances on social issues that help form the backbone of the party, including immigration, abortion and LGBT rights. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) vowed that his party's red-state incumbents would largely embrace the new agenda \u2014 which, he acknowledged, purposefully avoids the social issues that have already opened a rift this year between the party's liberal base and centrist bloc.\u201d Full story.   ON THE HILL \u2014 \u201cMcCain to make dramatic return for Obamacare vote,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett, Seung Min Kim and Jennifer Haberkorn: \u201cThe Senate GOP bid to kill Obamacare \u2014 itself left for dead as of Monday morning \u2014 saw a flicker of life late in the day after a furious pressure campaign by President Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell heading into a critical Tuesday vote. McConnell spent the day cajoling his members and meeting with Vice President Mike Pence to plot strategy. The majority leader was still short of the votes to even open debate, and Republicans still don't know what they'd be voting to allow debate on if they agree to go along with McConnell on the procedural vote. But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), recently diagnosed with brain cancer and recovering from surgery, announced that he would return to the Senate on Tuesday, giving GOP leaders a critical vote in the up-and-down battle over repealing Obamacare. But the Senate leader isn't being counted out.\u201d Full story.  Days until the 2017 election: 104.  Days until the 2018 election: 468.  Thanks for joining us.

But what about 2020?\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Ben Terris: \u201c...\u2018It\u2019s not out of the question that in 2020, if nothing changes, Democrats could win the popular vote by 5 million and lose the electoral college because of the Great Lakes states,\u2019 Brown said. So, because many of his constituents voted for Trump \u2014 and, frankly, because it seemed like a good reelection strategy \u2014 Brown\u2019s first instinct was to work with the president. ...He certainly is one of the Senate\u2019s most endangered Democrats. And if he loses, it could be the last anyone will hear from Sen. Sherrod Brown. But, if he wins ... \u2018We are constantly being asked by others if he\u2019ll run for president in 2020,\u201d Schultz said. \u2018In a way that we never have before.\u2019\u201d Full story.

Among first-term lawmakers in the chamber who will likely run for re-election next year, Democrats have taken in, on average, about 50 percent more in receipts per member than Republicans, according to a Roll Call analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. The margin between the two parties was largest during the first quarter of the year, when Democrats raised an average of $348,000 per freshman member, compared to $226,000 among Republicans. The disparity shrank slightly in the second quarter, but Democrats kept a sizable advantage.\u201d Full story.  \u2014 The RGA is donating another $2 million to Republican Ed Gillespie\u2019s campaign in Virginia: The cash infusion follows $1 million delivered to the campaign shortly after he won the GOP primary.   \u2014 POLLING DATA \u2014 Monmouth poll finds Gillespie 44, Northam 44: \u201cDemocratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie are tied in the latest poll of Virginia's race for governor, with President Donald Trump dragging voters away from the Republican, according to a new survey from Monmouth University. Northam and Gillespie each earned 44 percent of the vote in the survey. Libertarian Cliff Hyra got 3 percent and 9 percent were undecided.\u201d Full story.   FUNNY BEDFELLOWS \u2014 First Family lawyer keeps donating to Democrats: Jamie Gorelick, a Democratic lawyer who is representing Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump (and getting some grief from Democratic friends for doing so), has continued to donate to a handful of congressional Democrats in 2017, even as those candidates heavily criticize the Trump administration. Gorelick gave $1,000 to one House candidate, Lindsey Davis Stover, who\u2019s running to take on GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia. Gorelick also gave to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Montana Sen. Jon Tester.   SHOW-ME SHOWDOWN? \u2014 \u201cMissouri state rep eyes run against McCaskill after encouragement from Wagner,\u201d by the Kansas City Star\u2019s Bryan Lowry: \u201cMissouri state Rep. Marsha Haefner says she\u2019s weighing a run for U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s seat after being encouraged by U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner. Haefner, a St. Louis Republican, said she plans to travel to Washington, D.C., in the near future to meet with national party officials about her interest in a run. \u2018I would hope that the Republican Party would support someone who is not a white male,\u2019 said Haefner, a 66-year-old grandmother who owns a greenhouse and garden center. \u2026 Haefner had been planning to run for Wagner\u2019s congressional seat if Wagner had pursued a run against McCaskill, the incumbent Democrat, as most political observers in Missouri expected.\u201d Full story.   ADMINISTRATION SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cTrump tests the loyalty of the Ohio Democrats he won,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni: \u201cDown-and-out Youngstown, Ohio, last year became emblematic of the power of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. With his populist message targeting white working-class voters, he outperformed every GOP nominee since Richard Nixon won the Democratic stronghold of Mahoning County. Today, the blue-collar town represents one of the looming challenges of Trump\u2019s presidency, six months in: how to keep the support he won as a populist candidate, when he flipped disgruntled Democrats and independents to his side of the ledger, while in many cases governing like a plutocrat who has so far failed to deliver on many of his campaign promises. Trump will test the waters Tuesday night when he takes the stage in Youngstown at the Covelli Centre, a large arena that typically hosts events like ice hockey games, WWE wrestling matches, and monster truck tours. The campaign rally is designed to energize the president, excite his base, and offer Trump a chance to tack away from the Russia scandal that never stops brewing in Washington \u2014 one that his advisers claim no regular, outside-the-beltway Americans really care about.\u201d Full story.    CODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cWho the hell wants to speak about politics when I\u2019m in front of the Boy Scouts?\u201d \u2014 President Trump, who later talked about politics, POLITICO reported.

(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)  Story Continued Below  WOOF \u2014 \u201cBlue Dogs eye comeback in 2018,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Heather Caygle: \u201cThe Blue Dog Coalition, a fading wing of the Democratic Caucus in recent years, is leaning on a controversial ally as it tries to gain a toehold of power back to regain a toehold on power in the House: President Donald Trump. The group of moderate and conservative Democrats, which was all but wiped out when Republicans swept the House in 2010, has been slowly rebuilding its membership. And with Democrats eager to woo the white working-class voters who flocked to Trump, the coalition is prodding party leaders to support Blue Dog-backed candidates, saying that\u2019s the key to taking back the House in 2018. It\u2019s a push that is quickly running into conflict with the party\u2019s energized left flank.\u201d Full story.   ON MESSAGE \u2014 DCCC pops jobs, economy polling memo: Voters are "not looking for our sympathy," but candidates should share what they will "do about it," Democratic pollsters Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research wrote in a recent memo for the DCCC, as Democrats prepared to roll out their new economic message. The memo provides a data-driven messaging guidance for \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d which consultants have been briefed on in recent weeks. A survey of Democratic base and swing voters are \u201cdeeply dissatisfied with the economy and their place in it,\u201d per the memo, and it cautions that Democrats are \u201cat risk of being seen as prioritizing issues other than jobs and economic growth.\u201d The memo urges candidates to \u201cpivot quickly to a realistic, positive approach that helps small businesses grow and workers get better jobs, wages, and skills.\u201d And in a preview of potential 2018 bogeymen: Democrats should \u201caggressively contrast\u201d to include \u201cCongress, big businesses that send jobs overseas, and Wall Street for a weak economy."  \u2014 One naming missing from the guidance? Donald Trump. Read the full memo here.   \u2014 But first ... \u2014 From one senior Democratic consultant: \u201cThis polling is helpful, but non-incumbent candidates this cycle are mostly focused on winning primaries right now.\u201d   \u2014 "Schumer: Democrats were 'namby-pamby,'" via Campaign Pro's Kevin Robillard: "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday promised a bolder economic message for the Democratic Party, including the potential for single-payer health care. 'We were too cautious, we were too namby-pamby,' Schumer said on ABC's 'This Week.' 'This is sharp, bold and will appeal to both the old Obama coalition, let's say the young lady who's just getting out of college, and the Democratic voters who deserted us for Trump, the blue-collar worker. Economics is our strength, and we are going to get at it.'" Full story.  \u2014 COUNTER-PROGRAMMING \u2014 Congressional Leadership Fund launches digital ads in Trump-Democrat districts: The 30-second ads link Democrats to the most radical elements of the so-called resistance to Trump and to unpopular House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. "The Democrats are the party of the resistance," a male narrator says in the spot, which includes images of Kathy Griffin holding Trump's severed head and of violent protests on the day of Trump's inauguration. "Radical extremists who destroy buildings, burn cars and divide America. Hollywood celebrities who are blinded by their hatred of the president. Nancy Pelosi and the Washington Democrats answer to them." The ads will run in Pelosi's district, as well as the districts of Minnesota Reps. Collin Peterson, Rick Nolan and Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Rep. Matt Cartwright, Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind, Iowa Rep. Dave Loebsack, New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, New Hampshire Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Arizona Rep. Tom O'Halleran and Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos. Watch the ad here.  CANDIDATE PROFILES \u2014 \u201cMeet the lab-coat liberals,\u201d by POLITICO California\u2019s David Siders: \u201cDismayed by President Donald Trump\u2019s perceived hostility to climate science and other areas of research, a surge of scientists is entering the public arena and running for political office for the first time. They represent an evolving brand of Democrat that has been gaining steam for months. What began with rogue Twitter accounts and protest marches has graduated into candidacies in House races in places as varied as California, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York. The handful of scientists who have formally announced their candidacies so far \u2014 and the others who are preparing to join them \u2014 have cast themselves as a counterforce to the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of climate science and de-prioritization of innovation funding.\u201d Full story.  THREE WEEKS \u2014 Anti-Strange GOP donor begins ad campaign in Alabama Senate special: Alabama GOP donor Stan Pate has begun producing ads focused on Sen. Luther Strange in the Alabama Senate race. Pate, as POLITICO previously reported, registered a PAC in late June called Swamp Drainers PAC and plans to use the organization aggressively against Strange. In a separate interview on Friday Pate said the 17-second ad, obtained by POLITICO, which portrays Strange being appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley in exchange for Strange, then attorney general in Alabama, dropping any investigation his office had into Bentley. \u201cVote No! To Shady Big Luther Strange\u201d a line in the ad reads. Pate said that the ad is part of a series he plans to air online and on TV focused on Strange. He refused to say how much money he plans to spend on the ads. He said the ads will begin airing this week.   \u2014 Brooks gets endorsement from Lamar Smith: \u201cRep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) is endorsing GOP Rep. Mo Brooks in Alabama's special Senate election, according to the Brooks campaign.\u201d Full story.  Days until the 2017 election: 106.

BACK HOME \u2014 \u201cMcCaskill plays watchdog ahead of tough 2018 race,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor in Monroe City, Mo.: \u201cClaire McCaskill has sought to cultivate a familiar brand during her decade in the Senate: the dogged investigator, eager to ferret out waste, fraud and abuse. And the Missouri Democrat has found her next target in the pharmaceutical industry. ...As the top Democrat on the Senate's governmental affairs committee, McCaskill is using her oversight authority to probe the opioid industry's marketing, trying to decipher how the highly addictive drugs sparked a wave of overdoses across the country. Her scrutiny of the opioid epidemic, which has raged across her Midwestern state, also offers McCaskill a chance to burnish her credentials on an issue of bipartisan concern.\u201d Full story.   COMING ATTRACTIONS \u2014 \u2018Tony Evers files paperwork to run for Wisconsin governor but remains noncommittal,\u201d by The Journal Sentinel\u2019s Patrick Marley and Daniel Bice: \u201cState Schools Superintendent Tony Evers filed paperwork to run for governor Friday, but said he had not yet made up his mind about whether to formally enter the race. Evers won re-election to the nonpartisan job as schools superintendent in April, but has been considering a run as a Democrat against GOP Gov. Scott Walker next year. In a statement, he called Friday's filing of paperwork with the state as the next step as he considers a run. \u2018I look forward to making a final decision in the near future,\u2019 he said in his statement.\u201d Full story.  PRIMARY WATCH \u2014 \u201cDespite structural and financial advantages, possible primary still looms for Dean Heller,\u201d by The Nevada Independent\u2019s Riley Snyder: \u201cFinding Republicans unhappy with Sen. Dean Heller isn\u2019t too difficult these days. From radio host Hugh Hewitt to rank-and-file Republicans upset with Heller\u2019s chilly relationship with President Donald Trump \u2014 who issued a thinly-veiled threat to Heller at a luncheon this week \u2014 questions have begun swirling as to whether Heller could be vulnerable to a primary challenge. The nation\u2019s most vulnerable Republican senator still has structural and financial advantages with more than 470 days to go before the 2018 election that could fend off an insurgent primary challenger. And floating in the minds of any potential challenger is the fact that Heller has never lost a race since entering Nevada\u2019s political scene in 1990.\u201d Full story.  DEBATE POST-GAME \u2014 \u201cCandidates for Virginia Governor Employ Trump as a Barometer,\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Martin: \u201cLt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia on Saturday used the first debate of the state\u2019s race for governor to assail President Trump as a liar and a \u201cdangerous man,\u201d wagering that the growing backlash against the president will overwhelm Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee, in a state drifting to the political left.\u201d Full story.   CASH UPDATE \u2014 DSCC tops NRSC in June fundraising: \u201cThe NRSC raised $4.8 million in June, according to its FEC filing, and finished the month with $16.2 million on hand. That trails the DSCC, which announced today it raised $5 million in June and had $17.2 million in the bank.\u201d Full story.  ICYMI \u2014 \u201cSenator Kid Rock. Don\u2019t Laugh,\u201d via POLITICO Magazine\u2019s Tim Alberta and Zack Stanton: \u201c...Not a single prominent Republican in Michigan told us they\u2019d heard from Ritchie or his associates about a campaign. Good musicians are great marketers, and Kid Rock has been brilliant in terms of creating and selling a brand. His flirtation with electoral politics could be nothing more than a promotional ploy aimed at rekindling interest in his career\u2014he\u2019s had only one single reach any of Billboard\u2019s charts in the past four years\u2014and boosting his bottom line. And yet this theory doesn\u2019t appear consistent with the man himself.\u201d Full story.  WAY DOWN-BALLOT \u2014 DLCC launches page spotlighting key legislative races: The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee's new "Spotlight Races" page features critical seats Democrats are trying to hold and trying to chase in statehouses around the country, in an effort to direct donors and volunteers to below-the-radar battlegrounds. See the page here.  ADMINISTRATION SPEED READ \u2014 \u201cPriebus sidelined as Washington outsiders' power grows,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Tara Palmeri: \u201cReince Priebus took the punishing job of President Donald Trump's chief of staff with the idea that he would stick it out for at least one year. Six months in, with one of his top allies in the West Wing \u2014 press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 on his way out, Priebus is in defensive mode, his role diminished and an internal rival hogging the limelight. Trump's decision to bring Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci into the role of communications director shows the rising power of political outsiders and the diminished influence of establishment figures \u2014 which Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, epitomizes. One White House official and two outside advisers said that while Scaramucci was brought into the White House for the communications job, he's considered an internal candidate to eventually succeed Priebus as chief of staff. There are also a handful of outside candidates.\u201d Full story.   CODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cIt\u2019s hell. Do I need to say anything else?\u201d \u2014 State Rep.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and BRIANNA GURCIULLO  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  DONEZO: You smell that, our loyal MT readers? That\u2019s the smell of lingering jet fumes in the air. The Senate confirmed more than 60 nominations Thursday afternoon \u2014 including David Pekoske to be TSA administrator, Mark Buzby to be MARAD administrator and Robert Sumwalt to be NTSB chairman \u2014 before lawmakers took off for recess.  Baptism by fire: Pekoske, previously vice commandant of the Coast Guard, will now be sworn in as the 13th administrator of the 16-year-old TSA. His confirmation by voice vote comes days after John Kelly left DHS to be White House chief of staff. As Steph reports for Pros, \u201cPekoske will likely work closely with Acting Secretary Elaine Duke to oversee implementation of a directive DHS issued in June ordering 180 airlines to work with partner airports around the globe to update security for flights to the United States.\u201d  Story Continued Below  Excluded from the en bloc confirmations? Steven Bradbury to be DOT general counsel and Ron Batory to be FRA administrator. Bradbury just squeaked out of committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats questioning his past work for Takata and his part in helping pen the so-called torture memos during the George W. Bush administration. The nominations of Bradbury and Batory \u2014 as well as Derek Kan, to be undersecretary of Transportation for policy, and Adam Sullivan, to be assistant secretary for governmental affairs \u2014 will have to wait until after recess.  Also of note: The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kay Bailey Hutchison to be the United States\u2019 ambassador to NATO. A former senator from Texas, Hutchison served for years on the Senate Commerce Committee.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  TWEET DU JOUR: From POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman: \u201cKelly has totally changed trump. Much more disciplined, tighter etc.\u201d (Jake was referring to this tweet from President Donald Trump: \u201cOur relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!\u201d)  SAFETRACK SOUNDTRACK: On WAMU\u2019s The Kojo Nnamdi Show, musician Jason Mendelson talked about his years-long mission to write a song for every station in Washington\u2019s Metrorail system. Although, he confessed that he hasn\u2019t been to all 91 stations yet. Listen here.   SANCTUARY CITIES TARGETED: Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, John Barrasso of Wyoming, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Thom Tillis of North Carolina introduced legislation that would block sanctuary cities from receiving federal funds if they don\u2019t comply with federal immigration enforcement requests. The lawmakers said the bill would take a \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to immigrants who commit crimes or violate immigration laws, in an effort to increase public safety. The legislation also proposes to allocate $15 billion to tighten security at the U.S.-Mexico border, but none of it would go toward fulfilling Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a standalone border wall, POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Ted Hesson write.   MORE, MORE, MORE: It\u2019s been 10 years since a law H.R. 1 (P.L.110-53) was enacted mandating that DHS adopt 9/11 Commission recommendations to improve national security, but the department is still lagging behind when it comes to tracking travelers\u2019 arrivals to and departures from the country and checking cargo entering U.S. ports, according to Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.). \u201cWe still do not have a biometric exit system though the department has a pilot underway,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday. CBP also is still allowing maritime cargo to enter the country without scanning all materials, including those that could pose nuclear threats, he added. Thompson, who was chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee when the bill passed the chamber, urged the Trump administration to prioritize those issues and make sure that the legislation was fully enacted \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d   ALL THE DEADLINES: The infrastructure initiative Trump promised during the campaign is likely to be idling until late autumn, at the earliest. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) thinks Congress needs to send a bill overhauling the tax code to the White House by Thanksgiving. That\u2019s what the House Freedom Caucus chairman said Thursday at an Americans for Prosperity event, Aaron Lorenzo reports for Pro Tax. The White House is operating under the optimistic assumption that a tax overhaul will pass the House in October and the Senate will follow up in November, which would give lawmakers about a month to turn to Trump\u2019s third priority for 2017: an infrastructure bill.  THEN THERE\u2019S THE MUST-PASS BILLS: The House and Senate will both be in session for only a few days before fiscal 2017 ends, as Pro Day Ahead notes. In that time, lawmakers will not only need to re-up the FAA\u2019s authorization, but also increase the debt ceiling, a debate that stands to tear apart Republicans. \u201cThe upshot: Congress will return next month from August recess with no clear road map for avoiding the first-ever default on the nation\u2019s debt,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade report. On top of that, Congress will need to pass a spending bill before the government shuts down at the end of September.  BACK IN THE DAY: Robotics engineers and former government officials sat down with Wired Magazine to reminisce about what it was like to participate in what sounds like a pretty epic 142-mile self-driving vehicle race sponsored by the Pentagon. Despite offering a $1 million prize to the winner of the 2004 Grand Challenge in the Mojave Desert, Tony Tether, then director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said he didn\u2019t expect more than 10 people to show up. But on the day of the race, the grounds \u201cteemed with sweaty, stressed, sleep-deprived geeks, desperately tinkering with their motley assortment of driverless Frankencars,\u201d Alex Davies writes of the race that is now considered a launching pad for the self-driving car industry.   SHIFTING GEARS: Nicole Hager is leaving Sen. Jim Inhofe\u2019s (R-Okla.) office, where she has served as deputy press secretary, to take the same position for the Senate Finance Committee beginning Aug. 21. Hager\u2019s last day with Inhofe, for whom she has worked since 2015, was Thursday. In an email to colleagues, she said she will also attend The George Washington University Law School.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and BRIANNA GURCIULLO  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Tanya Snyder and Lauren Gardner  WHEN IS IT 'LOBBYING'? Three House Dems want DOT\u2019s inspector general to look into whether administration officials broke federal law by promoting Rep. Bill Shuster's (R-Pa.) bill, H.R. 2997 (115), to split off air traffic control operations from the FAA. In a letter to IG Calvin Scovel, Democratic Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Nita Lowey of New York and David Price of North Carolina wrote: \u201cIt has come to our attention that at least four DOT political appointees have contacted members of Congress, nonfederal stakeholders such as aviation association representatives and airport sponsors, or both to gain support\u201d for the House Transportation Committee chairman\u2019s legislation.  Story Continued Below  Sound familiar? Luckily for you MT readers, you all already knew that some DOT officials had sent emails to lawmakers and trade groups advocating for the bill. FAA told us at the time that it was \u201cproviding fact-based information in response to questions and issues that we have been consistently asked over the course of the FAA\u2019s reauthorization.\u201d  \u2018Highly irregular\u2019: DeFazio, Lowey and Price wrote in their letter that folks within DOT also chatted on the phone with \u201cnonfederal stakeholders\u201d to urge the overhaul. And, they pointed out, DOT launched a website on separating air traffic control operations from the FAA. \u201cEven when viewed in the light most favorable, these e-mails, phone calls, and other activities are highly irregular, at best,\u201d the trio wrote.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  TWEETS DU JOUR: From our POLITICO colleague Seung Min Kim: \u201cThe smell of #jetfumes getting stronger in the Senate.\u201d And from Time\u2019s Zeke Miller: \u201cFAA has formally issued NOTAMS for POTUS vacation in Bedminster from Aug 4-20.\u201d  DOT PICKS MOVE AHEAD: Several nominees moved through the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday (including controversial DOT general counsel nominee Steven Bradbury, who barely made it through on a party line vote). Some Democrats, including ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), objected to advancing Bradbury\u2019s nomination because of his ties to Takata, and because they felt his plans to avoid potential conflicts of interest were insufficient.   Meanwhile: Other Dems balked at Bradbury\u2019s history in President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, where he authored three memos that helped authorize torture. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) led that campaign, saying: \u201cWhen you\u2019re stuck bleeding in a helicopter behind enemy lines like I was, you hope and pray that if the enemy finds you first, they treat you humanely.\u201d The other three nominees \u2014 Mark Buzby for MARAD administrator, Ron Batory for FRA administrator and Robert Sumwalt for NTSB chairman \u2014 were approved easily. Our Tanya Snyder has more for Pros.  DRIVERLESS BILL-LESS: At Wednesday\u2019s Senate Commerce Committee markup, Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) announced that his panel's driverless car legislation would have to wait a little longer. The bill \u2014 which Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) had promised was coming \u201cvery soon\u201d a bit more than a week ago \u2014 is being held up until \u201csometime this fall,\u201d Thune said.  NEVER MIND: Qatar Airways has changed its mind about looking to purchase a stake in American Airlines, saying "further review \u2026 has demonstrated that the investment no longer meets our objectives,\u201d the Doha-based carrier said in a statement to Reuters. American, which has clashed with Qatar Airways over Open Skies issues, is surely pleased. \u201cWe respect Qatar Airways\u2019 decision not to proceed with its proposed investment,\u201d the U.S. carrier told us in a statement.   MOVING ALONG THE PIPELINE: FTA released on Wednesday the Record of Decision for the Gateway program\u2019s Portal Bridge project, putting it closer to the engineering phase of the Capital Investment Grant pipeline. The partners involved with the $1.64 billion project hope to obtain CIG funding totaling $811 million.  AMICABLE DIVORCE: DHS spokesman David Lapan says John Kelly\u2019s departure from the agency was smooth and followed the established succession plan to shift power to Elaine Duke. He said during a pen and pad Wednesday that he didn\u2019t know how much of a heads-up Duke had before Trump tweeted out the announcement that Kelly would take over as White House chief of staff, but that Kelly had been aware that he was being considered. \u201cI know that there had been conversations between Gen. Kelly and the White House,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t tell you how many or over what period of time.\u201d  Search party update: It\u2019s possible that Duke could hold the top spot at DHS for a while given that there are still no clear front-runners to step in as the permanent head of the agency. Pro Energy\u2019s Alex Guillen reports that Energy Secretary Rick Perry doesn\u2019t want anyone to add his name to the list of contenders to replace John Kelly. Perry is \u201chappy where he is & focused on carrying out mission POTUS gave him,\u201d DOE\u2019s press office tweeted.   And I am telling you: Lapan also poo pooed rumors that he might be following Kelly to the White House to take over the freshly vacant communications director position. \u201cI have no plans to move,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been asked by anyone to change jobs and so that\u2019s where that stands.\u201d Still, Lapan couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at reporters\u2019 suggestions that he might have to make some wardrobe changes, like upgrading from his no-frills suits to pinstripes, should he change his mind.   LAW AND ORDER: Possibly joining Lapan at DHS is John Mitnick, who the president nominated Wednesday to be the department\u2019s general counsel. Mitnick is currently the chief legal officer at the Heritage Foundation and previously served as associate general counsel for science and technology at DHS.  YEAH, ABOUT THAT: Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft made some waves earlier this week when he said he would continue to support transgender service members in the face of Trump\u2019s threat to ban them. But Lapan said that should an official order come down from the White House, Zukunft would have no choice but to implement it. \u201cThis policy, when the Department of Defense develops it, will apply to the Coast Guard,\u201d Lapan said. He added: \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is that the commandant, clearly as a serving military officer, will follow the orders and directions of not only of the commander in chief but the secretary of Defense.\u201d  PRIVATE EYES: The Secret Service will use a drone to help keep an eye on the president when he goes on vacation at his golf club in New Jersey later this month, according to a Reuters report. The agency will operate a \u201csmall tethered unmanned aircraft system vehicle\u201d during Trump\u2019s extended visit to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., and is considering it a test for using drones as presidential protection. However, the fact that the drone would be flying within range of private residences surrounding the golf course could raise privacy concerns.   SHIFTING GEARS: Lawrence Kluttz is stepping down as communications director for North Carolina Rep. David Price, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations THUD subcommittee, our colleagues at Playbook report. Kluttz begins Aug. 10 as the speechwriter for Vincent Price, the president of Duke University (who isn\u2019t related to the House appropriator). \u2026 Tyler Rushforth, formerly counsel to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is now executive director of the American Trucking Associations\u2019 Intermodal Motor Carrier Conference.

aV \u000a            By BRIANNA GURCIULLO and STEPHANIE BEASLEY  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Lauren Gardner  \u2018A HOLDING PATTERN\u2019: Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) confirmed for us Tuesday what we\u2019ve pretty much already known for a while: The upper chamber won\u2019t consider its FAA bill on the floor until September, when lawmakers come back from recess. Thune saidthe Senate will either pass the legislation, which would reauthorize the agency for four years, or a shorter term extension. The latter is looking more and more likely. \u201cIt\u2019s in a holding pattern at the moment,\u201d Thune said about the bill, S. 1405 (115). \u201cBut, one way or the other, we\u2019ll get on it. We\u2019ll get it done.\u201d   Story Continued Below  The sticking point: As for that controversial provision to change up training requirements for co-pilots, Thune said there\u2019s been no resolution yet. \u201cBut there will be obviously before we get to the floor with it,\u201d he said. When asked about the issue Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said: \u201cWell, we\u2019re not gonna sacrifice people\u2019s safety.\u201d  NOM NOM NOMS: Later this morning, the Senate Commerce Committee is slated to move a handful of DOT nominees (and one NTSB member) to the floor, which means there will be even more names in play for a potential nominations package senators are hoping to clear before the August recess begins next week. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that a number of these that we\u2019re going to report out [Wednesday] will get included in a unanimous consent package,\u201d Thune told MT on Tuesday, adding that lawmakers are \u201ctrying to get as many on the cleared list as we can.\u201d   Nom-aste: To refresh Pros\u2019 memory, Derek Kan, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be undersecretary for transportation policy, has been waiting in the wings for more than a month since his committee approval. On deck today in committee are Ron Batory for FRA administrator, Mark Buzby to head the Maritime Administration, Steven Bradbury to be general counsel and Robert Sumwalt to serve another term at NTSB. (The nomination of Adam Sullivan for assistant Transportation secretary for governmental affairs is privileged and therefore doesn\u2019t require the panel\u2019s sign-off before a floor vote.) We\u2019d hazard a guess that all of those names \u2014 with the exception of Bradbury, the vote for whom is expected to break along party lines \u2014 would be ripe for consideration for a noncontroversial package.  IT\u2019S WEDNESDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports. Steph and Brianna are driving the MT train, so please send along tips, feedback and lyrics to sbeasley@politico.com or @Steph_Beasley and bgurciullo@politico.com or @brigurciullo.  \u201cYeah, that\u2019s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  WITH SKIES WIDE OPEN: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met up Tuesday with air carrier and travel industry officials to chat about Open Skies. The attendees: David Bronczek, FedEx\u2019s president and COO; Robin Hayes, JetBlue\u2019s president and CEO; William Flynn, Atlas\u2019 president and CEO; Kevin Burke, Airports Council International-North America\u2019s president and CEO; and Roger Dow, the U.S. Travel Association\u2019s president and CEO.   Let\u2019s break this down: When it comes to Open Skies, FedEx, JetBlue and Atlas stand in opposition to United, American and Delta. The latter accuse Qatar and the United Arab Emirates of flying in the face of their Open Skies agreements with the United States by subsidizing their airlines. In the White House, officials have been talking about the controversy for months, as POLITICO\u2019s Andrew Restuccia and Michael Grunwald reported. But the continuing strain between Qatar and Saudi Arabia decreases the chances that the U.S. government will make a decision anytime soon.  Where it stands: A State Department official told MT in a statement that the agency \u201cremains in contact with all U.S. industry stakeholders who have expressed their differing views on a range of issues, including on the issues of Open Skies and subsidies to the Gulf Carriers.\u201d Burke told POLITICO that Tillerson \u201cdid not give a position\u201d during the meeting. Tillerson \u201csaid that it really is an intergovernmental process they\u2019re going through. They\u2019ve made no decision. Obviously, it includes the White House, it includes the Commerce Department, the Justice Department and maybe even DOD,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI think they\u2019re keeping things very close to the vest,\u201d he added.  THE SENATORS BEHIND THE PROPOSED PFC CAP INCREASE: Airports are closer than they\u2019ve ever been to the federal government raising the cap on Passenger Facility Charges, with a provision to do just that included in the Senate\u2019s DOT spending bill for fiscal 2018 that was favorably reported out of committee last week. Burke told us that a group of senators \u201cbanded together\u201d to put the provision in the bill, including Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), the vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference; Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Susan Collins (R-Maine), the chairwoman of the THUD appropriations subcommittee; and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), the subcommittee\u2019s top Democrat.  Why not the FAA bill? Burke said senators who supported increasing the cap ruled out trying to do so through the Senate Commerce Committee\u2019s FAA reauthorization bill, which became controversial when the panel adopted an amendment during its markup to change co-pilot training standards. \u201cThere were a number of senators who knew that they couldn\u2019t help us on the Commerce Committee because Sen. Thune had some concerns on flight hours and some other issues and PFCs were not going to be put in the equation,\u201d Burke said. The future of the Senate measure to raise the PFC cap is uncertain and, of course, tied to the rest of the government funding process.  Enough about MT, tell MT about you: After the Washington Post wrote about American Association of Airport Executives President and CEO Todd Hauptli\u2019s passion for cooking, we asked Burke if he had any secret talents. \u201cI\u2019m a carpenter. I make cabinets and moldings and stuff like that,\u201d Burke said. \u201cI have not had one of Todd\u2019s meals yet and I\u2019m going to threaten to come over to his house to have a meal with him. \u2026 I\u2019ll make him a dining room table if he supplies me some gourmet meals.\u201d  LIVE YOUR LIFE WITH NO REGRETS: Trump doesn\u2019t seem to regret his decision to tackle health care first after his inauguration. \u201cYou know, a lot of people said you should have started with taxes or you should have started with infrastructure,\u201d Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWell, infrastructure I\u2019ll actually have bipartisan support, and I can use infrastructure to carry other things along. So I don\u2019t want to waste it at the beginning, if that makes sense.\u201d Check out the full transcript of the interview here.  DHS DUO: Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he hopes to travel to the White House soon to meet with ex-DHS Secretary John Kelly and discuss the future of the department under the Trump administration. With Kelly as the face of the agency and now-Acting Secretary Elaine Duke behind the scenes overseeing management of the agency, the two created \u201cthe perfect structure,\u201d Johnson told Steph. The question now is how will the agency be managed with Duke in the driver\u2019s seat and Kelly there to assist from the White House, he said.   Step up: Kelly\u2019s position in the White House certainly seems like it would work to Duke\u2019s benefit as she continues with many of the efforts that he started, former DHS Chief of Staff Christian Marrone told MT. \u201cHaving Gen. Kelly there, who has an appreciation for the mission, and the breadth of the mission, the capability of the department, I think only enhances the department\u2019s standing, both in this administration, and I think bodes well for the future,\u201d Marrone said.   Moving along: Marrone added that we shouldn\u2019t expect to see Elaine Duke make any drastic changes to DHS\u2019 approach to overseeing security updates at all international airports with flights to the United States. Marrone, who is now senior vice president of external relations and chief of staff at CRSA, worked with Duke both at DHS and when she served as a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. He said Duke might have a different style from Kelly, but he believes the two were on the same page when it came to preventing terrorist attacks on airplanes. \u201cI don\u2019t see a big drop off from any of the things that Secretary Kelly was attempting to do,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cShe\u2019s been working on the issues with him, and so I think she\u2019ll just continue to make improvements to aviation security that they think are necessary.\u201d  In the air: Trump still hasn\u2019t given any signals (or sent out any tweets) about who he plans to nominate to permanently fill the DHS vacancy. Duke, who has worked for both Republican and Democrat administrations, could be seen as a non-partisan choice. Marrone said that House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) could also easily win confirmation since he is a \u201cwell-known entity\u201d with deep knowledge of the department. Whomever the administration nominates, it needs to be someone who isn\u2019t surrounded by controversy, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have someone who is going to be a lightning rod because it won\u2019t happen. So I think that disqualifies a number of folks who you hear mentioned,\u201d Marrone said.   Don\u2019t forget about us: Just a reminder that the other potential picks for DHS chief include Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is helping to lead Trump\u2019s controversial commission on alleged voter fraud.   GOTTA HAVE FAITH: Elsewhere within DHS, Coast Guard Commandant Paul Zukunft said he would try to shield his service members from a possible ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, POLITICO\u2019s Gregory Hellman reports. The president has yet to issue a formal order that would prevent people who are transgender from serving in the military. If it is formalized, the ban could apply to the Coast Guard, which the president can transfer to the Navy during wartime. Zukunft said he has reached out to the secretaries of DHS and DOD to discuss the possible implications of a ban and has told transgender Coast Guard personnel that he \u201cwill not break faith\u201d with them.   CAN WE TALK? Top officials from DHS and CBP met with privacy groups on Tuesday to discuss the roll out of CBP\u2019s biometric exit program to airports and other ports of entry throughout the United States. John Wagner, deputy executive assistant commissioner of CBP\u2019s field operations, used the meeting as an opportunity to \u201creiterate CBP\u2019s commitment to protecting traveler\u2019s privacy,\u201d the agency said in a press release.   Down to the nitty, gritty: The meeting comes less than two weeks after the Electronic Privacy Information Center asked a D.C. federal judge to order CBP to disclose how it uses biometric information collected at entry and exit points. CBP currently uses facial recognition technology at five U.S. airports, including Washington Dulles International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. "CBP has and will continue to engage our privacy office at every step in the process to add biometric to the departure process from the United States," Wagner said.  SHIFTING GEARS: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser named Jeff Marootian interim director of the District Department of Transportation, effective Aug. 11. Marootian, now DDOT\u2019s deputy director, was assistant secretary for administration at DOT from 2015 to 2017.

aV \u000a            By BRIANNA GURCIULLO and STEPHANIE BEASLEY  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Tanya Snyder and Annie Snider  STEPPING ON THE GAS: The Trump administration hopes the House will pass a tax code overhaul in October and the Senate will then clear it in November, leaving about a month left in the year for Congress to potentially move on an infrastructure package. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has said for months that we\u2019ll see a legislative proposal in the fall, but the chances of enacting a bill before year\u2019s end \u2014 especially when such a thing doesn't yet exist \u2014 look slim at the moment.  Story Continued Below  First things first: GOP lawmakers have long put overhauling the tax code before an infrastructure package on their to-do list (though, some have suggested they could be paired). Now, Republicans clearly want a legislative win after their unsuccessful effort to repeal Obamacare. And, as Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports, they\u2019re aiming to give the economy a boost through their tax code changes before the midterm elections. \u201cSo that, I think, is an aggressive schedule but that is our timetable,\u201d Marc Short, the White House\u2019s director of legislative affairs, said on Monday about the administration\u2019s expectations for October and November. \u201cI think we\u2019re in for a long fall, legislative calendar-wise.\u201d  On the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue: White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Monday that infrastructure is still very much on Trump\u2019s mind. \u201cThe president\u2019s been very outspoken on the need for a massive overhaul to the country\u2019s infrastructure system, and that\u2019s certainly still a priority \u2014 both legislative and in any capacity that he has the ability to carry that out,\u201d she said.  COLE STANDS AGAINST ATC OVERHAUL: Speaking of to-do lists, the House will have just 12 legislative days to reauthorize (or, more likely, extend) the FAA's expiring authorization when members come back in September. On Monday, Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and appropriator, dedicated his \u201cweekly column\u201d to air traffic control, saying he thought last year\u2019s attempt to hand over air traffic control operations to a nonprofit corporation was \u201ca terrible idea\u201d then, and that he still disapproves.   Catching up with Cole: MT spoke with Cole before House lawmakers left town Friday, and he made it clear he would vote against severing air traffic control operations, as Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) has proposed. Cole said that \u201cmost\u201d of his fellow Oklahoma lawmakers, including Rep. Steve Russell, also oppose Shuster\u2019s plan. Russell and several other Republicans are pushing their colleagues to reject the House Transportation chairman\u2019s legislation, H.R. 2997 (115).  Just one of those things: \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those cases where I think all the Democrats are against it. So given that, if you have much in the way of division on the Republican side, it becomes pretty dicey. And right now, I know they\u2019re working it hard, and they may get there, but I don\u2019t think the votes are there in the House, let alone the Senate,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard, quite frankly.\u201d Last month, Cole signed onto a letter with Russell \u2014 as well as Reps. Ralph Abraham, Ron Estes and Walter Jones \u2014 asking leadership to \u201cprohibit any provision to privatize air traffic control operations from consideration on the House floor.\u201d  IT\u2019S TUESDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

FOR YOUR RADAR: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will sit down today with "U.S. industry stakeholders" who asked to meet with him to talk about Open Skies and other issues, a State Department official told MT.   KELLY CLEANS HOUSE: Now-former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly blasted into his first full day as White House chief of staff by ousting Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, putting folks on alert that he is about business. Just hours after Kelly was sworn in, news broke that Trump had dismissed Scaramucci per Kelly\u2019s request. Sources had speculated that Trump would look to Kelly, a retired Marine general, to help rein in the in-fighting and drama at 1600 Penn. Earlier in the day, Trump commended Kelly not only for his \u201crecord shattering\u201d (albeit brief) tenure at DHS but also for handling controversial issues like border security without creating much controversy. \u201cI predict that Gen. Kelly will go down in terms of the position of chief of staff [as] one of the great[est] ever,\u201d Trump said.  Before I let go: Before Kelly started setting off White House fireworks, he sent one last email to the \u201ctremendous group of selfless public servants\u201d at DHS announcing personnel changes, POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson writes. Chip Fulghum, current acting undersecretary for management, will take over as deputy secretary now that Elaine Duke has assumed the role of acting secretary. And Duke\u2019s previous chief of staff, Chad Wolf, will be promoted to acting chief of staff for DHS. Kirstjen Nielsen surrendered her position as DHS chief of staff to follow Kelly to the White House.  DUNCAN PEACING OUT: Rep. John Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.), a longtime member of the House Transportation Committee, won\u2019t campaign again to keep the seat he\u2019s had for almost three decades. \u201cI have decided I wanted to spend less time in airports, airplanes, and traveling around the district and more time with my family, especially my nine grandchildren, who all live in Knoxville,\u201d Duncan told the Tennessean.   News comes amid controversy: Early last month, the Nashville Post reported that Duncan \u201cdoled out hundreds of thousands of dollars to his two sons, his niece, his son-in-law, his daughter-in-law and his sister for campaign work\u201d over the course of the last 10 years. Pro Campaigns\u2019 Elena Schneider has more on Duncan\u2019s retirement plans.  BARLETTA EYES SENATE RUN: Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) is eyeing the Senate, The Associated Press reported Monday. The chairman of the House Transportation subcommittee on economic development wants to challenge Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) next year. Barletta was once a contender to be Trump\u2019s secretary of Transportation. As Pro Campaigns\u2019 Kevin Robillard reports, Trump carried Pennsylvania in 2016 and has recommended that Barletta face off against Casey or Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Democrat Tom Wolf.  LOOK OUT: NTSB sent out an alert Monday cautioning about relying on just a lookout to tell track workers about oncoming trains. \u201cIf a watchman/lookout does not devote his or her full attention to their duty of looking for approaching trains, they might not provide warning of an approaching train with sufficient time for their coworkers to clear the tracks,\u201d Robert Sumwalt, the acting chairman of NTSB, said in a release. An incident in which two employees died in South Dakota partially inspired the alert, NTSB said in the release. The docket for the probe into that January incident opened last week.  HIP PIPP HOORAY: DOT on Monday issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for \u201cnew, experimental procedures\u201d to grow the use of public-private partnerships in transit projects. The newly proposed Private Investment Project Procedures (PIPP) would allow federal funding recipients to identify FTA regulations and practices \u201cthat may be an impediment\u201d to the use of P3s or private investment and let them ask for a waiver of those requirements. The proposed rule was required by MAP-21.  'ALMOST' DOESN\u2019T COUNT: States have ramped up their investment in bridge repair projects over the last decade, but it still isn\u2019t enough, according to a new analysis from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. The group marked the 10-year anniversary of the I-35 bridge collapse in Minnesota by examining federal data that tracks investments in bridge work, finding that bridge construction had increased just 8 percent, from $54.6 billion in 2007 to $59.2 billion in 2016. At the current pace of investment it would take more than three decades to replace and repair every bridge that needs work, ARTBA Chief Economist Alison Premo Black said. The group said that \u201ca long-term infrastructure package from Congress and a permanent revenue solution to the Highway Trust Fund would help states make greater progress.\u201d  CONTENTIOUS ASIAN CARP STUDY COMING NEXT WEEK: The Army Corps of Engineers has alerted lawmakers that it will release a draft plan for halting the spread of dangerous Asian carp into the Great Lakes on Aug. 7. The study was originally due out Feb. 28, but was put on hold by the Trump administration amid concerns from the barge industry that it could hamper navigation between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been pushing for the study\u2019s swift release, including through policy riders inserted in pending appropriations measures.  SHIFTING GEARS: Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser in the Obama administration, has become a member of Lyft\u2019s board of directors. Jarrett was previously Chicago\u2019s commissioner of planning and development and chairwoman of the Chicago Transit board, Pro Technology\u2019s Steven Overly reports.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and LAUREN GARDNER  07/31/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Brianna Gurciullo  IT\u2019S THE DHS SHUFFLE: A new day is dawning at DHS, where Elaine Duke is stepping in as acting secretary to replace John Kelly, who will be sworn in as White House chief of staff today. After President Donald Trump fired off a surprise tweet Friday announcing that Reince Priebus was out and Kelly was in, Kelly issued a statement saying he was \u201chonored\u201d to take over the position. The move reflects an increasing level of trust between Trump and the retired Marine general, who has become a \u201ckindred spirit,\u201d several sources told POLITICO. But suddenly yanking Kelly away from DHS while the department is grappling with emerging threats to airplanes and visa security could create chaos.   Story Continued Below  And the beat goes on: Duke will now be in charge of overseeing the department at a critical moment when DHS is working to tighten security at airports around the globe, Stephanie Beasley reports. Airlines have fewer than three months to complete an enhanced security plan at 280 airports with flights to the United States. However, airline and airport officials are already familiar with Duke, a former deputy assistant administrator for acquisition at TSA. So it's possible the change in leadership might not create major waves.   On your mark, get set: Still, lawmakers in both chambers are urging Trump against leaving DHS\u2019 top spot vacant for too long. Some of the names being floated by White House and former DHS officials as possible replacements include House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-Texas), ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. McCaul has been a big supporter of Kelly\u2019s efforts to tighten aviation and visa security, and Kelly has praised McCaul for pushing a DHS reauthorization bill through the House. \u201cI look forward to continuing to work closely with [Kelly] to combat the most crucial homeland security challenges facing America,\u201d McCaul said in a statement.   TEACH ME HOW TO SHRUGGIE: The House has 12 legislative days to reauthorize the FAA and fund the government \u2014 not to mention re-up the national flood insurance program and CHIP funding \u2014 when lawmakers return in September from the summer recess. How is it all going to get done? \u005c_(\u30c4)_/  The tank\u2019s on E: The needle is moving closer and closer toward extension territory, no matter what air traffic control overhaul proponents say publicly. Even if each chamber were to miraculously pull itself up by bootstraps and pass its own FAA bill, that leaves next to no time for any sort of deal to be hashed out. And the jury\u2019s still out on whether House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster\u2019s bill (H.R. 2997 (115)), which includes a controversial air traffic control overhaul, will even make it to the floor \u2014 it\u2019s going to be a long five weeks, aviation fans. When asked how he\u2019s persuading members to change their votes from nos to yeses, Shuster said by "talking to them, explaining the bill \u2026 moving a lot of people the right way."

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  \u2018THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING AIRLINE SEAT\u2019: Want an FAA tidbit that isn\u2019t tied to the soap opera that is the reauthorization bill debate? A federal appellate court ruled Friday that FAA didn\u2019t do an adequate job backing up why it rejected a petition for a rulemaking on airplane seat size and pitch, Mary Lee reports for Pros. A nonprofit group focused on airline passengers\u2019 rights argued that shrinking seat size and spacing poses a threat when flyers must evacuate a plane, as well as when it comes to health concerns like deep vein thrombosis. Regulators maintained that risks for the blood clot condition were minimal, and that the existing regime for studying the safety of seat size still works.  FAA-ke news? The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit took FAA to task for offering a \u201cvacuous\u201d justification for its denial of Flyers Rights\u2019 original petition, but the decision doesn\u2019t order the agency to write a rule giving everyone more legroom and cushier seats. FAA can still deny the rulemaking request, but it has to back it up with more evidence the public can see, the court said. \u201cWhile we do not require much of the agency at this juncture, we do require something,\u201d the opinion stated.  Maybe, just maybe: Remember that the Senate\u2019s FAA bill (S. 1405 (115)) would require FAA to evaluate the minimum seat pitch on planes while considering passengers with disabilities and flyers\u2019 safety.   IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME: Did you ever line up to board your flight only to look down at your ticket and realize you wanted an aisle seat, not a window seat? Delta says it\u2019s working on a tool that could fix that for you. The airline kicked off a three-month pilot program at Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson airport that, among other things, will give gate agents handheld devices that allow them to change seats and check bag statuses. The second phase of the pilot will also integrate biometric boarding technology currently being tested at Reagan National Airport. \u201cDeveloping and testing these innovations is an important part of our ongoing effort to improve the customer travel experience,\u201d said Gil West, Delta\u2019s chief operating officer. Delta has also been collaborating with CBP to test biometric identification technology at Hartsfield.  GIVE ME MY MONEY: Starting this week Wells Fargo will begin repaying customers who it was surreptitiously charging for auto insurance.The bank issued a statement late last week saying it would refund more than 570,000 auto loan customers who were unaware that they were also being charged for auto insurance that many did not need. The bank will make a total of $80 million in payments \u2014 $64 million in cash and $16 million in account adjustments, USA Today reported. Wells Fargo, which has previously been fined for insurance fraud, made the announcement after The New York Times reported the bank had charged more than 800,000 car loan customers for auto insurance without their knowledge.  MT MAILBAG: The Surface Transportation Board fired off a letter to CSX CEO Hunter Harrison last week to put in writing concerns about service issues on the freight line that have arisen since it instituted operational changes earlier this year. The board said it\u2019s received \u201cinformal complaints\u201d from shippers that have seen transit times balloon and general service inconsistencies. STB said it has been made aware of \u201cdelays resulting from CSX congestion in critical gateways,\u201d including New Orleans. The railroad loudly protested a recent report to Congress advocating for Amtrak service to return to the Gulf Coast, arguing that it needs billions of dollars\u2019 worth of infrastructure improvements to be able to accommodate passenger trains along its tracks.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and LAUREN GARDNER  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Brianna Gurciullo and Tanya Snyder  TRUMP\u2019S BUDGET REQUESTS LAND WITH A THUD: The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved its fiscal 2018 spending bill for all things transportation. In doing so, Congress dismissed President Donald Trump\u2019s requests to get rid of federal funding for Essential Air Service and Amtrak\u2019s long-distance routes, and phase out the Capital Investment Grant program. The House\u2019s spending bill, which was approved by committee last week, also shoots down those proposals, but it would cut off federal funding for TIGER grants as Trump requested.   Story Continued Below  No love for Gateway: Unlike the House\u2019s legislation, the Senate version doesn\u2019t throw a chunk of grant money at projects like the ones that make up the Gateway program. Instead, the Senate Appropriations Committee just says in its report that it \u201cencourages Amtrak to use funding provided to continue the Northeast Corridor Gateway Project.\u201d   You would now be free to move up your PFCs: As airports expected, the Senate bill would bump up the Passenger Facility Charge cap from $4.50 to $8.50 at the point of origin. The House\u2019s bill contains no such increase, and airlines are sure to loudly oppose the provision.  Got trucks? The Senate committee also adopted amendments offered by Sens. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) related to exemptions for their states from federal limits on truck weight. \u201cMy amendment would not put heavier trucks on New Hampshire\u2019s roads,\u201d Shaheen said during the markup. \u201cIt would simply fix an error that has come to light that the Federal Highway Administration has raised concerns about.\u201d Read Hoeven's amendment here and Shaheen's here.  SMH: Senate appropriators said in their bill report that the panel \u201cstrongly disagrees with the administration\u2019s assertion that providing federal dollars for infrastructure has created, \u2018an unhealthy dynamic in which state and local governments delay projects in the hope of receiving federal funds.\u2019\u201d The committee quoted from a fact sheet that the White House released about Trump\u2019s infrastructure vision. Appropriators also think it\u2019s \u201ctroubling\u201d that the president\u2019s budget \u201cassumes that after fiscal year 2020, Highway Trust Fund outlays will be at levels that are supported with existing tax receipts,\u201d which would lead to a $95 billion drop in outlays from fiscal 2021 to 2027. \u201cThe administration's approach is dangerously close to support for devolution of federal funding provided by the Highway Trust Fund, an idea the committee strongly opposes,\u201d they said.  WINTER IS COMING: Does that mean an infrastructure bill is, too? It\u2019s still early (congressional leaders are only just starting to pivot toward priority No. 2 of the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda, which is of course a tax code overhaul), but a small group of senators were invited to the White House on Thursday to discuss just that. \u201cThe ball is starting to roll," Sen. Jim Inhofe gleefully told our Lauren Gardner. GOP Sens. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Roger Wicker of Mississippi were also on hand at the meeting with DJ Gribbin, one of Trump\u2019s infrastructure advisers, and Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intergovernmental and technology initiatives.   Not quite there yet: Inhofe characterized the confab as a general discussion to assess lawmakers\u2019 priorities and compare how they line up with the administration\u2019s. While he wouldn\u2019t get into the thorny issue of how to cover the $1 trillion price tag the administration is shooting for, Inhofe did say he would be talking with EPW Committee Democrats during the health care "vote-a-rama" Thursday to get their input on a package. \u201cThey are just as anxious to get into an infrastructure bill as I am,\u201d said Inhofe, who was sporting a snazzy orthopedic sandal Thursday just like your MT co-author. (The Oklahoma Republican, fortunately, didn\u2019t break anything. Leave that to me, folks.)   AND THEN THERE\u2019S THE HOUSE FAA BILL: House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster acknowledged Thursday what we had long expected: his FAA reauthorization bill, H.R. 2997 (115), won\u2019t get any floor time until September, if ever. Meanwhile, the Senate\u2019s FAA bill is just as much in limbo with its controversial changes to the 1,500-hour co-pilot training rule. An extension is all but assured now, folks.  IT\u2019S FRIDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  (SELF-)DRIVING THE DAY: The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday unanimously approved Congress\u2019 first bill, H.R. 3388 (115), to deal with driverless cars. In the week since a subcommittee marked up a draft bill that was still full of placeholder text, Democrats and Republicans worked out significant compromises in an act of bipartisanship that, these days, could almost bring you to tears. One of those compromises accepted the Republican cap of 100,000 exemptions per year per manufacturer from old-school safety standards \u2014 but layered on some Democrat conditions, like ramping up to 100,000 over the course of several years, with DOT rulemakings in between and public reporting of crash data. (Carmakers don\u2019t love that part, by the way.)  States of play: Another big wrinkle the committee ironed out involved the latitude states and cities have to come up with their own rules for self-driving cars. Industry wants one consistent standard nationwide, but governors and mayors want to be able to weigh in, and they worry that NHTSA is too lax (and too understaffed) to be an effective enforcer. The agreement maintains traditional divisions between state and federal responsibilities but eliminated some ambiguities in order to carve out a little more space for state action. The bill also requires manufacturers to sign off on a vehicle safety assessment that NHTSA designed but left optional in its guidance.  Hurry up and wait: Members and staff worked at breakneck speed over the past couple of weeks to get to a deal \u2014 and it\u2019s now going to sit on the shelf till September since the House heads out today for a monthlong recess (barring Senate action on the health care bill, but that\u2019s a whole 'nother Pro vertical). Meanwhile, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) hinted strongly this week that the upper chamber\u2019s driverless car bill would be released imminently, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet. Tanya\u2019s got more for Pros.  DELANEY 2020? Longtime infrastructure bank advocate Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) is contemplating a 2020 presidential run. Former MT scribe Heather Caygle and Kevin Robillard write that Delaney is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a plan where he would skip challenging GOP Gov. Larry Hogan and instead aim straight for the White House. Democrats in the state say they expect he will announce his plans today in a Washington Post op-ed. Delaney has established a reputation among infrastructure groups because of his various proposals to establish public-private partnerships for highway projects, but he is largely unknown outside of those circles. So this could be a very long shot.   NOT SO FAST: House Democrats said DOT\u2019s plan to prioritize consideration of projects that would require minimal federal funding when it hands out $1.5 billion in INFRA (formerly FASTLANE) grants \u201cdoes not align with the impetus of the program\u201d created by President Barack Obama, POLITICO's Mary Lee reports. Thirteen Democrats, including Transportation Committee ranking member Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), signed off on a letter sent to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urging her against altering the program before the agency distributes fiscal 2017 grants for highway and freight projects.  ALMOST THERE: FMCSA is working faster to bring high-risk carriers into compliance by tackling the cases that need immediate intervention first, but the agency isn\u2019t effectively keeping track of compliance review results or making sure that the quality-assurance tools used by its inspectors are actually effective, according to an audit report from DOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General. The report was requested by Sen.Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) following a fatal commercial truck crash on an Illinois highway in 2014. FMCSA previously flagged the carrier as high-risk but had not conducted an investigation.  METRO BOARD SHAKE-UP: DOT\u2019s two new appointees to the WMATA board of directors made their debut Thursday at the group\u2019s last meeting for the summer. Neither David Horner nor Steve McMillin would opine on whether they believe the federal government should help cover Metro\u2019s expenses, a major question that Congress has yet to tackle outside of the $150 million that\u2019s been authorized annually for the system\u2019s capital expenses through fiscal 2019. But the appointees \u2014 both of whom served in the George W. Bush administration \u2014 said they\u2019re eager to apply the Trump administration\u2019s infrastructure principles to their roles, though McMillin noted they don\u2019t have specific \u201cmarching orders\u201d they\u2019re expected to fulfill. \u201cTheir policies, our policies, concerning infrastructure are bold, they\u2019ve innovative,\u201d Horner said. \u201cThey recognize that the status quo doesn\u2019t cut it any longer, and we need to shake things up in order to deliver better service to the riding public.\u201d   MT MAILBAG: The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association wrote a letter to FMCSA encouraging the agency to work with lawmakers to delay implementation of a congressional mandate for truckers to use electronic logging devices despite the American Trucking Associations urging FMCSA to do the opposite. \u201cDespite being the self-proclaimed \u2018most authoritative voice in the trucking industry,\u2019 ATA by no means represents the hundreds of thousands of crucial owner-operators and independent drivers working within our industry,\u201d Todd Spencer, OOIDA\u2019s executive vice president, wrote to Deputy FMCSA Administrator Daphne Jefferson. Separately, the group signed on to a letter to Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) in support of legislation that would extend the deadline for the ELD mandate.   ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES: Lauren Huston will be leaving her position as press secretary and digital director at the Senate Commerce Committee to pursue a J.D. at Catholic University.

aV \u000a            By LAUREN GARDNER and STEPHANIE BEASLEY  07/27/2017 10:02 AM EDT  With help from Tanya Snyder and Brianna Gurciullo  THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo stormed Washington Wednesday to deliver an urgent message to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao: that "there is no backup plan" for New York and New Jersey to come up with the money the Obama administration pledged for the Gateway program. Our Brianna Gurciullo was there when Cuomo emerged from a morning meeting with New York's Democratic congressional delegation and told reporters what he wanted to get out of his forthcoming meeting with Chao: "I want to hear that we\u2019re actually going to fund the tunnel, you know. All the planning is nice, but we don\u2019t have a funding agreement in place. And here\u2019s the fear: If you said today, \u2018Ok, let\u2019s go build the tunnel' \u2014 by the time you do the [environmental impact statement], by the time you do the contract, by the time you deal with all the bureaucracy, you\u2019re talking 10 years. \u2026 And these tunnels are not in a position, or I wouldn\u2019t want to be relying on these tunnels for 10 years."  Story Continued Below  So how did it go? Good question \u2014 neither Chao's nor Cuomo's offices provided details or statements on the meeting, despite our requests. But as a quick refresher, the Trump administration has proposed phasing out a popular transit grant program that was expected to fund significant portions of Gateway, such as the Portal North Bridge project that proponents had expected would be accounted for in the fiscal 2018 budget (it wasn't). Now, they're hoping a sense of hometown pride hits Trump and compels him to find a way to get the project funded.  HERE WE GO: The full Senate Appropriations Committee will mark up its fiscal 2018 transportation spending bill today. Airports are anticipating that the legislation would push up the cap on the Passenger Facility Charge, but subcommittee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-Maine) wouldn\u2019t confirm that to MT on Wednesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t released the entire bill \u2014 we can\u2019t before the markup under the committee rules,\u201d Collins said. Still, when asked whether she would support increasing the cap, Collins said: \u201cI believe that it has to be very carefully done. You certainly can\u2019t do it at every stage of the flight, for example, because that would really add up. I think it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s up to the individual airport and community \u2014 it\u2019s not a fee or tax that is assessed or collected by the federal government. But there certainly is a backlog in airport development.\u201d  IT\u2019S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  ATC PING PONG: Administration officials, including Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, visited Capitol Hill Wednesday to address some lawmakers' concerns about the effects House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster\u2019s FAA bill (H.R. 2997 (115)) would have on national security and DOD\u2019s use of airspace \u2014 and to reiterate the department\u2019s support. \u201cWe feel like we answered everybody\u2019s questions,\u201d Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) said, adding that they\u2019re \u201cpicking up votes.\u201d But GOP members agitating against the legislation have indicated that not everyone in DOD is happy about the bill's air traffic control overhaul. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys that are talking to members about it,\u201d Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) said. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) told MT he's seen a recent DOD document outlining concerns with the proposal, but wouldn't elaborate on what exactly they were.   ON SECOND THOUGHT: The Congressional Research Service issued a report suggesting parts of Shuster\u2019s air traffic control spin-off proposal could be unconstitutional. The report posits that it could be difficult for a court to determine if the new ATC organization created by the bill would be a government or non-government entity. And, if it is not a government entity, then allowing it to set and adjust user fees without federal oversight could be \u201cimproper delegation of legislative authority under the nondelegation doctrine,\u201d Mary Lee writes. Shuster was quick to slam the CRS report for not being definitive in its assessment of whether or not his plan would be unconstitutional.   SHELL GAMES: The House Energy and Commerce Committee will consider a bill on driverless cars that, before Wednesday night, was just a \u201cshell\u201d awaiting final language. As Tanya Snyder reported for Pros, bipartisan language, even on thorny subjects like balancing the roles of federal and state governments and granting exemptions from federal motor vehicle safety standards, was close to a done deal in advance of Thursday's markup. Lo and behold, a substitute amendment dropped late last night. On introduction, the shell bill (H.R. 3388 (115)) contained only a non-controversial provision to require vehicle manufacturers to provide consumers with clear information on new cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities and limitations.  Us, too! Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said Wednesday that the Senate will release its bill imminently. \u201cWe are just about ready to move as well on the bill,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI think there\u2019ll be an announcement coming out shortly. Very soon. Extremely soon.\u201d   OUT OF TIME: Commuter railroads hoping lawmakers might give them more breathing room on the 2018 positive train control deadline should think again, Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune said Wednesday. "I want to be clear \u2014 any railroad that fails to meet the revised framework should not expect any further extension from this committee," he said during a nominations hearing featuring the Trump administration\u2019s pick to head FRA, Ron Batory. Remember that commuter railroad representatives met with congressional staff and American Public Transportation Association officials in June to discuss implementation issues.  Please hold: While Batory vowed to continue FRA\u2019s work to promote progress on PTC, he was more reticent on issues like long-distance Amtrak lines (for which Trump has proposed eliminating funding) and electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems for trains. But he did get personal on the issue of grade-crossing safety, describing an accident years ago where a train he was riding on collided with a school bus stalled on the tracks (thankfully, no one was killed or hurt). \u201cAfter experiencing that, I have become a very strong proponent of good rail-highway crossing innovation, improvement and capitalizing on something that we always talk about within the industry \u2026 and that being best engineering we can come up with at the time, continuous education \u2014 it can never stop,\u201d Batory said.  Coming soon: The Commerce Committee announced late Wednesday that it will mark up a number of bills and nominations Aug. 2, including the nominations of Batory and NTSB member Robert Sumwalt.  IT AIN\u2019T OVER: DHS is advising airlines to continue complying with an U.S-EU agreement to share airline passengers\u2019 names, despite a European court decision that called the legality of a similar agreement with Canada into question. The European Court of Justice issued a legal opinion Wednesday saying EU lawmakers should not continue with an agreement with Canada that information about travelers between the two countries be collected, shared and stored because it infringed on privacy rights. DHS is reviewing the court\u2019s opinion and assessing whether it will impact the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement, a DHS spokesman said.  What\u2019s it all mean? Former DHS Deputy General Counsel Jonathan Meyer told MT that it could be \u201cproblematic\u201d if the EU adopted some of the court\u2019s suggestions. For example, the court took issue with Canada and EU agencies being allowed to store passenger data for up to five years, saying that was a \u201cparticularly long period of time.\u201d The court also recommended that travelers be notified whenever either country used their information or disclosed it to law enforcement. \u201cNotifying the individual is problematic when law enforcement is conducting an investigation and does not want the subject or target to know,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThe time limitation will be objectionable to some authorities because they like to use the data over time in their analyses.\u201d  SAFETY FIRST: The House Homeland Security Committee approved a slew of bills on Wednesday, including a measure (H.R. 3328 (115)) that would require TSA officials to take a closer look at who\u2019s working at Cuban airports and what safety measures are in place. The committee also approved legislation (H.R. 3359 (115)) that would establish a new agency within DHS dedicated to cybersecurity and infrastructure security. The new office would also include an emergency communications division.   BIN THERE, DONE THAT: As if taking off your shoes, measuring your liquids and separating your laptop weren\u2019t enough, travelers will soon have to start putting all electronics larger than a cell phone in bins for screening. TSA announced Wednesday that the new procedure, already piloted at 10 airports, will spread to all U.S. airports "during the weeks and months ahead." That means putting tablets, e-readers and handheld game consoles in a bin with nothing on top of or beneath it, the way laptops are handled. PreCheck travelers will be exempt.  LOBBYING UPDATE: Uber hired two firms \u2014 Peck Madigan Jones and Chambers, Conlon and Hartwell \u2014 to lobby for the company on self-driving car issues and FAA reauthorization, Pro Technology\u2019s Li Zhou reports.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and LAUREN GARDNER  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Heather Caygle, Sarah Ferris, Brianna Gurciullo and Tanya Snyder  FAA WHIPLASH: House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster told our Tanya Snyder on Tuesday that he\u2019s still trying to whip enough votes to get his FAA bill H.R. 2997 (115) on the chamber floor this week before lawmakers skedaddle for August recess \u2014 not 24 hours after he told Fox News that a vote to keep the agency running would have to wait until September. The Pennsylvania Republican is mining for \u201ca couple more\u201d votes. \u201cI don\u2019t just want to win, I want to win significantly,\u201d he said.  Story Continued Below  Real talk: The House has the balance of the week to wrap up a four-bill spending package before members skip town Friday. Barring some kind of massive appropriations meltdown this week, we\u2019re betting the FAA bill is going to become a September item on the calendar (provided Shuster gets his votes). Then we\u2019re in extension territory, when the question becomes: How long will the chambers give themselves for this boxing match?  The Bill Shuster FAA extension bill: Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, is dubious. "I just don't see that the votes are there," he told Tanya. But he\u2019s got an idea: "If they want to do extensions, we'll start naming extensions after members of Congress."  We also cover the Senate: Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune said Tuesday that the upper chamber\u2019s bill, S. 1405 (115), may have to wait until September for floor consideration. \u201cIt could be before the August break or it could be September,\u201d Thune said, pointing out that the Senate is tackling health care this week and potentially defense next week. An extension is \u201calways a possibility,\u201d he said, though it isn\u2019t his \u201cpreference.\u201d Meanwhile, Thune said talks are still in progress about his provision to alter the 1,500-hour rule for first officers in training, which the committee adopted during markup.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  SENATE THUD SPENDING BILL OFF TO FULL COMMITTEE: The Senate subcommittee responsible for DOT appropriations on Tuesday approved a fiscal 2018 spending bill that would supply the agency with about $19.5 billion in discretionary funding \u2014 $1.67 billion more than the House\u2019s legislation. The draft bill would bump up TIGER funding to $550 million, while the House bill would end the grant program altogether as President Donald Trump requested. The Senate panel also ignored Trump\u2019s requests to draw the Capital Investment Grant program to a close and sever funding for Essential Air Service and long-distance Amtrak service. The full committee will hold a markup Thursday.  About those PFCs \u2026 Airlines for America was out with a statement Tuesday objecting to any language in the Senate bill that would raise the federal limit on Passenger Facility Charges. \u201cWhile the committee has not made the bill language public, airport sources indicate that the subcommittee voted [Tuesday] to increase and nearly double the PFC tax from $4.50 to $8.50, which would result in a massive $3.2 billion tax hike on every air traveler who takes to the skies,\u201d A4A said. Airports Council International-North America and the American Association of Airport Executives are lauding the bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee only said in a release Tuesday that the legislation \u201cprovides greater flexibilities for airports to make much-needed capacity improvements.\u201d  Hot mic drop: Sen. Susan Collins isn\u2019t one to shy away from bashing the White House, but even she\u2019s not usually this blunt. Collins was caught with the tape rolling after a Senate appropriations panel Tuesday as she slammed OMB \u2014 and Trump \u2014 to a Democratic appropriator, Sen. Jack Reed. \u201cI swear, OMB just went through and whenever there was \u2018grant,\u2019 they just X it out,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWith no measurement, no thinking about it, no metrics, no nothing. It\u2019s just incredibly irresponsible.\u201d Reed responded, berating Trump as \u201ccrazy.\u201d Collins added, \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d Then, she took aim at Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows there is a BCA or anything,\u201d Collins said, referring to the Budget Control Act of 2011 that sets strict spending limits on Congress. (Of course, the juicy stuff is what Collins had to say about being challenged to a duel by Rep. Blake Farenthold. "He's huge,\u201d Collins said about the Texas Republican. \u201cHe's so unattractive, it's unbelievable.\u201d)  OPENING UP THE GATEWAY? New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will be in Washington today to meet with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Democratic members of the state\u2019s delegation, The New York Times scooped. His meeting with Chao comes as Congress continues to work on a spending bill that many would like to see send some money toward the Gateway project \u2014 and as the New York metro area slogs through a \u201csummer of hell\u201d with Amtrak and its commuter rail lines. Rep. Louise Slaughter, the New York delegation\u2019s dean, will host the meeting on the Hill \u201cto discuss state and national priorities, including protecting the [Affordable Care Act], federal transportation investments, and initiatives to making voting easier,\u201d according to an aide.  DON\u2019T FORGET ABOUT US: Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) said he\u2019s considering introducing legislation this year that could reinstate TSA\u2019s defunct air cargo security policy division, given the litany of complaints that he heard during a House Homeland Security subpanel hearing Tuesday. Stephen Alterman, president of the Cargo Airline Association, told lawmakers that aside from providing TSA with additional resources to oversee cargo security, Congress should push the agency to consolidate all of its air cargo officials under one division and not leave them scattered across the agency. \u201cI think there should be concentration of recognizing the unique place that air cargo plays in the world,\u201d he said. Brandon Fried, executive director of the Airforwarders Association, added that inconsistent policy interpretations during TSA inspections was one of the most frustrating things air transport companies are dealing with today.   DNDE EST EL AEROPUERTO? Katko also chatted with MT about a bill H.R. 3328 (115), he recently introduced that would tighten TSA oversight of commercial flights between the U.S. and Cuba. He said language in the legislation \u2014 which is slated to be marked up by the full House Homeland Security Committee today \u2014 calling for TSA to inspect the airport equipment and security procedures at Cuban airports is necessary to ensure American travelers are safe. \u201cLet\u2019s have a good look at the security protocols there and make sure they\u2019re up to snuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause TSA has very limited access to them, and they basically have to rely on what the Cuban government is telling them.\u201d The bill would also require TSA to standardize its process for signing agreements to allow U.S. air marshals on scheduled, commercial flights. That portion is not specific to Cuba, Katko said.   Reminder: Katko was among a group of Homeland Security Committee members that were denied visas to enter Cuba last year. And he has been generally supportive of Trump\u2019s plan to impose new restrictions on travel between the U.S. and Cuba, and to roll back some of the Obama administration policies that sought to normalize relations.   LAPTOP BAN UPDATE: Cuban and other point-of-departure airports with flights to the United States are still on the hook to implement new security measures introduced last month by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. A DHS spokesman said TSA officials were now working with 280 international airports and 180 airlines on the next phase of the process. This phase will include additional technological updates and increased use of bomb-sniffing dogs at each airport, he said. Airlines and airports have a total of 120 days to complete implementation or face penalties that could include a complete ban on passengers carrying large electronics and the suspension of flights to the U.S.  YOU MAY ENTER: The Coast Guard has decided that it doesn\u2019t need to completely block public access to the portion of the Potomac River that runs adjacent to President Trump\u2019s Virginia golf course when he's there. Instead of blocking off the two-mile stretch of river for Trump and other golf-loving administration officials, the Coast Guard will work with Secret Service to escort members of the public through that area, Adm. Paul Zukunft told a House Transportation subpanel Tuesday. The Coast Guard has issued an interim rule that would lay out the parameters of the process. The public comment period closes on Aug. 9. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re looking at, through this public comment period, is can they create an unescorted portion of the river that will allow people, again, free access through there,\u201d a DHS spokesman said.   NTSB: NO ONE TO BLAME BUT THE VICTIM: At a board meeting Tuesday, NTSB determined that all safety mechanisms were in place and functioning properly at the time of a deadly 2015 train crash outside of Valhalla, N.Y. When the railroad gate closed on top of her SUV, Ellen Schaeffer Brody got out to assess the damage, seemingly unaware that a train was coming \u2014 and then got back in her vehicle and proceeded forward onto the tracks. Despite the sounding of the train horn, the flashing of the lights, and the reflective paint on the pavement indicating the presence of a railroad crossing, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that she thought she was on a railroad track or close to a railroad track.\u201d He chalked it up to a \u201closs of situational awareness.\u201d  Next steps: NTSB recommended that jurisdictions with third rail systems at or near highway-railroad grade crossings conduct risk assessments and take steps to mitigate any safety issues that may arise, but the discussion of probable cause focused on the driver\u2019s actions.  Grieving husband slams the process: \u201cWhat you saw was a bunch of engineers talk about how they need to protect the status quo,\u201d said Alan Brody, the widower of the SUV driver who died in the crash, after the meeting. \u201cNothing will be fixed from today.\u201d Brody said the rail crossing signs are invisible at night and that \u201ceven the town knows that [the crossing] is inherently unsafe.\u201d Indeed, the town wants to close down the crossing, which remains open for now.

aV \u000a            By LAUREN GARDNER and STEPHANIE BEASLEY  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Kathryn A. Wolfe  HEADS UP: The Senate Appropriations subcommittee in charge of transportation spending will mark up its draft fiscal 2018 funding bill today, and according to an action alert distributed by the American Association of Airport Executives and obtained by POLITICO, the mark may contain a long-sought hike for the cap on Passenger Facility Charges. The group says they\u2019re expecting the draft to raise the cap from $4.50 to $8.50 \u2014 along with a $250 million bump for the Airport Improvement Program, with some caveats. The alert calls on members to press their senators to keep the language, as the \u201cairlines and their allies are already hard at work trying to make sure any proposed PFC increase is defeated soundly.\u201d  Story Continued Below  Someone else got the message: Americans for Tax Reform reiterated its opposition to a fee hike in a letter to appropriators Monday. Read it here.  Check's in the mail: Based on that subcommittee\u2019s recent hearing on transportation spending, we\u2019re expecting some big differences (per usual) from the House measure. For one, don\u2019t expect subcommittee cardinal Susan Collins (R-Maine) to sacrifice the TIGER grant program, which has been consistently funded at the $500 million mark annually, for other priorities \u2014 she\u2019s on-record as a big booster of the program despite the Trump administration\u2019s desire to do away with it. That being said, we\u2019ll be looking for the panel to propose some way \u2014 as the House did \u2014 to send a chunk of money to the Gateway program, a top priority for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Northeast lawmakers. While the Senate subcommittee has a few billion more to play with than the House did at about $60.1 billion total, keep in mind this bill also has to fund housing programs.  Trains and planes: Collins has been historically friendly to Amtrak, which has a state-supported route running through her home state, and to transit grant programs. Once the text is released (later this week, after the full committee marks up on Thursday), we\u2019ll be watching for how the committee words DOT\u2019s responsibilities for carrying out the Capital Investment Grant program, which the administration has suggested winding down. And the Essential Air Service, another rural-focused program Trump proposed for the chopping block, is unlikely to be slashed dramatically, if at all.  About that recess \u2026 : Meanwhile, House GOP appropriators are agitating for leadership to delay the August recess so the chamber can consider a trillion-dollar omnibus spending package catering to the party\u2019s base, POLITICO\u2019s Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris write. \u201cIf leadership decides to reverse course and pursue a full GOP spending package, it\u2019s likely the House will stay in session for another week, delaying the first week of recess,\u201d they report.

What better way to start your day than with tunes (picked by us and readers) that are all about flying, driving, commuting and sailing?  NTSB MEETS ON GRADE-CROSSING CRASH: The NTSB meets this morning to determine the probable cause of a 2015 train crash in suburban New York that killed five Metro-North passengers and the driver of an SUV that had stopped on the tracks at a grade crossing. The meeting has been a long time coming \u2014 NTSB investigations typically take between 12 months and 18 months to complete, and this one clocks in at nearly 18 \u2014 and The Journal News has a primer here with background and some things to expect. Sarah Feinberg, the most recent FRA administrator, focused a significant portion of her tenure on improving safety at grade-crossings. Ron Batory, who\u2019s been nominated as her successor for the Trump administration, appears before the Senate Commerce Committee Wednesday, and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone like Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) decides to interrogate him about how he plans to address NTSB\u2019s recommendations for improving rail safety (in this case or for any number of train accidents that have happened in the last few years \u2014 including many in his state).  WAY BETTER DEAL? Congressional Democrats unveiled their \u201cBetter Deal\u201d agenda (which House Republicans wasted little time ripping for sounding a lot like Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d platform) Monday in exurban Northern Virginia. They vowed to propose at least one more infrastructure-focused policy idea in the coming weeks that could be bolted onto the $1 trillion plan Senate Democrats unveiled months ago. \u201cNow, in future weeks we\u2019ll offer additional ideas, from rebuilding rural America to fundamentally changing our trade laws to benefit workers, not multinational corporations,\u201d Schumer said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also couldn\u2019t resist dinging President Donald Trump for not yet following through on his infrastructure pledge. \u201cWe are here with no jobs bill, no infrastructure bill, no tax reform legislation, no plan to avert the debt default,\u201d she said.  OUT WITH THE OLD \u2026 : Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Monday appointed David Horner and Steve McMillin to the board of directors for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, replacing two Obama-era appointees that had not finished their terms, our Brianna Gurciullo reports. Horner is a partner at Hunton & Williams and focuses on public-private partnerships. McMillin is a partner at U.S. Policy Metrics and former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. The two take over for Carol Carmody and David Strickland, both former federal transportation safety officials and both appointed to multi-year terms last year by former DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx. They were asked to step down from their positions as two of the board\u2019s eight voting members.   Chao\u2019s stamp: Board members told the Washington Post that they were aware of Chao\u2019s plans to make the switch this week. Chao said in a statement that she was pleased to have appointed two \u201cdistinguished and experienced individuals\u201d who would help \u201cimprove the performance and reliability of this vital transit system in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d However, former Metro Special Advisor Katie Thomson (who was also appointed by Foxx) said replacing former NTSB member Carmody, in particular, was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d if safety was a priority for DOT.   TOOT TOOT: Tugboats, towboats and barges are moving about 763 million tons of cargo and generating more than $33.8 billion in gross domestic product, according to a new study from the American Waterways Operators and Pricewaterhouse Coopers highlighting the importance of waterway infrastructure. AWO has been pressing lawmakers to include funding for inland and coastal waterway repairs in any infrastructure package that might be developed over the next year. The group also has pressed Congress to pass legislation that would put the U.S. Coast Guard in charge of determining how commercial vessels should get rid of wastewater, the American Waterways Operators said. The group issued a list of policy priorities that included passage of the Commercial Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (S. 168 (115)) \u2014 a bill introduced by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) that would give the Coast Guard authority to consolidate and issue new federal regulations for ballast water discharge standards.  MT MAILBAG: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent House Energy and Commerce leaders a letter Monday voicing support for their draft self-driving vehicle bill, which a subcommittee approved last week. "This legislation is a critical step towards capitalizing on the opportunities of this technology as long as it continues to be technologically neutral, promote coordination in legislation, and support innovation and market competition," Chamber reps wrote to committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and ranking Democrat Frank Pallone of New Jersey.

aV \u000a            By STEPHANIE BEASLEY and BRIANNA GURCIULLO  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Tanya Snyder  STRIKE TWO: The FAA bill was once again notably absent from the weekly schedule House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthydistributed Saturday. After raising expectations for a vote last week, and then having to pull back when the vote count wasn\u2019t in his favor, Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) has been hesitant to publicly target a specific timeframe for a floor vote. But clearly the failure to pass the bill before August recess would be a major blow for Shuster, and \u2014 assuming nothing else changes \u2014 will necessitate what\u2019s already been all but a foregone conclusion for the past few weeks: an extension.   Story Continued Below  Ray of hope: The fine print of McCarthy\u2019s schedule holds out a thin lifeline for Shuster. At the bottom of the list is the line, \u201cAdditional Legislative Items are Possible.\u201d That caveat frequently appears below the weekly schedule, but no doubt Shuster is hoping that this week it means the FAA bill still has a shot. As he told MT last week, \u201cwe\u2019re whipping it every single day; every minute,\u201d and no doubt once he has the 218th vote sewn up he\u2019ll be running to the floor.   Don\u2019t forget: The Senate doesn\u2019t have any air traffic control spinoff language, but a version championed by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) is still having trouble getting buy-in, due to language inserted at committee that would weaken the rule that pilots must have 1,500 hours of flight time before getting certified to fly commercially. Lawmakers are working toward a compromise, but so far nothing has emerged.

E-CIG BAN HERE TO STAY: A federal court of appeals Friday shot down arguments for lifting DOT\u2019s ban on using e-cigarettes on planes, our Tanya Snyder reported for Pros. Among the three judges, one \u201cruled in favor of DOT based on the principle of Chevron deference, which means that courts tend to defer to agencies\u2019 interpretations of the statutes that require them to take action,\u201d Tanya writes. \u201cAnother judge said that even without invoking Chevron deference, e-cigarettes are just similar enough to cigarettes to fall under the ban.\u201d  LYFT JOINS DRIVERLESS CAR RUSH: Lyft is developing its own driverless car technology and plans to hire hundreds of new workers to help with the project, Pro Technology\u2019s Li Zhou reports. The ridesharing company has created a new driverless car division that it says will compete with Uber and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo. Lyft has previously collaborated with Waymo and announced plans to test automated cars with nuTonomy in Boston later this year.   KATKO EYEBALLS CUBAN AIRPORT SECURITY: Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) introduced a bill that would require U.S. officials to examine security measures and equipment at Cuban airports. The legislation, H.R. 3328 (115), would also require TSA to create a standard process for signing agreements with the Cuban government to allow U.S. air marshals on scheduled flights between the two countries.

"In the White House, Mr. Trump has continued to dangle the possibility of 'a great national infrastructure program' that would create 'millions" of new jobs as part of a public-private partnership to rival the public works achievements of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower,\u201d Thrush writes. \u201cBut an ambitious public works plan, arguably his best chance of rising above the partisan rancor of his first six months in office, is fast becoming an afterthought - at precisely the moment Mr. Trump needs a big, unifying issue to rewrite the narrative of his chaotic administration.

aV \u000a            By BENJAMIN WERMUND  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Michael Stratford, Caitlin Emma and Mel Leonor  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SPARKS AGE-OLD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FIGHT: News that the Justice Department may soon begin investigating whether colleges are discriminating in the way they use race in admissions set off a firestorm this week. The Supreme Court ruled just last year that colleges can use race in admissions, but experts say that doesn\u2019t preclude the administration from targeting colleges \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t mean that opponents of race-based admissions policies will stop working to end them. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this fight for 40 years, at least,\u201d said Rachel Kleinman, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which defends affirmative action policies in court. \u201cWe\u2019re realistic that whenever you think something is settled, the challenges still pop up.\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know about the issue.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 The Supreme Court has ruled multiple times that schools can use race as a factor in admissions. Most recently, the court ruled that the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s use of race was appropriate, because it was narrowly tailored and because the school proved that it needed to consider race in order to build a diverse student body. Those are the hurdles schools must clear to prove their use of race in admissions policies is legal.   \u2014 Still, the issue is likely to find its way back to the high court eventually \u2014 and could be decided by a very different set of justices. The group that challenged UT Austin\u2019s policies, Students for Fair Admissions, has sued both Harvard and the University of North Carolina. (Notably, Edward Blum, who heads that group, told the Boston Globe that he was \u201cbefuddled\u201d by the DOJ news and hadn\u2019t heard from anyone there.) While those lawsuits are still likely a long way from the high court, if they make it there, \u201cI am sure the issue will go back to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 the only question is when,\u201d said Vinay Harpalani, an associate professor of law at the Savannah Law School. The makeup of the court, which could change dramatically during President Donald Trump\u2019s term, will matter greatly on this issue. Justice Anthony Kennedy swung the court in UT\u2019s favor, and if President Donald Trump has a chance to replace him or one of the liberal justices \u201cthen that\u2019s a major change on this specific issue,\u201d said Jesse Choper, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley.   \u2014 It remains unclear what the Justice Department was, or still is, planning on this front. An internal Justice Department posting seeking lawyers for "investigations and possible litigation" relating to university affirmative action policies, first reported earlier this week by The New York Times, was actually a call for volunteers to work on a complaint alleging discrimination against Asian-American applicants at Harvard, not a sweeping policy change, the department says. But the groups that filed that complaint told Morning Education they haven\u2019t heard from the department and are only cautiously optimistic that their complaint will actually be taken up \u2014 especially after all of the backlash the news drew. \u201cWhat if upon all this political maneuvering the DOJ will back down,\u201d said Chunyan Li, a spokeswoman for the coalition that filed the complaint.   \u2014 If the department does begin to investigate college admissions practices, it will, at the very least, be sending a message to schools, advocates fear. \u201cIf you hear the Justice Department is coming after schools, whether or not you\u2019re doing the right thing under the law, that will certainly chill universities,\u201d Kleinman at the NAACP LDF said. For their part, colleges and universities have voiced strong opposition to any crackdown on affirmative action from the Trump administration. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by news reports about the Department of Justice\u2019s interest in exploring legal action against universities that would undermine schools\u2019 ability to use Supreme Court-sanctioned, race-conscious admissions practices as part of a holistic process,\u201d Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said in a statement.   \u2014 Also of note: Most Americans are opposed to the use of race in college admissions, according to a Gallup poll taken after last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling. Seven in 10 Americans said merit should be the only basis for college admissions, and 65 percent said they disagreed with the Supreme Court decision. Some, meanwhile, have speculated that if the administration does seek to challenge race-based admissions, it will be a play to its base. \u201cAs they are doing with Kris Kobach\u2019s misguided efforts to prove voting fraud, this is a thinly-veiled effort to reach aggrieved whites who are looking for someone to blame and to demonize,\u201d said Michael A. Olivas, a law professor and higher education policy expert at the University of Houston. \u201cThere is no evidence that whites are displaced due to admissions for students of color, and SCOTUS has, since 1978, upheld modest uses of [affirmative action] for diversity.\u201d  HAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION. I really like this take from The Ringer on Randy Newman, who has a new album out today: \u201cIn Newman\u2019s songs, we can see an American history with all its luminescence and hope, but mostly its pain and betrayal. Newman investigates the skeletons in our closets, the gunk between our toes, the hate that drives us to make bad choices. And sometimes he tells us how to be good friends.\u201d Tips? Feedback?

STATES DIAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FOR ESSA FEEDBACK: Eight states are in the process of gathering federal feedback on their Every Student Succeeds Act plans, and at least three have had phone calls with federal officials in recent days. The calls come after the Education Department last week announced that it was changing the feedback process. This summer, the department had been publicly posting letters to states outlining initial comments or concerns, in addition to comments from a team of experts known as peer reviewers. Those letters got a lot of blowback from states and policy experts for being confusing, inconsistent or heavy-handed. Now, the agency is first discussing peer reviewer comments with states over the phone, giving them an opportunity to address any issues before a letter is posted publicly. After the phone call happens, the clock starts \u2014 states have 15 days to make changes, tweaks or clarifications to their plans. Some worry the process change could potentially shield from public view the back-and-forth between state and federal officials over the development of state ESSA plans.  \u2014 D.C. had its call with the Education Department on Tuesday. Maine and Michigan spoke to the feds Wednesday. Vermont is scheduled for a call early next week. D.C. Superintendent Hanseul Kang told Morning Education, \u201cWe appreciate the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s thorough review of D.C.\u2019s ESSA state plan. We are carefully reviewing the feedback we received from the department while keeping at the forefront the question of what will be most meaningful for our students, educators and schools, within our unique context.\u201d  \u2014 A spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Education declined to elaborate on where federal officials felt there was room for improvement in the state\u2019s plan. But she said, \u201cThe conversation highlighted a few areas that Maine\u2019s plan needed additional context, or further clarification, and there were a few sections that needed specific language to ensure that it aligned with the statute.\u201d  \u2014 Michigan Superintendent Brian Whiston told The Detroit News, \u201cWe were told that the secretary\u2019s determination will be based on compliance with the letter of the law only, and no subjective judgments on what is in the plan. This is in line with what Secretary DeVos promised about giving more flexibility and control back to the states on what they think is best for their state.\u201d Michigan initially submitted a plan this spring that included three options for grading schools. The state has since decided to use a \u201cdashboard\u201d of data approach. Whiston said federal officials want to see more information about how the dashboard will be designed and used to identify low-performing schools.   \u2014 Several weeks ago, Whiston said he was taken aback by a phone call that he had with Jason Botel, acting assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education. Botel reportedly questioned why Michigan\u2019s plan was incomplete, even though DeVos earlier this year said states could hand in their plans even if they still had to fill in some blanks. Whiston accused the Education Department of overreach after months of DeVos messaging flexibility to states.   SENATE CONFIRMS TRUMP EDUCATION NOMINEE: The Senate on Thursday confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be assistant secretary of education for legislation. Peter Oppenheim, an aide to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), was confirmed to the post through unanimous consent in the Senate, as it approved dozens of Trump nominees in bulk as part of an agreement reached between Democrats and Republicans. POLITICO first reported in April that Oppenheim was a front-runner for the job.   \u2014 Oppenheim is the first Education Department nominee confirmed by the Senate since DeVos was confirmed earlier this year with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tiebreaking vote on her nomination. He was a key figure in drafting and passing the Every Student Succeeds Act, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.  \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had previously signaled that she might put up a fight over the nomination, citing what she said was DeVos\u2019 lack of responsiveness to Democrats\u2019 inquiries. Warren wrote last week in a letter to Oppenheim that she was concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s Education Department had been \u201cnegligent in its duty to respond\u201d to congressional inquiries. But no senator objected to the nomination on the Senate floor on Thursday.  \u2014 Trump\u2019s sole other Education Department nominee \u2014 Florida attorney Carlos Muiz to be general counsel \u2014 remains pending before the Senate HELP Committee. Michael Stratford has more.   \u2014 DeVos said of Oppenheim\u2019s confirmation: \u201cPeter has spent his career working tirelessly on behalf of our nation\u2019s students, and I am thrilled he will continue that work here at the Department of Education. Peter\u2019s policy knowledge and expertise will be a tremendous asset to this Administration as we continue to fulfill the President\u2019s pledge to empower parents and ensure every child, no matter where they grow up, has access to a world-class education that meets their needs now and in the future.\u201d  IN TOWN TODAY \u2014 NAEP UPDATE: The National Assessment Governing Board \u2014 the body charged with overseeing the National Assessment of Educational Progress assessment \u2014 will be discussing what\u2019s ahead for NAEP at its quarterly meeting in Washington, D.C., today. Board members and stakeholders are planning to discuss the NAEP schedule and hold talks on the design and dissemination of the assessment. Peggy Carr, acting commissioner for the National Center for Education Statistics, will talk about what\u2019s ahead for the agency, and NCES staff will break down its High School Transcript Study. See the full agenda.  AFT JOINS ARMS WITH PUERTO RICO TEACHERS UNION: The American Federation of Teachers and the Asociacin de Maestros de Puerto Rico \u2014 which represents 40,000 teachers on the island \u2014 voted to affiliate Thursday. Both parties signed a trial affiliation agreement that will carry over through the next three years, as AFT works with AMPR and its locals to help with collective bargaining in the financially embattled U.S. territory. \u201cEvery country wants to improve its economic and social situation, but in Puerto Rico teachers haven\u2019t been treated fairly,\u201d AMPR President Aida Diaz said. \u201cWith the AFT, we can work hand in hand to improve our working conditions and reclaim all that has been denied to us.\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten said she is looking forward to mobilizing AFT\u2019s new members for better working conditions and education opportunities on the island.

aV \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma, Kimberly Hefling, Mel Leonor and Benjamin Wermund  DOJ DENIES BROAD ATTACK ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, SAYS IT\u2019S INVESTIGATING COMPLAINT OF ANTI-ASIAN BIAS AT HARVARD: The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back against news reports that it is seeking to curb affirmative action programs at colleges and universities \u2014 but confirmed that the Justice Department is investigating a complaint filed by Asian-American groups accusing Harvard University of racial bias in admissions.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 An internal Justice Department posting seeking lawyers for \u201cinvestigations and possible litigation" relating to university affirmative action policies was a call for volunteers to work on a complaint alleging discrimination against Asian-American applicants at Harvard, not a sweeping policy change, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday.  \u2014 The internal document, described in a New York Times report on Tuesday evening, set the higher education and civil rights worlds ablaze, as supporters of affirmative action worried that Attorney General Jeff Sessions was seeking to marshal the resources of the Justice Department against race-conscious university admissions policies.  \u2014 "The posting sought volunteers to investigate one administrative complaint filed by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations in May 2015 that the prior Administration left unresolved," Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. Those groups, led by the Asian-American Coalition for Education, filed complaints with both the Education and Justice departments alleging that Harvard discriminated against Asian-American applicants based on their race. The Education Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights dismissed the complaint in July 2015, citing an ongoing lawsuit against the university over similar issues. But the complaint remains pending with the Civil Rights Division at DOJ.  \u2014 \u201cThis Department of Justice has not received or issued any directive, memorandum, initiative, or policy related to university admissions in general,\u201d Flores said in the statement. \u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination.\u201d Read more.

GI BILL EXPANSION HEADS TO PRESIDENT\u2019S DESK: A bill that would inject more than $3 billion in additional benefits over the next decade under the Post-9/11 GI Bill to veterans and their families to pay for higher education was sent to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it. The Senate on Wednesday cleared the bipartisan bill, which veterans groups have long sought, by unanimous consent. The legislation has been dubbed the \u201cForever GI Bill\u201d because one key component removes, for new enlistees, a requirement that the education benefit be used within 15 years. Purple Heart recipients and Reserve troops are among the groups of vets who see expanded benefits under the bill. It would also fully restore the GI Bill education benefits for veterans who were affected by the collapse in recent years of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech \u201cThis is what collaboration looks like, and this is what leadership looks like,\u201d said Jared Lyon, the president of Student Veterans of America.

DEVOS, U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE TO RENEW SECURITY AGREEMENT: The U.S. Marshals Service and the Education Department plan to renew an agreement to continue providing protective services for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a spokesman for the Marshals Service tells Pro Education\u2019s Caitlin Emma. Earlier this year, the Marshals signed a memorandum of understanding with the agency to provide protective services for DeVos for up to four years, \u201csubject to the availability of funds and current threat assessments.\u201d The Education Department at the time agreed to reimburse the Marshals Service an estimated total of $7.78 million for services spanning mid-February through September 30, or the end of the fiscal year. Now, both parties \u201cplan to renew the reimbursement agreement beyond Sept. 30, which will continue the memorandum of understanding between the agencies for the protective detail for Secretary DeVos,\u201d a Marshals Service spokesman said. The spokesman could not provide details about the anticipated cost or length of the reimbursement agreement and could not discuss specifics about threats to DeVos\u2019 safety. The past four Education secretaries have been protected by the Education Department\u2019s own small security force.  JUDGE AGAIN SCOLDS DOJ ATTORNEYS IN EDUCATION DEPT. DEBT COLLECTION CONTRACTING DISPUTE: The federal judge overseeing a legal battle involving the Education Department\u2019s contracts with debt collection companies apparently isn\u2019t happy that she wasn\u2019t informed about DeVos\u2019 decision this week to scrap a planned loan servicing overhaul. In an order issued Wednesday evening, U.S. Court of Federal Claims Chief Judge Susan G. Braden appeared to chastise the DOJ attorneys representing the Education Department in the case for not informing her of the loan servicing announcement \u2014 and ordered them to produce a status report about the case by the end of tomorrow.  \u2014 \u201cOnce again, the Department of Justice has failed to inform the court of these developments,\u201d the Braden wrote in her order, citing POLITICO and Inside Higher Ed stories from earlier this week describing DeVos\u2019 change of course on student loan servicing.  \u2014 Braden did not explain in her order why she believes the debt collection and loan servicing contracts are connected. The Education Department has a set of contracts with debt collection firms that pursue borrowers who have defaulted on their federal loans; those are separate from the department\u2019s contracts with loan servicing companies, which manage the payments of federal borrowers whose student loans are in good standing.  \u2014 Braden earlier this year issued an order blocking the Education Department from assigning defaulted loans to any of its debt collectors as she resolves a dispute over whether the department acted unfairly in awarding contracts to some of the companies. In May, Braden extended her injunction against the department, criticizing DOJ attorneys for not informing her about the resignation of James Runcie as chief of federal student aid and a policy proposal reportedly under consideration that would shift the student loan program to the Treasury Department.  \u2014 A federal appeals court last month balked at the Trump administration\u2019s emergency request to reverse Braden\u2019s injunction, which the government says has prevented it from collecting defaulted student loans and deprived hundreds of thousands of borrowers of the ability to get their loans out of default.   COURT SAYS TITLE IX DOESN\u2019T PROTECT TEEN BECAUSE SHE WASN\u2019T A STUDENT: A recent ruling on Title IX addresses an odd wrinkle in the law: Does it require colleges to protect only their students, or also those, including high schoolers, on campus as prospective students? A federal appeals court said only the prior and tossed out a lawsuit by a 16-year-old high school junior who says she was assaulted at a fraternity party while visiting Culver-Stockton College in Missouri, because she wasn\u2019t a student at the college. The teen, who spent the night at the college as a potential athletics recruit, claimed the college violated Title IX by failing to prevent the assault. Inside Higher Ed has more.   \u2014 Meanwhile, the Education Department's civil rights office continues to open new investigations into allegations that colleges and universities mishandled sexual assault cases \u2014 including six just this week \u2014 despite the Trump administration's plans to change guidance for schools dealing with allegations of sexual violence. The Office for Civil Rights opened new investigations this week at Humboldt State University in California, the University of Florida, Michigan State, Ohio State, Ursinus College in Pennsylvania and the University of Texas at San Antonio. They bring the ever-growing list of Title IX probes to 350 at 246 colleges and universities.  \u2014 But the office this week also closed two cases \u2014 at Grinnell College in Iowa and Princeton \u2014 as investigators works to cut down on the lengthy backlog. They're under new marching orders from Candice Jackson, the acting head of the civil rights office, who told investigators to use a shorter scope than they previously had. Both of those cases were closed administratively without findings of wrongdoing. Benjamin Wermund has more.   ICYMI, GAVIN GRIMM\u2019S CASE SENT BACK TO TRIAL COURT: The case of Gavin Grimm, the Virginia teen at the center of a high-profile legal battle over transgender student rights, is back in federal district court. Grimm graduated high school in June. His attorneys argue that his case \u2014 in which he\u2019s suing for access to the boy\u2019s bathroom at his high school under Title IX \u2014 is still relevant because Grimm could return to school as an alumni and still be subjected to discrimination. Attorneys for the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia have argued that Grimm's graduation makes the case moot. Now, the three-judge panel on the 4th Circuit wants the trial court to decide if that\u2019s the case. Caitlin Emma has more.  COLORADO UNION STEPS UP TEACHER DEVELOPMENT: The Colorado arm of the National Education Association is partnering with professional development planform Edthena to deliver teacher-to-teacher professional support to its members. The union\u2019s partnership with Edthena will expand its professional development offerings by using video to connect teachers hoping to improve their skills, while fulfilling the training requirements imposed by their districts. \u201cUsing Edthena, teachers can record their classroom instruction and receive feedback from other educators who they respect and trust,\u201d the union said. \u201cVideo coaching also allows teachers to become an active part of the evaluation process.\u201d   BIPARTISAN PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE AID TO STUDENT PARENTS: Bipartisan bills introduced in the House and Senate this week propose a boost in federal funding for on-campus child care tapped by student parents across the country. The bills would reauthorize the Child Care Access Means Parents In School program and quadruple investment in the program, which is now under threat of being axed under the House Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. The bills, titled CCAMPIS Reauthorization Act, were introduced by Reps. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and Don Young (R-Alaska) in the House, and Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bob Casey (D-Penn.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in the Senate.   \u2014 \u201cAs the costs of college and child care continue to climb, too many students and families are struggling to make ends meet,\u201d Murray, ranking member of the Senate HELP committee, said. \u201cWe must invest in student parents as they invest in their families\u2019 futures.\u201d   GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT REMINDER: Even as the Trump administration takes steps to delay parts of the Obama-era \u201cgainful employment\u201d and eventually re-write it completely, the regulation remains on the books. The Education Department on Wednesday reminded colleges and universities that they have until October 1 to submit a new round of data about their career college programs that are subject to the rules.

aV \u000a            By BENJAMIN WERMUND  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma, Mel Leonor, Kimberly Hefling, Josh Gerstein and Michael Stratford  OMAROSA MEETING WITH HBCU LEADERS THIS WEEK: White House aide Omarosa Manigault, who is spearheading the Trump administration\u2019s outreach to historically black colleges and universities, is meeting with several HBCU leaders this week \u2014 at a time when some of the leaders have become impatient with the Trump administration\u2019s approach to the schools.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 The leaders are still waiting on a couple of changes President Donald Trump promised when he signed a much-ballyhooed executive order designed to woo the schools. That order said his administration would move an initiative aimed at boosting HBCUs from the Education Department to the White House \u2014 a move that many college leaders hoped would give them a direct line to the president, but six months later, still hasn\u2019t happened, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The initiative, meanwhile, has no leader \u2014 marking the longest a president has gone without naming one, Inside Higher Ed reports.   \u2014 "There was a big display of love and support on the front end, and right now it\u2019s sort of like, \u2018OK, where are we?\u2019" Walter Kimbrough, president of Dillard University, told the Chronicle. He and other HBCU leaders have been skeptical of the administration from the start, blasting a \u201clistening session\u201d before the executive order signing as little more than a photo opp for the president. "There was very little listening to HBCU presidents today," Kimbrough wrote at the time.  \u2014 But Manigault, Trump\u2019s point person on HBCUs, told Morning Education that she is \u201cworking closely with the HBCU community in preparation for the official launch of the White House HBCU office.\u201d The administration has worked \u201cdiligently to interview and meet with all of the candidates that were submitted through our various HBCU channels,\u201d Manigault said in a written response to questions. She said they are now going through the final stages of the process and will have an announcement soon. \u201cIn terms of those who are frustrated that the government hiring and vetting process is taking too long all I can say to them is that \u2018we will not and CAN NOT cut corners,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy law every candidate must go through the same process, the same screenings and the same background checks. That process takes time \u2014 plain and simple.\u201d  \u2014 Manigault said she is \u201cconducting nearly 20 different meetings over the next 4 days\u201d at a conference in Florida hosted by the umbrella organization of the nation's HBCUs, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education.  MEANWHILE IN PENNSYLVANIA: The fight to save the country\u2019s oldest HBCU continues as Sen. Bob Casey and Rep. Dwight Evans, both Pennsylvania Democrats, wrote to the chancellor of state\u2019s system of higher education urging him to do anything he can to protect Cheyney University\u2019s accreditation, which the school is at risk of losing. The university has faced a financial crisis and dwindling enrollment. \u201cWhile Cheyney\u2019s path has been a rocky one, we believe they are committed to ensuring a strong path forward,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Monday. \u201cWe remain optimistic Cheyney will show they have taken the steps needed to ensure the viability of the institution and will ensure we pursue all federal options, as is our duty to the people who live in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d  GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THE CROSSHAIRS: Colleges and universities that discriminate against white applicants appear to be the target of a new project by the Justice Department. The New York Times, citing an internal document, reported late Tuesday that the Trump administration is preparing to redirect resources from the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division to investigate and sue universities over admissions policies that disadvantage whites. The division is seeking lawyers who want to work on \u201cinvestigations and possible litigation related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions," the Times reported. The Times did not publish a copy of the internal document. But the newspaper said it suggests the effort will be operated out of the division\u2019s front office, where the Trump administration\u2019s political appointees do business.  \u2014 The move would come just a year after the Supreme Court upheld that the University of Texas' program admitting some students based on consideration of their race is constitutional but cautioned that the university must continue to show that other means of addressing diversity have failed. An American Council on Education survey found in 2015 that about 60 percent of the most selective four-year schools consider race in admissions. Eight states ban race-based admissions for public institutions. Kimberly Hefling and Caitlin Emma have more.   \u2014 The news drew outrage from civil rights groups Tuesday night. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said such a move would \u201cwaste taxpayer resources relitigating last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling. Affirmative action is rooted in our nation\u2019s fundamental commitment to equality, a commitment this Administration woefully lacks and has expressed hostility towards.\u201d  \u2014 Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division under President Barack Obama who is now president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told POLITICO that \u201cIt kind of is turning civil rights laws on their head and away from the purpose for which they were enacted, which is to ensure racial diversity and inclusion in higher ed institutions and prevent discrimination against marginalized, vulnerable or historically disadvantaged communities.\u201d She said she believes the administration \u201cwill likely be trying to set back the work schools and colleges are doing to try to ensure diverse student bodies.\u201d  DEVOS DROPS PLAN TO OVERHAUL STUDENT LOAN SERVICING: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday abandoned her plan to overhaul how the federal government collects payments from the nation\u2019s more than 42 million student loan borrowers after it faced growing resistance from congressional Republicans and Democrats. The Trump administration announced that it was scrapping plans to award a massive contract to a single company to manage the monthly payments of all student loan borrowers, and said it would come up with a new proposal aimed at improving customer service for student loan payments.  \u2014 \u201cBy starting afresh and pursuing a truly modern loan servicing environment, we have a chance to turn what was a good plan into a great one,\u201d DeVos said in a statement.  \u2014 The Education Department announcement came several hours after a bipartisan group of senators unveiled legislation that would have blocked DeVos\u2019 plans. The bill \u2014 sponsored by Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) \u2014 would require the department to keep its current system of \u201cmultiple student loan servicers.\u201d  \u2014 Liz Hill, a department spokeswoman, told POLITICO that the announcement on Tuesday was not a response to the legislation. The changes, she said, had \u201cbeen under consideration\u201d since DeVos tapped A. Wayne Johnson as the new head of student aid in June and he \u201cbrought his fresh perspective and private sector experience\u201d to the project.  \u2014 Warren said in a statement that she\u2019s \u201cglad the Education Department is changing course, but it will be important to continue watching the department to evaluate whether its decisions are good for the millions of struggling federal student loan borrowers.\u201d  \u2014 Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the House education committee, said she believes DeVos \u201cmade the right decision to cancel the single-servicer proposal,\u201d spokesman Michael Woeste said in a statement to POLITICO.   \u2014 Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander also praised DeVos\u2019 change in plans, saying the department\u2019s new approach \u201cshould make it simpler for students to manage their loans\u201d and that he hopes it \u201cwill result in competition and better service."  \u2014 What\u2019s next? Department officials said they will solicit feedback from student loan industry groups and \u201cvarious stakeholders\u201d as they develop a new plan. That new approach will involve a single platform for back-end processing and data storage. But department officials said they haven\u2019t yet decided whether to hire a single company or multiple providers for the consumer-facing account servicing. Michael Stratford has more here.  STATES LOOK TO FEDS FOR TESTING FLEXIBILITY: Florida, Kentucky and New Jersey are all asking federal officials for flexibility when it comes to testing in their plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Florida and New Jersey both want more wiggle room for a provision of the law that allows eighth-grade students enrolled in advanced math to avoid "double testing," letting them take an advanced math test for accountability and avoid taking their grade-level test. In a waiver request, New Jersey says it wants to extend that rule to lower middle school grades, not just eighth grade. \u201cSince so many New Jersey middle school students have been successful in advanced-level mathematics coursework, it is in the best interest of students to administer end-of-course mathematics assessments that align with students\u2019 coursework rather than the grade-level exam,\u201d the state says in its request.   \u2014 Florida says in its waiver request that it wants to do the same, in addition to including science tests. The state is also asking for flexibility on how it tests English-language learners. POLITICO Florida reported early last month that the state wants an expansive waiver from federal requirements in order to preserve a school grading system developed under former Gov. Jeb Bush.  \u2014 Kentucky is seeking a waiver of an ESSA provision that caps at 1 percent the number of students with disabilities that states can test on alternate assessments.   \u2014 How Education Secretary Betsy DeVos handles the requests will be watched closely. DeVos has emphasized flexibility for states as they implement ESSA, while also stressing that her agency will ensure plans adhere to the letter of the law. Some education policy experts believe DeVos\u2019 Education Department is reading the law too narrowly. And the department has come under fire from state education officials, experts and members of Congress who've found federal feedback to states on their ESSA plans inconsistent, confusing or heavy-handed.  \u2014 Speaking of ESSA: Michigan sent the Education Department a plan in May that included three possible options for how it will hold schools accountable \u2014 and reportedly faced criticism from federal officials for not deciding on one, even though DeVos said earlier this year that states could hand in their plans even if they still had to fill in some blanks. Michigan has since decided to ditch an A-F approach to grading schools, instead opting for a \u201cdashboard\u201d of data. More.   \u2014 Acting Assistant Secretary of Elementary and Secondary Education Jason Botel has been working to schedule calls with D.C. and seven states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, North Dakota and Vermont \u2014 after the Education Department announced last week that it\u2019s changing the way it delivers ESSA feedback to states. State education officials from Michigan and Vermont tell Morning Education that they haven\u2019t had their call with federal officials yet.   \u2014 ICYMI, DeVos said Tuesday night that she\u2019s approving Delaware\u2019s ESSA plan, months after her department questioned the ambitiousness of the state's long-term goals. Delaware in recent weeks posted a revised plan defending those goals. DeVos said in a statement that the plan "embraces ESSA\u2019s spirit of flexibility and creative thinking." Caitlin Emma has more.  \u2014 And finally, on \u201cevidence\u201d \u2014 The Education Department earlier this week set out new requirements to better align definitions of research and evidence on school improvement in grant-making with what\u2019s outlined in ESSA. The agency will be accepting public comment for the next 30 days. More.   MOVERS AND SHAKERS   \u2014 The Education Department earlier this year hired Christopher Rinkus as a special assistant in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, press secretary Liz Hill confirms. Rinkus is working with Botel on implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act, sources tell Pro Education\u2019s Caitlin Emma. He previously worked for D.C. Public Schools, according to LinkedIn.   \u2014 The Education Department has also tapped Nicholas Hahn as director of speechwriting in the Office of Communications and Outreach, Hill confirms. Hahn was previously chief opinion editor for The Hill and assistant editorial page editor for The Detroit News, according to LinkedIn.   \u2014 Roberto Rodrguez, former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama for Education, has been selected by the board of directors at the national nonprofit Teach Plus to be the new president and CEO. Teach Plus works to ensure that teachers have access to leadership training and that disadvantaged students have access to effective teachers.   REPORT ROLL CALL   \u2014 D.C.\u2019s effort to link teacher pay and retention to performance has led to higher rates of turnover among the lowest-performing teachers while boosting student achievement, researchers from Stanford University and the University of Virginia find in a new research article for Education Next.

aV \u000a            By MEL LEONOR  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aubree Eliza Weaver  ED LOOKS TO REINSTATE CHARLOTTE LAW LOAN ACCESS, A BOON FOR EMBATTLED FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' Education Department plans to reinstate federal funding for a for-profit law school cut off from aid by the Obama administration \u2014 the latest sign that the Trump administration is taking a friendlier view toward the for-profit education industry. The Education Department said this week it plans to reinstate the Charlotte School of Law\u2019s ability to award Title IV funds if it agrees to certain conditions. The Obama Education Department blocked the for-profit school\u2019s access to the Federal Direct Loan Program last December, a month after the American Bar Association placed the school on probation \u2014 a status the association has yet to lift.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 Charlotte School of Law could be reinstated as soon as the fall, according to CSL spokeswoman Victoria Taylor. \u201cThe Department has specified certain conditions, with which the school must agree to comply in order to allow eligible CSL students enrolling for the fall semester to receive Federal Direct Loans,\u201d Taylor said in a written statement. \u201cThe school has notified the Department of its willingness to abide by the necessary conditions, details of which are under discussion.\u201d   \u2014 Both the school and the Education Department declined to discuss the conditions when reached by POLITICO. But according to a letter obtained by the American Bar Association Journal, the school must supply the department with a letter of credit to the tune of $6 million to cover a \u201cteach-out\u201d plan, student refunds and fines under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The school must also agree to tightened admissions criteria and submit itself to the department\u2019s Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 program. An Education Department spokesman told POLITICO that discussions on the conditions are ongoing. \u201cUntil the discussions reach a successful conclusion, CSL will remain ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs,\u201d he said.   \u2014 When the department announced its would block the school\u2019s access to federal student loans last year, it cited the school\u2019s \u201csignificantly\u201d low bar pass rates and high academic attrition. In February 2016, just under 35 percent of first-time test takers from CSL passed the North Carolina bar, compared to the 51 percent statewide rate. The department also alleged that the school misrepresented its standing with the ABA after its accreditation was put on probation, as well as its bar pass rate. The school has argued that the decision to withdraw its eligibility for funds was made "without proper cause, justification or the barest semblance of due process."  \u2014 For Charlotte School of Law, it could mean a comeback from what observers saw as almost-certain closure. The Education Department\u2019s decision could help its case before the University of North Carolina system, which gave the school until early August to prove its financial stability or face having its license to operate revoked. Still, hurdles remain for the school: It has yet to firm up its standing with the American Bar Association and faces an investigation by North Carolina\u2019s Attorney General under the state\u2019s civil consumer protection laws.

A WAITING GAME IN ILLINOIS: After weeks of back-and-forth, statehouse Democrats in Illinois have delivered their plan to fund the state\u2019s public schools to the desk of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. The governor, who repeatedly vowed to amend the bill by veto and hailed the legislation as an unacceptable \u201cbailout\u201d of cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools, said through his office late Monday he would review it and take \u201cswift\u201d action.   \u2014 It\u2019s unclear what came out of a series of closed-door meetings held in Springfield through the weekend and into Monday. The Chicago Tribune reports Democrats claimed progress toward a deal, while Republicans called the negotiation a \u201cpolitical charade.\u201d   \u2014 In the operating theater are Illinois\u2019 800-plus school districts, where officials still don\u2019t know if funds for the first day of school will come from Springfield. School districts are due for funding in early August, and a special provision inserted in the budget by Democrats will hold those funds until Illinois enacts a new "evidence-based" funding formula. The proposal at the center of the debate sets a target level of funding for each district and doles out money from the bottom up to work towards equity. Right now, Illinois schools draw most of their funding from local tax dollars, meaning districts in low-income areas often have the fewest resources to educate their students. But the dispute hinges on the dollars earmarked for Chicago, which is set to receive additional funding, on top of state block grants, to help cover teacher pension payments. (CPS is the only district that controls its teachers' pensions.) This is the part Rauner has said he would amend by veto.   \u2018NAACP HAS CHOSEN TO STAND AS AN OBSTACLE\u2019: Two charter school leaders and school choice proponents blasted the NAACP this week for its report highlighting a \u201cwide range of problems\u201d present in U.S. charter schools. David Hardy, founder and chair of Boys' Latin Philadelphia Charter School, and who is African American, said the NAACP campaign against charters is \u201cdetrimental and disrespectful to all parents who struggle to ensure a quality education for their children.\u201d   \u2014 \u201cRather than embrace, and work to expand, the opportunities that charter schools represent to America\u2019s disadvantaged, and to families of color across the nation, the NAACP has chosen to stand as an obstacle,\u201d Hardy said. Donald Hense, founder and chairman of D.C.'s Friendship Public Charter Schools said the NAACP\u2019s anti-charter efforts \u201care the antithesis\u201d of its \u201clong history of fighting for justice and individual rights.\u201d   PARENT DISCONNECT: While most parents still believe in the importance of a college education, worries over academics have taken a backseat to fears surrounding bullying, physical safety and even financing a college degree, according to a new report from Learning Heroes. Part of this may stem from many parents\u2019 belief that their child is already on track and performing at grade level. Nine in 10 parents of K-8 students think their child is at or above grade level in reading and math, while data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicates that only one in three 8th graders are proficient in these subjects. Read the full report here.  NASA LOOKS TO INVOLVE MORE WOMEN AND GIRLS: In response to the INSPIRE Women Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in February, NASA is taking steps to encourage women and girls to study STEM, pursue careers in aerospace and play a part in advancing the country\u2019s space science and exploration efforts. As of 2012, NASA was the largest STEM employer of women; one-third of the agency\u2019s approximately 18,000 civil-service workers are women.  \u2014 A new report shows that in addition to astronaut appearances and other popular speaker events, the agency plans to invest in three programs: NASA GIRLS & BOYS, a program that pairs middle school students with NASA employees for a virtual mentorship; Aspire to Inspire, which offers content such as short films about career opportunities in STEM through the lives of early career women at NASA; and the Summer Institute in Science, Technology, Engineering and Research, which allows middle school students to take a deeper look at nontraditional career fields with female engineers, mathematicians and scientists. In the next year or so, NASA plans to consider other ways to reach and engage girls and women.   VETERANS GROUP URGES SENATE PASSAGE OF GI BILL EXPANSION: Student Veterans of America, one of the largest veteran organizations in the country, is urging the Senate to pass legislation that would expand the education benefits under the GI Bill (S. 1598 (115)) before the August recess. The measure \u2014 which also restores GI Bill benefits for veterans affected by the closure of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges \u2014 unanimously passed the House last week and has 57 bipartisan co-sponsors in the Senate.   \u2014\u201cIt\u2019s time for our senators to guarantee this benefit for those who serve our country today and in the future, and get this done,\u201d SVA President and CEO Jared Lyon said in a statement. \u201cVeterans should be a top priority, and [this bill] should be at the top of the to-do list.\u201d  STATES INCH FORWARD ON COORDINATED DATA SYSTEMS: Currently just 37 states and D.C. connect data between at least two educational systems and only 16 states plus D.C. have systems that share data across early learning programs, the K-12 system, postsecondary institutions and the workforce. That\u2019s according to a new study by the Education Commission of the States, which found that a handful of states considered legislation to improve data coordination in 2016.   \u2014California enacted legislation last year to improve data sharing between its department of consumer affairs and its community college system to monitor employment outcomes of students who participated in career technical education programs. Four other states considered legislation: Alabama, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virginia. Proposals failed in all but New Jersey, where a bill remains in the pipeline. That proposal would connect available data from students in early learning programs through their outcomes in the workforce.   REPORT ROLL CALL   \u2014 Fear of deportation under Trump\u2019s immigration policy is causing children emotional stress and economic instability, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress \u2014 and that could ultimately affect their development and future successes. In cases of parental deportation, children without a guardian in the U.S. could be forced to return to their parents\u2019 home country and make a challenging transition, the report says. Children who are separated from their parent \u2014 or even those who face the idea of separation \u2014 may display signs of stress and trauma, such as anxiety, depression and difficulty in school.  \u2014 Food insecurity (or not having reliable access to sufficient amounts of healthy, affordable food) continues to be a leading public health concern across the country. When seen in college students, food insecurity is often associated with \u201cpoorer health, poorer academic performance and mental health symptoms,\u201d according to a new Urban Institute report. The report shows that as of 2015, food insecurity in households with students enrolled in four-year colleges was at 11.2 percent, versus 13.5 percent in households with students pursuing vocational education. The rate among households with students attending two-year colleges dropped to approximately 13.3 percent after reaching new highs following the 2008 recession.

aV \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma  DEMOCRATS BLAST DEVOS\u2019 CHANGES TO STATE ESSA PLAN FEEDBACK PROCESS: Top Democrats on the House and Senate education committees are criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s changes to how it provides feedback to states about their plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act. The department last week confirmed that it would first hold telephone calls with state officials about each state\u2019s ESSA plan before publicly posting its feedback about the plans \u2014 a change that critics worry will shield the back-and-forth between state and federal officials from public view.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Bobby Scott wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos being released today that the \u201cconcerning changes\u201d violated the law\u2019s requirement for public transparency surrounding the state plan review process. \u201cA verbal agreement in a nonpublic setting is not an appropriate substitute for publicly available discourse with states,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cPut simply, if your staff needs more information to better understand a plan\u2019s components, so do parents, teachers, civil rights advocates, members of Congress, and other stakeholders.\u201d They also said it would \u201ccreate an uneven playing field for states\u201d for the department to change its feedback process in the middle of its review of state plans.  \u2014 Murray and Scott asked DeVos to produce a written justification for the change in policy as well as other documents relating to the changes. Read their full letter here.  \u2014 The over-the-phone feedback is meant to \u201cprovide an informal opportunity to address any potential concerns prior to plans being submitted\u201d for DeVos\u2019 review, said Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill last week. "Secretary DeVos looks forward to reviewing plans and approving every plan that complies with the law,\u201d she added.   GOOD MONDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

WEST VIRGINIA INVESTIGATES AUDIT DELAY THAT LED TO FEDERAL SANCTIONS: West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice\u2019s office says it expects that state budget officials will be able to advance hundreds of millions of dollars to the state\u2019s public colleges and universities for the upcoming school year, minimizing the financial hit of new federal sanctions. The Education Department earlier this month imposed \u201cheightened cash monitoring\u201d restrictions on West Virginia\u2019s public higher education systems after the state was late in submitting annual financial paperwork to the department for a third year. The state\u2019s congressional delegation has lobbied Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reverse those restrictions.  \u2014 The federal restrictions, which are unusual for a public college and university system, require that schools must first use their own funds to disburse federal student loans and grants to students \u2014 and then later receive reimbursement from the Education Department. The state will float extra money to the college and universities \u201cto handle student loans for the Fall semester,\u201d Justice\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Casey, said in a statement on Friday.  \u2014 The governor\u2019s office is also \u201cthoroughly reviewing the circumstances that led to the delay of the final completion and filing of the State\u2019s single audit for the last three years to find out exactly who is responsible,\u201d Casey said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s become obvious that there is a systemic bottleneck that got in the way of a timely audit being filed for 2014, 2015 and 2016.\u201d  \u2014 Meanwhile, Moody\u2019s Investors Services is warning that the sanctions could negatively affect the credit ratings of the state\u2019s colleges and universities. Moody\u2019s said in a report that the restrictions were a \u201ccredit negative\u201d for the schools because of the strain they could create on their cash flows. Read more.   BETTER UNDERSTANDING BACK TO SCHOOL: Understood.org, an organization devoted to supporting parents of children with learning and attention issues, is making a back-to-school push in the coming weeks. The group will launch a campaign to alleviate some of the pressure and anxiety that comes with the start of a new school year by offering customized materials for families and teachers, said Kevin Hager, managing director of Understood.   \u2014 For example, depending on a child\u2019s age and learning or attention issue, the organization might design a homework contract to help manage expectations between a child and his or her parents. Or families might fill out a custom worksheet describing how a child learns best, which can then be shared with teachers. Understood is also offering advice on what not to say before the start of a new school year. For example, parents might want to avoid saying things like, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more homework this year,\u201d Hager said. Rather, the organization is encouraging families to \u201ccreate a sense of excitement around getting a fresh start,\u201d he said.   \u2014 Understood is also the organization behind \u201cThrough Your Child\u2019s Eyes\u201d \u2014 a tool that allows parents of children with learning and attention issues to get a sense of their child\u2019s experience through simulations and interviews with real students. About 10,000 people a week use the tool, which was developed two years ago with input from more than 100 experts on learning and attention issues, Hager said. Millions of people have visited the organization\u2019s website, Hager said, \u201cbut nothing resonates as much as \u2018Through Your Child\u2019s Eyes does.\u2019\u201d   COLLEGE BOARD TEAMS UP WITH KHAN ACADEMY FOR AP TEST PREP: The College Board announced a partnership with Khan Academy on Friday to deliver preparatory courses for its Advanced Placement tests on the online learning portal.

EDUCATION GROUPS URGE TEXAS TO DROP \u2018BATHROOM BILL\u2019 EFFORT: A handful of education groups are urging Texas lawmakers to ditch an attempt to restrict transgender students' bathroom and locker room use.

The Senate passed a bill earlier this week, but the effort faces an uncertain future in the House, where the Republican speaker is a vocal critic. Read more.

aV \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma, Benjamin Wermund and Mel Leonor  EDUCATION DEPARTMENT HIRING HITS A WALL: The task of staffing the Education Department with fresh political faces appears to have hit a wall. Dozens of individuals have dropped out, frustrated by the drawn-out, rigorous hiring process. Those in the pipeline are wondering what\u2019s taking so long. And fewer folks are throwing their hats in the ring, doubting whether the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to dramatically expand private school choice options for working class families will ultimately go anywhere, according to multiple sources plugged into the hiring process. \u201cThe White House looks so chaotic, I think people are starting to wonder if you will be able to do much\u201d on education, one source told Pro Education\u2019s Caitlin Emma.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 Amid the chaos, the Hill doesn\u2019t seem interested in funding the president\u2019s school choice budget proposals and it\u2019s unclear if the White House will get behind a plan to expand private school choice through tax reform \u2014 a huge lift for Congress and the administration. Folks who support private school choice are \u201cincreasingly pessimistic,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere still seems to be people in the pipeline that could get through. But it seems like no one new is getting in line.\u201d  \u2014 Education Department press secretary Liz Hill said, \u201cWe are making progress on staffing and more announcements on are on the horizon soon. The notion that the secretary doesn\u2019t have an agenda is ridiculous. The secretary is championing a robust agenda to reduce the federal role in education, expand school choice and empower parents, retool the Higher Education Act for the 21st Century, and modernize [Federal Student Aid] to better serve students and taxpayers. The secretary hears from those inside and outside the government who are excited about her agenda and are ready and willing to help advance it.\u201d   \u2014 Political vacancies will make it more difficult for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to figure out and implement an agenda. At least a quarter of the Education Department\u2019s political vacancies have been filled, but a number of potential hires have been held up, thwarted or vetoed by the White House or Education Department, sources say. The Office of Government Ethics, in particular, has presented enormous hurdles. For example, the rigorous financial expectations set out by the Office of Government Ethics prompted Allan Hubbard, an economic adviser during both Bush administrations, to drop out of the running for the Education Department\u2019s No. 2 job in early June. Rumored names of a potential front-runner for that position have yet to surface.   \u2014 A lack of senior political hires has failed to attract other talent, compounding the problem, sources say. And the political hires now at the Education Department have way too much on their plate. President Donald Trump has only formally nominated two individuals for politically appointed, Senate-confirmable positions: Sen. Lamar Alexander aide Peter Oppenheim as assistant secretary for legislation and congressional affairs, and Florida attorney Carlos Muiz as general counsel. Jim Blew, director of the education advocacy group, Student Success California, is the front-runner to become the Education Department\u2019s assistant secretary of the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development \u2014 but has yet to be formally nominated.   \u2014 A White House spokesman declined to comment on personnel issues, but stressed the Trump administration\u2019s education accomplishments to date. For example, the spokesman pointed to the president\u2019s decision this week to donate his quarterly salary to the Education Department for a STEM-focused camp, among other things. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, Secretary DeVos has increased stakeholder engagement and rolled back harmful restrictions to ensure America\u2019s schools are helping students,\u201d the spokesman said.

And follow us on Twitter: @Morning_Edu and @POLITICOPro.  WARREN PRESSES TRUMP NOMINEE OVER DEVOS\u2019 RESPONSES TO CONGRESS: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Thursday signaled that she may put up a fight over President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be the Education Department\u2019s top liaison to Congress, citing what she said was Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 lack of responsiveness to Democrats\u2019 inquiries. Warren wrote in a letter to Peter Oppenheim, Trump\u2019s pick to be assistant secretary of education for legislation and congressional affairs, that she was concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s Education Department \u201chas been negligent in its duty to respond substantively, completely, and thoroughly to Members of Congress.\u201d  \u2014 The Trump administration \u201chas been either totally unresponsive to our oversight letters, or it has responded with paltry rhetoric and talking points that plainly ignore urgent document and information requests or do not completely answer our questions,\u201d Warren wrote, adding that it was impeding \u201cstrong\u201d congressional oversight of the department.  \u2014 Warren pressed Oppenheim, who is currently an aide to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), on whether he would \u201ccommit to doing everything within your power to obtain substantive and complete responses\u201d to congressional Democrats\u2019 inquiries. Read the full letter here.  \u2014 What to watch next: The nomination for assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs is \u201cprivileged,\u201d which puts it on an expedited path to consideration on the Senate floor, bypassing a committee markup. But any Senator could object to that process and force a committee vote. The clock for making such an objection began on July 19, and lasts for 10 legislative days.   HIGHER ED GROUPS CALL ON IRAN TO RELEASE IMPRISONED STUDENT: A slew of American higher education groups are calling on Iran to release a Princeton graduate student who was accused of espionage while conducting research in Iran and sentenced to 10 years in prison. In a statement issued this week, several groups, led by the American Council on Education, write that Xiyue Wang described his research plans in advance to the Iranian authorities and the libraries and archives he planned to visit, and he only sought materials that he needed for his dissertation. His research was solely for the purpose of completing his academic work. \u201cMr. Wang\u2019s imprisonment can only have a chilling effect on historical research and scholarly exchange in Iran and throughout the world, and this, in turn, can only lead to diminished understanding and greater mistrust, to the detriment of all,\u201d the statement says. Read it here.   HOT DOCUMENTS: The Education Department has released the transcripts from the two hearings it held earlier this month to solicit public feedback on how to rewrite the Obama-era \u201cgainful employment\u201d and \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d rules. Read the hearing transcript from the Washington D.C. hearing here, and the Dallas, Texas one here.  \u2014 Next up in the process: The Education Department is expected to solicit nominations for the two negotiated-rulemaking panels that it has said it plans to convene later this year.   EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PLANS CHANGES TO ESSA FEEDBACK AMID BLOWBACK: The Education Department is changing the way it delivers feedback to states under the Every Student Succeeds Act. This summer, the department has been publicly posting letters to states outlining initial comments or concerns, in addition to comments from a team of experts known as peer reviewers. Now, the agency will first discuss peer reviewer comments with states over the phone, giving them an opportunity to address any issues before a letter is posted publicly.    \u2014 The change could potentially shield the back-and-forth between state and federal officials over the development of state ESSA plans from public view. It will likely raise transparency concerns from education policy wonks closely watching the implementation process. It comes after months of blowback from state education officials, education policy experts and members of Congress who've found the Education Department's feedback to states inconsistent, confusing or heavy-handed.   \u2014 Jason Botel, the acting assistant secretary of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, is now working to schedule calls with eight states: Arizona, Colorado, D.C., Illinois, Maine, Michigan, North Dakota and Vermont. Caitlin Emma has more here.   DEVOS BOOSTS STAKE IN NEUROCORE: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has increased her financial stake in a \u201cneurofeedback\u201d company that says its technology treats attention deficit disorder and the symptoms of autism. DeVos reported a new investment of between $250,001 and $500,000 in the Michigan-based Neurocore, according to a financial disclosure form that was certified by government ethics officials on Wednesday.  \u2014 The June 13 purchase of new shares of Neurocore adds to DeVos\u2019 previously reported stake in the company that was valued at $5 million to $25 million on the disclosure form she filed in January. DeVos said earlier this year that she had stepped down from the Neurocore board but government ethics officials did not require her to shed her financial interest in the company.  \u2014 Neurocore, a \u201cbrain performance\u201d company, says its biofeedback therapies are aimed at improving the cognitive performance of children and adults and addressing a wide range of problems such as anxiety, stress, attention deficit disorder and autism symptoms. But some experts have questioned the company\u2019s methods and claims.  \u2014 DeVos also reported a new investment of between $50,001 and $100,000 in Move Systems, a company that makes high-tech and environmentally friendly food carts. She also purchased a $100,001 to $250,000 stake in the Orlando Solar Bears, a minor league professional hockey team. Read more here.   REPORT ROLL CALL   \u2014 Incidents of violence and reports of bullying are more prevalent in U.S. middle schools than in high schools, according to new data from the National Center for Education Statistics. In the 2015-16 school year, the survey found, middle schools reported 27 violent incidents per 1,000 students, compared to 16 incidents in high schools and 15 in elementary schools. As for incidents of bullying, 22 percent of middle schools reported incidents at least once a week, compared to 15 percent of high schools and 8 percent of elementary schools.

aV \u000a            By BENJAMIN WERMUND  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 07/27/2017 10:25 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma, Michael Stratford and Mel Leonor  CAMPUS SPEECH BACK IN CONGRESS\u2019 SPOTLIGHT: Republicans continue to ramp up pressure on colleges to preserve free speech on campus and do away with free speech zones and other policies they deem restrictive. Today, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee and Health Care, Benefits and Administrative Rules Subcommittee will tackle the issue in a joint hearing featuring conservative comedian Adam Carolla and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who have both claimed college administrators have trampled their right to free speech.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 \u201cThe First Amendment is under attack on campuses across the country,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Health Care, Benefits and Administrative Rules Subcommittee, said in a statement. Jordan called Carolla and Shapiro \u201ctwo of the best defenders of free speech.\u201d  \u2014 In written testimony, Carolla rails against \u201csafe spaces\u201d on campuses. \u201cInstead of fostering the development of young adults, colleges are providing coloring books, play-doh, puppies, and stuffed animals,\u201d the testimony says. \u201cIt\u2019s basically your four-year-old daughter\u2019s bedroom where one can shut out the challenges and facts of the outside world. Providing this bubble wrapped type of education does not prepare the next generation for the challenges of life. It prepares them for failure.\u201d   \u2014 Shapiro, in written testimony, complains about the concept of \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2014 comments or actions seen as indirect or unintentional discrimination against members of a marginalized group \u2014 which he says have been used to justify violence against speakers who voice views that some find offensive. \u201cAll of this destroys free speech,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut just as importantly, it turns students into snowflakes, craven and pathetic, looking for an excuse to be offended so they can earn points in the intersectional Olympics and then use those points as a club with which to beat opponents.\u201d  \u2014 The hearing comes after Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) earlier this week said he would be open to cutting off federal funding for colleges that restrict speech. The House Education and the Workforce Committee member blasted colleges for carving out free speech zones and uninviting speakers with views that some find offensive. "If this, to me, offensive behavior continues to occur across the country, I would certainly be open to looking at how, maybe you don't need federal funding if you don't allow people to speak freely on your campus," Roe said. That sentiment appears to be shared by President Donald Trump, who earlier this year threatened the University of California-Berkeley in a tweet after administrators there canceled a speech by alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos following violent riots.  \u2014 Michael Zimmerman, a former provost and vice president for academic affairs at Evergreen State College who is set to testify today, will challenge the notion that government needs to intervene. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need is additional legislation to be brought into the mix,\u201d Zimmerman says in written testimony. \u201cCollege administrators need the courage to do what is right, to stand for principles rather than expediency, and to risk alienating some in the name of those principles. On campuses where such strong leadership exists, conflict rarely escalates to crisis.\u201d Zimmerman recently criticized Evergreen State administrators for their handling of recent protests that embroiled the campus.  \u2014 Also testifying at today\u2019s hearing are Nadine Strossen, a law professor at the New York Law School, and Fred Lawrence of the Anti-Defamation League. The hearing begins at 9 a.m. in 2154 Rayburn House Office Building. Watch a livestream here.   GOOD THURSDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

STUDENTS: Michelle Obama today is meeting with nearly three dozen students \u2014 all first-generation, rising college freshmen \u2014 at Dunbar High School in D.C. They\u2019ll talk about what it takes to succeed in college. The conversation is closed to the media, in part to keep the discussion candid, a spokeswoman told Morning Education. Obama will be joined by ESPN commentator Michael Wilbon. The discussion is part of the former first lady\u2019s Reach Higher initiative, aimed at inspiring all students to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree, particularly underserved students. Earlier this year, Obama surprised D.C. students at Ballou High School and Cardozo Education Campus, holding similar conversations. Reach Higher today is also launching a PSA encouraging students to commit to higher education, featuring celebrities like Allison Williams, Kelly Rowland, Connie Britton, Wale and Kal Penn. Watch the PSA.   TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HASN\u2019T APPROVED ANY DEBT RELIEF CLAIMS: Acting Undersecretary of Education James Manning said in a letter to senators earlier this month that the Education Department has not approved any borrower defense to repayment claims since President Trump took office \u2014 despite having received nearly 15,000 additional applications for such loan forgiveness over the past several months. \u201cNo borrower defense applications have been approved between January 20, 2017, and today,\u201d Manning wrote in a July 7 letter, which was released on Wednesday by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). Durbin and other Democrats have been critical of the administration\u2019s decision to halt approvals of the claims.  \u2014 The Trump administration has carried out the loan forgiveness that was promised to some borrowers by the Education Department before the change in administration. The department, Manning said, has executed the loan forgiveness for 26,372 of the 31,773 claims previously approved by the Obama administration. The remaining 5,401 claims are \u201cin progress.\u201d  \u2014 Manning said in the letter that, in total, more 65,169 claims for loan forgiveness remain pending before the Education Department. The bulk of those pending claims, 45,092 of them, are from borrowers who claim they were defrauded by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges. The others are from borrowers associated with ITT Tech (7,186 claims), Education Management Corporation (2,175 claims), DeVry University (1,872 claims) and University of Phoenix (1,306).  \u2014 Read the full letter from Manning here.

FORDHAM\u2019S TAKE ON STATE ESSA PLANS: The Fordham Institute is out with its own review of state plans under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Some independent reviews have found the first 17 state plans submitted to the Education Department lacking, either in ambition or detail. But Fordham, a conservative education think tank, is assigning those states mostly \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cmedium\u201d marks. The reviews are a little more positive because the think tank is only evaluating plans on three metrics, said Brandon Wright, Fordham\u2019s editorial director. Those metrics include: whether states are assigning clear, understandable ratings to schools; whether states are focusing on all students, not just low-performers; and whether state accountability systems fairly measure and judge all schools, including high-poverty schools. Arizona, Colorado and Illinois earn the highest marks in all three categories, followed by Connecticut, D.C. and Vermont, which also earned high marks. More.  SECRETARY DEVOS, YOU\u2019VE GOT MAIL: A bipartisan group of 20 lawmakers sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her acting civil rights chief Candice Jackson urging them to continue publishing a list of colleges and universities under investigation for allegedly mishandling sexual violence claims. Jackson said last month that she may stop publishing the list, which she called a \u201clist of shame.\u201d The Obama administration began publishing the list in 2014 under pressure from sexual assault survivors. \u201cEnding sexual violence on our college campuses will never become a reality if college and university communities are kept in the dark,\u201d the letter, led by Reps. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), and David Joyce (R-Ohio), who all co-chair the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, says. The administration did release the list this week. It included 346 investigations at 243 institutions and showed the department had opened three new investigations into alleged violations of Title IX by colleges and universities \u2014 but also closed two probes as it seeks to cut down on the backlog. More on that here.   \u2014 A coalition of more than 60 members of Congress also sent a letter to DeVos Wednesday, urging her to work on reducing \u201cexcessive\u201d discipline in schools. The letter urges DeVos to continue the work undertaken by the Obama administration to reduce the number of out-of-school suspensions, specially among young students, and address the disproportionate disciplining of students of color and those with disabilities. The letter was signed by 68 members of Congress \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 including Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.). In it, they point out the Education Department\u2019s \u201cobligation\u201d to work on the issue under the Every Student Succeeds Act, which calls on states to address the overuse of suspensions in the plans they\u2019re required to submit to the department. The review process, the letter reads, should ensure that state education agencies adequately \u201cdevelop proactive discipline approaches rather than suspensions, expulsions, seclusion and restraint.\u201d Read the letter.  \u2014 Another group of Democrats, also led by Murray, sent another letter to DeVos urging her to reverse course on a decision to delay an aspect of \u201cgainful employment\u201d rules that requires schools to disclose, such as how many students complete programs on time and how much graduates earn. The Trump administration is rewriting the Obama-era regulations, which would cut off funding for career colleges that produce graduates with more debt than income. Read that letter, signed by 59 members of the Senate and House, here.   TEXAS \u2018BATHROOM BILL\u2019 AGAIN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE IN HOUSE: As expected, Republicans in the Texas Senate again advanced efforts to restrict transgender bathroom use, as they did during the legislature\u2019s regular session, but those efforts now head to the House, where they face significant resistance from key lawmakers. House Speaker Joe Straus, a Republican, is a vocal critic of the so-called bathroom bills, which would force transgender students and athletes to use bathrooms and locker rooms associated with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The chairman of the House Committee on State Affairs, the first hurdle bathroom bills will have to clear in the lower chamber, meanwhile, criticized the efforts on Wednesday.

MOVERS AND SHAKERS   \u2014 Members of the National Association of Secondary School Principals have elected Christine Handy, principal of Gaithersburg High School in Gaithersburg, Md., as the organization\u2019s new president-elect.   REPORT ROLL CALL   \u2014 The majority of young people believe mental health is a very important priority, but more than a third of high school students say their schools don\u2019t cover mental health in any class at school. That\u2019s according to a new report from the Born This Way Foundation, led by pop star Lady Gaga and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta.   \u2014The Institute of Education Sciences, the Education Department\u2019s independent research arm, is seeking input on its education and special education research programs. IES wants to know whether some of its goals \u201care meeting the needs of the field, or whether changes should be considered to incentivize and support more replication and effectiveness studies.\u201d More.

aV \u000a            By CAITLIN EMMA  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Benjamin Wermund and Mel Leonor  NAACP REPORT FINDS \u2018WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS\u2019 WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS: After calling for a moratorium on charter school expansion last year, the NAACP today is releasing a highly anticipated report that calls for the elimination of for-profit charter school operators. The report concludes that \u201cwhile there are certainly some charter schools serving students well, there are also a wide range of problems with the operation of charters across the country that require attention.\u201d And it stresses the need to "protect students from failing schools and create more high quality schools, regardless of the school\u2019s structure.\u201d   Story Continued Below  \u2014 \u201cAll children deserve the choice of a good neighborhood public school,\u201d the report says. \u201cPublic schools must be public. They must serve all children equitably and well. To the extent that they are part of our public education system, charter schools must be designed to serve these ends.\u201d   \u2014 The report comes as race has emerged as a focal point in ongoing sparring over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to expand school choice policies. While those arguments have centered largely on private school vouchers, the NAACP\u2019s stance on charter schools is significant, in part, because charters \u2014 for which the Trump administration wants to boost funding \u2014 are very popular among many black parents. Approximately 837,000 Black students attended charter schools during the 2016-17 school year, according to the report. That\u2019s more than a quarter of charter school enrollment, while black students make up just 15 percent of the nation's overall enrollment.   \u2014 Those tensions were highlighted this week when Howard Fuller, a civil rights activist, former Milwaukee schools superintendent and founder of the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette University, blasted the NAACP's moratorium call. The NAACP has the right to express its opposition to charter schools, Fuller said, but thousands of parents have already shown their support for choosing to send their children to charter schools. \u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of the NAACP," he said. "But the reality is, the NAACP doesn\u2019t represent all black people in this country.\u201d  \u2014 The report is the result of the work of the NAACP Task Force on Quality Education, which the NAACP formed after calling for the charter moratorium. The group was initially tasked with studying only charters, but its aim was expanded after President Donald Trump was elected. \u201cBased upon the United States President-Elect\u2019s campaign promise to expand privatization of public education, the officers were concerned that the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education victory that promised a quality education for all was at risk,\u201d the report says. The task force held a series of listening sessions in cities across the country, including in New Haven, Memphis, Orlando, Los Angeles, Detroit, New Orleans and New York.   \u2014 Much of the report focuses on funding. It calls for \u201cmore equitable and adequate funding for all schools serving students of color\u201d and for an investment in \u201clow-performing schools and schools with significant opportunity to close the achievement gap.\u201d The report also says that school finance reform is needed and calls for states to model their funding formulas off of Massachusetts and California and for the federal government should fully enforce the funding-equity provisions in Every Student Succeeds Act. Benjamin Wermund has more.   \u2014 The task force will present its findings this afternoon at the NAACP National Convention in Baltimore. Watch a livestream here.   GOOD WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 26.

RIP \u2018EDIBLES\u2019 Bad news for Morning Education readers who love a good pun: the Education Department\u2019s cafeteria, once called \u201cEDibles,\u201d has been renamed \u201cMarketplace.\u201d But don\u2019t blame Education Secretary Betsy DeVos \u2014 the vendor that contracts with the General Services Administration to provide food services at the Education Department has decided to shake up its marketing and branding, said press secretary Liz Hill, which led to the demise of the pun-tastic name.   ON THE HILL TODAY: A House Education and the Workforce subcommittee will hold a hearing on \u201cExpanding Options for Employers and Workers Through Earn-and-Learn Opportunities.\u201d Lawmakers will hear about opportunities for workers to earn a paycheck while getting trained in a high-skilled job. They\u2019ll also hear about changes to the Labor Department\u2019s Registered Apprenticeship program aimed at increasing employer participation. Witnesses include Mike Bennett, vice president of Cianbro, a construction company in Pittsfield, Maine; Stacey Johnson Hughes, state chair of the Kentucky Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education in Russellville, Ky.; Robert Peglow, a student with KYFAME; and Rob Hogan, vice president of manufacturing and material distribution for Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va. The hearing starts at 10 a.m. in 2175 Rayburn. Watch live.   \u2014 Also happening on the Hill: The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee holds a markup of S. 1598 (115), bipartisan legislation that would expand the education benefits offered to veterans under the GI Bill. The House overwhelmingly passed an identical version of the bill on Monday. The markup starts at 11 a.m. in the Capitol, S-216.  \u2014 A House Science, Space, and Technology subcommittee will hold a hearing on \u201cSTEM and Computer Science Education: Preparing the 21st Century Workforce.\u201d Witnesses include: James Brown, executive director of the STEM Education Coalition; Pat Yongpradit, chief academic officer for Code.org; A. Paul Alivisatos, executive vice chancellor and provost at the University of California, Berkeley; and Dee Mooney, executive director of the Micron Technology Foundation. The hearing begins at 10 a.m. in 2318 Rayburn.  \u2014 And a report released today by Democrats on the U.S. Joint Economic Committee says that while more Americans are attending and completing degree programs, \u201csharp divisions\u201d in access remain \u201cby income level, race, ethnicity, and geography.\u201d The report calls on Congress to \u201cclose educational attainment gaps\u201d to make sure \u201call Americans have the ability to find a good job that pays well and provides a foundation for their family\u2026 Making college more affordable, giving students access to better information about their options, and better preparing high school students for the rigors of college are all goals that Congress must pursue.\u201d Read the report.   CHILDHOOD WELL-BEING: A new report from the Forum on Child and Family Statistics on the well-being of children found a decrease in the number of school-aged children who speak a language other than English at home and have difficulty speaking English. In 2015, according to the report, that number was 4 percent, compared to 5 percent in 2015. Researchers looked at a few dozen other indicators on childhood well-being in the U.S. and found a decrease in the number of eighth graders using illicit drugs from 8 percent in 2015 to 7 percent in 2016, and reported a decrease in the number of adolescent births from 11 per 1,000 live births in 2014 to 10 per 1,000 in 2015.   \u2014 Researchers also analyzed peer victimization in the third grade, and found that 6 percent of students in their sample were identified as perpetrators, meaning they frequently teased, hit or told lies about other students. Among these students, roughly one in ten reported they were also frequently victimized. Read the report here.  DEVOS, TRUMP AND THE SUMMER READING SLIDE: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Adviser to the President Ivanka Trump teamed up Tuesday for a STEM-focused reading event at the National Museum of American History. The event was aimed at raising awareness about the \u201csummer reading slide,\u201d or when students fall behind in reading over the summer. They took turns reading \u201cRosie Revere, Engineer\u201d by Andrea Beaty to a group of D.C.-area girls with the YMCA and the Boys & Girls Club. Trump said her daughter, Arabella, loves the book, which is about a girl who dreams of becoming an engineer. When one student noted that Rosie \u201cpersevered,\u201d Trump said, \u201cGood word!\u201d While DeVos and Trump didn\u2019t take questions from reporters, they entertained questions and comments from the students. \u201cYou are the next generation,\u201d Trump told the girls, encouraging them to grow up to be inventors, engineers and coders. After the reading session, DeVos and Trump worked on some STEM-focused projects with the students. Pictures here, here and here.

aV \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma, Benjamin Wermund and Mel Leonor  THE SPARRING OVER VOUCHERS CONTINUES: Proponents of private school vouchers on Monday held a call with reporters to rail against a recent report backed by the American Federation of Teachers and Center for American Progress that describes the \u201cracist origins of private school vouchers.\u201d The rebuttal comes after days of pitched fighting in the education community sparked by the report, which looks at how Virginia\u2019s Prince Edward County sought to avoid racial integration more than 60 years ago through vouchers. Critics believe the report illustrates the potential consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s support for federal investment in voucher expansion.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of 50CAN, an education reform advocacy organization, said the public school system is often \u201cthe biggest, most pernicious engine of segregation in American culture.\u201d New Jersey has \u201ca constitutional provision against school segregation, yet has among the most segregated schools in America,\u201d he said. Bradford said the American Federation of Teachers and the Center for American Progress should \u201cknow better and it's sad that they've elected to take this line of reasoning on this issue." More.  \u2014 Darrell Allison, president of Parents for Educational Freedom in North Carolina, an advocacy group, said thousands of low-income families in the state are applying for private school scholarships to escape failing public schools. \u201cYou know in our state we have 2,450 traditional public schools, and poor low-income, mostly minority children are disproportionately assigned to public schools with letter grade D or F. So when we make broad strokes statements that public schools are places of \u2018endless opportunities\u2019 \u2026 for that low-income parent in North Carolina, when faced with the reality of schools the system assigned their precious child to, there\u2019s nothing great about that. More.  \u2014 Catherine Brown, vice president of education policy at CAP, said in response to Monday\u2019s criticism that, \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see certain advocates of voucher programs trying to shout down a historically accurate account of the history of vouchers \u2014 a history that is rooted in racism and segregation, and a history that everyone in this country has a responsibility to acknowledge in order to not repeat the mistakes of past. While the silence on voucher program\u2019s racist history from DeVos and Trump is deafening, the swift defensiveness and hostility from some voucher advocates has been alarming. American students deserve reassurance that they will not face taxpayer funded discrimination and a government that believes in the importance of public education.\u201d Brown also penned an op-ed last week titled, \u201cThe History of School Vouchers Isn\u2019t Flattering.\u201d Read it.

HIGHER ED GROUPS SEEK EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC PELL GRANT INCREASES: More than 300 advocacy groups and institutions of higher education today are urging Congress to extend annual increases in Pell grant funding that are pegged to inflation. For the past five years, a mandatory \u201cadd-on\u201d award has boosted the value of the Pell grant above what Congressional appropriators provide for the program each year. The amount of that \u201cadd-on\u201d is adjusted each year to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index \u2014 and it\u2019s funded through mandatory appropriations rather than being subject to the discretion of Congress each year.  \u2014 Mandatory \u201cadd-on\u201d increases in recent years have allowed the amount of the maximum Pell grant to increase even as Congressional appropriators kept their discretionary funding of the program at the same level. But the provision linking the amount of the \u201cadd-on\u201d to inflation each year \u2013 which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 \u2013 will expire at the end of the 2017-18 school year.  \u2014 \u201cAbsent Congressional action, the maximum Pell Grant award will no longer adjust with inflation after this upcoming school year,\u201d the groups write in a letter, which was organized by The Education Trust. \u201cAs costs for students continue to rise, ending the annual inflation adjustment is \u2014 in real terms \u2014 a cut to the value of the Pell Grant.\u201d Read it here.

The ad, which will begin playing on radio stations today, argues that if the \u201cbathroom bills\u201d pass, the NFL, which has voiced opposition to the bills, could reject the Cowboys\u2019 bid to host the festivities, the Dallas Morning News reports.   \u2014 Texas Republicans have proposed a handful of bills during the state\u2019s special session that would restrict bathroom use and would prohibit school districts, cities and counties from passing ordinances to \u201cprotect a class of persons from discrimination\u201d by allowing them to use the bathroom of their choice. Similar efforts failed during the regular session, but Gov. Greg Abbott revived them for the special session that he called. They have the support of Senate leadership, but the House speaker has vocally opposed them.   \u2014 Several police chiefs from major Texas cities, as well as the mayor of Austin, will protest the bill at the state capitol today. Those cities include Austin, Houston and San Antonio. The superintendent of a San Antonio school district is also slated to appear at the rally, a livestream of which can be found here at noon. The state\u2019s former education commissioner, Michael Williams, meanwhile, voiced opposition to the bathroom bills in a tweet he posted on Monday. \u201c35 years ago when I \u2018came out\u2019 as a Republican it never crossed my mind my party would some day worry about what bathrooms people used,\u201d he wrote.  ILLINOIS FUNDING SHOWDOWN CONTINUES: Uncertainty still clouds school districts in Illinois, where state lawmakers continue to clash over how to fund the state\u2019s public schools. On Monday, Illinois Democrats blew past a noon deadline set by Gov. Bruce Rauner to deliver the school funding bill to his desk, triggering a special session to start Wednesday.   \u2014 What\u2019s the hold up? Depends on who you ask. Rauner has repeatedly denounced the bill as a \u201cbailout\u201d for troubled Chicago Public Schools and promised to amend it by veto once it does reach his desk. Democrats have ignored Rauner\u2019s requests to send up the bill, asking the governor to meet with Democratic lawmakers before taking his pen to the legislation.   \u2014 Hanging in the balance is the start of the school year. School districts are due for funding in early August, and a special provision inserted in the budget by Democrats will hold those funds until Illinois enacts a new \u201cevidence-based\u201d funding formula. The proposal at the center of the debate sets a target level of funding for each district and doles out funds from the bottom up to work towards equity. Right now, Illinois schools draw most of their funding from local tax dollars, meaning districts in low-income areas often have the fewest resources to educate their students. It also gives cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools additional funding, on top of state block grants, to help it cover teacher pension payments. (CPS is the only district that controls its teachers' pensions.) This is the part Rauner hopes to amend by veto. More from the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune.   GI BILL EXPANSION SAILS THROUGH HOUSE: The House on Monday overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation that would expand the education benefits offered to veterans under the GI Bill. Lawmakers voted 405-0 to pass the legislation, H.R. 3218 (115), sending it to the Senate, where the Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee is scheduled to markup an identical version of the bill on Wednesday. More here.  CHARTER SCHOOL LEADERS THANK LAWMAKERS FOR DREAM ACT: Charter school leaders are thanking Sens. Dick Durbin and Lindsey Graham for introducing the bipartisan DREAM Act of 2017, which aims to provide a legislative solution for "DREAMers" or undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The bill that would give young undocumented immigrants a chance to become lawful permanent residents and eventually apply for citizenship.   \u2014 Nina Rees, CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, writes in a letter that, \u201cSome of our students were born elsewhere and brought to our country as very young children, without going through the appropriate processes. For them, America is home, the only country they know and the only country to which they have allegiance.\u201d Rees stresses the importance of nurturing that allegiance. \u201cThe threat of deportation and limited access to the benefits of citizenship work against this goal and put students under tremendous stress, inhibiting their ability to learn,\u201d she writes. Read the letters here and here.  \u2014 Richard Barth, CEO of KIPP Public Charter Schools, says in a letter to Durbin that \u201cit is heartening to see such an illustrative group of senators reach across the aisle to work together to ensure immigrant children can continue pursuing the American dream \u2026 We have seen firsthand the positive impact that federal policy can have had on our undocumented students.\u201d Barth shares the experience of a student named Brandon, a DREAMer and alum of the KIPP network. Brandon says, \u201cI am currently thriving in my second year in college and am on track to graduate from one of the best business schools in the country \u2026 Everywhere I look I see good people doing good things \u2014 people in power advocating for students like me. That is what makes me hopeful. I believe in America, and I know, through nineteen years of experience, that Americans believe in me.\u201d Read the letter.

aV \u000a            By MICHAEL STRATFORD  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Caitlin Emma  SHOWDOWN OVER WEST VIRGINIA\u2019S FEDERAL STUDENT AID: West Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor and its bipartisan congressional delegation are urging Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reverse her agency\u2019s decision to impose new restrictions on federal funding of the state\u2019s public colleges and universities. The Education Department last week imposed sanctions on West Virginia\u2019s public higher education systems after state officials were late in submitting annual financial statements to the feds for the third year in a row. The department ruled that, for at least five years, the colleges would have to distribute federal student loans and grants first using their own institutional funds \u2014 and then seek reimbursement from the department.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 It\u2019s unusual for the department to impose those restrictions \u2014 known as heightened cash monitoring \u2014 on the public institutions of an entire state. Most of the roughly 545 campuses currently facing those restrictions are for-profit institutions or private, non-profit schools that have failed the department\u2019s financial responsibility test or given officials some other reason to doubt their ability to manage federal funds.  \u2014 The sanctions are putting a \u201cbig financial burden on our colleges,\u201d which had already been facing budget cuts from the legislature, said Jessica Kennedy, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure this doesn\u2019t have any impact on students,\u201d she said.  \u2014 West Virginia each year receives roughly $609 million in federal student loans and grants, according to Kennedy. Campus officials are working with state budget officials to make sure that the schools are able to float that amount money to students before being reimbursed by the Education Department, a process that could take as long as two weeks.  \u2014 State education officials say that they were late in submitting the financial paperwork because of a delay in the financial statements of the entire state government, which was out of their control. Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, said in a statement last week that \u201cheads will roll\u201d when he finds out who is responsible for \u201cthis disastrous mistake three years in a row.\u201d He said that West Virginia\u2019s \u201cschools and students are being penalized because of a mistake that\u2019s been brewing two years and ten months before I got here.\u201d  \u2014 The Education Department rejected that explanation last week. A department official wrote in a letter to West Virginia officials that \u201cthe failure to submit an acceptable complete audit and audited financial statements by the due date is a serious violation,\u201d noting that this year marks \u201cthe third annual submission that is late.\u201d  \u2014 The state\u2019s bipartisan congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to DeVos urging her to reconsider the department\u2019s decision. \u201cThe people who will be harmed most by these sanctions are the low income students who rely on federal financial assistance to attend college,\u201d said the letter signed by Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito and Reps. David McKinley, Alex Mooney and Evan Jenkins. They added: \u201cWe hope that you will put the needs of West Virginia students above bureaucratic technicalities while the state works to correct past mistakes.\u201d  \u2014 Scheduling note: President Donald Trump today is traveling to West Virginia, where he\u2019ll visit the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s 2017 National Scout Jamboree.

HOUSE VOTES TODAY ON GI BILL EXPANSION: The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote today on legislation that would expand the educational benefits to veterans under the GI Bill. The bill, H.R. 3218 (115), would eliminate a 15-year time limit that veterans have to use their educational assistance as well as expand funding for veterans to enroll in non-traditional education providers like coding boot camps. It would also boost veterans educational assistance for National Guard and Reserve troops and for the dependents of fallen troops. In addition, the legislation would fully restore the GI Bill educational benefits of student veterans who were affected by the closures of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech.  \u2014 An identical companion bill was introduced last week in the Senate, where the Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee has scheduled a markup for this Wednesday at 12 p.m.   SETTLEMENT TALKS IN LAWSUIT OVER PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS: Government attorneys representing the Trump administration said in court filings on Friday that they were in talks to settle an ongoing lawsuit over the Education Department\u2019s denial of applications in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The American Bar Association and four attorneys working in public-service jobs have sued the department, accusing officials of reneging on promises that it would forgive their loans.  \u2014 The Justice Department attorneys representing the Education Department on Friday asked the federal judge overseeing the case for more time to file their next motion so that they could have \u201cadditional time to continue to discuss settlement\u201d with the plaintiffs in the case. But the American Bar Association pushed back, writing in its own filing that the department has not sought to settle all of their claims. The government, the attorneys for the ABA wrote, \u201chave merely purported to \u2018offer\u2019 to settle individual portions\u201d of the four attorneys\u2019 case but only as part of a \u201cpackage\u201d under which they agree to dismiss the entire lawsuit \u201cin exchange for piecemeal relief on a small set of claims.\u201d The ABA argued that the Education Department shouldn\u2019t be granted any more extensions in the case because borrowers were being harmed by the delay. A federal judge on Saturday split the difference, giving the department a one-week extension instead of the two-week reprieve it had been seeking.  \u2014 The lawsuit drew attention earlier this year because of an Education Department filing in which it said that borrowers could not rely on their loan servicers to determine whether they were actually on track to receive loan forgiveness under the federal program. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also warned about problems with how the department\u2019s contracted loan servicers are carrying out the program \u2014 which the Trump administration has proposed eliminating.  ASHFORD UNIVERSITY LOSES BID TO KEEP GI BILL ELIGIBILITY: An Iowa judge last week upheld a decision by the state regulators to cut off GI Bill eligibility for Ashford University's online programs across the country. The Bridgepoint Education-owned for-profit school had sued to block the Iowa State Approving Agency\u2019s decision, which threatens the ability of thousands of student veterans to use their benefits at the school. The state regulators' decision stemmed from Ashford\u2019s closure in 2015 of its physical campus in Iowa. That decision had been stayed until last week when a judge issued a preliminary order against the for-profit school, which becomes final next month unless the company appeals.   \u2014 Curtis Coy, deputy under secretary of economic opportunity at the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, sent an email to affected student veterans last week, bracing for the court ruling to become final on August 16. After that point, Coy wrote, students will no longer be able to use GI Bill educational benefits at Ashford\u2019s online programs. \u201cVA does not have the legal authority to restore any GI Bill benefits you have used to attend Ashford University, even if you are not finished with your program,\u201d he wrote in the email. \u201cHowever, you are free to pursue your education goals at another approved school or training facility.\u201d  THE LAB-COAT LIBERALS MARCH ON WASHINGTON: \u201cDismayed by President Donald Trump\u2019s perceived hostility to climate science and other areas of research, a surge of scientists is entering the public arena and running for political office for the first time,\u201d reports POLITICO\u2019s David Siders. \u201cThey represent an evolving brand of Democrat that has been gaining steam for months. What began with rogue Twitter accounts and protest marches has graduated into candidacies in House races in places as varied as California, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York. The handful of scientists who have formally announced their candidacies so far \u2014 and the others who are preparing to join them \u2014 have cast themselves as a counterforce to the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of climate science and de-prioritization of innovation funding.\u201d Read more.   EDU-PINION: John Schilling, chief operating officer at the American Federation for Children, penned a recent op-ed in the National Review defending the notion of a federal tax credit to help working class families access private school. AFC, an advocacy group formerly chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, is pushing for the creation of such a program, which reportedly has interest from the Trump administration.   \u2014 In the op-ed, Schilling pushes back on the Heritage Foundation and for concerns that the program would come with too many regulatory strings. \u201cA federal education tax credit would not be a federal program, no matter how anyone tries to spin it,\u201d Schilling writes. \u201cEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has said that the administration has no intention of imposing anything on states \u2014 a view the majority in Congress shares \u2014 making it clear that the feds won\u2019t be doing any regulating of private schools, which is a state responsibility.\u201d   \u2014 The op-ed comes as groups supporting the creation of a federal tax credit scholarship program beat the drum on school choice during the summer months, hoping it will be included in a broader tax overhaul tackled by Congress.

REPORT ROLL CALL   \u2014 Nobel Prize-winning economist James Heckman is out with a new brief on the Nurse-Family Partnership program, which receives funding through the the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting federal grant program.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Maggie Severns and Colin Wilhelm  HOW ABOUT ANOTHER TIMING ANNOUNCEMENT? There\u2019s less than five months left in 2017, and you can probably safely expect that there will be a lot of discussion here about whether a tax deal is on track to get done before 2018.  Story Continued Below  The latest installation: Key GOP senators stayed true to the reputation of their chamber, seeming to back a more deliberate timeline for tax reform. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s top person on the Hill, laid out a plan for tax reform markups in September, House passage in October and clearing the Senate in November.  But Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), at least in his scripted remarks, only vowed a markup this fall. (Muddying the waters a bit, Hatch also told reporters that he did plan for the committee to consider a tax overhaul next month.) For his part, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) basically avoided the question when asked if tax reform could be wrapped up by November. \u201cThe hope is to do this through regular order,\u201d Cornyn told reporters, among other things.  One of the issues: Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before, but Obamacare might end up holding up other parts of the Republican agenda. The issue this time is that Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) is making noise about a bipartisan measure to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, while President Donald Trump, still angry that the GOP has fallen short on repeal, has threatened to revoke the cost-sharing reduction payments that help lower-income people afford insurance.  And that\u2019s got Hatch hopping mad, as your Morning Tax author and Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo report \u2014 eyeing a September full of legislative landmines, and believing that tax reform basically needs his committee\u2019s close-to-undivided attention. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to health care. We\u2019re in tax now. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they shot their wad on health care and that\u2019s the way it is. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Hatch said this week.   But hey, assistant secretary for tax! Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s team filled out quite a bit on Thursday right before the Senate skipped town, with David Kautter, now the assistant secretary for tax policy, among the nominees waved through. (The Senate filled more than five dozen positions in all, according to the Financial Services team\u2019s Zach Warmbrodt.) Other Treasury nominees confirmed: David Malpass as undersecretary for international affairs, Chris Campbell as assistant secretary for financial institutions, Brent McIntosh as general counsel and Andrew Maloney as deputy undersecretary for legislative affairs.  WELCOME TO MORNING TAX, first day of full congressional recess edition. Want to celebrate? It\u2019s also the 324th anniversary of when Dom Perignon invented champagne! (Well, actually, that\u2019s probably a myth. And the good monk probably didn\u2019t say \u201ccome quickly, I am drinking the stars.\u201d But don\u2019t stop on our account.)

NO MIDDLING FIGHT: Mortgage interest deduction has been called one of the numerous third rails in American politics, but our Colin Wilhelm reports that the Trump administration sounds willing to put some serious limits on it. That was the message some officials from the real estate lobby took from a Monday meeting with two of Trump\u2019s top deputies on tax issues, Gary Cohn and Shahira Knight. (One potential idea \u2014 capping the deduction at $500,000, instead of a $1 million, a la former House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp\u2019s plan.)  It\u2019s a reminder that Republicans are going to need to search for revenue, after the implosion of the border adjustment, and that both liberals and conservatives have objected that the current incentive doesn\u2019t do much to help the working class. But as Colin notes, the deduction has proven durable in part because of the support from industry and the many, many homeowners who rely on it. And then there\u2019s the final wild card: the president\u2019s decades as a real estate developer.  NOW OFFERING DIGITAL BOUQUETS: Americans for Affordable Products, the coalition of retailers and others that relentlessly fought against the border adjustment, is now offering thank-yous to the GOP lawmakers who helped kill the proposal \u2014 or at least expressed some skepticism about it. The lawmakers receiving that appreciation include Cornyn, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio).  REMEMBER, THEY STILL NEED A BUDGET: House Republicans left town without passing a budget, but GOP senators told reporters Thursday that they expected a budget markup in their chamber in September. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) also noted that Republican senators are debating whether to use a current policy or current law baseline \u2014 an idea that could influence how generous a tax package can be.  FOXCONNED? Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Wisconsin chapter is breaking with Gov. Scott Walker over his proposed $3 billion in tax incentives to lure the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn to the state. \u201cAs much as we believe in Governor Walker\u2019s agenda that has turned this state around, as free market activists who staunchly oppose government tax incentives, we cannot support the expensive refundable tax credits in this package, which are not available to every other business in our state,\u201d Eric Bott, AFP\u2019s Wisconsin state director, said in a statement. But as the Associated Press notes, the decision from a key Koch organization isn\u2019t likely to trip up the incentive package that\u2019s winding its way through the GOP legislature. Foxconn is eyeing sites in southeast Wisconsin, between Milwaukee and Chicago, the AP added.  Still, it\u2019s pretty stunning for AFP to break with Walker. When Walker was running for president in 2015, Tim Phillips, AFP\u2019s president, raved that \u201cthe difference Scott Walker has made with his policy achievements is as transformative as any governor anywhere in a generation.\u201d  SPEAKING OF AFP: Mark your calendars, because AFP is breaking out the big guns. Vice President Mike Pence will address Americans for Prosperity\u2019s annual summit, set for August 19 in Richmond, Va. The summit, which offers AFP volunteers a chance to network, attend training sessions and hear from a battery of speakers, will focus this year on tax reform \u2014 the Koch network\u2019s main focus heading into fall.  FIRE WITH FIRE: Conservative and business groups have already started ramping up their advocacy campaigns for tax reform, and now they\u2019re getting a progressive foil, The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel reports. The Not One Penny campaign, led by the Tax March, MoveOn and the Working Families Party, won\u2019t have nearly the resources as those other groups as it seeks to oppose any tax overhaul that lowers corporate tax rates or taxes on the wealthy. But organizers say their advantage will come from the energy generated by the GOP\u2019s failure so far to repeal Obamacare and the grassroots energy behind the Tax March on April 15. "In mid-July, as the fight to kill Obamacare repeal was underway, more than 50 organizers from the 'resistance' underwent training on best practices for organizing against tax cuts. They\u2019ve fanned out to create anti-tax-cut presences in congressional districts over the long August recess," Weigel writes.  COINS GOTTA STICK TOGETHER: Coin Center, a D.C.-based, digital currency-focused think tank, filed an amicus brief late Thursday on behalf of Coinbase, the largest digital currency exchange in the U.S. The IRS has pushed for two years\u2019 worth of comprehensive user records from Coinbase in an important case for the burgeoning technology. The government tax agency maintains that it has reasonable cause to suspect several of Coinbase\u2019s users based in America may have avoided paying taxes owed on Bitcoin-related trades, while Coinbase maintains that the IRS\u2019s request is unjustified and far too broad. No real shocker here, but Coin Center\u2019s with Coinbase. \u201cIf such a simple and sweeping statement of purpose is sufficient to qualify as a legitimate purpose, there would be no meaningful judicial check in place to stop the IRS from using the John Doe summons process to collect the personal records of every person who had bought or sold stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, art within a given time period from Sotheby\u2019s, rare books from City Lights Booksellers, or cash deposits or withdrawals at Bank of America,\u201d said Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center\u2019s executive director and director of research, respectively.   INTERNATIONAL UPDATE  DOES THAT ADD UP? At first glance, Google\u2019s tax bill in Sweden seems to line up \u2014 an effective rate of 22 percent. But Business Insider Nordic reports that doesn\u2019t take into account how much of the online giant\u2019s business in the country was routed through Ireland, with one estimate finding that \u201cthe corporate tax Google paid in Sweden was less than one thousandth of its sales.\u201d  STATE NEWS  COMING TOGETHER: Thirteen states have banded together for a tax amnesty program for Amazon sellers, CNBC reports. Merchants selling through Amazon currently owe about $2 billion from sales taxes that have gone uncollected, but would be able to only be liable for taxes on future sales if they enlist in the program starting in the middle of the month. How is their $2 billion in uncollected taxes? Independent sellers can sign up to get access to Amazon\u2019s warehouses. But in doing so, those merchants might also make in-state sales from those warehouses that would force them to charge sales taxes \u2014 sometimes without their knowledge, because of the sprawling nature of Amazon\u2019s infrastructure.  WHAT NEXT? The future of the nuclear production tax credit is now in flux after a South Carolina provider decided to halt construction on a pair of nuclear plants, Tax Analysts\u2019 Asha Glover and Stephen Cooper report. The House passed a nuclear tax bill, but the Senate was seeking to combine that measure with a host of other energy provisions. \u201cBut the latest developments in South Carolina, combined with pessimism about the prospects for the projects in Georgia, have led some senators to question if the legislation is still necessary.\u201d  QUICK LINKS  The Financial Times examines why international tax rules will be such a challenge in tax reform.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo  TURKEY WITH A DOLLOP OF DOMESTIC POLICY SUCCESS: Whether they like it or not, key Republicans are \u2014 of their own doing \u2014 basically making Thanksgiving almost a make-or-break moment for tax reform.  Story Continued Below  Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said at a Wednesday event sponsored by Americans for Prosperity that tax reform just wouldn\u2019t make it if an overhaul wasn\u2019t on President Donald Trump\u2019s desk by Thanksgiving, becoming the second big-name Republican in just a few days to suggest November would be key for tax reform. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s top liaison to Capitol Hill, on Monday laid out what he called an \u201caggressive\u201d timeline for tax reform that included passing both the House and the Senate by November.   Other tidbits from Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo: Meadows called for a corporate tax rate into the teens, suggested that he was open to expanding the budget window beyond a decade and once more insisted he wanted deficit-neutral \u2014 not revenue-neutral \u2014 tax reform. (The Freedom Caucus chairman has for a while wanted to offset tax cuts with spending cuts.)  Those happen to be just several of the rather central details that Republicans still have to work through on taxes, after that very high-level statement that came out of the Big Six of senior administration officials and top GOP lawmakers last week.   That\u2019s not all: Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s budget chief, became perhaps the most dismissive top Republicans yet of working with Democrats on tax reform Wednesday, telling Fox News that "my gut is that a tax bill looks a lot weaker \u2014 a lot less likely to get us to 3 percent economic growth \u2014 if we've got eight, 10, 12, 14 Democrats on it."  To be fair, the smart money has long been on tax reform being a partisan exercise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) just this week dismissed the idea that the GOP could work with Democrats on the issue, and Axios reported that the White House hadn\u2019t reached out in a serious way on taxes to any of the 10 Democratic senators on the ballot next year in states won by Trump. But at the same time, Short was still selling the idea this week that bipartisanship was possible.  AND THEN: It's not like the Heritage Foundation releasing a study expounding on the benefits of full expensing should be all that surprising. Adam Michel and Salim Furth argue that nothing else is quite as good for the economy in their new paper, saying it helps to increase both employment and wages for American workers. Dropping the corporate rate and exempting companies\u2019 foreign income from U.S. taxes are both good ideas, the authors added \u2014 but not in the same league as full expensing when it comes to expanding economic growth. \u201cWhile lower tax rates are an important part of tax reform, expensing provides a larger economic gain because it is forward-looking, removing the current system\u2019s bias against new investment,\u201d they wrote.  Maybe it's the fact that Heritage released a new paper on the topic at all that is even more interesting than its findings. Michel and Furth released a similar paper not even two months ago, but a spokesman said the new release was aimed at pushing back on what the foundation believes is the \u201cwrong narrative\u201d \u2014 that robust expensing provisions aren\u2019t crucial to tax reform.  The Koch orbit, most notably Americans for Prosperity, and House Freedom Caucus members have been among those recently downplaying the importance of full expensing. In other words: expensing is also on that list of the very central details that the right is still not united on when it comes to tax reform.  Finally: Some Freedom Caucus members are grumbling that they don\u2019t have enough details on the GOP\u2019s tax reform path to sell it while they\u2019re back home, Bloomberg\u2019s Sahil Kapur reports.  And Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the panel's top Democrat, sent a letter to Finance Committee leaders urging them to take care of true small businesses in a tax revamp. The two senators added that lawmakers need to include protections against gaming along with any preference for pass-through income.  THANKS FOR HANGING IN with us here at Morning Tax.

IN THE HOLE: Three of Trump\u2019s political appointees have racked up some pretty extensive tax debts, the Center for Public Integrity\u2019s Dave Levinthal reports off an examination of financial disclosure forms. Two of the officials, Joe Alexander, a special assistant in the Agriculture Department, and Deborah Cox-Roush, White House liaison for the Corporation for National and Community Service, both are on IRS payment plans for tax debts of up to $50,000. Justin Clark, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs and a deputy assistant to the president, also owes up to $50,000 but doesn\u2019t seem to have a payment plan.  Lawmakers have proposed barring people with serious tax debts from holding government positions, but that idea hasn\u2019t gained much traction. Also of note, as Levinthal reports: Don\u2019t think this is just a Trump thing. \u201cTrump\u2019s appointment of federal debtors to his administration perpetuates a pattern that\u2019s dogged presidential administrations \u2014 including that of President Barack Obama \u2014 for decades.\u201d  ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, I CAN DO BETTER: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and several politically vulnerable members of his caucus unveiled a trade agenda that sounded downright Trump-y on Wednesday \u2014 an attempt "to put pressure on the White House to work across the aisle on trade or risk looking weak" on the issue, as Pro Trade's Megan Cassella put it. Among the proposals: Tax incentives for companies that bring jobs back to the U.S., and tax punishments for those that do the opposite.  ALL FITTING UNDER ONE UMBRELLA: The IRS is setting up an investigations unit to focus solely on international crimes, your Morning Tax author reported Wednesday. Don Fort, the new chief of the IRS criminal investigations division, said the unit will hopefully build on the agency\u2019s recent triumphs in the international sphere, including its partnership with the Justice Department in targeting Swiss banks that helped facilitate offshore tax evasion.   Fort added in a conference call with reporters that his division would be seeking to take fewer identity theft cases in the years to come. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has made battling identity theft one of his central issues, following an explosion of new cases in recent years. But Fort noted that his division is responsible for more traditional tax enforcement matters \u2014 like tax evasion \u2014 and that declining resources means that it can only take the most far-reaching identity theft cases going forward.  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE  SOAK THE RICH TIME: The South Korean government is seeking to buck the current global trend on corporate taxes, Bloomberg reports \u2014 looking to increase its top rate from 22 percent to 25 percent. President Moon Jae-in has called tax hikes on both corporations and wealthy South Koreans key planks in the government\u2019s efforts to reduce income inequality. The new highest tax rate on corporations would hit companies with annual taxable incomes north of 200 billion won (around $178 million), while the government also wants to hike the top rate on individuals to 42 percent for those making more than 500 million won a year (around $445,000). The potential issue for a package that could raise around $5.5 trillion a year in won (about $4.5 billion), according to the government: Moon\u2019s party only has about 40 percent of the seats in South Korea\u2019s parliament.  STATE NEWS  WE SAID WHAT? Foxconn, the Taiwanese-based electronics manufacturer that makes devices for Apple, Sony and others, isn\u2019t commenting on Trump\u2019s assertion that it will invest as much as $30 billion in the U.S, the Associated Press reports. Trump said this week that Terry Gou, the company\u2019s chief executive, told him \u201coff the record\u201d that he would pour three times as much money as the expected $10 billion it plans for a Wisconsin plant. In a statement, Foxconn would only say that its Wisconsin facility would be just the first in a series of investments, and that it would offer an update on future plans whenever they were ready.  As for the Wisconsin plant, Republicans who control the legislature there are split over the $3 billion worth of incentives that Gov. Scott Walker is pushing to sew up the deal with Foxconn. Wisconsin\u2019s agreement with Foxconn says those tax breaks need to be in place by the end of next month, but there are questions about the size of the package that the state is offering in exchange for anywhere from 3,000 to 13,000 jobs.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/02/2017 08:32 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo  PIVOT UPDATE: Look at that \u2014 tax reform has reached the part of the proceedings where congressional leaders strive to set the markers for the debate.  Story Continued Below  Case in point: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and 44 of the other 47 Democratic senators sent a letter to the GOP demanding a few things that tax reform shouldn\u2019t be: a boon to the wealthy, a net tax cut or passed through budget reconciliation.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s retort, via our Elana Schor: That letter proved exactly why Republicans need to use reconciliation \u2014 because Democrats are unwilling to work on the majority party\u2019s priorities, McConnell said, declaring that the bipartisan template that got tax reform across the finish line in 1986 just doesn\u2019t exist anymore.  And what about that trio of Democrats who didn't sign? Those three \u2014 Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2014 are definitely vulnerable next year, and their decision not to sign raised suspicions that they might be the three most likely to play ball with Republicans on tax reform. (Other Democrats who are also in danger, like Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Jon Tester of Montana, did sign the letter.) GOP senators on Tuesday did drop some hints about trying to reach out to Democrats who might be interested in their line of thinking. But as our Colin Wilhelm put it, Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin all \u201cplayed down the significance of their demurral from the letter, and it's certainly too early to read much into it other than political caution.\u201d (Also of note: It doesn\u2019t sound like President Donald Trump and the White House have done a ton of wooing of those vulnerable Democrats on tax reform.)  AND WHAT ABOUT PERMANENCE? One of the knotty big-picture questions that Republicans are still working on when it comes to taxes is how crucial it is to make any changes permanent.  To be fair, that\u2019s basically everyone\u2019s preference \u2014 though, in recent months, it certainly seemed like permanence was more of a priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) than other key negotiators. But now, there\u2019s increasing chatter that Republicans might have to rely on a mix of permanent and temporary tax changes in order to jump through all the requisite reconciliation hoops.  So how would that work? It wouldn\u2019t take any special procedural steps for the GOP to mix it up like that within a reconciliation bill, Rohit Kumar, a former top McConnell aide, told Morning Tax. (Recall, for instance, that Republican health care bills pushed the Cadillac tax on expensive employer-provided health insurance plans back until 2025.) But Kumar, now at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said there were other issues to watch out for as Republicans eyed that path.  Temporary can easily become permanent: The recent health care debate and even the fiscal cliff negotiations, which kept the vast, vast majority of the Bush tax cuts, show that it\u2019s tough to get rid of policies once you\u2019ve got them on the books. \u201cIt would be totally rational to think, \u2018here\u2019s some stuff that we can only afford to do for seven to 10 years,\u2019 but in the back of your minds have some confidence that not all of this will go away,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cIt turns out once the public has a benefit for several years, they react poorly when the government tries to take it away from them.\u201d  It could take some imagination: Remember how Ryan\u2019s office said that not even a three-year corporate tax cut would work under reconciliation rules, because it would cause deficits in the out years? No matter what, Republicans will likely need to find offsets either in the first decade or for the years outside the budget window to account for those kinds of reverberations, Kumar said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that you can do. All of them would be unsatisfactory, and they\u2019re all things that people would later wish not to happen,\u201d he added. (In other words: Might you look for an offset that\u2019s unpopular enough that you don\u2019t expect it to get implemented?)  What would be temporary and what would be permanent? Probably too soon to say. But the policy change most likely to stay for the long-term would be a territorial system, Kumar said, because the Joint Committee on Taxation would likely score that like a years-long repatriation holiday \u2014 i.e., poorly.  THANKS FOR HEADING BACK for another installment of Morning Tax. Another taxiversary: It\u2019s 80 years to the day since the \u201cMarihuana Tax Act of 1937\u201d \u2014 yes, that\u2019s how it was spelled \u2014 was signed into law by then-President Franklin Roosevelt. (The law came out around the same time as the movie \u201cReefer Madness,\u201d and was later overturned by the Supreme Court in a case brought by the professor and activist Timothy Leary \u2014 leading to the current Controlled Substances Act.)

THE OUTSIDE GAME: There\u2019s been a lot of talk about how Republicans are going to step up their messaging campaign for tax reform, and our Nancy Cook found out some of the details. Outside groups like the American Action Network, Americans for Prosperity and Business Roundtable are going to spend millions of dollars on a campaign that won\u2019t focus much on how tax reform would help the corporate community. Instead, the spots will have the more populist tint aimed at Trump voters. \u201cThose ads will focus on how tax reform will hit consumers\u2019 pocketbooks, boost American jobs and help economic growth broadly, not on the benefits for the big businesses helping to fund the campaign,\u201d Nancy writes.  Speaking of which: Trump took to the East Room on Tuesday afternoon in his first real attempt to sell tax reform, this time at a small business event. The message at that meeting from Linda McMahon, the Small Business Administration chief, was that the Trump administration continues to believe tax rates should drop for all kinds of businesses, not just corporations, Matthew Haller of the International Franchise Association told Morning Tax.  That was a \u201cgood signal,\u201d Haller said. And yet, one of the attendees added to Morning Tax that he's still worried that Washington will fall short on a tax overhaul and instead fall back on simple corporate rate cuts. Matt Hefter, who owns a home and office painting franchise in Wisconsin, said that not giving pass-throughs and corporations equal treatment would cause business owners like him to waste time and money on accountants exploring whether to reorganize to secure lower rates.  The view from the left: Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon remain concerned that a steep reduction in taxes on pass-throughs could lead to a major loophole, as partners in lucrative partnerships could take advantage and mischaracterize capital gains income as wage income at a lower rate. Along similar lines, Americans for Tax Fairness said after Tuesday\u2019s meeting that the administration\u2019s 15 percent business rate is \u201ca massive tax giveaway for Wall Street hedge fund managers, big law firms, and real estate developers like Trump.\u201d  OH, MORE ON THAT TRUMP INTERVIEW: Our Josh Dawsey and Hadas Gold got their hands on the transcript of Trump\u2019s recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, and it turns out there was some more interesting stuff on taxes. The president, for instance, once again called the U.S. the highest-taxed nation in the world, and said American companies had as much as $5 trillion offshore. (Not really true in either case.) Meanwhile, Trump and what seems to be Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, went into further detail on the administration\u2019s hopes to make as many tax changes permanent as possible. (Another fun passage: Trump describing how George Steinbrenner\u2019s estate was taxed.)  Related: Reuters asks whether Trump is undercutting the case for tax reform by celebrating how much money corporations are making right now.  FAREWELL, MOOCH: Morning Tax made but one, brief reference to Anthony Scaramucci during his 10-day tenure as White House communications director \u2014 about how the former hedge fund executive was seeking to defer paying taxes on the sale of his company, SkyBridge Capital. And now as CNN reports, that\u2019s a no-go. \u201cMr. Scaramucci is going to pay the capital gains taxes once the sale goes through," Elliot Berke, Scaramucci\u2019s attorney, told CNN. "There was never an attempt to game the system \u2014 it was simply to adhere to what is allowable by law. His true and only purpose was to serve the country. And he will be back.\u201d  If you\u2019re interested in diving into waist-high weeds on this, David Herzig, a law professor at Valparaiso, wrote a primer on the tax provision itself and whether Scaramucci qualified before his lawyer sent the statement to CNN. (Short answer: it was a \u201copen and contentious\u201d question whether Scaramucci qualified.)  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE  ANOTHER GO-ROUND FOR INDIA AND APPLE: The world\u2019s second-most populated country and the mobile phone power continue to stare each other down over tax incentives for manufacturing iPhones, Reuters reports. Now, Apple wants India to give its suppliers tax breaks as well. \u201cThe two sides have been discussing a list of "prerequisites" that Apple submitted in October, including duty exemption on raw materials for manufacturing components and capital equipment for 15 years for it to make iPhones from scratch in India.The company has told the government it would be bringing in a host of these ancillary units when it sets up operations to cater to India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets, a top government official said.\u201d  STATE NEWS  GIVE US THOSE TAX INCREASES: Seattle picked a pair of progressive women to face off this fall in a mayor\u2019s race that has focused a lot on taxes \u2014 and how the city needs more of them, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThe debate among candidates has focused on taxes and inequality among residents in a city that has seen median house prices double over the last five years to more than $700,000. Several leading candidates want to ask big corporations to pay more taxes and to invoke a city-wide income tax targeting rich residents \u2014 even though the legality of such a levy is in question for Washington state.\u201d (Reminder: For a liberal state, Washington relies rather heavily on the sales tax and other regressive levies.)

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo  CHECK BACK AT THANKSGIVING: Who needs December?  Story Continued Below  Marc Short, the White House\u2019s top liaison to Congress, laid out a tax reform schedule on Monday that even he acknowledged was pretty aggressive \u2014 with September being for markups, October for House passage of a tax overhaul, and November the Senate\u2019s time, our Aaron Lorenzo reports. Short didn\u2019t get into whether the House and Senate bills would need to be reconciled at an event sponsored by Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners, a couple of groups in the Koch network, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated yet again that tax reform would get done this year.  As for the budget that Republicans would need to move a tax overhaul using reconciliation? Short expects that to be checked off the list in either September or October, though he also floated the idea that there could be some bipartisan interest in taxes. (We\u2019ll see about that.)  Just how aggressive is that? Look at all the work Congress has to do in September beyond its familiar task of extending government funding, as ticked off by our Budget team of Jennifer Scholtes and Sarah Ferris \u2014 the National Flood Insurance Program, the FAA, CHIP and the debt ceiling.  So while top Republicans have said for a while that fall would be the time for tax reform, it\u2019s not like the calendar has been cleared of other obstacles. Something else to keep in mind: Congressional staff are going to have to put in a lot of work during the August recess for bills to be ready for September markups.  All about that coordination: Short added Monday that it looks like the administration and lawmakers will have a much more fruitful relationship with outside groups on tax reform than they did in their efforts to repeal Obamacare, Aaron also reports.Short said to expect a glut of events advocating for tax reform in the second half of August, and noted that the White House has had a better chance to build a coalition on taxes, given that the GOP push on Obamacare started before President Donald Trump was even inaugurated.  BREAK OUT THE BULLY PULPIT: Trump appears at a small business event in the East Room of the White House at 3 p.m. today.

Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @colinwilhelm, @AaronELorenzo, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.  BUT, BUT, BUT \u2026 : Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, told a roundtable of officials from the real estate industry on Monday that the Trump administration and congressional leaders were on the same page on the big-picture tax reform issues.  But the White House also didn\u2019t take long to suggest on Monday that there\u2019s still a lot of work to do on some of the central details of tax reform. For instance, Short said the White House still wants the 15 percent business rate that many tax observers believed was just an opening bid that was bound to sneak higher, the Washington Examiner\u2019s Joseph Lawler reports.  But hours earlier, Cohn didn\u2019t sound as dug in when addressing the real estate officials, saying simply that \u201ccutting the business tax to as low as possible is important to us.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve proposed 15 percent. We\u2019re trying to work off a 15 percent base, and see if we can get there.\u201d Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), speaking to Reuters, sounded even more skeptical that Republicans would be able to pull off such aggressive rate cutting. "In fact, it would be kind of miraculous if we could get it down to 25 percent or less. I'd like to get it down to around 20 percent. I'd love to get it at 15 percent if we could," Hatch said. "But I think the odds are, we\u2019re going to be lucky to get it down at all."  REALLY, WE\u2019RE NOT DOING 44 PERCENT: Short also noted on Fox News that the White House wasn\u2019t interested in the 44 percent top rate for income over $5 million a year that\u2019s been floated by Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist. \u201cI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s on the table right now, to be honest with you,\u201d Short said. Bannon was pushing the rate as a way to pay for tax cuts for the middle-class, Bloomberg reports.  But a couple corollaries there: The top statutory tax rate for individuals is 39.6 percent. But the actual top rate can be more like 44.6 percent when you add throw-ins like Obamacare\u2019s 3.8 percent tax on unearned income, the Pease limitation and the Personal Exemption Phaseout. The other question \u2014 how much money could that 44 percent tax rate, which some observers suspect grew more from political rather than policy considerations, actually raise?  Tough to say, actually. The Tax Foundation\u2019s Kyle Pomerleau estimates that new bracket could raise anywhere from $80 billion to $260 billion over a decade, based on IRS data for 2014 that found about 43,000 tax returns with adjusted gross incomes over $5 million. Why the wide variance? All depends on the design \u2014 a 44 percent rate on ordinary individual income that exempts pass-throughs would be the low end of the estimate, Pomerleau told Morning Tax in an email. The high end assumes that the 44 percent bracket would also sweep up capital gains and dividend income.  THE PUSHBACK FROM THE LEFT: Democrats are starting to step up their efforts to frame the GOP tax reform plans \u2014 and we\u2019re betting they might have a familiar ring to those who have heard the party\u2019s message about taxes and health care in recent years. For instance, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee, took the following shot at Monday\u2019s Koch event, as Aaron also reported: "Congress may have recessed for August, but billionaire special interests, who demand ever more tax breaks, never go into recess."  For its part, Freedom Partners decided not to let that kind of talk go unchallenged, saying it was \u201cfocused on eliminating the special carve outs that rig the economy in favor of the wealthy and well-connected.\u201d Bill Riggs, a spokesman for the group, added that \u201cwe\u2019re hopeful most lawmakers will give the false political smears a rest and work together to do something good for their constituents and the country.\u201d  AVOIDING THE BULLS-EYE: Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) is one of only a handful of House Republicans who have joined legislation that would mandate that presidential candidates release their last three years of tax returns. Why haven\u2019t more Republicans joined him? Well, Sanford told NPR: \u201cBecause nobody wants a bad tweet from Donald Trump,\u201d adding that getting called out by the president on Twitter wasn\u2019t atop his priorities, either. \u201cNobody's looking for a bad day. The president can be quite vigorous in his pronouncements. And you don't want to be at the receiving end of one of those,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cBut I think that, in this case, not letting a 50-year tradition die off or fighting if it is doing so is of greater importance.\u201d  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE  NOT GONNA DO IT: A post-Brexit United Kingdom won\u2019t seek to become a tax haven to undercut its new rivals in the European Union, Reuters reports.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/31/2017 10:01 AM EDT  IT\u2019S TIME: What has five letters, starts with \u201cp\u201d and rhymes with divot?  Yes, the time for the tax reform pivot has arrived. (Well, maybe. More on that later.) But in the meantime, key lawmakers and outside groups are definitely ramping up for tax to be perhaps the key issue in the fall. (Well, maybe for most of it. Debt limit, anyone?)  Story Continued Below  Making the case: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), a.k.a. one-third of the Big Six, expressed confidence that tax reform would get done this year in Fox News interviews on Sunday \u2014 while pushing back on the idea from Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist, to raise the top tax rate to 44 percent.  \u201cI feel much more confident that we\u2019re going to stick the landing on tax reform," Ryan said, via Bloomberg (which added \u201creferring to a successful end for a gymnastics routine.\u201d) As for Brady, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t intend on introducing a 44 percent tax rate in the Ways and Means Committee. We\u2019re going for growth, which means lower rates at every level.\u201d  That dovetails pretty nicely with what Ryan told conservative activists in his office on Friday, our Colin Wilhelm reports. (Remember: Conservative groups also met with White House officials last week to make sure that tax reform messaging isn\u2019t as much of a dud as the campaign to repeal Obamacare.) Ryan told the activists that the goal is a quick strike to lower tax rates and boost expensing provisions, in order to hopefully help the economy in time for the 2018 midterms. One of the big issues, as always: Can it be permanent?  Get that bully pulpit ready: President Donald Trump is going to make a first big attempt to stir up support for tax reform on Tuesday, Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan reports, with an appearance at a small business event at the White House.  Who else? Add American Action Network to the list of outside groups willing to shell out big money \u2014 as much as $20 million \u2014 to shill for tax reform, McClatchy\u2019s Katie Glueck reports. The group joins the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others, in escalating efforts on taxes after the Senate\u2019s health care problems.  But yes, it\u2019s still difficult: The anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, within Colin\u2019s story, bumps Republican agreement on tax reform up to 97 percent with the death of the border adjustment from the House GOP blueprint \u2014 up from the 80 percent to 90 percent top Republicans had been saying. Whether that\u2019s true or not, Pro Tax\u2019s Brian Faler sought to explain the sheer scale of the challenge in front of the GOP, which has to sift through tax breaks helping everyone from bike riders to whale hunters. \u201cThey say it will be easier than dealing with Obamacare, because taxes are much more in their party's bailiwick, and promise to get legislation to President Donald Trump's desk by the end of this year. But most of the lawmakers weren't around for the last tax overhaul, in 1986, and many longtime tax aides say they are seriously underestimating the degree of difficulty that comes with uprooting hundreds of provisions. Many predict they will have no easier time undoing loopholes that have been in the code for decades than they've had rolling back Obamacare.\u201d  And yet, as Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports, GOP tax writers themselves have no illusions that this is going to be easy. \u201cIn regrouping, they'll look to salvage parts of past plans to overhaul tax laws and cobble together a bill they hope to pass this year for a much-needed political win after their latest efforts to upend the Affordable Care Act fizzled again,\u201d Aaron writes. But it might take awhile for Republicans to get their legs under them when both chambers are back in the fall. "I think we'll spend a fair amount of the month of September refocusing on what tax reform looks like going forward," said Rep. Kenny Marchant (R-Texas).

ABOUT THAT MAYBE: Even with Trump getting ready to hit the stump for tax reform, it doesn\u2019t look like the White House is prepared to let go when it comes to Obamacare repeal. Trump himself tweeted something to that effect a couple days back, and then his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said it was administration policy that the Senate shouldn\u2019t vote on anything else \u2014 including the debt ceiling \u2014 before it tackles health care again. "In the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate," Mulvaney said on CNN's "State of the Union,\u201d via Jacqueline Klimas. "You can't promise folks you're going to do something for seven years, and then not do it."  THE PEOPLE ARE READY TO MOVE ON: More than half of Americans want Washington to just throw in the towel on health care, a new Reuters poll found. \u201cWhen asked what they think Congress should do next, most Americans picked other priorities such as tax reform, foreign relations and infrastructure. Only 29 percent said they wanted Republicans in Congress to \u2018continue working on a new healthcare bill.'"  FRIDAY NEWS DUMP, 385 EDITION: The business community got some good news from the Treasury Department about those controversial Section 385 rules on Friday afternoon, Aaron also notes. No, it\u2019s not a full delay in the implementation of the rules, which would reclassify some debt as equity in an effort to put a crimp in earnings stripping. But businesses do get another year, until 2019, before they have to meet paperwork requirements on internal loans.  REQUIEM FOR A BAT: Safe to say that the border adjustment will be taking up less and less space here in the days to come, but Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution takes one last stab at how Ryan and Brady came up with a \u201cgenuinely good idea.\u201d For starters, Looney argues that former House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp\u2019s plan showed that a 1986-style \u201clower the rates, broaden the base\u201d approach wouldn\u2019t cut it when it comes to job growth or keeping U.S. companies from seeking new homes abroad. \u201cTaxing companies based on where their goods are consumed frees policymakers to retain or expand tax breaks for domestic investment, as in Chairman Brady\u2019s plan, and the rate can be set to bring in the revenues the federal government needs,\u201d Looney writes, adding: \u201cUnder a BAT, the U.S. would become an extremely desirable place to locate businesses and investment, and would reverse the shift of businesses abroad.\u201d  Meanwhile: Businesses in Arizona, whose GOP lawmakers were among the most strident critics of the border adjustment, are celebrating its death, the Arizona Republic reports.  GETTING PERSONAL: Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is calling the state legislature into special session to consider a $3 billion package of incentives for Foxconn, the Taiwan-based manufacturer known for its work on Apple\u2019s iPhones. Republicans control both the governor\u2019s mansion and the legislature in Wisconsin, though The Associated Press notes there is some Democratic opposition to what would be the largest incentive package in state history.  As to that opposition, Walker took critics to task \u2014 but in a sort of Wisconsin Nice way. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of people out there scrambling to try and come up with a reason not to like this. I can tell you, that\u2019s fine but I think they can go suck lemons,\u201d Walker said Friday.  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE  WE\u2019RE ON IT: Austria gets the European Council presidency for the last half of 2018, and Vienna is already hinting that it wants to make battling offshore tax gaming a core priority, Reuters reports. Hans Joerg Schelling, Austria\u2019s finance minister, has already come up with a strategy for cracking down on tax avoidance, his ministry said. "Tackling tax evasion more effectively will require European and international solutions. The European Union must finally come up with a joint strategy," Schelling said after meeting with Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, over the weekend.  STATE NEWS  ALL DRY: Hurricane Sandy might have been almost five years ago, but the storm is still having quite the impact on the property tax base of a lot of Jersey Shore communities, The New York Times reports.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo   R.I.P., B.A.T.: And with that, the most controversial topic in the tax reform debate was swept aside.   Story Continued Below  That\u2019s of course the border adjustment, which the so-called Big Six of top lawmakers and administration bigwigs officially took out of the tax reform mix with their new statement on Thursday.   The glass half-full take on that: Taking away the central point of contention in tax reform, one that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) had been clinging to pretty tightly, gives the process a jolt and policymakers the opportunity to unite behind the shared goals outlined in the new statement. (It might also allow Republicans to find a smoother path forward on tax reform than they ever have on the Obamacare replacement debate \u2014 though stay tuned on that.)   The glass mostly-empty take, from our Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo: It\u2019s almost August, the window for actual legislating is getting smaller and smaller, and the central players in the tax reform debate just released something that was somehow less detailed than the much criticized one-pager from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in April. \u201cTax overhauls live and die on details \u2014 and their absence, after months of weekly meetings aimed at achieving consensus, showed that the GOP's dream of achieving tax reform may be years from completion,\u201d Nancy and Aaron report. Also of note: Tax writers themselves now have to basically play the game perfectly from here with all the details left to be filled in: \u201cThat makes the conversation more difficult because we all now \u2014 50 out of 52 of us \u2014 have to agree on some number for short-term deficits,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.)   So what\u2019s next? You can expect that Senate Finance and House Ways and Means staffers will have a busy August starting to craft tax reform measures. And this likely wasn\u2019t the last hurrah either for the Big Six \u2014 Ryan, Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council. But now, the six principals will be more like a central command system, as described by one person with knowledge of the next steps \u2014 still meeting regularly to make sure that the House, Senate and White House are moving in the right direction and in sync with one another.   Reading between the lines: It\u2019s fair to say the Big Six worded their statement fairly carefully, leading tax analysts to try and translate the intentions going forward. For instance: The statement calls permanent tax changes a priority, instead of a must \u2014 something that led some downtown observers to suggest that the Big Six was leaving itself some wiggle room in case Republicans are unable to craft something that isn't deficit-neutral, thus making it incompatible with Senate budget reconciliation rules. (To be fair, this wasn\u2019t a unanimous view.) There\u2019s definitely some fear among deficit hawks that Republicans will take the easier path of just cutting taxes in the end, but a couple of potential problems with that approach, via Ed Lorenzen of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: the current House budget resolution and Senate pay-as-you-go rules.   Off the sidelines: Here\u2019s another potential positive point for tax reform following the new statement \u2014 the Business Roundtable is about to embark on a multi-million dollar national television and radio campaign in favor of tax reform, Nancy also reports. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the momentum created by the \u2018Big 6\u2019 and the unity going forward and taking advantage of the members being at home to hear about tax reform over the recess,\u201d said a BRT spokesperson. Why that\u2019s important: Trump\u2019s already supposed to hit the stump for tax reform next month. And before now, big national business groups like the Roundtable were largely sidelined in the tax reform debate, at least in part because the border adjustment divided their membership \u2014 suggesting the new statement will perhaps be bringing even more of those forces into the game.  About that budget: Remember how House Freedom Caucus members wanted the House budget to make a call on the border adjustment? That\u2019s not necessary any more, and yet Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, says the votes for the House budget still aren\u2019t there, The Hill\u2019s Niv Elis reports.   MERCIFULLY, Friday has arrived.

THAT HEALTH CARE PROCESS: Sorry tax nerds, but it doesn't seem that the Big Six statement will be making the front pages. Early this morning, a trio of GOP senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 brought down the so-called skinny Obamacare repeal that Republican leaders were pushing, which included a repeal of the medical device tax. (So what's it mean for tax reform? Give it a few more hours.)  It's not as important now, but the Senate also passed an amendment to permanently repeal the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on expensive employer-provided health insurance. The amendment, from Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), passed mostly on a party-line vote \u2014 largely because Democrats didn\u2019t want to back a vote aimed at undercutting Obamacare, as the Health team\u2019s Paul Demko reports. In fact, the Cadillac tax, now scheduled to go into effect in 2020, is so unpopular in both parties that it isn\u2019t expected to be implemented.   BACK FOR MORE TAX RETURNS: Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, the House Democrat who\u2019s perhaps been the most steadfast in going after Trump\u2019s tax returns, is back with yet another approach \u2014 a resolution of inquiry seeking the president\u2019s tax returns from 2006 to 2016, as well as the returns of 515 of Trump\u2019s business entities. The hook this time: tax reform. \u201cWe know that the tangled web of the President\u2019s potential conflicts cannot be understood without a full picture of his business empire,\u201d Pascrell said in a statement, adding that lawmakers have to \u201cexamine Mr. Trump\u2019s network of businesses, and to understand the deductions and loopholes the President uses\u201d and to \u201censure that White House policy-making is not being done in service to the President\u2019s personal financial advantage.\u201d   It perhaps goes without saying, but this would seem to be the sort of measure that Democrats could use to make some noise at a tax reform markup.   WHAT DO YOU GET FOR THOSE TAX BREAKS? The Taiwanese company Foxconn, known for its role in assembling Apple\u2019s iPhones, has agreed to build a 20 million square foot factory in Wisconsin \u2014 as Trump, Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker and others all announced at the White House on Wednesday. In exchange, the company could get in the neighborhood of $3 billion in tax breaks from Wisconsin, as The Washington Post\u2019s Danielle Paquette explains. \u201cAs long as Foxconn keeps hiring U.S. workers at the new flat-screen manufacturing facility, Wisconsin would cut the company $200 million to $250 million a year for up to 15 years. That works out to a rough cost to the state of about $230,700 per worker, assuming the factory goes on to generate 13,000 jobs.\u201d   Walker himself told a Wisconsin radio station that the state was basically paying the going rate for job creation. \u201cWhat we\u2019re proposing is not outrageous,\u201d he said, via Reuters. Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, Wisconsin\u2019s next-door neighbor, wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cYou have to ask what price is Wisconsin paying to get them to come there?" Snyder, a fellow Republican, said in a radio interview of his own. "I don\u2019t believe in buying companies into our states."   INTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014   WELCOME BACK, MARGRETHE VESTAGER: The European Commission has told France and Belgium to get rid of the tax breaks they offer for ports, saying that offers the two countries an unfair advantage over the other 26 European Union members, the Associated Press reports. Margrethe Vestager, the European antitrust czar, gave the countries until next year to revamp their systems for taxing ports, saying the current arrangements \u201cdistort the level playing field and fair competition.\u201d The E.C. gave a similar directive to the Netherlands last year.   STATE NEWS \u2014   NOT CHANGING NOW: Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, just nominated to a Trump administration position on religious freedom, has but one regret about the signature tax cuts that will be a big part of his legacy \u2014 that some of them were rolled back, the AP reports. In fact, the governor said that the legislature\u2019s decision to scrap a provision that zeroed out taxes on pass-through businesses was one of the biggest regrets of his six-and-a-half years in office, and blamed problems in the agriculture and energy sectors for the state\u2019s recent budget troubles. "We've opened up a new policy frontier," Brownback said. "I don't think that's going away in the country because the growth of small business is so critical."   MORE AND MORE TAXES: The Pennsylvania Senate went beyond raising taxes on natural gas drilling and utilities in its measure to close a $2.2 billion budget gap, the AP reports. \u201cGOP senators hope to raise another $43.5 million by requiring online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay to collect sales tax from third-party sellers using their sites. The Senate plan also counts on $200 million in revenue from another massive expansion of casino-style gambling in Pennsylvania, the nation's No.2 commercial gambling state, but it hasn't been approved and is still the subject of a disagreement with the House.\u201d (At first blush, that online sales tax proposal would seem to run afoul of the Supreme Court precedent that only allows states to collect from in-state retailers.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/27/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Colin Wilhelm   SOMETHING IS COMING: It was quite the buzzy Wednesday in D.C. tax circles, with all that discussion about Republicans having a further tax reform release before the week ran out.   Story Continued Below  So what do we know now? There\u2019s definitely something expected this week \u2014 so keep your eyes open today. The so-called Big Six of administration officials and top congressional types didn\u2019t offer up much after their latest meeting on Wednesday evening. What we don\u2019t really know is how much further substance Republicans will actually release, as they try to use August to gin up more momentum for tax reform. (In other words, how much will this be largely a messaging exercise?)   What else do we know? GOP tax writers in both the House and the Senate weren\u2019t getting any substantive updates out of the Big Six on Wednesday. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) handed out pocket calendars with suggested tax reform messaging, mostly bashing the current system as too complicated and weighing down the economy. Rank-and-file Republicans also got a pocket card that outlines some basic areas of agreement within the party \u2014 killing the estate tax, for instance, while lowering tax rates and installing fewer tax brackets. (Left unmentioned: The controversial border adjustment in the House GOP blueprint. More on that in a bit.) So long story short: Brady wants to make sure that tax reform doesn\u2019t get lost in the messaging shuffle when members are back home next month.   On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Finance Republicans had a long meeting of their own Wednesday, with presentations on the various issue areas assigned to tax writers by Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). The meeting allowed Hatch \u201cto continue to seek input on how members want to move forward on comprehensive tax reform,\u201d a Finance spokeswoman said. \u201cThey discussed process and policy options, as members continue their efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s broken tax code.\u201d   Also, there\u2019s a long way to go: And no matter what happens the rest of this week, Republicans still have a lot of tough questions to work their way through for tax reform to be successful. Case in point: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Shahira Knight, the former Ways and Means staffer who\u2019s now the White House\u2019s most senior person on taxes, have been sparring over any number of tax proposals, Nancy Cook reports. Those disagreements have largely been over how to offset the sort of rate cuts the administration was after \u2014 Knight, for instance, is more into getting rid of the deduction for business interest than Mnuchin. But Knight also had to convince Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, to back a territorial system over a pure worldwide system, Nancy notes. Oh, and this, too: Knight said in a recent meeting that attendees \u201cdid not need to spend much time talking about the border adjustment tax, leaving the impression that it was no longer on the table from the administration\u2019s perspective.\u201d   Other signs: White House officials are already considering a Plan B that would be a more straightforward tax cut in the event there\u2019s no agreement on full-scale reform, The Washington Post\u2019s Damian Paletta reports. The three main planks that are being pushed by outside advisers Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore \u2014 cutting the corporate rate to 15 percent, doubling the standard deduction and lowering the tax rate for offshore corporate profits, all for 10 years. (One question there: Top House GOP staffers have said that even a corporate rate cut that lasts three years would add to the deficit in the out years, running afoul of Senate budget reconciliation rules.)   And there\u2019s this, from The Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim: \u201cTop White House adviser Steve Bannon is pushing for tax reform to include a new 44 percent top marginal tax rate, hitting people who earn more than $5 million a year, with the revenue paying for tax cuts for the rest, according to three people who\u2019ve spoken to him recently.\u201d   GET EXCITED FOR ANOTHER EDITION of Morning Tax, everybody.

HEALTH CARE INTERLUDE: The so-called \u201cskinny\u201d Obamacare repeal, which would roll back the medical device tax, among other things, doesn\u2019t have the votes yet, Burgess Everett, Jennifer Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim report.   HEY, DEMS \u2026 STOP FIDDLING AROUND THE EDGES: That\u2019s at least one takeaway that progressive tax analysts have about the current Democratic approach to taxes \u2014 especially after party leaders stopped barely short of avoiding the topic altogether in their new \u201cBetter Deal\u201d agenda. In short, some on the left believe that Democrats need to worry less about tax rates and loopholes and more about how capital is taxed if they really want to battle income inequality, The Washington Post\u2019s Max Ehrenfreund reports. Not only that: Many Democrats want expanded government programs for paid family leave and tuition assistance, among other things, but aren\u2019t willing to increase middle-class taxes to pay for it. \u201cThe only remaining option is to increase taxes on the rich, but without innovative capital taxes, their proposals will not really get at that money,\u201d according to David Kamin, a former economic adviser to former President Barack Obama, as paraphrased by Ehrenfreund. (A reminder that this was an issue with Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, when he relied on tax increases on more than just the wealthy to pay for universal health care and other programs.)   LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY: Republicans haven\u2019t had much problem knocking the Congressional Budget Office for their recent health care projections. But here was the step too far, as the Budget team\u2019s Jennifer Scholtes reports: A large chunk of House Republicans teamed with Democrats to turn aside a pair of amendments to cut CBO\u2019s funding, including a proposal to scrap its Budget Analysis Division, that were favored by conservatives. \u201cThis amendment is not the best way to accomplish our goal of obtaining better information and analysis from the CBO,\u201d said House Budget Chairwoman Diane Black (R-Tenn.)   The vote came after a range of outside groups called on the House to vote the amendments down, as did Brady and Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means panel.   THE ADMINISTRATION AND ONLINE SALES TAX: Maybe it\u2019s just us, but Morning Tax isn\u2019t really used to Treasury secretaries weighing in on online sales tax matters. But that\u2019s exactly what Steven Mnuchin did on Wednesday, as Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports \u2014 telling a Senate hearing that \u201cthis is an issue that we've been looking at very carefully within the administration, and we expect to come out with a position shortly.\u201d The Treasury secretary also included some questions about the tax policies employed by Amazon, which has been known to be on the wrong end of some of President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets \u2014 most notably why the online sales giant charges taxes on items it sells directly to consumers, but not on items from third-party sellers on its marketplace.   Mnuchin has discussed the online sales tax issue with retailers, though only on the most surface of levels, according to someone with knowledge of those conversations. Trump himself has also seemed to suggest that he backs the idea of giving states more power to force out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes, the idea backed by retailers and Amazon.   Oh, so you\u2019re the one: One of the arguments that supporters of online sales tax legislation often rely on is that consumers almost never pay the use tax that they\u2019re frequently supposed to if they\u2019re not charged sales tax. But Mnuchin says he\u2019s not that kind of guy. \u201cI may be one of the few people in the world who actually file a use tax,\u201d he said.   More Mnuchin: A simpler tax code, coupled with improved technology, will help assuage concerns about the IRS\u2019s ability to offer quality taxpayer services, Mnuchin said, also via Aaron.

John McDonnell, the likely Finance minister if Corbyn is prime minister, met with finance executives at London\u2019s stock exchange to get feedback on Labour\u2019s proposals. London\u2019s financial set had largely ignored Corbyn until recent months, but are now more interested in \u201cLabour's proposals to expand an existing tax on shares to include trading on other assets such as bonds and derivatives. Labour says the tax \u2014 proposed to be around half of a percentage point or less on the value of a trade \u2014 could earn 4.7 billion pounds a year.\u201d   STATE NEWS \u2014   ON YOU, DRILLERS: Pennsylvania\u2019s GOP Senate is considering a tax on natural gas drilling to help get the state\u2019s books in order, as well as new taxes on gas, electric and phone services, Philly.com reports.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm   DUCKS FINDING THEIR ROWS: Tax reform might not be taking center stage yet, but know this: Republicans on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are already trying to figure out the best way to sell a tax overhaul to voters.   Story Continued Below  Cases in point: More than two dozen people from a range of grassroots conservative groups sat down with White House communications and political staffers on Tuesday to try to get on the same page on tax reform messaging, while House Republicans are gearing up to sell the idea back in their home districts next month.   The administration meeting was in part an acknowledgment that Republicans didn\u2019t cover themselves in glory on the public relations front when it came to repealing Obamacare, according to one attendee \u2014 no matter what the final outcome is on health care. \u201cThe general pitch of this meeting was to see how conservatives can make sure that the grassroots are energized on this and to make sure everyone is rowing in the same direction,\u201d the attendee said. (Among the groups involved: Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, Freedom Partners, FreedomWorks, the Heritage Foundation, the National Taxpayers Union and the R Street Institute.)   Conservatives are hoping that crafting a pitch for taxes will be easier than on health care, given that it\u2019s a bread-and-butter GOP issue. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting, attendees discussed a message that emphasized how tax reform could deliver lower taxes and a simpler system to voters in the middle parts of the income scale, with less of a focus on the wealthy.   The president\u2019s on message here! As it would happen, President Donald Trump sold his tax plan in just that sort of fashion in a Tuesday interview with The Wall Street Journal, while still pushing to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15 percent. \u201cThe people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country, who have gotten screwed,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s upward revision it\u2019s going to be on high-income people.\u201d   Trump is also expected to hit the road next month to pitch tax reform \u2014 which, it should be noted, will come before administration and congressional negotiators are done with crafting an actual framework. It should also be noted that outside analysts have said that Trump\u2019s tax proposals would most help the wealthy, and that the math for doing all that the president wants without adding to the deficit would be challenging. (Those around Trump have started talking about how the rate for businesses will likely have to creep higher.)   As for the House: GOP leaders told the rank-and-file at a conference meeting Tuesday morning that they\u2019d be \u201creleasing plenty more about the party\u2019s tax plans in August,\u201d as our Budget team put it. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) has stressed recently that GOP lawmakers need to make a hard sell on tax reform when their home in August, but told Pro Tax that there\u2019s more discussions to come on that front and no decisions have been made about giving colleagues explicit instructions on how to pitch tax reform. Still, Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chairman of the Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee, said there\u2019s no reason to overthink it. Republican lawmakers should tell voters back home to count on tax reform happening to set clear expectations, and count on it themselves too, Roskam said. \u201cCome back after Labor Day and be ready,\u201d he said.   The work going on: The Big Six hashing out a tax plan are scheduled to meet today, Brady said earlier this week, while the chairman will also be stopping by a meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee to discuss tax reform. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with agriculture groups on Tuesday, The Hill\u2019s Naomi Jagoda reported.

FEELING PRETTY GOOD: It\u2019s still far from certain where the GOP\u2019s effort to roll back Obamacare goes next, but it certainly seems that a so-called \u201cskinny\u201d repeal that scraps the medical device tax is on the table. And that\u2019s just part of the reason that industry believes that the end is near for a tax they\u2019ve railed against for well over half a decade. \u201cI feel confident it will come off the books at some point this year,\u201d Scott Whitaker, the chief executive for the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), told Morning Tax on Tuesday.   Whitaker didn\u2019t want to predict how Congress would repeal the tax, but said there were at least three other potential vehicles outside of rolling back Obamacare \u2014 reauthorizations for both FDA user fees and the children\u2019s health insurance program, as well as possible big spending or tax packages. He added that AdvaMed doesn\u2019t expect any Democrats from states with big device industries, like Massachusetts and Minnesota, to back repealing the tax within a measure undercutting Obamacare. But Whitaker insisted that \u201cwe haven\u2019t found any of them who\u2019ve said they would get in the way of getting this done\u201d in another vehicle.   HELLO, FLOOR: Rep. Morgan Griffith\u2019s amendment to end the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s Budget Analysis Division will get a vote on the House floor after it cleared the Rules Committee, our Colin Wilhelm reports. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a Rules member, said the measure \u2014 which would cut 89 jobs and save around $15 million \u2014 deserved a full hearing on the floor, even as he said he\u2019d oppose it. \u201cI just don\u2019t think, in my view, it\u2019s wise policy, but that\u2019s what you have debates for,\u201d Cole told POLITICO. House Freedom Caucus leaders have also backed the amendment from Griffith, who said in a release this week that CBO too frequently miss the mark on fiscal projections to be trusted.   Donald Marron, an Urban Institute fellow and former acting CBO director, has also expanded on his argument for why this is a bad idea.   FIRST LOOK: Art Laffer, the father of supply-side economics who already called the House GOP\u2019s proposed border adjustment pretty dumb this year, is out with a new paper arguing that the provision would hurt the insurance and reinsurance industries. The Republican blueprint, Laffer writes, \u201ccould amount to considerable economic harm for both insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as consumers and the global economy at large.\u201d   \u201cFirst, the economic effects of denying tax deductions for only importing companies could be disastrous \u2014 as other countries responded with their own trade protectionist measures, we would soon find a market with much less choice. Second, the complicated and numerous transactions flows present in an insurance or reinsurance contract cannot be easily defined as an import or export, and any and all corporate tax reform proposals must take this fact into consideration,\u201d Laffer added.   LET\u2019S GET LEGISLATING: Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), chairman of the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said Tuesday that he wants bipartisan legislation to overhaul the IRS in place by next year\u2019s filing deadline, Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports. Such a revamp would also help the agency\u2019s shoddy records-keeping procedures, the topic of a Tuesday hearing, Buchanan added. "We want to try to be helpful, in terms of the agency being more productive and effective long term,\u201d he said. One potential issue there: Brady likes to talk about how the House tax reform blueprint, not exactly bipartisan, seeks to \u201cbust up\u201d the IRS.   In better news for the IRS: The agency has overseen a pretty steep drop in the number of identity theft cases after teaming up with tax preparers on the issue, the Associated Press\u2019 Stephen Ohlemacher reports. John Koskinen, the IRS chief, said there had been around 107,000 identity theft victims through May of this year, compared to almost 700,000 for 2015 and 377,000 last year. Koskinen chalked the decrease up in part to more robust security of taxpayer data.   INTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014   IT WENT TO 11: Tanzania just escalated its quarrel with Acacia, a mining company that gets all of its gold from the African country \u2014 to the tune of $190 billion, Bloomberg reports. The Tanzanian government says that\u2019s the bill for 17 years worth of underreported revenues ($40 billion in taxes and $150 billion in interest and penalties.) The company denies that any underreporting has gone on. And as Bloomberg notes, the bill it just got from Tanzania would amount to \u201calmost two centuries worth of the gold producer\u2019s revenue.\u201d   STATE NEWS \u2014   SO ABOUT THAT BILL: It doesn\u2019t look like Congress will be finding common ground on online sales tax issues anytime soon, if a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing from Tuesday is any indicator. The Judiciary panel was examining a measure from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), and supported by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), that bars states from collecting sales tax from out-of-state retailers and from making other regulatory actions on other states.   Opponents of the measure, including groups like the National Conference of State Legislatures that want to give states more latitude to collect sales tax revenue, said the bill was far too broad. But proponents, including Goodlatte, said the one size fits all nature of the measure was the right approach to limiting states from interfering with one another. Another point to remember: Republicans remain divided on the issue, with Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) saying he couldn\u2019t support the measure, as The Hill\u2019s Ali Breland reported.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm   SLOWEST. PIVOT. EVER.: Today\u2019s Senate vote on health care \u2014 which looked likely to fail for much of Monday \u2014 now seems to be in much better shape.   Story Continued Below  That sets up the possibility that congressional negotiations over replacing Obamacare could get even more protracted, continuing to keep tax reform in the on-deck circle. But for now at least, the top officials working on taxes say they still expect the issue to get Washington\u2019s full attention come fall. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters Monday that the so-called Big Six from the House, Senate, and Trump administration will huddle again on Wednesday for their latest tax meeting.   Another issue to watch out for: Senate Republicans are still looking for ways to wiggle around the parliamentarian\u2019s guidance that several provisions run afoul of budget reconciliation rules, including a proposal to not allow tax credits to help buy plans that cover abortions. \u201cConservatives are also hoping the GOP can repair their abortion restrictions for plans on insurance exchanges by funneling those tax credits through other programs, like Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Those are already barred from using taxpayer funds to cover abortion with some exceptions,\u201d Burgess Everett, Seung Min Kim and Jennifer Haberkorn report. Brady said Monday that the current abortion restrictions were very important to House Republicans, but stopped short of calling them a dealbreaker.   FAR FROM DONE WITH CBO: Conservatives are seeking to take some more whacks at the Congressional Budget Office in spending legislation the House is set to vote on this week, our Colin Wilhelm reports. And this time, the whacks could be more than just rhetorical. (Recall that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been particularly critical of how CBO\u2019s projections about proposed GOP Obamacare replacements.)   Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) has proposed an amendment to scrap CBO\u2019s Budget Analysis Division, tossing aside 89 employees and $15 million in government salaries. Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), in another amendment backed by House Freedom Caucus leaders, would force CBO to incorporate budget projections from four outside groups \u2014 the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, the Heritage Foundation and the Urban Institute.   Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said Monday evening that only the Griffith proposal has a chance to get a floor vote this week. For what it\u2019s worth, Perry\u2019s amendment worried some outside budget wonks who believe it\u2019d be a mistake to replace CBO\u2019s work with outside aggregations. \u201cCBO's budget folks help Congress in myriad ways that think tanks can't replicate,\u201d tweeted Donald Marron, an Urban Institute fellow and former CBO acting director.   THANKS FOR JOINING US for another edition of Morning Tax.

Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @colinwilhelm, @AaronELorenzo, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.  THE WOOLLY WORLD OF ONLINE SALES TAX: A House Judiciary subcommittee is holding a hearing today on a measure that would essentially codify the current Supreme Court precedent that only allows states to collect sales tax on online purchases from companies that have a physical location in that state. It\u2019s not the first time that Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) has offered a bill to officially put the so-called Quill precedent into law. But it is the first time that House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) has signed on to the bill, which adds a little extra verve to this morning\u2019s proceedings. (Adding a little more oomph: Goodlatte released his own set of online principles not even a year ago.)   The battle lines for the hearing have already been drawn. Groups like the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the Marketplace Fairness Coalition both have statements blasting the legislation, with an extra eye roll for Goodlatte. (RILA noted that retailers, who want states to have more latitude to collect sales taxes on online purchases, have \u201cworked in good faith with Goodlatte. The Marketplace Fairness Coalition, meanwhile, maintains that Goodlatte\u2019s committee has been \u201cunable to fulfill\u201d its role on online sales tax issues.) On the other side of the issue, Steve DelBianco of NetChoice said the legislation is necessary to combat states finding increasingly novel ways to capture online sales tax revenue \u2014 like Massachusetts, which recently floated the idea that cookies on a mobile phone constituted enough of a physical location. (One last note: Retailers are hoping to the Supreme Court will reconsider the Quill precedent in the not-too-distant future.)   SACRED COW INDEED: The mortgage interest deduction is widely seen as one of the most entrenched tax breaks in the entire U.S. code. But there\u2019s long been one group that hasn\u2019t been a huge fan \u2014 academics, many of whom believe that the deduction subsidizes the buying of larger homes but doesn\u2019t do much to actually spur home ownership. The most recent installment of that genre: Three professors, using evidence from 1980s Denmark, found \u201cno effect of the tax policy change on whether households own or rent,\u201d as The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin reported. One of those professors, Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 who you might have heard of because of Obamacare \u2014 further suggested in an interview with the WSJ that a first-time homebuyer credit or a deduction capped at an area\u2019s median house price would be a better way to go. Industry groups said a study based on decades-old data from Denmark wouldn\u2019t offer much insight to America\u2019s mortgage interest break.   GIVE IT UP FOR THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS: One of the problems in tracking the offshore flow of corporate money has been distinguishing between the final destinations and the stop-offs along the way. And now, Quartz\u2019s Tim Fernholz reports that computer scientists have found a better way to track the journey. \u201cUsing a global dataset that tracks the relationships between more than 98 million companies, the researchers used algorithms to build a network that identified the relationships between corporate subsidiaries, tracing the flow of tax-free money from country to country through these corporate chains.\u201d   The findings: Some of the top final destinations are usual suspects like the British Virgin Islands, the Caymans and Bermuda. More surprisingly, Taiwan is a pretty popular last stop, while Panama \u2014 for all the controversy engendered by the Panama Papers \u2014 really isn\u2019t. But Panama is a good conduit to those final destinations, along with Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland and others.   PRAISING THE NMTC: Rural America benefits greatly from a tax credit meant to spur economic development in such areas as well as urban cores, according to a group supportive of the incentive. Financing through the New Markets Tax Credit has led to $11.6 billion in total private investment in economically distressed towns and farming communities, said a study from the New Markets Tax Credit Coalition. Those investments created 49,940 full-time jobs and 21,706 construction jobs, the study found. The credit was established in 2000 in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act, and supporters have been pushing to ensure it survives in tax reform. It is currently available through 2019.  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014   WHY CAN\u2019T THIS BE CIVIL? The French government is hoping that Google will sit down and negotiate a deal on back taxes, after a French court decided that the tech titan didn\u2019t owe Paris more than 1 billion euros. French officials had said they would appeal that decision, but Reuters reports that Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin is now saying that a long legal process wouldn\u2019t help either side.   THE VERDICT, THREE WEEKS IN: People are still confused by India\u2019s Goods and Services Tax that kicked off at the start of the month, Bloomberg reports. \u201cTraders, particularly in small towns, are struggling with their lack of knowledge of the new tax regime \u2014 compliance obligations, raising invoices and accessing input credits, said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders. Small merchants and e-commerce companies are tripping over a dizzying array of documents and the complicated classification system that determines what percentage of tax will be charged. Thousands of small merchants have stopped selling on e-commerce sites because they can\u2019t meet these new requirements.\u201d   STATE NEWS \u2014   SEE YOU AT THE BALLOT BOX: Texas moved one step closer to force local governments to get voter approval if property taxes rise, the Texas Tribune reported. The Texas Senate passed a measure on Monday that would allow voters in larger cities to weigh in if property taxes grow by more than 4 percent a year on existing property, while smaller entities would get to go to the polls after an 8 percent increase.

aV \u000a            By BERNIE BECKER  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Aaron Lorenzo  NOT QUITE PIVOT TIME YET: Health care will remain the dominant topic in Washington this week, as it has for months now. But fall \u2014 when GOP leaders say they want to move on tax reform \u2014 will be here before you know it, so here\u2019s some things to watch out for on taxes in what is scheduled to be the last full week that both chambers are in Washington until September.  Story Continued Below  A big one: Can the House pass a budget? That\u2019s the vehicle for tax reform, which Republicans plan to pass through budget reconciliation. But as of now, the math for GOP vote counters looks difficult, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) hasn\u2019t put the budget on this week\u2019s floor schedule as of yet.  Meanwhile, Republicans are continuing to hash out the actual policies they want on tax reform. The House GOP\u2019s controversial border adjustment doesn\u2019t seem to have much life left, but Koch Industries \u2014 one of that provision\u2019s most vocal opponents \u2014 still wants the House to use its budget to finish off the job, Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports. (Whatever you say about the battle against the BAT, it hasn\u2019t been cheap: Bloomberg reported that the National Retail Federation spent close to $5 million on lobbying in 2017\u2019s second quarter, or almost three times as much as it did in those three months the previous year.)  In any event, Republicans remain at least outwardly confident on tax reform. House Budget Chairwoman Diane Black (R-Tenn.), who\u2019s also a Ways and Means member, told Bloomberg Television last week that the GOP was 85 percent on the same page on taxes, per our Budget team. (Black\u2019s giving the GOP even more of a nudge in the right direction than Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady \u2014 who usually say Republicans are in 80 percent agreement \u2014 usually do.)  Also to watch out for: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, for those seeking any more clues on tax reform\u2019s path. (Also on the docket for that hearing: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, whose agency\u2019s records retention policies will be under the microscope at the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee on Tuesday.)  Who else wants to pivot? Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Job Creators Network and the American Legislative Exchange Council want the focus to shift from health care to taxes, stat \u2014 and they\u2019re more focused on tax cuts than reform, The Hill reports.  And so what about health care? Speaking of math, the Senate GOP\u2019s efforts on Obamacare repeal appear to be facing their own problems, with a key vote expected on Tuesday, Jennifer Haberkorn and Seung Min Kim report. There\u2019s still a lot of questions about what actual policy the Senate would consider if it votes to continue working on the bill on Tuesday. But there is this: Many GOP senators \u201care more than ready to turn to other priorities, like tax reform.\u201d  One last thing: The Senate parliamentarian released guidance on Friday that said that Republicans efforts to place \u201cantiabortion limits around tax credits that people could use to buy health insurance\u201d likely violate Senate rules, The Wall Street Journal reported.   IT\u2019S TIME FOR ANOTHER WEEK of Morning Tax, where your author is back and ready to wish a happy birthday to Lady Tax, also known as the mother of Toddler Tax. It\u2019s also been 106 years since the Yale lecturer Hiram Bingham III found the famous Inca site of Macchu Picchu in Peru, though plenty of people will tell you it was never really lost. (Bingham might also have been an inspiration for Indiana Jones.)  We\u2019re ready for another busy week, so send us all your tips and feedback.

Don\u2019t tell medical device makers that Obamacare\u2019s tax on them will live to see another day, even if the Affordable Care Act is here to stay, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. \u201cBob Paulson and hundreds of other executives in the massive medical technology sector are planning business operations on the assumption that the device tax is dead,\u201d Jim Spencer wrote. \u201cThe current expectation,\u201d Paulson told the Star-Tribune, \u201cis that it is not coming back.\u201d  That might be misplaced optimism, but those comments also point to perhaps one of the overlooked reasons why a Republican failure on health care complicates their efforts on tax reform. Lots of people like to talk about how repealing Obamacare would also change the revenue baseline for tax reform. But falling short also means that there would likely be more taxes \u2014 on device makers, wealthy people\u2019s capital gains and even tanning salons \u2014 to sift through on tax reform, something that top Republicans have started to acknowledge.  INFRASTRUCTURE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EASIER: The New York Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush detailed how President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to revive American infrastructure have, at least so far, largely run aground. Among the takeaways for taxes: Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, believed that pairing tax reform and infrastructure was a winner, as did Trump. But Mnuchin has been telling people that\u2019s too big of a package to pass \u2014 perhaps in part because there\u2019s a fair bit of skepticism among GOP leaders about combining the two.  PRETTY SOON, TALKING ABOUT REAL MONEY: Sen. John Thune\u2019s proposal to put more structure around how the U.S. taxes the so-called \u201csharing economy\u201d \u2014 think Airbnb, Etsy and Uber \u2014 would add up to a decent offset in tax reform, Bloomberg reports. \u201cThis is easily a multibillion-dollar bill,\u201d Caroline Bruckner of American University\u2019s Kogod Tax Policy Center said about a measure that would, among other things, force companies to tell the IRS about far more vendors\u2019 income. Still, the revenue the bill raises would like only be able to finance a very small portion of the GOP\u2019s ambitions when it comes to cutting tax rates.  WHO\u2019S A WINNER? The liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy broke down the numbers on Trump\u2019s tax plan, and found it would generally help richer states more than poor states. The losers: Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina and West Virginia, two-thirds of which voted for Trump. (The biggest winners under the Trump plan, which include 11 states and Washington, D.C., split evenly between the president and Hillary Clinton.)  INTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014   STEP BY STEP: Ireland will be setting up a fund to manage the 13 billion euros (currently $15.2 billion) that it\u2019s due from Apple, following the European Commission\u2019s ruling almost a year ago that the tax advantages that Dublin offered the tech giant amounted to illegal state aid. Apple and Ireland will jointly appoint someone to look after that money, which will be held in escrow. But as Bloomberg notes, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the end of this story is near. Ireland was supposed to have gotten the back taxes from Apple by January, and both Dublin and the company have appealed the ruling \u2014 which could tie up the case for years more.  STATE NEWS \u2014   \u201cTRUMP EFFECT?\u201d It seems like wealthy people\u2019s efforts to push off paying taxes wherever they can, in order to wait for a tax cut from Trump, dragged down state government revenues, The Hill reports. \u201cTotal tax collections in April fell 4 percent over last year, according to a Rockefeller Institute of Government of 41 state governments. The analysis suggests wealthy taxpayers likely shifted taxable income they could have collected in 2016 to 2017, when they expect rates on capital gains will be lower after President Trump\u2019s tax reform push.\u201d  POT TAXES ARE HARD: Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before, but officials in a state where voters just approved a recreational pot measure are grappling with how to tax marijuana purchases. The case in point this time: Maine, one of four states that saw a ballot measure pass in November. The Associated Press notes that the leaders of a legislative committee tasked with filling in the details are suggesting the tax rate might creep higher as they try to hit the \u201csweet spot\u201d between maximizing revenue and driving consumers to the black market. (Recreational marijuana advocates say a rumored 20 percent rate would definitely push people toward the latter.)  LOCAL TAX NEWS ON THE HORIZON: A Cook County circuit judge is expected to announce on Friday his ruling on a lawsuit challenging the county\u2019s penny-per-ounce soda tax, The Chicago Tribune reports.

aV \u000a            By CATHERINE BOUDREAU  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from John Lauinger and Li Zhou  LOCAL FOOD AND RURAL AMERICA: The Federal Reserve is typically more likely to care about bank reserve ratios rather than fertilizer ratios. This week, however, monetary policy was not at the forefront of a book released by the Fed as well as a related forum in Washington. Instead, the Fed showcased how local and regional food systems can drive economic growth. There to deliver the keynote was Anne Hazlett, the newly appointed assistant to the secretary for rural development at the USDA. She said that supporting the growth of local and regional food supply chains could help address the top four challenges in remote areas of the country that she and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue are working on: quality of life, workforce development, innovation and economic development.  Story Continued Below  "Whether it's through direct-to-consumer sales, farm-to-school programs or locally grown food in a grocery store, when I think about regional food systems, I see a strong tie to each of these four issues," Hazlett said to a room of regional food distributors, local and state policymakers, farming organizations, university researchers, bankers and investors. For example, local and regional food systems produce new job opportunities. For every job that is created in a farm-to-school program, another 1.67 jobs are created in the local community, she said.  A book authored by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in partnership with the system's Board of Governors and the Agriculture Department, arrived at a time when policymakers are trying to tackle the economic challenges in rural America. (You could argue that the controversy over Perdue eliminating the USDA undersecretary for rural development post, and instead establishing Hazlett\u2019s position, is an extension of that.)  While local and regional food systems are expected to grow substantially in the next few years \u2014 sales are estimated to increase to more than $20 billion by 2019, according to the USDA data cited in the Fed's report \u2014 there are many obstacles to scaling production and distribution.

USDA RECOGNIZES FARMERS MARKET WEEK: Speaking of local food, the USDA has recognized local farmers and vendors for the last 17 years. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue kept the streak going, issuing a proclamation on Thursday designating Aug. 6-13 as National Farmers Market Week. Perdue highlighted that farmers markets and direct-marketing outlets contribute about $9 billion each year to the U.S. economy.   \u201cBuying directly from farmers and ag-entrepreneurs has an outsized impact by helping diversify farm incomes and supporting other businesses by keeping more money in the local economy. In addition to being good for the farmers and convenient for consumers, farmers markets are a gathering place that help build a sense of community,\u201d the department said.   PERDUE: FARM BILL SHOULD \u2018FOLLOW THE MARKET\u2019: Perdue on Thursday made his way around southeastern Wisconsin, the first stop of his \u201cBack to Our Roots\u201d R.V. tour across five states. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Perdue said his main goal for the next iteration of the 2018 farm bill was to ensure that it would not direct farmers\u2019 planting decisions: \u201cMy principle for the farm bill is it should follow the market, not guide the market. I don\u2019t want people farming for the farm bill,\u201d he said, hitting on a long-held criticism of some subsidy programs in the farm bill -- that they give producers incentives to plant certain crops instead of allowing market conditions to dictate.  Perdue also echoed previous comments on SNAP. Just as he supports a safety net for farmers, Perdue said he supports one for people who don\u2019t have enough to eat. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want it to become a lifestyle for people who become dependent on a government program,\u201d Perdue told the Journal Sentinel.   Today, Perdue is heading north. The secretary is taking the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity on the road, as well, hosting a listening session today at the Northcentral Technical College in Wausau, Wis., with local elected officials, broadband industry leaders, Wisconsin Farm Bureau members and students.  Take MA out to the ball game? Maybe some day. Tonight, Perdue and USDA staffers will take in a Twins game at Target Field in Minneapolis.   TRUMP TO DASH OIL REFINERS\u2019 DREAMS ON ETHANOL RULES: The Trump administration plans to reject a proposal that would let oil refiners off the hook for complying with the federal ethanol mandate, a senior administration official told Pro Energy\u2019s Eric Wolff, dashing the hopes of billionaire Carl Icahn and several independent companies. The EPA plans to formally announce the decision within the next two weeks, the official said.   The move is a severe blow for Icahn, a longtime associate and early supporter of Trump, who owns the refiner CVR Energy. Icahn, refining giant Valero and smaller refinery firms argued that purchasing compliance credits, called Renewable Identification Numbers, squeezed their bottom lines and, in some cases, threatened to put them out of business. Icahn's CVR lost $19 million in the second quarter of this year after guessing incorrectly that the administration would make the policy change.  Corn power. But Trump has turned away from one of Icahn's main policy goals, in large part because of pressure from corn state voters and ethanol organizations. Corn state residents and ethanol interests have been lobbying hard, arguing that the change would set back an ethanol industry that is vital to many communities that strongly backed Trump.  HOUSE DEMS CALL FOR TRANSPARENCY IN NAFTA TALKS: Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell and Debbie Dingell are asking for their colleagues\u2019 support in requesting that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative ramp up its engagement with Congress in the coming NAFTA negotiations, Pro Trade\u2019s Megan Cassella reports. Pascrell, ranking member on the House Ways and Means\u2019 Trade Subcommittee, and Dingell are circulating a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter, asking for signatures on a separate letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that calls for, among other things, access to negotiating texts for personal congressional staff of any member and not just those on the committees of jurisdiction; the public release of U.S. negotiating proposals; access to other documents that don\u2019t fall into the category of a U.S. proposals or the consolidated negotiating text; and the appointment of a chief transparency officer.  \u201cWith NAFTA negotiations beginning later this month, it is imperative that the Trump administration develop a process for sharing negotiating documents with Congress and the public,\u201d the two Democrats wrote. \u201cSuch a process is necessary to get Congressional and public support for any eventual agreement.\u201d  WELL, THAT WAS FAST: Hours before Al Almanza\u2019s four-decade career at FSIS drew to a close on Monday, he told Pro Ag\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich that \u201cit is a great thing to get to leave when people want you and want you to stay.\u201d People wanted him, all right. JBS SA announced Thursday that it hired the former FSIS administrator to be its global food czar, a newly created position. Almanza\u2019s title will be global head of food safety and quality assurance. He\u2019ll be based in Greeley, Colo., and be responsible for \u201censuring that JBS operations around the world implement the highest food safety, quality control and risk management systems,\u201d the company said in a release.  In many ways, Almanza\u2019s new job will be to use his experience and reputation to help JBS rebound from the food safety and corruption probes, which led to the company paying $3.2 billion in fines in a settlement this year. Pro Agriculture\u2019s John Lauinger has more on Almanza\u2019s new gig here.  Focus on the future: Now, the task falls to Perdue and the Trump administration to replace Almanza. \u201cWe have been at odds with Mr. Almanza with respect to many food safety policies and needed reforms,\u201d Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, told MA on Thursday. \u201cHe has been accessible and shown a willingness to hear our concerns, but I am hopeful that his successor, not to mention a new undersecretary for food safety, takes more aggressive action on behalf of consumers to improve the performance of the meat and poultry inspection system.\u201d   SENATE CONFIRMS 3 CFTC NOMINEES: In a rush to skip town for a four-week August recess, the Senate cleared a backlog of more than 60 nominees by voice vote on Thursday afternoon. Those confirmed included J. Christopher Giancarlo as CFTC chairman, and Brian Quintenz and Rostin Behnam as commissioners. The raft of approvals did not include CFTC commissioner nominee Dawn Stump, a former lobbyist for the derivatives industry who earned almost $400,000 in the last year working working for an industry association that has been critical of the agency's regulations. Giancarlo, a CFTC commissioner since 2014, had been serving as acting chairman. Quintenz is the founder of a hedge fund, and Behnam is a former aide to Sen. Debbie Stabenow, ranking member of the Agriculture Committee.  Greenlight for USAID Administrator. Also confirmed in the afternoon scramble was former Rep. Mark Green (R-Wis.) to be administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Green served in Congress from 1999 to 2007 and was U.S. ambassador to Tanzania from 2007 to 2009. Most recently, he was president of the International Republican Institute.  Senate Flyaway: As the Senate takes its August leave of The Swamp, POLITICO\u2019s Elana Schor and Seung Min Kim put together this recap of how Senate Republicans passed their final days before vacation \u2014 they \u201cdelivered an unstated declaration of independence from their own Republican president.\u201d Read that here.   HATCH CALLS DEMS CORPORATE CRACKDOWN \u2018PARANOIA\u2019: Sen. Orrin Hatch on Thursday slammed congressional Democrats\u2019 new economic agenda and its call to crack down on corporate monopolies. The Utah Republican said on the Senate floor that the plan \u201camounts to little more than pseudo-economic demagoguery and anti-corporate paranoia.\u201d Hatch acknowledged that advances in technology could prompt authorities to reframe antitrust policy, but argued that there did not need to be a new \u201cprogressive standard\u201d on the issue.  \u201cTruth be told, the real trouble for the progressive standard is that it fails to grab the bigger picture of our history, economy and national character,\u201d he said, arguing that regulators should continue to use the existing consumer welfare approach to evaluate mergers like the Amazon-Whole Foods deal.  Dems\u2019 plan to hit corporate power. The Democrats unveiled their economic platform last week, which is packaged under the slogan \u201cA Better Deal.\u201d An anti-monopoly platform is part of the agenda, including targeting the agriculture and food and beverage industries. The pending mergers among six agrochemical companies \u2014 Dow with DuPont, Monsanto with Bayer AG, and Syngenta with ChemChina \u2014 are singled out as examples of the trend of concentration of power. Democrats want to establish new antitrust standards to limit large mergers and require federal regulators to review closed transactions more frequently, as well as create a new \u201ccompetition advocate,\u201d whose mission it would be to handle consumer complaints and recommend investigations to the FTC and the DOJ.  CANTWELL: NEW TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO FIGHT FIRES: As forest fires this year have blazed through Western states like Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Montana, Utah, Arizona and Washington, senators are urging the Interior Department to use new technology to fight them and keep workers safe. During a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing Thursday, Rep. Maria Cantwell pressed Bryan Rice, an Interior Department official, on why the agency wasn't trying new systems, reports POLITICO\u2019s Luis Sanchez. The Washington state Democrat cited GPS tracking technology and unmanned drones as examples of new tools that could aid in the safety of firefighters during forest fires.  Rice, who directs the Interior Department\u2019s office of wildland fire, disputed Cantwell\u2019s assertion, and said staff in local areas were using such technology, and the department was examining ways to deploy it more broadly. Cantwell again impressed upon Rice that her state \u201cloves technology and it loves to keep pushing the envelope, so don't hold us back to getting solutions in the marketplace, this summer if we can."  MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 Intense drought in eastern Montana and North and South Dakota has forced ranchers to sell their cattle and farmers to harvest crops early, the AP reports.  \u2014 The FDA\u2019s decision to give food and beverage companies more time to adopt the new Nutrition Facts panel has led to inconsistency in the marketplace as some manufacturers press ahead anyway, The Wall Street Journal reports.  \u2014 Western Farm Press looks at Arizona to consider how the agricultural teacher shortage can negatively affect quality of instruction for students. That\u2019s here.   \u2014 Global food prices increased for the third straight month in July, powered mainly by higher cereal, sugar and dairy quotations, according to the U.N. agriculture agency.

aV \u000a            By CATHERINE BOUDREAU  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from John Lauinger, Megan Cassella and Annie Snider  FEDERAL RESERVE PROMOTES LOCAL FOOD: The Federal Reserve and USDA are unveiling a new report today to showcase how local and regional food systems can help the economies of rural and urban communities, as well as increase access to healthier food and create a more productive workforce. The report is intended to signal that local food is no longer just for \u201cfoodies,\u201d but instead is in high demand by consumers across the country and is ripe for investment and financing. Through a compilation of research, essays and case studies, the report highlights possibilities like: communities that used regional food strategies to meet economic goals; opportunities in the regional food system sector; systems that benefit low- and moderate-income households; and models of partnerships between policymakers, members of the community and the financial industry.   Story Continued Below  The report arrives at a critical time in light of the heightened attention to the condition of rural America, said Jen O'Brien Cheek, executive director of the Farmers Market Coalition. (A board member of the group contributed to the report).   \u201cWe want to bring in investors and institutions that offer loans and grants to make sure initiatives are supported, because it\u2019s been demonstrated that they have a lasting impact on economic prosperity,\u201d O\u2019Brien Cheek said. \u201cReally successful food systems respond to unique needs of a community.\u201d The report also lands just before the start of Farmers Market Week (Aug. 6-12).  The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the USDA Rural Development and Agricultural Marketing Service, is hosting a forum today to release the report, which explores \u201cunanswered research, policy and resources gaps,\u201d that need to be addressed. You can find the agenda for the forum here.  HAPPY THURSDAY, AUGUST 3! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host has an addiction to mango mochi ice cream (you really ought to try it, too).

FOR CLOVIS, WHAT\u2019S OLD IS NEW (AGAIN): Sam Clovis, the nominee for USDA chief scientist, already was in trouble with Democrats. Writings the former Iowa academic made in 2011 and 2012 on a now-defunct blog during his conservative radio talk show days were unearthed yesterday by CNN \u2014 via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. They reveal him calling progressives \u201cliars, race-traders and race-\u2018traitors\u2019\u201d and accusing labor unions of coming out of the \u201cCommunist closet\u201d to support \u201csocialist\u201d Barack Obama.   Clovis had already been facing opposition from Democrats and left-leaning advocacy and science groups. They assert that he does not possess the academic credentials legally required for the post of USDA undersecretary for research, education and economics. Critics have also attacked him for his climate skepticism. In addition, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts recently issued a warning \u2014 albeit without mentioning Clovis by name \u2014 that his past position on the federally subsidized crop insurance program being unconstitutional simply would not fly with the committee.  Those controversies aside, Clovis has the backing of some 23 agricultural groups that regard the Trump administration official \u2014 he is currently USDA\u2019s liaison to the White House \u2014 as someone who has Trump\u2019s ear because of his campaign roots.  That said, Clovis\u2019 statements on race, in particular, are dangerous ground, especially because of USDA\u2019s history on that issue and reputation among critics as \u201cthe last plantation.\u201d In an August 2011 post, for instance, Clovis urged Republicans to call out progressives, saying they \u201chave done everything possible to keep minorities in this country enslaved to government.\u201d He said that was \u201cparticularly true in the African-American community," accusing progressives of attacking "the individual, the black family unit, the female and the black male to essentially eliminate people of color from the American landscape.\u201d More on the contentious issue here.  McKinney in committee: The White House announced on Wednesday that the nomination of Ted McKinney, Indiana\u2019s director of agriculture, for the new post of USDA undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, had been sent to the Senate. He\u2019ll have company in waiting for a confirmation hearing: Clovis and Steve Censky, the nominee for deputy secretary, are also in a holding pattern.  MEXICO\u2019S NAFTA DREAMS AT ODDS WITH \u2018AMERICA FIRST\u2019: The first glimpse of Mexico\u2019s negotiating goals for NAFTA 2.0 revealed the U.S. may already be on a collision course with its southern neighbor ahead of the upcoming renegotiation, Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi reports. Mexico views the free trade deal as a cornerstone of its economy. It seeks a new version that would make the country an even bigger producer and exporter.   That goal, laid out in a statement of priorities submitted to the Mexican Senate and released this week, will likely not be well received by the Trump administration, which wants to revamp NAFTA in a way that reduces the U.S. trade deficit south of the border. Something\u2019s got to give.  More broadly, Mexico believes the new, NAFTA-promoted reality of an integrated North America must be accepted in order to have fruitful negotiations. \u201cAcross North America, thousands of workers, from those in the field to the engineers in charge of advanced manufacturing, depend in one form or another on the value chains that exist throughout the region,\u201d Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said in one of the documents, according to an unofficial translation. \u201cAccepting and understanding this reality is a fundamental step in properly evaluating NAFTA and identifying the areas in which we can work to strengthen the treaty.\u201d Pros, read the full story here.  Head south for Round 2: Guajardo said Mexico will host the second round of NAFTA talks sometime around Sept. 10, Reuters reports.  FALSE (CLIMATE) ALARM AT USDA? Some climate change information disappeared from the USDA website late last week before reappearing late yesterday, according to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative. A USDA spokesman said the \u201coutages were the result of the site being migrated to a new server.\u201d The missing pages were from USDA\u2019s regional \u201cClimate Hubs,\u201d which are meant to provide tools to help farmers and land managers adapt to climate change.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Clovis, Trump\u2019s pick to be chief scientist, have both questioned human-caused climate change. But Perdue has also said he\u2019s committed to \u201cdigging ever deeper\u201d into research about agricultural production in light of a changing climate. EDGI, which is archiving public environmental data and monitoring changes to federal regulations and research to hold the Trump administration accountable, has seen no other changes to climate information on USDA\u2019s web pages.   SONNY PARKS HIS R.V. IN WISCONSIN TODAY: Perdue has a packed schedule in the Badger State today, beginning at 9:30 a.m. Central time, with the opening ceremony of the Wisconsin State Fair and a meeting with Gov. Scott Walker. Perdue will also discuss the 2018 farm bill with the Wisconsin Agriculture Secretary Ben Brancel and local farmers, including members of the Farm Bureau. Then it\u2019s on to Hunger Task Force Farm, which grows fruits and vegetables for food pantries and local meal programs. Perdue\u2019s last stop will be a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, during which international trade, dairy farmers and immigration are likely to be topics du jour.   TRUMP ENDORSES BILL TO SLASH LEGAL IMMIGRATION: Trump came out Wednesday in support of a bill that would reduce legal immigration by one-half over the next decade. He joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) to present a reworked version of the so-called RAISE Act, S. 354 (115), originally introduced in February. Like the original measure, the revised bill would, over 10 years, reduce legal immigration to roughly 500,000 annually, down from the current level of about 1 million.   No help for U.S. agriculture. This isn\u2019t the kind of immigration legislation that the U.S. agriculture sector was pushing for. The RAISE Act would end petitioning by U.S. citizens and green-card holders to make extended family members lawful permanent residents, although spouses and minor children would still have preference. The bill doesn\u2019t address guest worker visas, including the H-2A program for temporary agricultural employees (a system that farmers say isn\u2019t meeting their labor needs).   But the Cotton-Perdue bill faces steep odds of becoming law, because of likely opposition from Democrats and pro-immigration Republicans. In a statement, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said that under the bill \u201chard-working immigrants in \u2018low-skilled\u2019 jobs can never have the opportunity to earn a green card. In California, that would mean farmworkers who have worked in the country for years would be permanently ineligible to apply for a green card.\u201d Read the full take from POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson here.  LARGEST DEAD ZONE TO DATE IN GULF: Federal scientists have measured the largest dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ever recorded, with this year's oxygen-depleted area covering a space roughly the size of New Jersey. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which lead the measurements, said the sprawling dead zone was being fed by nutrient pollution washing down the Mississippi River, primarily from farms, as well as urban and suburban runoff. Such "non-point pollution," in Clean Water Act parlance, is not federally regulated and is difficult to control. These nutrients spawn massive algae blooms that suck oxygen from the water as they decompose.  At 8,776 square miles, the dead zone continues to grow despite efforts in the 1990s to shrink it. A task force of state and federal agencies had set a goal in 2001 that aimed for the dead zone to be more than four and a half times smaller by now. Scientists estimate that to shrink the dead zone to the goal of 1,900 square miles would require a 45 percent reduction in nutrient pollution along the Mississippi River. In 2015, when the federal-state task force missed its goal, it said that it would take another two decades to reach those levels using voluntary, state-led efforts. The task force set an interim goal of cutting pollution by 20 percent by 2025.  Little interest from Trump. State and federal agencies have promoted voluntary efforts to measure and study nutrient pollution problems in the U.S. But the Trump administration, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, has shown little interest in potentially controversial, more hands-on efforts to stanch nutrient pollution.  THUNE SEEKS SIMPLIFIED FOREST MANAGEMENT: Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced his fifth marker bill for the 2018 farm bill on Wednesday, with the newest proposal targeted at streamlining federal forest management. The legislation would: increase from 3,000 to 10,000 the number of acres that the U.S. Forest Service is allowed to categorically exclude from an analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act; expedite the environmental review process by allowing categorical exclusions for wildlife habitat, the thinning and salvaging of dead and dying trees (two activities that help prevent wildfires) and expanding designated insect and disease treatment areas; and provide alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for certain projects on a pilot basis.  \u201cThe U.S. Forest Service is excessively burdened with NEPA compliance obstacles and produces more environmental impact statements, which take longer to complete than those of most other federal agencies whose projects have longer-lasting impacts on the landscape,\u201d Thune said in a statement. \u201cThe changes I\u2019ve proposed would go a long way to provide relief from unnecessary and burdensome red tape and improve national forest management.\u201d Read a summary of the bill here.  \u2018CHARLOTTE\u2019S WEB\u2019 FARM IS FOR SALE: Perhaps the most famous saltwater farm in American literature \u2014 the 44-acre spread that inspired E.B. White to spin the beloved children\u2019s tale \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web\u201d \u2014 is on the market. Asking price: $3.7 million. And, yes, the barn that was \u201chome\u201d to Charlotte and Wilbur still stands.   The farmhouse in North Brooklin, Me., dates to 1795. White and his wife, Katharine, bought it in 1933. He called it home until he passed away in 1985. The current owners, Robert and Mary Gallant, told the Portland Press Herald that it was not uncommon for passersby to stop and photograph the property. \u201cE.B. White would turn over in his grave if he knew how many people stop here,\u201d Mary Gallant said. \u201cBut to me, that\u2019s absolutely wonderful that he is so alive to the world.\u201d  NEW NUTRITION LEADER FOR UNITED FRESH: Mollie Van Lieu has been hired as senior director of nutrition policy for the United Fresh Produce Association, the group announced. She starts Sept. 5. Van Lieu, a former senior associate in government relations at the Pew Charitable Trusts, will work with both Congress and regulatory agencies, and dig into nutrition policy in the next farm bill.  MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 \u201cLobsterman\u201d may be the term for the profession, but Maine\u2019s lobster fleet has a growing number of women running their own boats \u201cand busting stereotypes along the way,\u201d NPR\u2019s The Salt blog reports.   \u2014 The Brazilian government\u2019s effort to raise taxes on fuels to increase federal revenue prompted truck drivers on Tuesday to demonstrate along roads critical to agricultural shipments, Reuters reports.   \u2014 Some 400,000 fewer Californians receive food stamp benefits today than during the later part of 2015, reversing a pattern of increases that held for a decade, The Sacramento Bee reports.   \u2014 Dirk Van de Put, head of Canada\u2019s McCain Foods Ltd., will take over in November for Mondelez chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, who is retiring, The Wall Street Journal reports.  \u2014 Researchers found that if every American substituted beans for beef in their diet, the country could come close to meeting its 2020 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

aV \u000a            By HELENA BOTTEMILLER EVICH  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Catherine Boudreau and Luis Sanchez  ALMANZA HAILS \u2018MODERNIZATION\u2019 IN EXIT INTERVIEW: Al Almanza has seen a lot change in nearly four decades at USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service, the agency charged with overseeing the safety of meat and poultry in this country. It is where he climbed from front-line meat inspector to agency administrator and then acting deputy undersecretary. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great run,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging exit interview with POLITICO this week, emphasizing that FSIS staff bears responsibility for the successes under his leadership. \u201cEverybody has done their part,\u201d he added.  Story Continued Below  Poultry controversy: One of the things he\u2019s most proud of \u2014 revamping poultry inspection \u2014 is also perhaps the most controversial. The \u201cmodernized\u201d inspection system, known as the National Poultry Inspection System and finalized in 2014, pulled some FSIS inspectors off the line and away from looking for visible defects. The idea was to free up inspectors to focus more on pathogen testing and other activities aimed at pathogen reduction. The move, however, sparked a bitter public battle with the inspectors union and some consumer groups.   Need for speed? A provision allowing increased line speeds in slaughter plants was supposed to push poultry companies to opt in to the new inspection system, but the Obama administration ultimately backed off the increased speeds under intense criticism. FSIS initially estimated the vast majority of plants would opt in. Today some 60 of the 280 poultry slaughter plants have converted to the new system. Almanza said he was confident the poultry industry would eventually move toward adoption.   \u201cThe poultry industry is an industry that is very deliberate in what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to watch how this plays out for the plants that are opting in and I would say most every big corporation that has poultry plants has one plant in. They want to wait and see how that is affecting production, wait and see what the data is showing them. \u2026 I do think that as they develop some history, they will invest the capital to modernize the majority of their facilities. I have no doubt whatsoever that is going to happen.\u201d   Brazilian beef mess: Asked about the recent suspension of Brazilian beef imports \u2014 a move that came after FSIS inspectors stepped up inspection and then rejected some 11 percent of product \u2014 Almanza said he\u2019s confident that bad Brazilian beef was kept out of the U.S. \u201cOur inspectors at those import facilities did their jobs right because they found things that caused us to be more aggressive in the action that we took,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI would say that the chances that something got through that wasn\u2019t healthy or good are extremely remote, just on the diligence of the inspectors that we have out there.\u201d  What\u2019s in a recusal? Almanza said he doesn\u2019t know the status of talks with Brazil about resolving the issue. He\u2019s been recusing himself from the matter \u2014 something that has sparked plenty of scuttle in The Swamp about a possible private sector gig. Almanza said that as of Monday \u2014 his last day at FSIS \u2014 he hadn\u2019t committed to anything. Pros, read the full Q&A with Almanza here.  HAPPY WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 2!

TRUMP, FARMERS, KISSES AND TRADE BARRIERS: President Donald Trump said last week that farmers were hugging and kissing him because of the deal to open up China to U.S. beef exports, and that \u201cone of the reasons you see optimism is because people can actually use their land. They can farm their land.\u201d The statements are part of a long, meandering interview he gave The Wall Street Journal, a transcript of which was published by POLITICO on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts:  A protectionist EU: Trump was asked about what the important pieces of a potential trade deal with the U.K. would be. \u201cThere\u2019ll be certain pieces \u2026 I have a very good relationship with the EU people and all, but they are very, very protectionist,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, our farmers and others can\u2019t even deal with \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t sell in. It\u2019s very unfair. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. It\u2019s so stacked against the United States.\u201d  No clarity on ag trade: When WSJ editor-in-chief Gerard Baker asked about an agricultural deal with the U.K., Trump said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you, you know, I did \u2014 I did thing [sic] that nobody even wrote about \u2014 although, you did. (Laughter.) But when I was with President Xi, who I have a very good relationship with, I said: Do me a favor. Would you allow cattle, please, to come in? I was last night in West Virginia, and I had farmers coming up to me and hugging me and kissing me because of the cattle stuff. They actually weren\u2019t from West Virginia; they were from other places. (Laughter.) But, you know, it was the Boy Scouts, so they came from all over the country.\u201d  No kisses for China: The Trump administration is preparing to take action against China over trade as soon as this week, two administration officials familiar with the issue told POLITICO. Andrew Restuccia and Doug Palmer have the details here.  BLUMENAUER\u2019S ALTERNATIVE FARM BILL: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) voted against the 2014 farm bill \u2014 and now he\u2019s coming out with one more to his liking. He announced Tuesday plans to introduce an alternative farm bill this fall that would rein in commodity and crop insurance premium subsidies by capping them at $250,000 and $50,000 per year per farm, respectively, as well as make it easier for SNAP recipients and schools to purchase fruits and vegetables. Other reforms include creating incentives to help young and beginning producers gain access to land and equipment, establishing a food waste title, investing in local and regional food systems, and setting performance-based standards for conservation programs.   Blumenauer, a longtime critic of federal farm and nutrition policy, said the farm bill gives \u201ctoo much to the wrong people to grow the wrong food in the wrong places.\u201d Dissatisfied with the process, he conducted two years of outreach in Oregon to agricultural researchers, farmworkers, nutrition advocates, conservation groups, small and mid-sized farmers and ranchers and other interests \u2014 culminating in a report, published Tuesday, that serves as the basis of his alternative bill. Read a summary of the legislation here and the report, titled \u201cGrowing Opportunities: Reforming the Farm Bill for Every American,\u201d here.  SENATE DEMS REVIVE BILL TO LIFT CUBA EMBARGO: On Tuesday, just a few days removed from perhaps President Trump\u2019s roughest week in office, a group of senior Democratic senators moved to defy him on Cuba by introducing legislation to lift the economic embargo on the island nation. In mid-June Trump rolled back former President Barack Obama\u2019s historic opening to the island. The measure, submitted by Sen. Ron Wyden and known as The U.S.-Cuba Trade Act of 2017, would establish normal trade relations with the island nation, in addition to lifting the economic sanctions that go back to the White House days of Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. It was co-sponsored by Sens. Patrick Leahy, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Durbin, Tom Udall, Patty Murray and Jeff Merkley.   \u201cDecades of experience have proven the embargo will never improve the lives of the Cuban people,\u201d Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. \u201cInstead, this policy only serves to shut U.S. exporters out of a natural market for American agricultural and manufactured goods.\u201d  Political reality-check: The bill faces long odds of becoming law because of Republican party resistance.  You want numbers? The International Trade Commission has estimated easing U.S. restrictions on trade and business with Cuba could increase U.S. exports by $1.4 billion annually in the next five years, with even bigger gains possible.   ERNST TO EPA: PUMP UP ADVANCED BIOFUELS: Sen. Joni Ernst, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts asked EPA on Tuesday to ramp up the amount of biomass-based biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol in its final biofuels rule. During an all-day hearing on the agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard proposed rule, the trio told a panel of EPA staff that companies had the capacity to produce 2.75 billion gallons of biodiesel in 2019, far more than the 2.1 billion gallons the agency proposed. The group also asked EPA to increase cellulosic volumes, which EPA proposed to lower by 23 percent in 2018 compared with 2017. \u201cReducing volumes for biodiesel and cellulosic would create uncertainty, especially as rural communities continue to experience a downturn in ag economy,\u201d Ernst said. The trio was pleased the agency kept conventional biofuels, typically filled by corn-based ethanol, at the maximum level.   Pruitt access: Ricketts and Reynolds told reporters after their testimony that they\u2019ve each spoken to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in person and on the phone on at least four occasions. EPA will take comment on the proposed volumes through Aug. 31.   HEALTH CARE OPIOID COMMISSION CALLS FOR CASH: In its interim report this week, the presidential commission on opioid addiction recommended a \u201cnational emergency\u201d declaration be made and more federal funding devoted to addressing the crisis. POLITICO New Jersey\u2019s Katie Jennings explains: The report proposes waiving a longstanding prohibition on using Medicaid funds to pay for residential substance-abuse treatment. That could cost the federal government between $40 billion and $60 billion over a decade, according to previous CBO estimates. \u201cThis is the single fastest way to increase treatment availability across the nation,\u201d the report states.  Backstory: Since the 1960s, the federal government has barred certain health care facilities with more than 16 beds \u2014 classified as Institutions for Mental Disease \u2014 from receiving federal matching funds to treat Medicaid patients. The ban was originally intended to force states to pay for the longterm institutionalization of psychiatric patients and limit Medicaid spending. But the commission\u2019s chief, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, says the prohibition \u201cis leaving thousands of beds empty across the country that could be occupied by folks who are in the midst of this disease to get the kind of treatment that could save their lives.\u201d  IRISH AG MINISTER PROMOTES GMO-FREE ISLAND: As the U.K. and Ireland continue talks on how to bring about \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade over the Irish border with Northern Ireland, Andrew Doyle, Ireland\u2019s Minister of State for Agriculture, has promoted the idea of having an \u201call-island status as GMO-free to maintain biodiversity.\u201d Doyle said, according to the Irish Times, that the island could be a \u201creservoir\u201d of safe genetically-modified-organism-free seed varieties. His view, however, does not reflect that of the country\u2019s Agricultural and Food Development Authority, which believes science should prevail in the argument over whether or not to cultivate GMO crops.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAGNUSON-STEVENS: The Magnuson-Stevens Act, the primary law regulating fisheries in federal waters, is in need of reauthorization, and Senate Commerce\u2019s Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard on Tuesday held the first in a series of hearings to guide that process. And, unsurprisingly, the issue of climate change made waves.  Chris Oliver, assistant administrator of NOAA\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service, and John Quinn, chairman of the New England Fishery Management Council, pushed for a variety of changes, ranging from management of mixed stocks to more flexibility in how the Council Coordination Committee can monitor and collect data. But it was Sen. Richard Blumenthal who made the strongest case for change by criticizing the current system for failing New England\u2019s fishing fleet and leaving the region\u2019s fishermen \u201cangry and frustrated beyond words.\u201d  Because of climate change, Blumenthal said, fish that New England fishermen have traditionally sought were pushed north and fish from southern waters moved into New England. But catch limits for certain fish haven\u2019t been adjusted to meet the reality facing New England fishermen, forcing them to return quota-exceeding fish to the ocean. Billions of dollars in profits are being lost, Blumenthal said, while fishermen from southern states come to New England waters to catch their migrating fish. \u201cThere is something profoundly unfair and intolerable about the situation,\u201d he added. \u201cIn my view, it violates the present law.\u201d  Quinn responded by pointing out that parts of the New England fishing industry are booming but agreed that groundfish fishermen are struggling. While the CCC\u2019s process is to collect as much data as needed to produce accurate stock assessments, Quinn said they didn\u2019t have \u201ca simple solution for rising water temperatures or the ocean acidification,\u201d which are the roots of the shifting fish populations.  DASCHLE JOINS WORLD FOOD PROGRAM BOARD: Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is joining the nonprofit World Food Program USA's Board of Directors. One of the board\u2019s goals is to educate \u201cCongress and the administration about the importance of global food assistance for national security, economic development and global stability.\u201d The announcement is here.

aV \u000a            By CATHERINE BOUDREAU  08/01/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Eric Wolff and Adam Behsudi  PERDUE HITS THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF FARM BILL \u2018ROOTS\u2019: We\u2019ll spare you the Clark W. Griswold joke and get right down to it: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is set to depart on a five-state farm bill tour via RV, a journey that begins Thursday at the Wisconsin State Fair and signals the secretary\u2019s intent to be \u201cintimately\u201d involved in development of the 2018 measure. Perdue\u2019s summer road trip \u2014 dubbed \u201cBack to Our Roots\u201d \u2014 will also bring him to Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, USDA will announce this morning. His schedule is packed with listening sessions, to allow him to hear from producers and consumers across the country who are \u201con the front lines of American agriculture and \u2026 know best what the current issues are,\u201d Perdue said in a statement. He\u2019ll have some fun along the way, attending a Minnesota Twins game with USDA employees and popping in at Indianapolis Colts training camp for an event on the NFL\u2019s \u201cFuel Up to Play 60\u201d initiative.   Story Continued Below  \u201cUSDA will be intimately involved as Congress deliberates and formulates the 2018 Farm Bill,\u201d Perdue said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to making the resources and the research available so that Congress can make good, facts-based, data-driven decisions. It\u2019s important to look at past practices to see what has worked and what has not worked, so that we create a farm bill for the future that will be embraced by American agriculture in 2018.\u201d  That would mark a significant departure from the USDA that Congress came to know under former President Barack Obama. While Obama included changes to crop insurance and other farm bill programs in his annual budget, former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack largely stayed out of negotiations over the legislation.  Does Sonny do encores? Yup. A second RV tour is planned for later this summer, though details have yet to be announced. The trips will be documented on Perdue\u2019s Twitter account under #BackToOurRoots.  HAPPY TUESDAY, AUGUST 1! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host would categorize this as a crime of passion.

TEXANS FRET ABOUT NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS: Sticking with the 2018 farm bill for a moment \u2026 House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway said at the panel\u2019s field hearing in San Angelo, Texas on Monday that he wants to get a farm bill on the House floor by the end of this year \u2014 echoing a goal that his Senate counterpart, Pat Roberts, outlined last week. Over the course of three hours, some 80 farmers and ranchers, food bank employees, agricultural bankers and conservation groups discussed their concerns and suggestions on farm policy to Conaway, ranking member Collin Peterson and six other committee members.  Calls for returning cotton to Title I so it can qualify for commodity supports, improving livestock disaster assistance and strengthening conservation programs like CSP and EQUIP were plentiful, but the more passionate statements came from producers who fear the next generation won\u2019t be on the farm for a variety of reasons: the lack of equity needed to secure financing; the constant rise in the cost of pesticides, seeds, and equipment while commodity prices slump, which makes it difficult to make a profit; and the deteriorating economic condition of rural America.  \u201cI know five young growers who went out of business in the last three years,\u201d said Tony Dill of the Western Peanut Growers Association. \u201cThis is a very severe issue. I see no future in our country if we don\u2019t do something for younger farmers. A lot of us older farmers are living on equity, and younger farmers don\u2019t have that equity to get started.\u201d  THE ALMANZA ERA DRAWS TO A CLOSE: Al Almanza, administrator of the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, retired on Monday after 39 years at the agency. Secretary Perdue, in an email to staff, announced that two career employees will take on temporary leadership roles, beginning today: Paul Kiecker will be FSIS acting administrator, and Carmen Rottenberg will serve as acting deputy undersecretary for food safety \u2014 a post Almanza also held from September 2014 to December 2016.   In a farewell message to USDA employees last week, Almanza said highlights of his tenure include modernizing the poultry inspection system, reducing foodborne illnesses from listeriosis and E. coli and implementing stricter performance standards for campylobacter and salmonella in poultry.   The new line-up. Rottenberg has spent nearly six years in leadership roles at FSIS, including as deputy administrator and chief operating officer, overseeing the agency\u2019s $1-billion budget. Kiecker joined FSIS in 1988 as a food inspector and has held a number of positions since then, most recently as deputy assistant administrator for the Office of Field Operations.   MEXICO NAMES NEW CHIEF NAFTA NEGOTIATOR: Mexico is building out its negotiating team in preparation for the much-awaited renegotiation of NAFTA, naming Kenneth Smith Ramos on Monday to be its chief technical negotiator. Ramos, head of the trade and NAFTA office at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, will work just below Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo and Undersecretary for Foreign Trade Juan Carlos Baker in leading the negotiations, a Guajardo spokesperson told our colleagues at Morning Trade.  Guajardo, speaking to reporters on Monday, highlighted Ramos\u2019 past work in Mexico\u2019s agriculture department as well as its economy ministry. \u201cHe is a man who has had a very, very long, intense and brilliant career in all foreign trade topics,\u201d Guajardo said in Spanish.  RFS HEARING BE POPPIN\u2019 LIKE CORN: EPA is throwing its annual Renewable Fuel Standard bash today, an all-day hearing for the agency to get feedback on its proposed rule, which will set the amount of biofuel that must be blended into the nation\u2019s fuel supply. The agency kept the ethanol mandate at the legal maximum of 15 billion gallons, but it dramatically cut the amount of advanced biofuels, and it will surely get an earful on that.   RFS A-listers: EPA will hear from: Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds; Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts; Chris Bliley of Growth Energy; Bob Dinneen of the Renewable Fuels Association; Frank Macchiarola of the American Petroleum Institute; and Donnell Rehagen of the National Biodiesel Board. Reynolds, whose state leads the nation in ethanol production, will tell EPA she\u2019s glad it is on track for an on-time rule (they're actually a bit behind schedule), but wants the agency \u201cto raise the advanced biofuel, biodiesel and cellulosic volumes. The RFS is a bold policy, and Iowans and the industry as a whole have always risen to the challenge.\u201d  NMPF: PLANT-BASED FOOD PETITION \u2018INAPPROPRIATE\u2019: The Good Food Institute\u2019s effort to revive a 20-year-old soy industry petition that requested FDA allow plant-based products to be labeled as \u201cmilk\u201d is as \u201cinappropriate today as it was \u2026 in 1997,\u201d the National Milk Producers Federation said in response Monday. \u201cNothing has happened in the intervening time period to allow the combination of soy powder, water, emulsifiers, stabilizers, sugar, sodium and added vitamins to magically become milk,\u201d NMPF President Jim Mulhern said in a statement. \u201cRegardless of what food technologists might try, milk still only comes from mammals.\u201d   GFI also filed its own petition on Monday, asking FDA to codify its existing practice of allowing manufacturers to use common dairy names to broadly label plant-based foods and beverages. The FDA told MA in response on Monday that it is \u201creviewing the matter and takes action in accordance with public health priorities and agency resources.\u201d  THIS TAX REFORM TIMELINE IS \u2026 \u2018AGGRESSIVE\u2019: The White House expects tax reform legislation to move quickly through Congress this fall, clearing the House in October and the Senate in November, legislative director Marc Short said Monday. Markups will begin in September. \u201cSo that, I think, is an aggressive schedule, but that is our timetable,\u201d he said during an event hosted by a pair of conservative political groups backed by the billionaire Koch brothers \u2014 Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity.   Short\u2019s ambitious timeline is the most specific to be laid out by either the White House or Congress in recent months, reports Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo. It jives with a joint statement issued by administration and congressional negotiators last week, which said the expectation is that tax reform legislation will move through committees \u201cthis fall,\u201d followed by consideration on the House and Senate floor. Republicans are planning to use special instructions in a budget resolution \u2014 should it advance through Congress \u2014 to pass tax reform with a simple majority in the Senate in order to short-circuit a Democratic filibuster. But Short also suggested a Republican-only pathway isn\u2019t completely necessary. Some Democrats might get on board, particularly those up for reelection next year in states Trump carried, he said.  THE 2018 WATCH: CASEY, TESTER GET NEW CHALLENGERS: Senate Agriculture Committee member Bob Casey (D-Pa.) has a new challenger in 2018: GOP Rep. Lou Barletta, two Republican sources told POLITICO\u2019s Kevin Robillard. Barletta, an early supporter of President Donald Trump, is an immigration hard-liner serving his fourth term in the House. Trump has publicly suggested Barletta challenge either Casey or Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. Barletta, a former mayor of Hazleton, Pa., is the biggest name in a large Republican field challenging Casey, a moderate who has emerged as a fierce Trump critic.  Tester territory: Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale on Monday formally launched his campaign to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester next year, and gave a heads-up to POLITICO\u2019s Elena Schneider. A handful of Republicans are already in the race, but Rosendale is the first statewide officeholder to jump in. Tester, an organic farmer and two-term incumbent, is one of the GOP\u2019s top Senate targets. Rosendale ran for Congress in 2014 and loaned his own campaign more than $1.1 million before losing to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in the Republican primary.   \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I will serve wherever Montanans feel I can be the most effective, and I\u2019ve gotten calls from across the entire state from people who are not satisfied with the job that Tester is doing. He acts like a farmer when he\u2019s here, but he goes back to Washington and votes just like Chuck Schumer,\u201d Rosendale said. \u201cWe recognize that even if you go into federal government well-intentioned, there comes a time when you have been there too long.\u201d  U.S., BRAZIL TO COMPETE FOR CORN CUSTOMERS: Brazil\u2019s corn production in the 2016-17 season is forecast to be a record 97 million tons, while U.S. farmers are predicted to harvest their second-biggest crop this fall \u2014 setting up intense competition for buyers in the second half of 2017, Bloomberg reports. Two decades ago, Brazil wasn\u2019t even on the United States\u2019 radar as a competitor in corn exports, but has since ramped up shipments. In 2016, the country ranked third in corn exports, while the U.S. was No. 1 and Argentina No. 2, according to USDA data. Japan and Mexico are the top buyers of the commodity.   U.S. corn shippers are seeing slow bookings for the coming marketing year, which starts in September, Bloomberg reported, citing USDA data. Corn shipments from Brazil are climbing, but they are projected to continue to pace behind those of the U.S. Whether Brazil can steal more market share from U.S. farmers depends partly on the value of the Brazilian real and how many growers are willing to sell crops at low local prices, one analyst told Bloomberg.  Another factor? Trump. Mexico is looking to diversify its corn supply amid the political uncertainty surrounding NAFTA 2.0 and President Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric. But Secretary Perdue, after two days of bilateral meetings in Mexico last week with Mexican Secretary of Agriculture Jos Calzada, said the U.S. still has an edge.   \u201cI did not get any indication that they're seriously considering that,\u201d Perdue told reporters during a conference call on Friday. \u201cI think while they may talk ... as if they\u2019re having conversations, we have a corner store location for their supply," he added, highlighting the U.S. agricultural sector\u2019s competitive and logistical advantages in relation to its southern neighbor.  ERS: FARM PRODUCTIVITY KEY TO FOOD SECURITY: Growth in agricultural productivity is strongly connected to improvements in developing countries\u2019 food security status, according to a report published by the USDA Economic Research Service on Monday. Investments in agricultural research and technology are central to efforts to meet the challenge of feeding a world population north of 9 billion by 2050. \u201cOn average, the faster the growth in agricultural productivity, the larger the reductions in food insecurity,\u201d the report said.   ERS analyzed the role of trade, agricultural productivity, international aid, and better data and measurement in achieving food security gains in 76 low- and middle-income countries over the past 15 years. Since the U.S. provides about half of global food aid and support for agricultural development \u2014 between $6 billion and 7 billion annually over the last few years \u2014 the researchers said it\u2019s necessary to study factors that drive improvement if the U.S. is to reach its commitment of ending global food insecurity by 2030.  Cash is king? The report also found that for countries receiving aid, cash-transfer programs can be more cost effective than traditional methods like in-kind commodity donations, which represent the United States\u2019 largest form of food aid under the Food for Peace program. However, not all countries have sufficient food markets or the administrative capability to broadly implement cash programs. Advances in IT, personal identification, banking and mobile phones support the expansion of targeted cash-transfer programs. \u201cThese innovations can \u2026 reduce the market distortions associated with acquiring, distributing, and storing commodities found in traditional in-kind programs,\u201d the report said.

Laguarda, who joined the FCA Office of General Counsel in 1990 and rose to become assistant general counsel and the designated agency ethics official, succeeds Elizabeth Dean, who retired Monday.   MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 New Food Economy has this deep dive on who owns America\u2019s farmland (hint: it\u2019s increasingly not farmers).  \u2014  The country\u2019s largest fresh-garlic producer solved its labor shortage by raising wages to $13. The Mercury News explores whether it\u2019s an isolated success story or a fix for U.S. agriculture more broadly.   \u2014 A group of leading crop scientists is calling for a coordinated approach to research to tackle global food security threats, Feedstuffs reports.  \u2014 Researchers found that providing a 50 percent discount on the price of fruits and vegetables doubled consumers\u2019 intake of the produce.

aV \u000a            By CATHERINE BOUDREAU  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Jenny Hopkinson and Helena Bottemiller Evich   THE WAYBACK MACHINE HITS THE PLANT-BASED FOOD FIGHT: Twenty years ago the Soyfoods Association of North America filed a petition requesting FDA clarify that it allows soy-based beverages to be labeled as \u201csoymilk.\u201d FDA never acted on the petition. Now, in the midst of a simmering feud over naming of plant-based foods, the Good Food Institute is resurrecting that old petition. GFI, a nonprofit that promotes plant-based meat and dairy products, is today asking FDA to respond to the request, and petitioning the agency to codify its existing practice of allowing food producers to use common dairy names to broadly label plant-based items, such as almond milk, cashew cheese and coconut yogurt.   Story Continued Below  GFI says the need is urgent for FDA to clarify its position because of increased conflict over the issue. Last month a U.S. District Court judge in California stayed a case over use of the term \u201calmond milk,\u201d and referred the matter to FDA to settle the policy question. And the House Appropriations Committee, in non-binding report language attached to fiscal 2018 spending legislation, directed FDA to issue guidance on the standard of identity for dairy products.   The National Milk Producers Federation is pushing Congress to ban the practice of plant-based foods using the term \u201cmilk,\u201d arguing it is misleading to consumers from a nutritional standpoint. It\u2019s a fight that has taken on greater stakes for the dairy industry as it seeks to spur demand for its products amid a global oversupply of milk. On its side are Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who introduced the DAIRY PRIDE Act earlier this year, which would direct FDA to enforce standards of identity for milk, and effectively ban plant-based foods from being marketed with the term.

HORMONE-TREATED BEEF: A TALE OF TWO TRADE DEALS: If U.S. beef producers want to realize the full potential behind the deal to open China\u2019s market to American beef, they must climb an all-too-familiar mountain: removing artificial growth hormones from production. The White House is hailing its deal with China, but it\u2019s important to note the agreement effectively disqualifies most beef produced in the states because it prohibits use of artificial growth hormones. But at the same time the administration is reviving a 1990s-era challenge of an EU measure that throws up the same roadblocks, creating a strange dichotomy for U.S. beef trade in the Trump era, Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer reports this morning.   The Trump administration got China to lift its ban on U.S. beef by agreeing U.S. producers would ship only beef from cattle raised without hormones and also free of any trace of ractopamine or other beta agonists, a class of feed additives used to produce leaner meat. One analyst, who asked not to be identified, told POLITICO that forgoing those compounds would cost cattle producers upwards of $275 a head, a premium that isn\u2019t being offset by China. \u201cWe will still ship some small (niche) volumes to China, but the China deal is not commercially viable,\u201d the analyst said. U.S. meat industry groups expressed optimism, arguing exports to China will begin slowly and build over time.   A tipping point? It remains to be seen whether the opportunity for hormone-free exports to China proves to be a tipping point in U.S. agricultural trade policy after decades of fighting to keep overseas markets open to hormone-treated beef. The U.S. beef industry has every intention of pushing forward in its dispute with the EU. The WTO permitted the U.S. in the late 1990s to impose retaliatory duties on exports to the EU over the EU\u2019s ban on hormone-treated beef, which stayed in place until the Obama administration negotiated a settlement. As part of that agreement, a tariff-free quota for U.S. \u201chormone-free\u201d beef was created, but now Australia and Argentina are grabbing most of those sales. So the Trump administration is mulling whether to re impose retaliatory measures. Pros, read Doug\u2019s story here.  THIS WEEK: A FARM BILL TRIFECTA: Capitol Hill promises to be half as quiet as usual for the first week in August with only the Senate in town, trying to move past last week\u2019s momentous events in the Obamacare repeal effort (don\u2019t miss our colleagues\u2019 deep dive into Sen. John McCain's decisive vote). The farm world will largely be focused on House Agriculture Committee\u2019s trio of farm bill listening sessions. Chairman Mike Conaway, his staff, and other committee members will be racking up the airmiles as they go from San Angelo, Texas, on Monday to Morgan, Minn., on Thursday to Modesto, Calif., on Saturday. Today\u2019s hearing starts at 2 p.m. and will be livestreamed here.  Along with the changes in scenery will come huge shifts in the issues farmers are most concerned about. Expect the session in Texas to focus on the needs of cotton growers, including a commodity support program. Lawmakers also will likely hear calls from cattle ranchers for additional disaster-aid programs, especially following the prairie fires that burned in the northern part of the state this spring. The hearing in Minnesota is in ranking member Collin Peterson\u2019s stomping grounds, where the focus will likely be on dairy farmers and ways to fix their insurance program, as well as efforts to curb disease in poultry and hogs. Finally, the California hearing is undoubtedly going to feature a lot of specialty crop and organic production issues and calls for a federal fix to farm labor shortages.  Also this week:   Senate ENR tackles wildfires, water security: The full Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee holds a hearing on Thursday to look at ways to use collaborations and technology to reduce wildfire risks and enhance firefighting effectiveness. Wildfires have become increasingly destructive as communities have expanded into traditionally forested areas, weather patterns have changed, and forest managers, including USDA\u2019s Forest Service, have not had sufficient resources to manage the land. While it seems like more money will be difficult to come by in the current political context, the hearing indicates that committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski is exploring other approaches to solving the problem. The committee\u2019s water panel will also meet Wednesday to consider methods to increase water security and drought preparedness.  Not on the schedule: Confirmation hearings. The Senate Agriculture Committee hasn\u2019t scheduled confirmation hearings on the three USDA subcabinet positions the White House has announced. The committee has received paperwork from the White House for Stephen Censky, for deputy secretary, and Sam Clovis, for undersecretary for research, education and economics. But the committee is still waiting for 1600 Pennsylvania to send over the goods on Ted McKinney, for undersecretary for trade.  AGGIE POPULARITY CONTEST: MA told you last week about how farm groups have supported Clovis serving as the department's chief scientist, even though he doesn\u2019t have the science credentials called for in the law that established the position. But Clovis has got nothing on Censky when it comes to farm-group support. Last Monday 23 groups signed onto a letter backing Clovis, and on Friday 44 groups wrote to Senate Ag calling for Censky to be confirmed.   In case you missed it, read Helena Bottemiller Evich\u2019s profile of Clovis here.   JUDGE GREEN-LIGHTS COOK COUNTY SODA TAX: Dear Chicago, your sugary drinks are going to get more expensive this week. On Friday, Cook County Circuit Judge Daniel Kubasiak dismissed a lawsuit brought by retailers and other industry groups that argued the county\u2019s penny-per-ounce soda tax was unconstitutional. An injunction against the tax, slated to kick in on July 1, was dropped, and the levy will now take effect on Wednesday, Aug. 2. It\u2019s not known if retail groups will appeal. Find more on the ruling from The Chicago Tribune here.   ICYMI: AGRIBUSINESS TOP LOBBYING POWER ON REG REFORM: Since House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) introduced the Regulatory Accountability Act (H.R. 5) in January, it\u2019s become the sixth-most lobbied bill in Congress \u2014 and the agribusiness industry has been the most active. Out of the 109 companies and groups lobbying lawmakers this year, 23 represent agribusiness interests, according to an analysis conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics last week. For example, CropLife America, the trade group for pesticide manufacturers like Monsanto, Bayer AG and BASF Corp., has its own lobbyists on the bill and has also paid Jim Massie & Partners, LLC, $50,000 this year to work on the RAA and other issues (Lobbying disclosure forms don\u2019t break down the amount of money spent per issue or bill, but rather a total figure for all activity in any given quarter).   Other interests lobbying Congress on the RAA include National Grain and Feed Association; Dairy Farmers of America; farm bureaus in states like Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania; and the American Sugarbeet Growers Association.  The RAA, which is designed to overhaul the regulatory process, has passed the House, and a similar version was introduced in April by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). It is all but guaranteed to be signed into law if it reaches President Donald Trump\u2019s desk. The legislation would require federal agencies to choose the lowest-cost rulemaking alternative that meets objectives outlined by Congress, would end judicial deference by courts and instead require them to decide all terms of an agency\u2019s actions, and prohibit regulations that cost more than $1 billion from taking effect until courts can resolve litigation challenging them, among other provisions.   JOHANNS\u2019 NEW GOAL: GET FARMERS USING THE R&D TAX CREDIT: Farmers have a lot on their wishlist for tax reform, should Congress ever get to it, but former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns says many in agriculture aren\u2019t taking advantage of a key credit already available to them. The former Nebraska governor, who led the USDA under President George W. Bush before serving a stint in the Senate, is on a mission to get farmers to use the federal R&D tax credit. That provision provides a dollar-for-dollar credit when a business tries something new in its operation, Johanns told MA.   The provision isn\u2019t just about work done in a lab, but also any efforts by a business aimed at \u201cimproving a process,\u201d the former secretary said, pointing to common farming activities such as selective breeding in livestock and to work being done by dairy processors, breweries and even ethanol plants to increase productivity. \u201cIt fits hand in glove with what\u2019s going on in agriculture,\u201d said Johanns, who added to his resume chairman of agriculture for the Houston-based tax consultancy alliantgroup. While many, if not most, farms could qualify for the credit, Johanns said only about 10 percent are taking advantage of it. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that the ag community hasn\u2019t put on their radar screen,\u201d he said.  President Trump and House Republicans have stated they would maintain the R&D tax credit in any overhaul of the tax code.   We\u2019d be remiss not to ask about the farm bill: Between his time at USDA and in the Senate, Johanns has both implemented a farm bill and written one. Here are his predictions for this one: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a strained farm bill,\u201d he said, pointing to budget pressure from the White House and Republican leadership in Congress. However, he has some optimism because the House and Senate Agriculture committee leaders have started hearings early and are working on the legislation already. \u201cThat kind of preparation is very important,\u201d he said.  Recent comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he wants to get the measure to the floor soon are also promising, Johanns said. \u201cThose dynamics are very helpful, and I continue to believe that they can get a farm bill done and on time. It's not going to get any easier the longer they wait.\u201d  NEW BILL ROUNDUP: SNAP E&T, HEMP PRODUCTION: Legislation introduced by Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) would increase funding for employment and training programs for people who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. SNAP E&T programs are an oft-forgotten element of SNAP, but creation of a major E&T pilot program to test how best to get people back to work ended up being key to passing the 2014 farm bill. Costa\u2019s bill would create a longterm competitive grant program for states starting in fiscal 2019 with $300 million, a discretionary spending level that would go up to $600 million by fiscal 2027.  \u201cFor years I have been following how pairing education and training programs with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has transformed people\u2019s lives in the San Joaquin Valley, and we have seen the success of programs that focus on helping individuals find longterm employment and start real careers,\u201d Costa said.  Legalizing hemp. Reps. Goodlatte, James Comer (R-Ky.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.) on Friday reintroduced legislation that would remove hemp from the Controlled Substances Act and legalize its cultivation in all 50 states. The 2014 farm bill authorized universities and state departments of agriculture to launch pilot programs to grow and research industrial hemp, and 31 states are participating. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act had 75 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House and 16 in the Senate during the last Congress, but never advanced beyond being introduced.   MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 An agricultural crisis is looming across Africa as its population increases but the amount of arable land shrinks, due to climate change, soil degradation, erosion and poaching, The New York Times reports.   \u2014 Chefs at farm-to-table restaurants should talk more about the inequalities in the U.S. food system, most notably cheap labor, opines Andrea Reusing in NPR\u2019s The Salt.  \u2014 Hundreds of libraries are now serving federally funded summer meals to children to ensure they don\u2019t go hungry when school is out, The New York Times reports.

aV \u000a            By JENNY HOPKINSON  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich and Catherine Boudreau  WHERE ARE THE GMO LABELING RULES? Saturday marks one year since former President Barack Obama signed the federal GMO ingredient disclosure law, ending the food industry\u2019s long struggle to preempt state labeling standards and short-circuiting Vermont\u2019s brief experiment with on-package disclosure. The law requires USDA to craft rules that set standards for what needs to be disclosed and that give companies options \u2014 on package or online \u2014 for informing consumers that GMOs are in their food.  Story Continued Below  Obama\u2019s ag chief, Tom Vilsack, worked to lay the groundwork for the rule in his last five months in office, but the effort seems to have been thrown off by the change in administration and the drawn-out vetting process and confirmation battles that have bedeviled President Donald Trump\u2019s executive branch buildout. The measure must be finalized in a year, but USDA appears to still be grappling with core details of the rule. A proposed rule is months away.  Tick tock: The average rulemaking takes about four years, but the clock for USDA on the GMO disclosure rules started with half that. A USDA spokesman tells MA that \u201cour goal is have a final rule ready for publication by the statutory deadline of July 2018,\u201d and that a proposal should be out this fall. That\u2019s a quick turnaround, given that officials are taking comments until Aug. 25 on what the rule should include. Once the regulation is proposed, USDA will have to take comment on the measure itself \u2014 a process that could take months \u2014 and review and update it before going final.   Industry groups are still optimistic USDA will wrap it up by next year. \u201cGiven this administration\u2019s support for U.S. manufacturing and farmers, we have every reason to believe that it will want to move ahead as quickly as possible to implement this rule by July 2018,\u201d Denzel McGuire, executive vice president of government affairs for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, said in a statement.  The sticky bits: The trickier parts of the rulemaking are basic questions that must be answered, including defining genetic modification. Some farm and food groups want disclosure to be required only for modifications that can\u2019t be achieved in nature, arguing that some technologies just speed up the process. But consumer advocates, including Just Label It, say the rule should apply to all biotech crops.   \u201cConsumers will expect the mandatory GMO disclosure standard to apply to all foods produced with or derived from genetic engineering, including foods which contain ingredients like highly refined sugars and oils, as well as foods produced with new forms of genetic engineering,\u201d pro-labeling group Just Label It said in its comments. Other issues likely to cause trouble for USDA include whether each GMO ingredient should be identified and how to provide broad access to online labels.   Patience is a virtue, but here\u2019s the thing: While USDA is trying to figure out how best to craft the rules, food companies are moving ahead with labeling in ways they hope will be covered by the rule. Campbell Soup Company has decided to add disclosures to all its products\u2019 packaging, and some companies that labeled to comply with Vermont\u2019s law appear to have left them in place \u2014 read your labels and you\u2019ll see them. Meanwhile, brands are signing up for GMA\u2019s SmartLabel program, a website for disclosure of GMO ingredients and other product info that can be accessed either online or through an on-package QR code. More than 10,000 products are already listed in the online database, GMA said, and the goal is to have 30,000 products enrolled by the end of the year.  HAPPY FRIDAY, JULY 28!

U.S. FROZEN BEEF EXPORTS TO JAPAN TRIGGER TARIFF HIKE: As if U.S. producers didn\u2019t have enough to lose in beef exports to Japan, Tokyo invoked a safeguard measure on imports of frozen beef from the U.S. and other countries, ratcheting up tariffs from 38.5 percent to 50 percent, per the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Under the terms of its Japan\u2019s WTO membership, it instituted a safeguard that would trigger if the quarter import volume exceeded the previous corresponding quarter by 17 percent. Imports during the first quarter of Japan\u2019s fiscal year (April 1-June 30) topped the threshold by a mere 115 metric tons, meaning the increased tariff will be applied for the remainder of Japan\u2019s fiscal year.About 45 percent of U.S. beef exports to Japan are frozen.  \u201cUSMEF recognizes that the safeguard will not only have negative implications for U.S. beef producers, but will also have a significant impact on the Japanese foodservice industry,\u201d USMEF President and CEO Philip Seng said in a statement. \u201cIt will be especially difficult for the gyudon beef bowl restaurants that rely heavily on Choice U.S. short plate as a primary ingredient.\u201d  For U.S. producers, it gets worse: The safeguard won\u2019t apply to imports of Australian beef, which will continue to enjoy a lower tariff of 27.2 percent and are not subject to safeguard tariffs per terms of a deal it signed with Japan in 2015. However, the USMEF argues the Japanese food service industry prefers U.S. short plate, a belly cut, which accounts for a majority of U.S. frozen beef exports to Japan. Still, the organization acknowledges the situation makes Australia\u2019s position even more advantageous.  PORK PRODUCERS PUSH FOR STAY OF CAFO REPORTING: The National Pork Producers Council is urging a federal judge to give EPA time to develop guidance for how livestock operations must report emissions, arguing that not doing so will create a haphazard \u201creporting fiasco.\u201d The motion in support of a stay requested by the agency, filed Thursday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, follows an April decision of the same court overturning EPA\u2019s exemption for animal waste emissions reporting requirements.   Not so fast: Environmental groups, in their own filing Thursday, said the court should reject the stay, since the agency has had plenty of time to figure out how to enforce the rule on CAFOs. \u201cEPA\u2019s motion ignores that CAFOs have been reporting releases without any guidance for over a decade,\u201d Waterkeeper Alliance and other groups argue. \u201cAnd EPA has been collecting and analyzing emissions data, similarly, for over a decade, for the purpose of developing guidance \u2014 but guidance still has not issued.\u201d  DONDE ESTA SONNY? Livin\u2019 la vida loca in Mrida, Mexico. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue made his first trip south of the border for meetings Thursday and Friday with his Mexican counterpart, Agriculture Secretary Jos Calzada Rovirosa. The two officials are discussing trade issues, as well as hosting panel discussions with U.S. and Mexican farmers and ranchers.   The goal is to build personal relationships in Mexico so the two countries can collaborate on agricultural trade issues, USDA said. The U.S. agricultural industry has been trying to assure customers in Mexico that they are valuable partners and that preserving NAFTA is a top priority despite Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric \u2014 a likely aim of Perdue\u2019s visit. The U.S. grain industry said it has already lost sales since the beginning of this year as Mexico pursues other buyers, particularly in South America, amid political uncertainty over NAFTA 2.0. Perdue and Rovirosa are set to hold a press conference this morning, so stay tuned for more.  BYE BYE, BORDER TAX: White House and congressional leaders officially acknowledged Thursday that the controversial border-adjustment tax would be dropped from the GOP tax reform plan, but they didn\u2019t provide any new details on the broader package they expect to start moving through Congress in the fall, reports Pro\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady were pushing the border provision, which would tax imported goods but not exports, as a way to fund tax cuts. But the proposal prompted a fierce backlash from retailers and other import-dependent industries, and members of the Republican conference remain divided on the issue.   "While we have debated the pro-growth benefits of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform," top negotiators, including Ryan, Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a joint statement.   Regular order? The group\u2019s statement was largely symbolic, vowing to reduce tax rates, simplify the tax code and improve U.S. economic growth by changing tax laws. It added that "the time has arrived" for the tax-writing committees to produce draft legislation. "Our expectation is for this legislation to move through the committees this fall, under regular order, followed by consideration on the House and Senate floors," the statement added.  What about the estate tax? That was left unresolved. Lorenzo and POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook break things down further, here.   FOOD WASTE GETS A DAY ON THE HILL: A gaggle of chefs from across the country descended on Washington this week to talk to members of Congress about food waste, an increasingly hot topic that just might get some attention in the next farm bill.   The Food Policy Action Education Fund organized the fly-in on Wednesday that was part of the group\u2019s \u201cPlate of the Union\u201d campaign, a joint initiative with the Environmental Working Group. Dozens of chefs and other advocates met with no fewer than 65 offices, a full day that was capped off with a rooftop farm reception at Up Top Acres in Navy Yard. The day of action included chefs from all over, from South on Main in Little Rock, Ark., to Aziza in San Francisco and Dinette in Pittsburgh.   Spotted: Six members of Congress stopped by the rooftop farm shindig, including: Reps. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) and Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) (no surprises there) as well as Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Marc Veasey (D-Texas), Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), and Filemon Vela (D-Texas).   SENATE AG STAFF SHUFFLE: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts has some new faces leading the committee\u2019s legal staff, according to a notice from his office. Fred Clark, a former managing partner for Cornerstone Government Affairs and House Agriculture Committee staffer, is joining the majority\u2019s team as senior counsel, while DaNita Murray, previously senior counsel and policy director for the committee, is adding the title of chief counsel. The majority staff is also picking up two new staff assistants: former committee intern Haley Donahue and Future Farmers of America and Kansas State alumni Chance Hunley.  PHA NAMES ROMAN AS CEO: The Partnership for a Healthier America, the nonprofit launched to support former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! initiative, has named Nancy Roman as president and CEO, the group announced recently. Roman is currently president and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank, the largest food bank in the D.C. area.  \u201cAs President and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank, Nancy brought the vision, fortitude, and focus on impact that will be essential to the future of PHA,\u201d said Melissa Winter, chief of staff to the former first lady. \u201cMrs. Obama is looking forward to working with Nancy.\u201d Roman will begin her new role Sept. 5.  MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 A new report from three EU agencies found that the consumption of certain types of antibiotics in hospitals is directly linked to people\u2019s resistance to them, while in other cases the use of antibiotics in animals ties with antimicrobial resistance, POLITICO EU reports.  \u2014 A new report from USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service has found that ending conservation compliance requirements for crop insurance premium subsidies would mean a significant reduction of soil erosion prevention measures on farms.   \u2014 Mexican officials are pushing back against claims that a Salmonella outbreak in the U.S. is linked to Mexican papayas, the AP reports.   \u2014 Thanks to more than a month without rain, Washington State\u2019s cherry crop is expected to be one of the largest ever, The Packer reports.

aV \u000a            By JENNY HOPKINSON  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Annie Snider, Helena Bottemiller Evich, Patrick Temple-West and Catherine Boudreau  CROP INSURANCE AND THE NATURAL DISASTER PROBLEM: When historic floods hit South Carolina in 2015, crop farmers across the state relied on crop insurance payments to rebuild their farms. Payments averaged about 40 percent of premiums, but it was better than nothing, state Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers told MA.   Story Continued Below  As lawmakers on both sides of the aisle discuss changes to crop insurance to lower costs in the next farm bill, Weathers warned they are missing a key point: The program is becoming more important because natural disasters are on the rise. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only safety net still available to farmers,\u201d he said after spending time on the Hill this week pushing lawmakers to spare the federal crop insurance program. \u201cCrop insurance is sort of the last line in the sand.\u201d  While livestock producers have disaster relief programs under the farm bill, crop farmers have no such safeguards to help them recover from weather events. When extreme weather hits, USDA can do little more than make available low-interest loans, so farmers simply must rely on their crop insurance. But weather events are getting more common, which has put more strain on the system. There were 13 significant flooding events that were not related to a tropical storm, hurricane or nor'easter between 2010 and 2016, FEMA records show. From 2000 until 2009, there were only seven. If that trend continues, any cuts to crop insurance could impair farmers\u2019 ability to recover from floods, droughts and other natural disasters, Weathers said.  Also on the farm bill wish list: Weathers made the case to his fellow South Carolinians in Congress to maintain the farm bill\u2019s credit provision and conservation programs, fix the dairy program, support and fund specialty crop block grants, and keep the nutrition title in the legislation. That\u2019s been a sticky subject for lawmakers from the Palmetto State, among whom Jim DeMint, the former senator from South Carolina, is still popular. DeMint previously led the conservative Heritage Foundation, which advocated for splitting the most recent farm bill. The nutrition title was \u201ca cause of a fair amount of angst\u201d among South Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation in 2014 as Heritage and then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney pushed for the legislation to include only farm programs, despite warnings from agricultural groups.   But this time around, with DeMint off on new ventures and Mulvaney at the White House, things could be a bit easier, Weathers said.   HAPPY THURSDAY, JULY 27! Welcome to Morning Ag, where the news that former White House spokesman Sean Spicer is being eyed by producers for a spot on Dancing with the Stars is making the team nostalgic about our favorite farmer contestant, Texas Agriculture commissioner turned governor turned Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

SONNY IN A SEA OF BLUE: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has spent a lot of time touting the Future Farmers of America, hosting town halls with members and pointing out the navy-blue-jacket-clad youngsters in speeches and farm visits. Now the relationship is official. Perdue signed a memorandum of understanding between the USDA and FFA on Wednesday morning, agreeing to work to promote agricultural education and create internship opportunities and other resources to help young people develop careers in agriculture.   \u201cThe main objective is for USDA and National FFA to continue to have a dialogue on how we best build leaders and leadership programs, for how we prepare the next generation for careers in agriculture and agribusiness,\u201d FFA CEO Mark Poeschl told MA after the signing.   There is clear demand for assistance: A 2015 study from Purdue University and USDA estimated that for each year between that year and 2020, there would be an average of 58,000 skilled jobs available annually in agriculture \u2014 in areas like management, technology, sustainability and biomaterials development \u2014 but just 35,000 graduates qualified to fill them. \u201cWe need to and want to create an awareness among young people that while agriculture may not be as sexy as a Silicon Valley job, there are still a lot of opportunities available,\u201d Poeschl said.  The 800-acre gorilla in the room: The agreement surely could encourage some young people to fill high-skilled agricultural job openings, but it doesn\u2019t seem to do much to address the broader question of how to get young people into production agriculture. The average age of the American farmer is around 58 years-old, and more baby-boom-generation farmers retire with each harvest. FFA is an educational organization that works with middle- and high-school students on agriculture and leadership development, and under its charter it can\u2019t get involved in political issues and policymaking. As a result, it isn\u2019t involved in discussions on Capitol Hill about how to reduce burdens for people looking to get into farming \u2014 issues like access to land and capital for equipment, and student loan forgiveness for farm workers and managers.   The 2014 farm bill included money and technical assistance to help new and beginning farmers, but that has done little to encourage lenders or assist in land acquisition. Those are fixes, advocates say, that Congress will need to tackle next.  THE WOTUS AMONG US: EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will formally propose withdrawal of the Obama administration's controversial water rule today, marking the end of a yearslong effort by farm and other groups to scrap what they say is burdensome federal overreach. The proposed rule to withdraw the Waters of the U.S. rule, also called the Clean Water Rule, was unveiled in late June, but had yet to be noticed in the Federal Register, the formal step that triggers the beginning of the public comment period. The Trump administration has given the public 30 days to weigh in on the proposed rule, though critics of the repeal effort have called for more time.  A long way to December: The proposed rule would change little on the ground today, since the Obama administration's water rule only briefly went into effect before the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put it on hold nationwide. The repeal rule is seen as a safety net in case the Supreme Court determines the 6th Circuit didn't have authority over the case and the hold is lifted. The repeal rule would remove the Obama-era rule from the books and cement the status quo while the Trump administration works on its own regulation to define which streams and wetlands are subject to federal protection under the Clean Water Act \u2014 an effort it has said it plans to unveil in December. More details here.   CFTC NOMINEE EARNED THOUSANDS LOBBYING AGAINST CFTC: Dawn DeBerry Stump, one of the Republicans who President Donald Trump nominated for a CFTC commissioner post, earned almost $400,000 in the last year working for an industry association that has been critical of the agency\u2019s regulations. On Thursday, Stump and two other nominees to be commissioner of the U.S. derivatives regulator \u2014 Republican Brian Quintenz, a former asset manager, and Democrat Rostin Behnam, a staffer for Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow \u2014 will face their confirmation hearing before Senate Ag.   Stump is likely to face more attention than her fellow nominees. From January 2016 to May 2017, the Futures Industry Association paid her $198,902 in salary and bonuses, according to a financial disclosure form signed in May. Stump worked for FIA from 2012 to May 2016 as an executive. After she left, she made $197,586 lobbying at the firm she founded, Stump Strategic. FIA was her only client. She terminated the lobbying work in May. Stump declined to comment. More details on the nominees\u2019 financial disclosures here.   NCC HOPES TO GET POULTRY INTO CHINA SOON: The National Chicken Council is feeling optimistic about prospects for reopening China to U.S. poultry products after more than three dozen senators on Wednesday urged the Department of Agriculture to step up its efforts to get Beijing to lift its ban. \u201cWe are optimistic this will lead to the lifting of the ban in weeks, not months, and hopefully implementing regionalization soon after,\u201d Tom Super, a spokesman for NCC, tells MA.   In a letter to Secretary Perdue, the senators commended USDA for reopening the Chinese market to U.S. beef and urge that the same be done for U.S. poultry. China closed it market to U.S. poultry in 2015, citing concerns of highly pathogenic avian influenza that was detected in a wild duck. The letter, which was led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), notes that China has begun its animal health audit of the U.S. poultry industry \u2014 one of the crucial steps necessary for a resumption of U.S. imports.  CSPI RAILS AGAINST CLOVIS NOMINATION: Add the Center for Science in the Public Interest to the list of advocacy groups not pleased about Trump\u2019s nomination of Sam Clovis to be USDA\u2019s chief scientist.  \u201cSam Clovis has been a business school professor, a conservative talk radio host, an Air Force official, and, of course, a Trump campaign official. There are likely senior jobs in the administration that he would have been qualified to hold, but the job of USDA chief scientist is not one of them,\u201d Michael Jacobson, executive director of CSPI, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cHe should not have been nominated, and the law requires that he not be confirmed.\u201d  AG INDUSTRY URGES SWIFT ACTION ON NAFTA TO AVOID FURTHER HARM: Most members of the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday zeroed in on three issues related to the upcoming renegotiation of NAFTA, which starts August 16: expanding U.S. dairy exports to Canada and Mexico; balancing America\u2019s $5.3 billion produce trade deficit with Mexico; and ensuring NAFTA 2.0 is finalized as soon as possible \u2014 because the current political uncertainty has already hurt U.S. grain exports south of the border. Chairman Mike Conaway and Reps. Frank Lucas, Tom O\u2019Halleran and others emphasized the importance of wrapping up NAFTA 2.0 quickly, after officials from the U.S. grain industry testified that there\u2019s already been a 4-percent decline in sales of corn and 13 percent decline in sales of soybean meal to Mexico this year when compared with 2016.   Dairy dilemmas. Tom Vilsack, president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, fielded a deluge of questions about what he described as tactics used by the Canadian government to block U.S. dairy exports \u2014 most recently with the establishment of a pricing program for ultrafiltered milk (a key ingredient in cheese). Any renegotiation of NAFTA needs to ensure more predictability and transparency, as well as reduce tariffs on U.S. dairy exports, he said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.  But Canada is standing firmly in defense of both the Class 7 program for ultrafiltered milk and its supply management program, which sets production quotas and restricts imports to stabilize farmers\u2019 incomes. Canada argues these policies are not the cause of the U.S.\u2019s milk oversupply problem, and House Ag ranking member Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) predicted they could represent a potential rift in the coming talks, arguing the Canadians \u201care going to defend this no matter what.\u201d   IOWA FARMERS FLOOD INBOX OF WRITER WHO HIT BIOTECH MERGERS: It hadn\u2019t even been 36 hours and already more than 50 Iowa farmers had reached out to Austin Frerick to thank him. Frerick, who recently moved back to his home state after living in Washington, D.C., and working for the Treasury Department, had published an op-ed in the Des Moines Register last week that called for blocking the Monsanto-Bayer and Dow-DuPont mergers and breaking up other Big Ag corporations, to protect farmers from the potential combo of higher prices for seeds and pesticides and fewer alternatives that consolidation threatens to bring. Frerick\u2019s piece also criticized elected officials in Washington for not speaking up.   \u201cIt amazes me that no one has made a big deal about this wave of mega-mergers yet,\u201d Frerick told MA in an interview Wednesday. \u201cNo one is representing the actual farmer.\u201d  Frerick said that most of the e-mails he received from Iowa farmers were short thank-yous for raising a red flags on the issue when no one else has, including many industry groups that represent them. There also were expressions of frustration with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he said. Grassley has been one of the more outspoken critics of the proposed agrochemical mergers, sending letters to the Justice Department to press for strict scrutiny to ensure markets are competitive, and holding a hearing last year where top executives from Monsanto, Bayer, Dow, DuPont and Syngenta all testified. But during his more than 30-year tenure as Iowa\u2019s senator, consolidation in the agriculture industry has only increased, Frerick said.   Some groups are making a stink. That includes the National Farmers Union, Food and Water Watch and the American Antitrust Institute, which on Wednesday sent a 17-page joint letter to DOJ analyzing how the proposed mergers would consolidate power among three companies and likely harm competition \u2014 and farmers and consumers along with it.   MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 Federal prosecutors in California have subpoenaed Chipotle for information on a suspected norovirus outbreak at its Sterling, Va., outlet, as part of an ongoing probe into the wave of foodborne illnesses that befell the burrito chain in 2015, Reuters reports.   \u2014 The University of California is trying to convince a federal judge that the federal patent appeal board ignored key evidence that proves it should be granted the patent for the gene-editing technology CRISPR, Science Magazine reports.   \u2014 Agricultural equipment maker AGCO Corp. is planning to buy Monsanto\u2019s equipment business, Reuters reports.

aV \u000a            By CATHERINE BOUDREAU  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich, Jenny Hopkinson and Anthony Andragna  CLOVIS\u2019 PAST STANCE ON CROP INSURANCE SPARKS CRITICISM: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts put down a marker in what is expected to be a political battle to confirm Sam Clovis to a top USDA post. Although Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\u2019s confirmation hearing didn\u2019t feature any real dustups, Clovis\u2019 pursuit to be USDA undersecretary for research, education and economics has drawn rebuke.  Story Continued Below  Roberts, during a hearing Tuesday on risk management programs in the farm bill, said that any USDA nominee who regarded crop insurance as unconstitutional "might as well not show up" to a confirmation hearing. Roberts' comments came after concerns raised by ranking member Debbie Stabenow, who mentioned that a USDA nominee who has questioned the constitutionality of crop insurance would be coming before the committee. She didn\u2019t mention Clovis by name, but his reputation preceded him.  Have Clovis\u2019 views evolved? In a 2013 interview with an Iowa talk radio host \u2014 when Clovis ran unsuccessfully to replace retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) \u2014 he said crop insurance subsidies were federal spending that was unconstitutional. And in a 2014 interview with Iowa Public Radio, Clovis said: \u201c[M]ost of the Iowa farmers I talk to would just as soon have the government out of their lives and that includes the [crop] insurance program,\u201d adding that the government in some instances is supporting bad farming practices. His views resurfaced after POLITICO reported them in March, because he had since become a White House representative. But as recently as September, Clovis told reporters that crop insurance needs to be protected as a matter of national security.   Farm groups don\u2019t appear worried. Most major agricultural commodity groups cite crop insurance as one of the most important tools farmers have to manage risk, but they are still backing Clovis. In a letter this week to Roberts and Stabenow, they argue Clovis is qualified and will advocate for them.  He\u2019s officially the choice. President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Clovis earlier this month. It became official on Tuesday when the Senate Agriculture Committee received a formal notification from the White House.   HAPPY WEDNESDAY, JULY 26!

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wasn\u2019t shy about his frustration over the watering down of a provision he secured in a draft of the 2014 farm bill to cut off commodity subsidies to managers who aren\u2019t \u201cactively engaged\u201d in farming. Grassley had sought to limit to one the number of farm managers that a single operation could have, and cap their subsidies at $125,000. In the final version of the law, family farms (the majority of farm operations in the United States) were exempted from the new "actively engaged" requirements, which USDA finalized in 2015. Grassley has argued that this maintains a loophole allowing non-farming family members to receive subsidies.  \u201cPerhaps the most important thing I can do is explain why this issue is so important,\u201d Grassley said in a four-minute monologue during the Ag Committee hearing on Tuesday. \u201cGiving non-farmers subsidies is completely indefensible, especially when we have a $20 trillion debt. If bigger farmers are as efficient as they claim, they should not need unlimited subsidies to make their business model work.\u201d  Grassley added that he did not understand how the current $125,000-a-year cap on subsidies for a single farm operator (double that for married ones) wasn\u2019t enough to get a business through the year. \u201cWhat is the harm of supporting a policy that helps young and beginning farmers, gives us credibility against critics, and saves taxpayers money? Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m trying to help you, given the tight budget situation, as we try to help farmers that really are on the land doing the work,\u201d Grassley said to Roberts, who responded: \u201cMessage received.\u201d  McCONNELL GRACES AG HEARING WITH HIS PRESENCE: Also of note during Tuesday\u2019s hearing: A rare appearance by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He briefly stopped in at the nearly four-hour hearing to introduce a witness from his home state, Mark Haney, president of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Federation. Roberts capitalized on McConnell\u2019s presence, urging him to bring the next iteration of the farm bill to the Senate floor this year, if the Agriculture Committee can deliver. It\u2019s a rather optimistic view considering all the political nominees senators need to vote on, not to mention the ongoing debate over a new health care law. \u201cThe sooner the better,\u201d McConnell told Roberts.  REPORT: RURAL WATER SYSTEMS HAVE HIGH NITRATE LEVELS: A new report from the Environmental Working Group looked at the 30 utilities with the distinction of having the highest nitrate contamination in tests between 2010 and 2015. All 30 exceeded the legal limit. And all 30 served small populations in rural, farm-based economies.   Nitrate in drinking water often stems from nitrogen runoff from fertilized fields. A larger system, like the Des Moines Water Works, has about half a million ratepayers to defray the costs to remove nitrates. But the largest one of the 30 that registered high levels served just 1,650 people. Many of the problematic ones are in rural western Texas, agricultural areas in California, and other farm-heavy communities.  EWG wants Congress to help those communities avoid having too much nitrate in their water in the first place. The report reviewed water data from roughly 50,000 utilities across the country.  VILSACK TALKS NAFTA IN FIRST HILL APPEARANCE SINCE LEAVING USDA: Tom Vilsack, president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, will discuss trade issues between the U.S. and Canada during a House Agriculture Committee hearing on NAFTA this morning. It is to be Vilsack\u2019s first testimony before Congress since leaving his post as agriculture secretary. In his new role, Vilsack has repeatedly called for Canada to further open up its dairy sector. Canada has a supply management program that stabilizes incomes for its farmers by setting production limits and restricting imports. Other U.S. agricultural sectors that will be represented at the hearing today include beef, grains, poultry and eggs, and Florida fruit and vegetables. Watch the hearing live starting at 10 a.m. here.  WILDLIFE BILL SET FOR EPW VOTE: Senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee are expected today to clear legislation (S. 1514) to reauthorize through 2023 a number of popular conservation programs, including the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and Chesapeake Bay Program. \u201cThis bill is another example of how we can all work together, both Democrat and Republican, to help protect the environment and grow our economy,\u201d Chairman John Barrasso said at a hearing. While provisions in the package blocking Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in the Wyoming and Great Lakes region have drawn criticism from some Democrats, it\u2019s expected to clear the panel at a business meeting.  PERRY GETS TROLLED: The Energy Department has confirmed that Russian pranksters successfully got a 20-minute conversation with Secretary Rick Perry last week, Pro Energy\u2019s Darius Dixon reports. The trickery happened on July 19, but was only reported in a story on Tuesday in the Pravda Report, a Russian publication. (Cue the audio). Perry thought he was speaking with an Ukrainian official on behalf of Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. Topics discussed included the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline and the possibility of a biofuel devised from home-brewed alcohol and manure.  RURAL TASK FORCE DOES ROUND TWO: Perdue on Tuesday morning hosted a second meeting with the principals of the Agriculture and Rural Prosperity Task Force, a group charged with "promoting agriculture and rural prosperity in America." It is supposed to come up with policy recommendations within 180 days. The group is planning to send a final report to the White House by late October, the USDA said. Those in attendance on Tuesday included Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, the department said.  PERDUE MAKES NEWS AT FUTURE FARMER BREAKFAST: Perdue today will announce an agreement with the Future Farmers of America to support young farmers and prepare the future agriculture workforce. More than 100 FFA members from across the country are in Washington to chat with lawmakers about supporting technical education and programs for new and beginning farmers. The announcement will be livestreamed here.   Texas tour. Perdue also plans to travel to San Angelo, Texas, next week to attend the House Agriculture Committee\u2019s second field hearing on the farm bill, Chairman Mike Conaway announced Tuesday.

PHILLY SODA TAX REVENUE SLIGHTLY BELOW PROJECTION: The Philadelphia soda tax has brought in just under $39.7 million, preliminary estimates for fiscal year 2017 indicate, with the most money per month coming in June, the end of the city\u2019s fiscal year. The figure is short of the $46 million that the mayor\u2019s office had predicted. More from the Philadelphia Business Journal here.   GMA, FOOD POLICY ACTION TEAM UP ON FOOD WASTE SURVEY: A new survey by strange bedfellows \u2014 the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Policy Action Network \u2014 has found that nearly 60 percent of Americans have been confounded at home about what to make of date labels on food packages. About 40 percent said they\u2019ve had disagreements in their households about whether food should be kept or tossed by the date listed.   \u201cClarity on product date labeling will reduce confusion, cut food waste, and enable households to spend their time arguing about something other than what a date label means, like sports, politics, or what channel to watch on TV,\u201d said Meghan Stasz, GMA\u2019s senior director of sustainability.  The poll, conducted by Lake Research Partners, included more than 1,000 adults of various ages and political persuasions. The research comes after GMA and the Food Marketing Institute this year agreed to work together on standardizing date labels \u2014 which run the gamut from \u201cbest by\u201d to \u201cuse by,\u201d and \u201csell by\u201d and don\u2019t always mean the same thing.   WALMART, FFAR DISH OUT FUNDS TO REDUCE FOOD WASTE: The World Wildlife Fund has received a $1.3 million grant from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and the Walmart Foundation to identify ways for farmers to increase the proportion of crops that are harvested and delivered. The intent is to prevent food from going to waste in the field. Researchers will look at maximizing the harvest of specialty crops and developing data on post harvest losses, among other things. The groups will announce the grant today.  MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 DuPont CEO Ed Breen said the company is on track to close its merger with Dow Chemical Co. next month, Bloomberg reports. The company also said it had an 11 percent increase in farm-related earnings during the second quarter.  \u2014 Tests found traces of glyphosate in Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, The New York Times reports.   \u2014 Europe's largest farm lobby is urging the government to fight U.S. plans to impose anti-dumping measures against Spanish olive imports, POLITICO Europe\u2019s Emmet Livingstone reports.   \u2014 Brazil\u2019s federal food safety inspectors resumed their protest this week over what they say is a lack of employees to ensure the safety of the meat supply, Reuters reports.  \u2014 One of the founders of the food-delivery startup Blue Apron is stepping down from leadership a month after the company went public, The Wall Street Journal reports.

aV \u000a            By HELENA BOTTEMILLER EVICH  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Anthony Andragna, Catherine Boudreau and Jenny Hopkinson   HOW CLOVIS IS WINNING OVER HIS CRITICS: If you have been reading the headlines about Sam Clovis\u2019s lack of hard science experience and skeptical climate change views, you might think that his expected nomination to be chief USDA scientist was in jeopardy. But behind the scenes, Clovis has been winning over many ag folks, inside and outside the department.   Story Continued Below  At least that\u2019s what yours truly found after digging into Clovis\u2019s background over the past couple of days. He is among the most controversial subcabinet picks, largely because he lacks the credentials for the position laid out in federal law. He is also on the record questioning the scientific consensus on climate change.  But Clovis has political connections on his side. Even as the former professor\u2019s credentials have publicly drawn fire, he\u2019s been quietly winning over rank-and-file at the USDA. Unlike the chaos at the EPA after President Donald Trump picked Scott Pruitt to lead the agency, the USDA has been relatively even-keeled. Clovis has proven himself to be a steady hand and impressed career staff. Even some of his critics privately acknowledge that tanking his nomination could yield a pick whom they would view as much worse.  Trump whisperer? It was widely reported that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped make the case for not pulling out of NAFTA by bringing a map to the Oval Office to illustrate precisely where the pain would be felt by such a drastic move. Guess who suggested he bring the map? Clovis.   Clovis, an Iowa Republican, is now known within the USDA as having a direct line to the president, a level of access far above that which is usually enjoyed by the USDA\u2019s head of research. That close rapport is not lost on agricultural groups. On Monday, nearly two dozen leading farm groups \u2014 including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association \u2014 signed a letter urging the Senate Agriculture Committee to move swiftly on his nomination. Don\u2019t miss the full story on Clovis here.  HAPPY TUESDAY, JULY 25! Welcome to Morning Ag, where we your host could not be more excited to be heading to the Pacific Northwest on Friday. Oh summer weather sans humidity, I\u2019ve missed you so much! You know the deal: Thoughts, news, tips? Send them to hbottemiller@politico.com and @hbottemiller. Follow the whole team at @Morning_Ag.  DEMS PLEDGE CRACKDOWN ON CORPORATE MONOPOLIES: Democrats trekked on Monday to the small town of Berryville, Va., to unveil their new populist economic agenda packaged under the slogan \u201cA Better Deal.\u201d It\u2019s aimed at improving their chances of winning over voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Within the party\u2019s plan is a pledge to crack down on corporate monopolies, including those in the agriculture and food and beverage industries.  The pending mergers among six agrochemical companies \u2014 Dow with DuPont, Monsanto with Bayer AG and Syngenta with ChemChina \u2014 were cited as examples of the trend in concentration of power. Consolidation in the agriculture industry will hurt family operations that will have to pay more for seeds and pesticides, as well as consumers paying higher food prices, the platform says. The beer industry was also targeted, as Dems noted that Anheuser-Busch InBev's purchase of SABMiller last year led to plans for job cuts.  NFU URGES \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE ON ACA REPEAL AND REPLACE: The National Farmers Union on Monday called on Senate lawmakers to drop their effort to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act.  \u201cThe cost of health care has long been a primary concern of farmers and ranchers,\u201d NFU President Roger Johnson wrote in a letter. \u201cWhile there is certainly room for improvements to current policy, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) and the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act both ignore the needs of family farmers and ranchers. NFU urges you to vote no on either piece of legislation and to seek a common sense, bipartisan solution to improve our nation\u2019s health care system.\u201d The BCRA would leave many rural marketplaces without a single insurer, NFU argued. \u201cWorse yet, completely repealing the ACA would leave nearly three-quarters of the population without a single insurer in the non-group market,\u201d Johnson said.   Reality check: Any way you slice it, the rural health insurance market is lacking in competition. Roughly 41 percent of rural Americans have only one plan to choose from on the exchange. Nearly 32 percent of counties, many of them rural, only have only one provider offered. It doesn\u2019t take an economist to understand that less competition means higher prices. Pros can brush up on farmers\u2019 concerns on health care from yours truly here.   BYE-BYE RECESS?  House members and staffers, don\u2019t pack your bags just yet. House Republican appropriators are pressing Speaker Paul Ryan to cancel the first week of recess and tackle the extensive spending package full of goodies for the base.   Under the urging of financial services subcommittee chairman Tom Graves (R-Ga.), a few appropriators are urging the leadership to reconsider a $1 trillion spending bill before leaving for summer break. They were furious when the leadership decided last week to only pursue a smaller, scaled back version for national security priorities. The full story from Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan is here.   Late Monday night, another lawmaker, Rep. Mark Walker, started an effort to force a vote on all 12 spending bills by hijacking the slimmer package scheduled to hit the House floor this week. Pros can read about that here.   What that means for ag: The fiscal 2018 agriculture spending bill gives the USDA and the FDA more money than Trump\u2019s budget sought, so if the full House approves the bill before recess, it increases the likelihood that it will become the law of the land. It\u2019s still not clear what the Senate\u2019s timeline is, but aggies will certainly be watching closely. Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran and ranking member Patrick Leahy worked out a provision in the Senate bill to give $1 billion in support over 10 years \u2014 to be split evenly between the cotton and dairy sectors.  MEADOWS REITERATES SUPPORT FOR WORK REQUIREMENTS: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the ringleader of the House Freedom Caucus, doubled down on Monday on his tribe\u2019s insistence for stricter work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (known as ABAWDs) for them to receive SNAP benefits.   \u201cWe believe there should be a work requirement for able-bodied adults with non-dependent children,\u201d Meadows said, when asked about SNAP cuts at a National Press Club luncheon. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put the value back in work once again. It\u2019s not fair to the American taxpayer for us to continue to give benefits if someone could work.\u201d  He noted the Freedom Caucus had taken a strong position on work requirements, but added that he was thinking beyond that: \u201cWe think we can find some common ground on the other part of the safety net.\u201d  Farm bill love? Meadows was a bit softer in his stance on the farm bill. He noted that he voted for the last iteration because agriculture is a major driver of the economy in his North Carolina district. \u201cAre there some good things in the farm bill? Yes. The less government involvement that we have generally the better off we are,\u201d he said.   FIRST STEP TOWARD CLIMATE \u2018RED TEAM\u2019? The Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Myron Ebell says EPA might tap Steven Koonin, undersecretary for science at the DOE from 2009 to 2011, to run its "red team" review of climate science, Pro\u2019s Alex Guilln reports. Koonin, who wrote in 2014 that the science behind climate change \u201cis not settled.\u201d He floated the formation of a red team in a Wall Street Journal piece in April, arguing that such a review "would shine much-needed light on the scientific debates" surrounding the issue.  UDALL, BLUMENTHAL CALL FOR CHLORPYRIFOS BAN: Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) will introduce a bill today to ban the use of the pesticide of chlorpyrifos \u2014 a move that follows a court order last week that kept in place the EPA\u2019s March decision not to pull the chemical from the market. Chlorpyrifos is a widely used agricultural pesticide, but has been linked to neurological problems in children in some cases, as well as to other health risks. The EPA under President Obama was on track to ban the chemical for agricultural uses, a move called for in a petition from environmentalists. However, the Trump administration has denied the petition, arguing that it needs more time to study the health risks of the chemical. EPA says it will make a decision by 2022 on whether to keep the pesticide on the market.  Udall and Blumenthal will layout their bill in a press conference Tuesday, according to a notice from their offices.   ANOTHER PANEL WADES INTO BIOFUELS DEBATE: Two House Science subpanels will dip their toes into the debate over biofuels policy. A hearing at 10 a.m. will \u201cexamine federal funding of biofuels projects and how it affects the private market.\u201d Witnesses include representatives from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and University of Michigan\u2019s Energy Institute, as well Growth Energy\u2019s CEO Emily Skor and the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nicolas Loris. More info here.  AG SHAREHOLDER RETURNS TANK: The agribusiness sector is returning a whole lot less to its investors than in years past, according to a new study by the consulting firm Boston Consulting Group. The report looked at 40 of the top agribusiness companies from 2012 to 2016. It found that the industry\u2019s shareholder returns were among the lowest of the 34 sectors that the firm examined. Only oil and mining ranked lower. This was not always so, the report says. Between 2007 and 2011, the agribusiness sector was the best-performing industry in the ranking. Find the report here.   USDA BUMPS UP SUGAR QUOTA: The Agriculture Department said Monday that it would allow more imported raw cane sugar this fiscal year to meet domestic demand by increasing the tariff-rate quota by 244,690 metric tons.The USDA, in a Federal Register notice Monday, said that with the increase, the overall fiscal 2017 raw sugar TRQ would be 1.36 million metric tons."This action is being taken after a determination that additional supplies of raw cane sugar are required in the U.S. market," the department said.  FOOD POLICY ACTION NAMES MILLS AS NEW HEAD: Food Policy Action has named Monica Mills as the organization\u2019s new executive director. Mills, formerly director of government relations at the anti-hunger group Bread for the World, has previously been named a top grassroots lobbyist in Washington. Tom Colicchio, FPA co-founder and celebrity chef, praised the selection by saying: \u201cThis is a pivotal time for our food movement, and we are confident that Monica can build on FPA\u2019s historic successes and best prepare the organization to meet the enormous challenges ahead to protect and improve our nation\u2019s food and agriculture system.\u201d   MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker and other lawmakers in the Congressional Black Caucus are planning to push for greater scrutiny over Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, Recode reports.   \u2014 The Senate confirmed former lobbyist Dave Bernhardt to the Interior Department's No. 2 spot, Pro Energy\u2019s Ben Lefebvre reports.  \u2014 Heinz is in court in Australia over the sugar content of some of its toddler foods, BBC reports.   \u2014 Inadequate funding for food safety oversight of imports is putting people at risk, Bill Marler argues over at The Hill.

aV \u000a            By JENNY HOPKINSON  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Catherine Boudreau, Luis Sanchez, Doug Palmer and Helena Bottemiller Evich   AG GROUPS RALLYING AROUND CLOVIS: Look for at least a dozen leading agriculture groups to go on the record today in support of Sam Clovis, President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial pick for USDA undersecretary for research, education and economics. The groups are expected to send a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee leaders today that outlines why they think Clovis, a climate skeptic who does not have a background in agricultural science, is a good choice to be USDA\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cThose researchers don\u2019t need a peer, they need an advocate,\u201d said Chuck Conner, president and CEO of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, who organized the letter.   Story Continued Below  Clovis and his critics: Conner and others MA has spoken to recently also contend that Clovis has started winning over critics inside and outside the department. \u201cTheir first instinct, given his background, was to not like this guy,\u201d Conner said, referring to rank-and-file USDA officials. \u201cBut he\u2019s won them over in a big way.\u201d Stay tuned later today for more on Clovis and the coming battle over his nomination.   HAPPY MONDAY, JULY 24! Welcome to Morning Ag, where we are reading about scientists rushing to get on the campaign trail, Cubans hoping President Trump won\u2019t follow through with his plans to reverse recent improvements in relations, and about Jay Leno\u2019s ride in a hemp car as we ease back into the work week. You know the deal: Thoughts, news, tips? Send them to jhopkinson@politico.com and @jennyhops. Follow the whole team at @Morning_Ag.  THIS WEEK: HOME STRETCH FOR THE HOUSE: House lawmakers are in their final week before August recess, and the Agriculture Committee is making its preparations for next month\u2019s start of the NAFTA 2.0 talks before it leaves. Chairman Mike Conaway will use a hearing on Wednesday to highlight the needs of farmers in the upcoming renegotiation. Farmers are worried that efforts to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. \u2014 something Trump has long promised to do \u2014 could hurt provisions of the deal that have made it so successful for agriculture. The witness list has yet to be announced, but some grain and corn growers are likely to want to deliver their message directly to lawmakers. Details for the hearing are here.   Also happening this week:  The gang\u2019s all here: The Senate Agriculture Committee will meet Tuesday morning to hear from 17 farmers and farm group representatives, to get their take on existing risk management tools as lawmakers prepare to craft the 2018 farm bill. Yes, you read that right: There will be 17 witnesses! Some time will be devoted to discussion of farmers\u2019 access to credit, a big talking point for groups like the National Farmers Union and advocates for young farmers, both of which are expected to have representatives testify. The proceedings will also likely include calls to make sure the farm bill doesn\u2019t include cuts to crop insurance. Details.  Achin\u2019 for some bacon? National Pork Producers Council CEO Neil Dierks is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about state rules that affect entities outside of their borders. Also due to testify are representatives from Taxpayers for Common Sense and the National Conference of State Legislators. Details.   While we wait for USDA nominees to get their Senate spotlight: The Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday will hold a confirmation hearing for three nominees to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: Rostin Behnam, Brian Quintenz and Dawn DeBerry Stump. Quintenz, in particular, is no stranger to the committee; the hedge fund manager was nominated for the same job by former President Barack Obama in March 2016. Quintenz won bipartisan support from Senate Ag, but did not get a full Senate vote before the election, and his nomination withered on the vine. Trump nominated him anew in May. Details.  The hearing is a key step toward filling out the agency\u2019s leadership, which today consists of acting Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and Commissioner Sharon Bowen, who has announced plans to step down. Giancarlo has received Senate Ag\u2019s signoff but is awaiting the floor vote that will make him the CFTC\u2019s confirmed head.  Farm Credit leaders climb the Hill: More than 600 members of the Farm Credit Council \u2014 the organization that represents the agricultural banking network\u2019s interests in Washington \u2014 will be on Capitol Hill for two days, beginning Tuesday. Farm Credit System leaders plan to talk with lawmakers about their priorities for the 2018 farm bill and to advocate for increasing the USDA Farm Service Agency\u2019s $1.39 million limit on guaranteed loans. Members also want to ensure that funding for all FSA loan programs, both guaranteed and direct, remains at the same levels in fiscal 2018 as in the previous fiscal year.   SONNY GOES TO DELAWARE: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is headed to the Delaware State Fair today to spend some time with Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons, and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, as well as state officials and farmers. Agriculture is the top industry in Delaware, contributing about $8 billion to the economy. Corn, soybeans, poultry and apples are the state\u2019s big crops. The state fair, in Harrington, is in its 98th year, and promises visitors a chance to hold a chick, drink Cheerwine and watch an extreme pogo stick demonstration. Details.   Scuse (is still) on the loose: Perdue will get a tour of the fair from Delaware Agriculture Secretary Michael Scuse, who was USDA\u2019s acting deputy for most of 2016 after several years as undersecretary for farm and foreign agriculture services.   IN DEFENSE OF POLLINATORS: A slew of food safety and environmental groups will demonstrate outside EPA headquarters today to voice support for a ban on all neonicotinoid pesticides \u2014 chemicals the groups believe are causing declines in pollinator populations. Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice, Environment America and SumOfUs will also deliver what organizers said are thousands of letters to EPA from members of the public who back a ban. The event begin at 11 a.m.  SENATE APPROPRIATORS CALL FOR CONSERVATION DEPUTY: The Senate Appropriations Committee, in non-binding report language that was published Friday to accompany its fiscal 2018 agriculture spending bill, encouraged USDA to appoint a deputy undersecretary for conservation. The position would be second in command to the newly created post of undersecretary for farm production and conservation, which Secretary Perdue established as a part of a broader reorganization earlier this year. The undersecretary oversees three agencies: the Farm Service Agency, the Risk Management Agency and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.   Senate appropriators said they recognize that \u201cbetter coordination and data sharing between the three agencies can limit inefficiencies, improve conservation outcomes and enhance USDA\u2019s ability to serve its customers.\u201d A deputy undersecretary for conservation could facilitate those efforts and help ensure that each agency is supporting farmers\u2019 conservation objectives. The committee advanced the ag spending bill last week; the measure would allocate $20.5 billion in discretionary funding for USDA and FDA combined.  Additional committee recommendations on global food production, antibiotic research: Senate appropriators also said there needs to be an integrated approach at the federal level to address the food security and nutrition challenge of feeding more than 9 billion people around the world by 2050. Lawmakers urged the agriculture secretary to \u201ctake a leadership role\u201d in working with other federal agencies to meet that challenge and to \u201calign domestic and global programs related to food production.\u201d   The report language also said appropriators \u201cstrongly support\u201d research to develop alternatives to antibiotics used in animal production, and encouraged the USDA Agriculture Research Service to look into the role of \u201cnutritional alternatives/feed additives containing bioactives and prebiotics\u201d that may to lead reduced antibiotic use. Lawmakers requested a report on this effort as part of the department's fiscal 2019 budget.   Senate appropriators also want to be updated on imports of beef from Brazil after the scandal over federal food safety inspectors in that country taking bribes and allowing expired and unsanitary meat to be sold. (The U.S. banned all imports last month). Within 60 days of Congress enacting the ag spending bill, the agriculture secretary must send a report to Congress on any on-site trips USDA officials have taken to Brazil since March 18. The secretary must also notify lawmakers of when the next audit of the Brazilian meat inspection system will be conducted and provide results of the re-inspection system that Secretary Perdue implemented.  BILL INTRODUCED TO BOOST NUTRITION ED: Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) late last week re-introduced a bill to promote nutrition education as a way to help combat the nation\u2019s crippling childhood obesity epidemic. The Nutrition Education Act would require schools participating in the National School Lunch Program to include 50 hours of nutrition education each year.  \u201cNearly one in three children is overweight or obese. This bill is an important step in ensuring our children are getting the health education they need to live healthier, longer lives,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cIn addition, obesity and associated health problems take a toll on the nation\u2019s economy. Childhood obesity alone costs an estimated $14 billion annually in direct health expenses.\u201d More.   DOW\u2019S CHINA BIOTECH BLUES: As part of the Trump administration\u2019s 100-day plan to expand trade with China, the government of President Xi Jinping committed that it\u2019s National Biosafety Committee would hold a meeting by the end of May 2017 \u201cto conduct science-based evaluations of all eight pending U.S. biotechnology product applications to assess the safety of the products for their intended use.\u201d That wording suggested an agreement between the U.S. and China on the eight biotechnology products in question, even if it did not promise all eight would be approved by the end of the 100 days, which fell on July 16. But now it seems the U.S. and China may have been talking about two different groups of eight.   Dow AgroSciences said it previously understood that its \u201cEnlist\u201d variety of soybean was one of the eight pending biotechnology traits referenced under the 100-day plan. So, it was surprised when China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture recently told the company that the herbicide-tolerant variety is not actually one of the eight products targeted for potential approval under the program. \u201cWe are seeking to clarify MOA\u2019s position related to Enlist soybeans,\u201d Dow said in a press release. \u201cWe will continue to work cooperatively with MOA to ensure this much-needed new technology will soon be available to farmers located in the U.S. and throughout the Americas.\u201d  The waiting list: China has approved four biotech varieties since the May 11 announcement of deliverables from the 100-day plan. One of those was Dow\u2019s Enlist corn. China also approved Monsanto's Vistive Gold soybean and its 87427 glyphosate-resistant corn, which is sold under the Roundup Ready brand, as well as Syngenta's 5307 insect-resistant corn, which is sold under the Agrisure Duracade brand.  MA\u2019S INSTANT OATS:  \u2014 Nutrition science drives everyone crazy not because it\u2019s fundamentally broken, but because it\u2019s really hard. The Washington Post explains.   \u2014 NPR goes behind the scenes to explore what it\u2019s like to work in a prison-run goat dairy. Read that here.   \u2014 University of Florida researchers are warning that recent weather fluctuations that have affected the state\u2019s strawberry crop are a harbinger of what climate change will do to all of the state\u2019s farms, the Tampa Bay Times reports.   \u2014 A class-action suit against Monsanto over dicamba-damaged crops alleges that company sales staff condoned use of older forms of the chemical on its new GMO crops, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.   \u2014 Sen. Luther Strange is hoping that a focus on the farm bill will convince voters to keep him in office, AL.com reports.  THAT\u2019S ALL FOR MA! See you again soon!

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Cory Bennett, Eric Geller and Martin Matishak   WHITE HOUSE CYBER SHAKEUP \u2014 Changeover on the National Security Council\u2019s cybersecurity team could disrupt work on President Donald Trump\u2019s cyber executive order, and all eyes are on cyber coordinator Rob Joyce to see how he manages the transition. Cheryl Davis, Daniel Melleby, and Heather King left the NSC cyber directorate in July, and Monica Maher is set to leave at the end of August, as Eric first reported on Thursday. King was filling in as one of two senior directors for cyber policy, while the other three were directors. A source familiar with the situation told Eric that at least two new people will be brought on to fill the gaps. The NSC cyber team has many responsibilities, but lately it has focused on overseeing the bevvy of reports from agencies that are spelled out in Trump\u2019s executive order. As those are submitted, the team will convene interagency meetings to distill the key takeaways and present policy options to senior officials.  Story Continued Below  Michael Daniel, who was former President Barack Obama\u2019s cyber coordinator, said he expected the departures to cause a short-term disruption in the NSC\u2019s work. \u201cWhen you have that much turnover in a short period of time, it inevitably affects your ability to operate,\u201d Daniel told MC in an email. \u201cYou lose people who know how to make the process work, the personal contacts at the agencies, and the perspective that comes with serving on the NSC.\u201d The fact that the departures came around the same time \u201cwill cause some temporary problems,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I expect Rob will be able to manage through it.\u201d  \u201cIt is a big loss for the NSC, administration and country,\u201d Ben Flatgard, who was an NSC director for cyber policy until January, told MC. \u201cWe're in a much better place as a nation because of their ideas, leadership and persistence.\u201d Andrew Grotto, who served as a senior director for cyber policy at the NSC until May, told MC that the impact might be felt in the \u201cquality of the work,\u201d because \u201cthe agencies won't lean in the way we want them to without [White House] leadership.\u201d NSC staffers, he said, are \u201ca vital conduit to the senior working experts doing the key work at the agencies.\u201d If the handoff to their replacements is not smooth, he said, there could be a \u201creal execution risk\u201d for the executive order.  Former officials noted that the four staffers\u2019 departures were expected, given the longevity of their service. Most NSC postings last only one or two years, and King had been working there since 2013, while the others joined in 2015 and 2016. \u201cIt's good to have some churn on the NSC staff as new people can come in with new ideas and energy to lead the interagency forward,\u201d said Flatgard, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. Grotto, now a fellow at Stanford University, said he had confidence in Joyce \u2014 who he called \u201can experienced manager, with obvious depth in the substance\u201d \u2014 to serve as a steady hand. Joyce previously led the National Security Agency\u2019s elite hacking unit.  HAPPY FRIDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

WAGONS CIRCLED AROUND MUELLER \u2014 Senators are preemptively coming to the defense of special counsel Robert Mueller just as the former FBI is taking a step to accelerate his investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign.  Two pairs of bipartisan senators on Thursday proposed legislation that would protect special counsel Robert Mueller from potentially being fired by President Donald Trump. Together, the bills represent a warning shot for the president, who has expressed disdain for Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.   One measure, introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee members Thom Tillis and Chris Coons, would let Mueller challenge his firing to a panel of three federal judges after getting axed. The second proposal, from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Cory Booker, would force the Justice Department officials tasked with firing Mueller to first explain their rationale to the panel of judges. "Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong," Graham told reporters last week. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Flake suggested that Congress could hire Mueller if he\u2019s canned by the president. "I think that if he were to be removed, however it's done by the assistant attorney general or a new one, Congress would assert its prerogatives," Flake, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told MSNBC. "That would mean hiring a special prosecutor, and that might even be Bob Mueller."   The legislation dropped shortly before it was revealed that Mueller had impaneled a Washington grand jury for his Russia investigation, which our POLITICO colleague Darren Samuelsohn reported was \u201ca key procedural step.\u201d Mueller is expected to use the closed-door panel \u201cto present evidence and issue subpoenas as part of his expanding probe,\u201d Darren reported. And the investigation has been exploring financial ties, according to CNN.  WHITE HOUSE BIGFOOTING DHS ON CYBER? \u2014 The New York Times has some interesting details about what went down during the global ransomware outbreak earlier this year, in a story about new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who was at the time head of Homeland Security. "Mr. Kelly objected strenuously to the decision by Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser in the White House, to take control of the response to a global cyberattack \u2014 a role traditionally played by Mr. Kelly and his department\u2019s cybersecurity division."  MUCH TO LEARN, YOU STILL HAVE \u2014 Universities, business groups and research organizations are sharing their thoughts on expanding and improving America\u2019s cyber workforce in comments sent to the technical standards agency NIST. Trump\u2019s cyber executive order tasked the Commerce Department with preparing a report on cyber education and training strategies, and NIST issued a request for comment to solicit feedback. The agency posted the submissions after the comment period closed on Wednesday. The technology trade group CompTIA stressed the need for \u201clow-cost cloud-based cybersecurity training and assessment tools\u201d to reach workers who can\u2019t take traditional certification courses. \u201cImprovements are needed for the effectiveness and scalability of cybersecurity education,\u201d CompTIA wrote. \u201cScalability can be met through cloud-based cybersecurity training, but a problem exists. At this point in time, cloud-based solutions tend to be expensive.\u201d  The SANS Institute, a private training organization, highlighted the importance of \u201chands-on experience, not just classroom instruction of hypothetical situations.\u201d It was important, SANS said, to use a variety of educational approaches, \u201csince some concepts are regrettably dry and are unlikely to normally generate much interest or excitement from students.\u201d And the University of Texas at San Antonio, \u2014 which the NSA has designated as a \u201cNational Center of Academic Excellence\u201d \u2014 said NSA and National Science Foundation scholarship programs were crucial to growing the workforce. The scholarships have \u201chelped to introduce individuals who may not have previously considered a career in the security field to the many rewarding jobs that exist,\u201d the university wrote.   POSITIONS FILLED \u2014 The Senate on Thursday confirmed dozens of Trump administration nominees, including several who will be involved in cybersecurity policy. The confirmed picks include Susan Gordon, Trump\u2019s selection for principal deputy director of national intelligence. For the Department of Homeland Security, the Senate confirmed David Glawe as undersecretary for intelligence and analysis and Claire Grady as undersecretary for management. The Senate also confirmed a number of overseas-oriented nominees, including Kay Bailey Hutchison as U.S. representative to NATO and Nathan Sales to be the State Department\u2019s coordinator for counterterrorism.  BOBBY DIGITAL \u2014 The Senate on Thursday also passed a bill that would order a federal working group to study the security of internet-connected devices. Under the legislation (S. 88), known as the DIGIT Act, the working group would make recommendations to Congress after examining what the federal government could do to \u201cenhance the resiliency of Federal systems against cyber threats to the Internet of Things.\u201d The overall goal of the bill, sponsored by Sens. Deb Fischer, Cory Booker, Cory Gardner and Brian Schatz, is to foster innovation and collaboration between the private sector and industry on internet-connected devices. Another bipartisan group of senators this week also introduced legislation aimed at securing such devices.  OPM GETS A CHECK, NO CHECK-PLUS \u2014 The Office of Personnel Management has more digital cleanup work to do, despite the bevy of digital reforms the agency has made since the data breach that exposed over 20 million sensitive government background files, concluded a new government watchdog report. While OPM has enacted 11 of the recommendations the Homeland Security Department made in the wake of the unprecedented intrusion and has worked to implement eight more, the agency is falling short on four of them, the Government Accountability Office found in a report issued on Thursday. \u201cGenerally, the recommendations pertained to strengthening activities and controls related to passwords, access permissions, patches, audit and monitoring, among other things,\u201d the examination states. Auditors submitted an accompanying report about the sensitive topics to Congress. "Until OPM completes implementation of government-wide requirements, its systems are at greater risk than they need be," GAO officials wrote in the report.  OPERATION DUMBO DROP \u2014 WikiLeaks released another batch of documents Thursday that appear to illuminate the CIA\u2019s hacking tools, with the latest dunno revealing a method of hacking into security cameras and turning them off, code-named Dumbo. \u201cDumbo can identify, control and manipulate monitoring and detection systems on a target computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system,\u201d according to WikiLeaks\u2019 summary of the 2012 and 2015 documents. The idea is to protect CIA personnel who have to physically access a location. The hack requires a USB stick to activate.  RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 \u201cA 23-year-old British cybersecurity researcher who helped stop a recent global malware outbreak has been arrested for allegedly creating a different piece of notorious malware.\u201d \u2026 Trump blamed Congress for an \u201call-time\u201d and \u201cvery dangerous low\u201d state of U.S. relations with Russia. \u2026 A Russian botnet operator received a 46-month prison sentence. \u2026 \u201cSen.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak   WHAT\u2019S THAT, NOW? \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s statement on his signing of Russian sanctions legislation went further than anything the president has personally said aloud about the Kremlin\u2019s digital meddling in the 2016 election. In the statement, released after Trump signed the bill (H.R. 3364 (115)) into law on Wednesday, the president said he supported \u201cmaking clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process, and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization.\u201d At the White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the statement was consistent with Trump\u2019s previous comments on 2016 meddling \u2014 that he thinks other countries \u201cmay have been involved as well, but he doesn't dispute the fact that Russia was.\u201d But even in recent months, Trump has cast doubt on the situation, accusing Democrats of creating a \u201cscam\u201d and \u201cHOAX!\u201d around the alleged Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee.   Story Continued Below  WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF TRUMP AND RUSSIA \u2014 In a new Quinnipiac University Poll out Wednesday, 30 percent of U.S. voters said they believe Trump did something illegal with Russia during the 2016 elections, and another 30 percent believe he did something unethical but not illegal. Another group, 32 percent, believes he did nothing wrong. Among the same group of voters, 58 percent believe Trump has tried to \u201cderail or obstruct\u201d the investigation into Russia\u2019s election-year meddling and possible collusion with the Trump camp. And 63 percent believe Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. The numbers skew heavily by party lines. For instance, 88 percent of Democrats believe Trump behaved illegally or unethically, while 70 percent of Republicans say he did neither. Overall, Trump\u2019s approval ratings hit new lows in the survey.   HAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST \u2014 Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Office of Personnel Management, George Nesterczuk, withdrew from consideration for the post, the White House announced. \u201cI have decided to withdraw because the prospect of my favorable confirmation has grown remote,\u201d Nesterczuk wrote in a letter to Trump, first reported by GovExec. \u201cRecent partisan attacks threaten to delay further the consideration of my nomination. These attacks are intended to prevent me, or anyone, from carrying out government reforms that the American people and you, Mr. President, are rightly demanding.\u201d   HOYER: HANDS OFF ELECTION COMMISSION \u2014 The No. 2 Democrat in the House is warning his Republican colleagues not to cut off funding for the federal agency that helps states administer elections. Given Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the constant threat of cyberattacks on the country\u2019s voting infrastructure, \u201cabolishing\u201d the Election Assistance Commission \u201cwould be downright foolish,\u201d House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer wrote in an op-ed. The House budget blueprint for fiscal 2018 initially suggested zeroing out funding the bipartisan agency, with supporters of the move arguing the agency is outdated and that its primary functions are carried out by the FBI and the Homeland Security Department. Hoyer wrote that none of the GOP\u2019s arguments \u201chold water\u201d and called on appropriators to fix the \u201cerror\u201d and infuse the EAC with $9.2 million, as the Trump administration requested in its budget. \u201cWith adversaries intent on undermining Americans\u2019 faith in our voting systems, Congress ought to be providing the Election Assistance Commission with even greater resources to meet these new threats, not pulling the plug,\u201d he wrote. Hoyer pointed to the recent DEF CON hacker conference, where researchers broke into voting machines, as evidence of the flaws that could be exploited by more nefarious actors. \u201cWe must not allow that to happen,\u201d he said.   CYBER BILLS ADVANCE \u2014 Two Senate panels, Commerce and Small Business, approved cybersecurity legislation without a single \u201cno\u201d vote Wednesday. The Commerce Committee-approved bill would expand the National Science Foundation\u2019s CyberCorps: Scholarship-for-Service program, which helps cyber-focused students pay for their education in exchange for a guarantee of post-graduation government work. And the Small Business Committee-approved measure would direct small-business development centers that receive federal grants to certify that a certain percentage of their personnel can offer cyber assistance. Both committees approved the bills amid a slate of broader legislation. \u201cThis diverse package of common-sense legislation will give small businesses a boost in areas where they need it,\u201d said Small Business Chairman Jim Risch.   THEY GROW UP SO FAST \u2014 A government-funded malware analysis program has left the research lab and become a startup company. REnigma, which records the activities of malware on a system so incident response teams can rewind its execution and study its code, began life at Johns Hopkins University as part of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Transition to Practice program, or TTP, which aims to turn leading research ideas into commercial products. On Wednesday, DHS announced that REnigma had left TTP and become part of the Oregon-based startup firm Deterministic Security. Nadia Carlsten, TTP\u2019s program manager, said REnigma\u2019s success reflected DHS\u2019s work funding tools that \u201ccan be applied to critical cybersecurity problems and developed into solutions that will help secure our nation\u2019s public and private networks.\u201d   SPYWARE SAGA CONTINUES DOWN SOUTH \u2014 Mexico\u2019s ongoing surveillance scandal grew on Wednesday after internet watchdog Citizen Lab found that a pair of high-profile human rights attorneys were targeted with spyware after they investigated execution-style killings. According to researchers, the lawyers, Karla Micheel Salas and David Pena, had their cellphones targeted by messages designed to infect them with the same spyware, dubbed \u201cPegasus,\u201d that the University of Toronto-based research facility previously concluded was sent to almost 20 other individuals and groups in the country. Pegasus is a product of NSO Group, an Israeli firm that has been accused of selling its digital snooping tools to repressive regimes. \u201cA pattern has emerged in a subset of these cases: lawyers and investigators working on targeted killings in Mexico have been targeted with NSO Group\u2019s spyware when their investigations questioned official accounts provided by the authorities,\u201d Citizen Lab researchers wrote.   RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 The Homeland Security Department says two states and six local governments have askedfor election cybersecurity scans since January. \u2026 DHS employees have confidence in acting Secretary Elaine Duke, a spokesman said. \u2026 The White House said national security adviser H.R. McMaster fired intelligence operative Ezra Cohen-Watnick. \u2026 \u201cAnother federal judge has turned down a request to prevent President Donald Trump's voter fraud commission from going forward with plans to collect information on about 200 million American voters.\u201d   TWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 What can you even say about this?   QUICK BYTES  \u2014 Taxpayers for Common Sense has created a cyber spending database.  \u2014 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev criticized the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cweakness\u201d over sanctions legislation.  \u2014 The Drug Enforcement Administration met with the NSO Group, makers of smartphone malware.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak   FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC \u2014 The Senate is sticking around longer than planned to wrestle with some thorny, politically divisive topics, but cybersecurity is uniting two panels today in bipartisan harmony.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Senate Commerce Committee: The panel will mark up legislation that would expand the National Science Foundation\u2019s CyberCorps: Scholarship-For-Service program \u2014 which helps cyber-focused students pay for education costs in exchange for a guarantee of post-graduation government work \u2014 to include community college students. Under the potential expansion, 5 percent of the scholarship funds would also be devoted to career changers and military veterans in two-year programs. Additionally, students could, in some cases, serve government-affiliated elements of critical infrastructure, like a public power utility. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who is sponsoring the legislation with Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, said the measure \u201cwill expand the federal cybersecurity workforce and strengthen national security.\u201d  \u2014 Senate Small Business Committee: Although it was missing a final time or location late Tuesday, the committee\u2019s planned markup features a bill that would require small-business development centers that receive Small Business Administration grants to certify between 5 percent and 10 percent of its employees to provide cyber assistance. \u201cEntrepreneurs \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 depend on online sales and marketing to commercialize their businesses, leaving them incredibly vulnerable to cyber risks,\u201d said Chairman Jim Risch, who is co-sponsoring the bill with Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. \u201cWith many small businesses unable to recover after suffering a cyberattack, it is incredibly important that we address this threat head on.\u201d   HAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

IN THE WAY OF WRAY \u2014 The Senate voted 92-5 Tuesday to confirm Christopher Wray as director of the FBI, but at least one senator voted \u201cno\u201d because he worries Wray poses a threat to cybersecurity. \u201cIn his public and private statements, Chris Wray failed to oppose government backdoors into Americans\u2019 personal devices, or to acknowledge the facts about encryption \u2014 that it isn\u2019t about liberty versus security, it\u2019s about more security versus less security,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden said. \u201cWhile I appreciate his willingness to continue studying the issue, other officials who have talked about finding common ground have turned around and sought to fatally undermine the cornerstone of Americans\u2019 cybersecurity.\u201d While top Trump administration officials have backed off from trying to push for legislation that would force tech firms to decrypt data upon request, it has still vowed to work with the tech sector to come up with a way that would guarantee government access to locked communications, a prospect that cybersecurity experts and civil liberty advocates like Wyden say would inevitably erode online security.   KITT BY COMMITTEE \u2014 Rep. Ryan Costello has a new bill that would create a new panel inside the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make cybersecurity recommendations for testing, deploying and updating automated vehicles. The proposed Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council would be made of 15 to 30 members from across a wide variety of sectors, offering technical advice and developing a framework for identifying and implementing vehicle recalls. Costello\u2019s measure (H.R. 3411) has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, on which he serves.   CYBER DIPLOMACY AT AN 'INFLECTION POINT' \u2014 The Trump administration must not abandon U.S. leadership on international cyber diplomacy by diluting the work of the State Department\u2019s cyber office. That was the implicit message of the first public statement Tuesday from Christopher Painter, who left State at the end of July after serving for six years as the agency\u2019s first coordinator for cyber issues. Painter led countless U.S. delegations to other countries and international organizations, where he promoted the American view on issues like the protection of critical infrastructure, the prevention of cyber crime and the applicability of international law to cyberspace \u2014 all efforts that cyber policy watchers say have been vital to promoting global norms in the Wild West of the digital realm. \u201cI believe we are at an inflection point, where the work we do now and the choices we make will determine whether we can all continue to benefit from this amazing technology, or whether both growing policy and technical threats will undermine its incredible potential,\u201d Painter wrote in a Medium post. \u201cDiplomacy has and must continue to play a pivotal role \u2014 shaping the environment, building cooperation, and working to build coalitions to respond to shared threats, and we must continue to lead the international community.\u201d  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly plans to downsize Painter\u2019s old office, merge it into the economic bureau and downgrade the rank of the coordinator, who currently reports directly to the secretary. Painter did not directly address these plans in his post, but he appeared to take aim at a common argument in favor of merging the cyber office with a larger bureau: that its current setup as a \u201cspecial envoy\u201d office leaves it stranded in Foggy Bottom\u2019s vast bureaucracy. \u201cFar from being divorced from the expertise and resources of any single bureau at State,\u201d Painter wrote, \u201cwe have tapped into and used the expertise of every regional and functional bureau \u2014 each bringing their own unique perspective and experience \u2014 on a wide range of issues across the entire Department. In turn, we have been a resource for each of their growing cyber efforts.\u201d   STILL WAITING \u2014 The U.S. and China have yet to meet to discuss cyber issues during the Trump administration, Tillerson said Tuesday. Following President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s Mar-a-Lago meeting in April, the two countries established the U.S.-China Comprehensive Dialogue, which Tillerson described at the time as a \u201chigh-level framework for negotiations\u201d on thorny policy issues. Two of those issues is cybersecurity and law enforcement. But during a State Department briefing on Tuesday, Tillerson said that the two sides had yet to meet to discuss either cyber or law enforcement issues.  Digital security experts are closely watching how Trump handles cyber discussions with China, a longtime U.S. adversary that he frequently bashed during the campaign. Former President Barack Obama used the threat of economic sanctions to convince Xi to sign a landmark bilateral agreement prohibiting corporate cyber theft for domestic economic gain, and most experts say China has taken steps to comply with the agreement. Speaking to reporters, Tillerson said the new China dialogues had \u201cserved us well to this point.\u201d   TROOPS\u2019 INFO POSSIBLY EXPOSED \u2014 A veterans group is suing the Defense Department for potentially exposing the personal information of millions of former and current service members. The federal lawsuit by the Vietnam Veterans of America accuses the department of poor oversight of its Servicemembers Civil Relief Act website, which allows visitors \u2014 without any restrictions \u2014 to search through an individual\u2019s service records by providing a last name and either a Social Security number or birthdate. The suit \u2014 filed by the Civil Liberties and Transparency Clinic of the University at Buffalo School of Law \u2014 accuses DoD officials of violating the federal Privacy Act, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act and other industry best practices for personal information. It seeks $1,000 in damages for Thomas Barden, a retired Air Force master sergeant and a party in the lawsuit who says online scammers used the site to gain his trust and convince him to purchase fraudulent computer security software.   AS IF TAXES WEREN\u2019T ENOUGH OF A HEADACHE \u2014 The IRS wants tax professionals to watch out for ransomware attacks that could cripple their operations and disrupt the smooth reporting and collection of state and federal taxes.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  08/01/2017 10:02 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak   THE STAKEHOLDERS SEND THEIR REGARDS \u2014 Tech companies, wireless providers, trade groups, civil society groups and other interested parties filled up the National Telecommunications and Information Administration\u2019s inbox with ideas for reducing the risks of botnets, the malicious armies of hacked devices that have powered spam campaigns and website takedowns. NTIA asked for public feedback to help it prepare a report to President Donald Trump on botnets as part of his cybersecurity executive order, and on Monday the agency posted all the comments it received by the July 28 deadline. Here are a few of the ideas it received:  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Transparency: If private companies cooperate with government agencies \u2014 for example, in the takedown of botnets using the companies\u2019 infrastructure \u2014 they should do so as publicly as possible, argued the Center for Democracy & Technology. \u201cOne upside to compulsory powers is that they presumptively become public eventually, and are usually overseen by judges or the legislative branch,\u201d CDT argued in its filing. \u201cVoluntary efforts run the risk of operating in the dark and obscuring a level of coordination that would be offensive to the general public. It is imperative that private actors do not evolve into state actors without all the attendant oversight and accountability that comes with the latter.\u201d  \u2014 Education: Because so many different players in the internet of things marketplace are responsible for overall security, it is essential that government and industry spread awareness of best practices and things to avoid, according to the Consumer Technology Association. \u201cWithin the United States, education and awareness is a challenge that must be addressed holistically. No single entity can reach out to all the necessary parties \u2014 from manufacturers to retailers to installers to consumers,\u201d CTA said. \u201cOvercoming these gaps requires effective teamwork and collaboration, information sharing about the threats and solutions, and awareness of which players are responsible for what actions and when.\u201d    \u2014 Common sense: New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute argued that IoT device makers should start equipping their products with basic security from the start \u2014 including by randomizing each device\u2019s default username and password, making it much harder for hackers to locate and take over poorly configured devices. \u201cThe ability to modify login credentials should not be taken as a replacement for the implementation, where possible, of unique passwords for every device sold,\u201d OTI wrote. Also on the common-sense front, OTI said that IoT devices \u201cmust be designed in such a way that they can be patched or updated.\u201d  \u2014 Applause for NIST, NTIA: The two Commerce Department agencies are contributing well to productive discussions about internet of things security and botnets and should be encouraged to keep doing so, wrote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe Chamber believes the NTIA IoT security upgradability and patching effort and related activities can advance the private sector\u2019s interest in collaborative, voluntary best practices and shared information,\u201d it said. And NIST, which produces a widely used cybersecurity framework, \u201cdid an admirable job\u201d of seeking industry input on the document. \u201cThe Chamber believes the department is well positioned to convene stakeholders to identify existing standards and guidance to enhance the security and resilience of the IoT.\u201d   HAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE \u2014 Russia isn\u2019t ruling out improvement to relations with the United States, following Congress\u2019 passage of new sanctions and Moscow\u2019s retaliatory removal of U.S. diplomatic personnel. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman appealed Monday to Trump\u2019s earlier pledges to heal the rift between the two countries during the 2016 campaign, when the U.S. intelligence community accused Russian hackers of digitally disrupting the election. \u201cThe will to normalize these relations should be placed on the record,\u201d said the spokesman, Dmitri Peskov. \u201cOf course we\u2019re not interested in those relations being subject to erosion,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in sustainable development of our relations and can only regret that, for now, we are far from this ideal.\u201d But Putin said he had lost hope.  BEND THE KNEE, RUSSIA \u2014 Trump\u2019s top lieutenant, though, showed no signs Monday of relaxing rhetoric. \u201cThe United States stands with the nations and people of the Baltic States \u2014 and we always will. We stand with our NATO allies in our commitment to your security,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said in remarks at the HQ of Estonia\u2019s defense forces. \u201cToday we stand where East meets West \u2014 on a great frontier of freedom. No threat looms larger in the Baltic States than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east.\u201d Pence criticized Russian attempts to \u201cundermine democracies of sovereign nations,\u201d and its \u201cmalign influence\u201d in the region. \u201cTo be clear: We hope for better days, for better relations with Russia, but recent diplomatic action taken by Moscow will not deter the commitment of the United States of America to our security, the security of our allies, and the security of freedom-loving nations around the world,\u201d Pence said.   YOU KNOW NOTHING, CISO \u2014 Hackers say they have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO, including scripts for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and the network\u2019s new show \u201cRoom 104,\u201d according to Entertainment Weekly. The unknown thieves have already posted what they say are full episodes of \u201cRoom 104\u201d and the HBO show \u201cBallers,\u201d and they say more is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d HBO told EW that it had experienced \u201ca cyber incident\u201d involving \u201cthe compromise of proprietary information.\u201d In an email to employees, HBO CEO Richard Plepler wrote that the threat of hacking \u201cis unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a part of.\u201d Word of the hack first spread on Sunday, when a group claiming to have breached HBO emailed journalists to offer up the stolen material. There is no evidence that the hackers have stolen full episodes of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d   SMALL COUNCIL BUSINESS \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats demanded the White House explain why it published the personal emails of people who expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The messages \u201cechoed the sentiments shared by millions of Americans in that they raised privacy and security concerns with the Commission\u2019s plan to gather and publish personal data on American voters,\u201d Sens. Dianne Feinstein, Sherrod Brown and Ron Wyden wrote in a letter to White House counsel Don McGahn. The panel held its first formal meeting last month amid controversy over the background of many of its members and its leader Kris Kobach\u2019s request that every state send the commission voter data, including partial Social Security numbers and information on felony convictions. \u201cThe decision by the White House to publish the emails commenting on the Commission without redacting personal information demonstrates, at best, a lack of sensitivity to and simple disregard for the very concerns raised in many of the emails,\u201d according to the trio. \u201cAt worst, the decision to publish is a vindictive action taken to harm individuals that spoke out against the Commission\u2019s efforts to gather and publish personal data on every American voter.\u201d The group asks McGahn to answer over a dozen questions about the move, including if the White House has amended its disclosure policies regarding written correspondence; who made the decision to publish the emails; and if they were published in retribution for people criticizing the commission.   THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST REMEMBERS \u2014 Wyden renewed his request for Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to answer a months-old question about whether key surveillance programs can be tapped to collect communications known to be \u201centirely domestic.\u201d Wyden originally asked the question about the snooping programs contained in Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \u2014 which authorizes the collection of foreigners' digital chatter but also gathers personal data on an unknown number of law-abiding Americans \u2014 during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on May 7. The cryptic question, coming near the end of the hearing, seemed to surprise the nation\u2019s spy chief before he replied: \u201cNot to my knowledge. It would be against the law.\u201d But Wyden brought the matter up again Monday in a letter to Coats, noting that \u201cfollowing the hearing, your office responded to inquiries from reporters by answering a different question. I request that you respond publicly to the original question, as asked at the open hearing.\u201d The spying efforts will expire at the end of the calendar year without congressional action.   THE WALK OF PUNISHMENT \u2014 The Trump administration could, as soon as this week, levy punishments against China, our POLITICO colleagues Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey report. Although the impetus appears to be North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and China\u2019s trade policies, there\u2019s also growing pressure from Congress and experts for economic sanctions against China over North Korea\u2019s hackers. Chinese technology reportedly aids North Korea\u2019s hacking operation, one of the reasons Rep. Robert Pittenger offered an amendment to the annual defense policy bill in the House that would forbid telecommunications companies that aid Pyongyang cyberattacks from contracting with the Defense Department. The amendment won adoption by unanimous consent. \u201cFor far too long, China has enabled the North Korean government to pursue nuclear development, global provocation, and egregious human rights violations,\u201d Pittenger said. \u201cThe Chinese government is simply not a good faith partner on the issue of North Korea.\u201d There are similar pressures in the Senate. China, though, might be growing impatient with North Korean hackers on their own.   HACKER OF COIN \u2014 July wasn\u2019t a great month for the increasingly popular cryptocurrency Ethereum, the victim of at least three wallet and initial coin offering hacks reaping at least $1 million each. During the span there was a $1 million theft at first, then $7.4 million, then $32 million. As such, Ethereum lost one third of its value over 30 days. At least one analyst predicts Ethereum is still on track to double in value by 2018, however. The troubles at Ethereum reflect a plague of hacks of other bitcoin services that date back years. Although crytpocurrency is meant to enable more secure transactions, the thefts of such a hot form of currency reminds of Willie Sutton\u2019s old quip about why he robs banks: \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d   TWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 You can\u2019t rush these things.   PEOPLE ON THE MOVE  \u2014 The Senate on Monday evening cleared the way for Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart to become deputy director of Cyber Command.  QUICK BYTES  \u2014 An email prankster convinced Tom Bossert, White House homeland security adviser, he was Jared Kushner, CNN reports.  \u2014 \u201cRepublican National Committee officials have been ordered by the party\u2019s legal team to preserve documents pertaining to the 2016 presidential campaign, a precaution in the face of a broad federal investigation into Russian interference in the election.\u201d The Wall Street Journal.  \u2014 The Washington Post reports that President Trump had a hand in drafting Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s misleading statement on his meeting with a Russian lawyer.    \u2014 The FCC says it can\u2019t reveal its cyber defenses following the agency\u2019s allegation that it was hit with a distributed denial of service attack.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Andrew Hanna  FLIPPING THE SCRIPT \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s shock announcement that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly would take over as his chief of staff, effective today, could do harm to DHS\u2019s cybersecurity mission, former department officials told your MC host for a story for Pros (with help from Cory and Eric). And they aren\u2019t alone in that opinion. Given the growing nature of the digital threat, \u201cDHS needs to be leading a full scale and comprehensive effort to protect our critical infrastructure as well as our election related and voter registration systems,\u201d John Cohen, a former acting undersecretary at DHS, told MC. \u201cChanging leadership now \u2014 especially at a time when there are so many senior leadership vacancies at the department \u2014 is highly disconcerting.\u201d  Story Continued Below  But it\u2019s not all bad. For one, Elaine Duke, the deputy secretary turned acting secretary, is highly regarded. \u201cDHS is fortunate to have an extremely competent deputy secretary,\u201d Bruce McConnell, a former DHS deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity, told MC. \u201cI expect DHS cyber won't miss a beat.\u201d And while Trump this month made two key widely-commended cybersecurity appointments at the department, DHS still has some major openings atop the National Protection and Programs Directorate, the main cyber wing at Homeland. \u201cThey have not yet named a cyber undersecretary, so that allows the next person to really put a stamp on the organization,\u201d James Norton, a former DHS deputy assistant secretary, told MC. It doesn\u2019t look like the NPPD undersecretary job will go to Kelly\u2019s DHS chief of staff Kirstjen Nielsen, the subject of on and off rumors as a leading candidate. She\u2019s expected to join Kelly in the White House.  So who\u2019s going to be the next DHS secretary? Speculation has veered toward House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. McCaul is the most experienced cybersecurity hand among the group, but he faced opposition for the DHS job prior to Kelly\u2019s appointment from some conservatives who considered him weak on border security. Notably, over the weekend, McCaul introduced a border security bill that backs up key elements of Trump\u2019s plans.  HAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

CYBER TRAINING, SCHOLARSHIPS ON SENATE AGENDA \u2014 Senate lawmakers will mark up bills this week aimed at boosting cyber skills among small businesses and expanding the cyber workforce more broadly. On Wednesday, the Small Business Committee will consider legislation that would require workers at small business development centers to be certified in cyber training, and the Commerce Committee will consider a bill to expand cyber scholarships to people pursuing associate\u2019s degrees. The scholarships bill would also create a National Science Foundation study on the success of the cyber scholarship recruiting program. Scholarships for young cyber professionals have emerged as a key tool to fill what experts say is an alarming and growing workforce shortage. Rep. Jim Langevin, co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, recently introduced an amendment to the 2018 Pentagon funding bill that would add money to DoD\u2019s own cyber scholarship initiative.  NO OTHER CHOICE \u2014 President Trump will sign a sanctions bill targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea, the White House announced over the weekend, even as his administration remains concerned that it unwisely ties his hands in negotiations with foreign adversaries. Trump \u201cread early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it,\u201d the White House claimed in a statement. \u201cHe has now reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it.\u201d The Senate late last week passed the House-approved bill (H.R. 3364) by an overwhelming 98-2 vote. The measure cleared the House 419-3, meaning Congress would likely have overridden any Trump veto of the legislation.  The veto-proof margins in both chambers were seen as a rebuke of Trump\u2019s desire to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but the administration tried to put a positive spin on the bill. The margins \u201crepresent the strong will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States,\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that there will be cooperation between our two countries on major global issues and these sanctions will no longer be necessary.\u201d Tillerson, who had previously expressed reservations about the bill, promised that the Trump administration would \u201cwork closely with our friends and Allies to ensure our messages to Russia, Iran, and North Korea are clearly understood.\u201d  THIS AGAIN? \u2014 Trump may be willing to impose further sanctions on Russia, but he remains convinced that the Kremlin sought to aid his opponent, not him, in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cRussia was against Trump in the 2016 Election,\u201d he tweeted over the weekend, citing a Fox News article, \u201cand why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt!\u201d The Fox story cited Senate testimony by Bill Browder, a financier and longtime Kremlin adversary. Browder claimed that the opposition research firm Fusion GPS \u2014 which commissioned ex-MI6 agent Christopher Steele to prepare the salacious and largely unverified Trump dossier \u2014 also worked for the Russian government \u201cin a smear campaign\u201d against Browder aimed at fighting U.S. sanctions. Trump\u2019s tweet, and the Fox story which he retweeted, implied a connection between Fusion GPS\u2019s work on the dossier and its separate work for the Kremlin.  The president\u2019s tweet marked the latest break between the commander-in-chief and the intelligence community he oversees regarding Russia\u2019s 2016 intentions. In a landmark assessment that Trump\u2019s top intelligence chiefs have said they support, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded that the Kremlin\u2019s cyberattacks on the 2016 election were aimed at undermining Hillary Clinton and, eventually, helping Trump get elected.  KASPERSKY IN THE SPOTLIGHT \u2014 Congressional fears about the reach of Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab are rising. Late last week, House Science Chairman Lamar Smith asked 22 federal agencies whether their computer networks rely on software from the popular Russian antivirus giant, which some lawmakers worry is cozy with the Kremlin. \u201cThe committee is concerned that Kaspersky Lab is susceptible to manipulation by the Russian government, and that its products could be used as a tool for espionage, sabotage or other nefarious activities against the United States," Smith wrote in a letter sent Thursday.   Meanwhile, with the Senate expected to soon turn to its version of the annual defense policy bill, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has submitted an amendment that would expand her proposed Pentagon ban on Kaspersky products to cover the entire federal government. According to the provision\u2019s text, \u201cNo department, agency, organization, or other element\u201d of the U.S. government may use \u201cany hardware, software, or services developed or provided, in whole or in part\u201d by Kaspersky. And what does Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of the firm, think of all this scrutiny? He gave an interview where he vehemently denied his company has any ties to Russian intelligence.  DEFICIENCY STATUS: UNCORRECTED \u2014 From 2014 to 2017, overseas State Department inspector general reports repeated 18 different cybersecurity assessment recommendations, meaning the gaps went unfixed, according to an IG report released late last week. \u201cThese recommendations addressed weaknesses in information systems security officer programs, incomplete and untested IT contingency plans, noncompliant dedicated internet networks, and various physical, technical, and administrative cyber security control weaknesses,\u201d the report states. The report suggests that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security join forces with the Bureau of Information Resources Management and regional bureaus to develop a system for tracking how overseas posts comply with cybersecurity assessment recommendations.  SWEDEN MAKES CYBER HISTORY \u2014 A massive government data breach in Sweden has toppled two cabinet officials, perhaps the highest-ranking dismissals to ever result from a government cybersecurity incident. Two ministers resigned after a Swedish Transport Agency breach, exposing reams of highly-sensitive data in Eastern European countries. The reshuffling was seen as a bid by Prime Minister Stefan Lfven to avert new elections amid calls for his own resignation. \u201cI have to take responsibility for the country,\u201d he said late last week. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t serve Sweden to throw the country into a political crisis.\u201d Comparatively, the largest U.S. government data breach led to the ouster of the head of the Office of Personnel Management.  TALLIN-TED \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence is visiting cyber-focused Estonia, and our POLITICO colleague Andrew Hanna exploredwhy the tiny nation has outsized influence in the United States. Among the reasons: \u201cIts skill in combating Russian cyber and intelligence operations. Russia targeted Tallinn with a huge cyberattack in 2007, targeting its parliament, banks, broadcasters and newspapers following a dispute with Moscow over the relocation of a Soviet war memorial. Since then, Estonia has bolstered its cyber defenses and know-how,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe country is home to a NATO cyber center and hosts an annual cyber war game called \u2018Locked Shields,\u2019 which U.S. European Command participated in last year.\u201d  In fact, the Estonian government announced a new cyber defense exercise late last week, bringing together European Union defense ministers this September. The exercise, called EU CYBRID 2017, will be conducted in partnership with the European Defense Agency in Tallinn. \u201cThere are no borders between countries or organisations on the Internet, and when it comes to countering threats on the internet, barriers between European Union and NATO cooperation must be reduced,\u201d Estonian Minister of Defence Jri Luik said in a statement. The exercise aims to prepare governments to deal with the aftermath of cyberattack. EU defense ministers will gather in Tallinn for an informal meeting from Sept. 6 to 8, when the exercise will take place.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller, Martin Matishak and Li Zhou  LAWMAKERS \u2018MEH\u2019 ON NSA-CYBER COMMAND SPLIT \u2014 House and Senate lawmakers are shrugging off reports that the Trump administration is closing in on a plan to separate the NSA from U.S. Cyber Command, saying, essentially, they\u2019ll believe it when they see it, Martin reports. \u201cIt would help the debate if they sent something up, because then we could look at their proposal,\u201d according to Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Splitting the two agencies has been a topic of debate since Cyber Command was established in 2009, but has gained momentum in recent years as the Pentagon\u2019s stepped up its digital operations against threats around the globe.  Story Continued Below  \u201cI\u2019m open to it,\u201d said Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s NSA and Cybersecurity subpanel. \u201cI\u2019m never a big fan of expanding bureaucracy, but we do have to do a better job with cybersecurity. And if splitting it off and ... having its own focus makes that better, then of course I would be interested in it.\u201d Lawmakers already used last year\u2019s annual defense policy bill \u2014 the National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 to legislatively mandate that the Pentagon elevate Cyber Command, putting it on equal footing with other combatant commands that oversee military operations in Europe, Africa and the Pacific. But the same measure also set up a number of conditions that must be met before any full NSA-Cyber Command split can occur, leading to a sense of caution on both sides of the aisle. A split \u201cmay happen some day,\u201d said Rep. Jim Langevin, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services emerging threats subcommittee. \u201cThey are not there yet. I\u2019m not ready to support such a move.\u201d  Questions about the fate of the two organizations is a positive thing, said John Schindler, a former NSA senior analyst. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do this very carefully, you\u2019re going to create a bigger furball than we have now,\u201d he said. But if lawmakers \u201cdo this slowly and patiently and understand this is a multi-year \u2014 not a one or two fiscal year project \u2014 this can be OK.\u201d Pros can read the full story here.

TEACH A MAN NOT TO BE PHISHED \u2014 The federal government should encourage internet of things manufacturers to educate the public about ways to prevent their devices from being taken over by hackers, a leading cyber policy group said today. \u201cContextual customer notification may enable consumers to respond in the event their device is infected by malware,\u201d said the Coalition for Cybersecurity Policy and Law in comments filed with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. \u201cNotifying consumers that their devices are infected by malware may not help consumers if they do not have the tools to remove the malware or are not able to distinguish between authentic notifications and fraudulent ones.\u201d  NTIA is leading a multistakeholder process to study ways to improve the security of the internet of things, and the cyber policy coalition\u2019s filing comes in response to an NTIA request for comment. The coalition said the Commerce Department, which houses NTIA, could help companies keep customers informed \u201cby bringing industry participants together to develop guidance for companies that choose to provide such notice to their customers.\u201d   SECOND TIME\u2019S THE CHARM \u2014 The House today is expected to take up, for the second time, its version of the annual intelligence authorization bill. Democrats successfully scuttled the measure earlier this week to protest it being brought to the floor under suspension of the rules, an expedited process without amendments that requires a two-thirds majority. This time the bill is coming to the chamber via a \u201cclosed rule,\u201d a procedural maneuver that bans amendments, unless they\u2019re recommended by the committee reporting the bill.   As for the measure itself, it directs the director of national intelligence to produce a report on past and present Russian plots to tamper with elections and would require that the DNI produce a publicly available report on foreign cyber threats to U.S. elections. Another part of the legislation would request an intelligence community report on the viability of a voluntary cyber exchange program between spy agencies and private companies, while another provision would direct the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general to produce a report on spy agencies\u2019 roles in the process of disclosing to tech companies the vulnerabilities that the government unearths.   MUCH-NEEDED BOOST \u2014 The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved a bill that would increase funding for Senate cybersecurity training and defenses. The 2018 fiscal year legislative branch funding bill \u201cprovides for investments in Senate cybersecurity capabilities and training to senators and their staff,\u201d the committee said in a statement. The bill adds money to the Senators\u2019 Official Personnel and Office Expense Account \u201cto support the increasing costs related to providing cybersecurity protections for senators\u2019 offices.\u201d Senators have focused more on their own offices\u2019 digital defenses in recent years as hackers have exploited weaknesses to breach numerous government agencies. In April, Sen. Ron Wyden pressed the Senate Rules and Administration Committee to mandate two-factor authentication for all congressional IT systems.   TICK TOCK \u2014 The State Department has yet to submit a required report on cybersecurity vulnerabilities related to its email policies that was due more than a month ago. Buried in the government funding bill that became law on May 5 is a provision requiring the State Department to report on changes to its email policies. One section of the report must address the department\u2019s efforts to \u201cstrengthen cybersecurity measures to mitigate vulnerabilities, including those resulting from the use of personal email accounts or servers outside the .gov domain,\u201d a nod to the Hillary Clinton private email server scandal. The report was due on June 19 to the congressional appropriations committees and to the National Archives and Records Administration \u2014 which oversees records retention policies \u2014 but the State Department has yet to submit it. \u201cWe have been working diligently to meet this requirement,\u201d a department official told MC. \u201cThe department is aware of the requirement and we will be forwarding a report to the requesting committees as soon as possible.\u201d   EYE ON THE SKY \u2014 The Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general said Thursday that it was initiating an audit, requested by lawmakers, of cybersecurity at the FAA. \u201cCyber-based threats \u2014 from both internal and external sources \u2014 are rapidly evolving and could threaten the connectivity of a complex aviation infrastructure,\u201d Matthew Hampton, assistant inspector general for aviation audits, wrote in a memo. \u201cFurthermore, FAA\u2019s current modernization efforts increasingly rely on integrated information systems, distribution of information, and satellite-based technologies,\u201d he added, referring to the FAA\u2019s transition to NextGen programs. \u201cAs a result, may put the air-traffic control system at greater risk for compromise.\u201d The audit stems from a request by leaders of the House Transportation Committee to determine how the FAA was complying with cybersecurity requirements from a 2016 law. The aviation industry has become an increasing target for hackers, and the FAA itself has been dinged by government watchdogs for poor cybersecurity practices.   GAO GETS GOING \u2014 The Government Accountability Office dropped a number of cybersecurity-related reports on Thursday. One determined that the SEC hasn\u2019t fully implemented 11 information security recommendations. A second report found that the Defense Department needs to take additional steps to secure internet-connected devices. And a third concluded that federal agencies aren\u2019t doing enough to reduce the use of Social Security numbers. Rep. Steve Chabot is also concerned about the number of State Department telecom device and software manufacturers identified by the GAO as having Chinese-headquartered suppliers.   HOUSE ELECTION SECURITY GROUP KICKS OFF \u2014 The House Democratic election security task force got its first informational briefing on Thursday. The Brennan Center spoke with the task force about its report, \u201cSecuring Elections From Foreign Interference,\u201d which focuses on hacking vulnerabilities in voting machines and voter registration databases. \u201cThe Brennan Center\u2019s expertise on election issues will lend us to our first public meeting in the coming weeks where we will hear from officials and experts with diverse backgrounds,\u201d said Reps. Bennie Thompson and Robert Brady, the task force\u2019s co-chairs. \u201cThis will be the first step towards forming solutions to protect our democracy and its cherished institutions from malicious actors and outside influence.\u201d   NEW ICPA BILL COMING \u2014 Per our friends at Morning Tech: Hot on the heels of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act reintroduction from Sens. Mike Lee and Patrick Leahy, Sens. Orrin Hatch, Chris Coons and Dean Heller are due to announce the return of the International Communications Privacy Act, according to a Hill aide. ICPA would provide a legal framework for U.S. law enforcement agencies to obtain electronic communication records of U.S. citizens that are stored overseas, which would include the use of a warrant. Google, BSA | The Software Alliance and SIIA are among those that have voiced their support for the return of the bill.    \u2014 Speaking of ECPA: Lee and Leahy on Thursday unveiled a new version of ECPA, which would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant for Americans\u2019 emails that are more than 180 days old. It would also create a warrant standard for tracking location information, including on cell phones. A previous version of the legislation got bogged down in the Senate last term, after Sen. John Cornyn added amendments that appeared to give the FBI more leeway for surveillance. Lee also introduced a companion to the House\u2019s Email Privacy Act. A range for groups, from BSA to the Consumer Technology Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology, quickly embraced the bill. Read the new version of ECPA here.

One of the bill\u2019s leading original authors, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, was temporarily balking at the last-minute decision in the House to add North Korea sanctions to the measure, which also included new penalties on Iran. \u201cWhat likely will happen is we will strip out the North Korea piece and send it back to them so that the two pieces that we\u2019ve negotiated together will remain intact,\u201d Corker said, noting that the Senate never got a chance to carefully negotiate the North Korea language the way it did on Iran and Russia. Late Wednesday, Corker announced that the North Korea language would be removed, with the Senate likely to later take up separate Pyongyang sanctions legislation from the House.  Story Continued Below  The White House was remaining noncommittal until it sees the final bill, said spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cSen. Corker actually came out earlier today and said that he's not fully supportive of where the bill stands,\u201d she said at her briefing Wednesday. \u201cWe expect that there's a possibility that more changes take place. And so we're going to see what that looks like before we make a final decision.\u201d Overall, she said, \u201cI can tell you that the White House, the president, and the entire administration \u2014 as we've said many times before \u2014 strongly support sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d  Other countries are developing heartburn over the U.S. legislation. Russia, naturally, isn\u2019t pleased, and vaguely raised the possibility of retaliation, while warning the bill (H.R. 3364) would do harm to international cooperation with the United States. The European Union is also vaguely threatening retaliation out of concern that the sanctions could have a negative impact on European corporations, although sources told our POLITICO Europe colleagues that recent changes to the bill have assuaged some of those concerns.

VEP, CISA \u2014 The House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday approved a bill that would require the Homeland Security Department to produce a report on how the agency determines whether to disclose software vulnerabilities. The bill (H.R. 3202), sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, seeks to shed light on the secretive Vulnerability Equities Process, amid a spree of leaks about purported vulnerabilities the government has hoarded. \u201cBecause vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important that the sensitive information is managed securely and the details are guarded against premature disclosure,\u201d Jackson Lee said. But, she added, the government must also work on \u201csolutions\u201d to the vulnerabilities it finds. The panel also approved legislation (H.R. 3359) renaming and elevating DHS\u2019s primary cyber wing, the National Protection and Programs Directorate. It would become the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The committee approved both bills by voice vote.   DHS BUYING BILLS CLEAR COMMITTEE \u2014 The Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday easily approved two bills altering how the Homeland Security Department makes major purchases, which could affect future cybersecurity acquisition programs. The first measure would create a new review board to oversee the DHS acquisition process. The second bipartisan proposal would require DHS to notify Congress when one of the agency\u2019s buying efforts breaches its contract by failing to meet cost, schedule or performance benchmarks. Both bills were approved by voice vote.   WEDNESDAY NIGHT DOJ NEWS \u2014 \u201cA grand jury in the Northern District of California has indicted a Russian national and an organization he allegedly operated, BTC-e, for operating an unlicensed money service business, money laundering, and related crimes,\u201d the Justice Department announced Wednesday about indicted suspect Alexander Vinnik. \u201cThe indictment alleges that he received funds from the infamous computer intrusion or \u2018hack\u2019 of Mt. Gox \u2014 an earlier digital currency exchange that eventually failed, in part due to losses attributable to hacking.\u201d  GET ON THIS \u2014 The IRS has much more work to do to fix serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities and improve security policies, according to the Government Accountability Office. In a report released on Wednesday, GAO found that, while the IRS improved its security controls based on earlier recommendations, it still fell short in key areas. Among the problems that GAO identified: the IRS didn\u2019t consistently implement user authentication requirements; users had more permissions than they needed; some agency systems did not use the strongest possible encryption; and the agency failed to implement some of its auditing procedures, including logging who accessed certain databases. The IRS, according to GAO, is \u201cexposing financial and sensitive taxpayer information to unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure and modification.\u201d In a departure from standard agency responses to GAO reports, the IRS \u201cneither agreed nor disagreed\u201d with GAO\u2019s recommendations and maintained that its systems were secure.  The GAO\u2019s cybersecurity concerns about the IRS could come at an opportune time for the Treasury Department. In Senate testimony on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pressed Congress on the importance of the department\u2019s security upgrade program, which locates and fixes vulnerabilities in critical systems. The Trump administration has asked for \u2014 and the House Appropriations Committee has already approved \u2014 $27 million for the program, known as the Cybersecurity Enhancement Account. Last year\u2019s Treasury budget, however, funded the program at a much higher level, $48 million.   SWEDISH LEADERS COULD LOSE JOB OVER BREACH \u2014 Sweden\u2019s opposition party is trying to oust three government leaders they say are responsible for major data security mistakes that exposed sensitive information on the Swedish population. The move came after Swedish officials paid IBM\u2019s local division $100 million to manage vehicle registration and driver\u2019s license databases, but failed to implement proper safeguards, according to a New York Times story. As a result, IBM subsidiaries in Eastern Europe had unauthorized access to \u201cdetails about bridges, roads, ports, the subway system in Stockholm and other infrastructure,\u201d the Times reported.  Swedish Prime MInister Stefan Lofven said the breach was \u201cincredibly serious\u201d and \u201cput Sweden and its citizens in harm\u2019s way.\u201d The database contains information about undercover Swedish police and schedules for the movement of armored vans transporting valuables. The head of Sweden\u2019s transportation agency was fired and fined $8,500 for sidestepping privacy laws in setting up the contract, and the new agency chief estimated that it would take until the fall to repair the damage.   RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 A Facebook official said the company will donate $500,000 to a project to protect the American electoral system from cyberattacks \u2026 Partisan tempers flared on the House Intelligence Committee after Jared Kushner\u2019s testimony \u2026 Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed bipartisan alarm over Russia\u2019s attempt to influence U.S. politics. \u2026 Despite days of badgering tweets, the White House insisted Trump wants Attorney General Jeff Sessions to stay on.   TWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 No firewall can keep out Fancy Bird.   PEOPLE ON THE MOVE  \u2014 Andrew Grotto, who served as senior director for cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council from late 2015 until May of this year, is joining Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation. He\u2019ll be a fellow in the Stanford Cyber Initiative and research fellow at the Hoover Institute. During his time in the Trump administration, he was a driving force behind the White House\u2019s cybersecurity executive order. His past experience also includes serving as technology adviser to then-Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and as the lead cybersecurity staffer for then-Senate Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak  KASPERSKY BAN MAY MAKE FINAL DEFENSE POLICY BILL \u2014 While it could be months before House and Senate lawmakers agree on a final defense policy bill, they are expressing confidence that the finished measure will contain some form of an amendment to bar the Pentagon from using software developed by Moscow-based cyber giant Kaspersky Lab. Now that the Senate draft of the measure \u2014 the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 has been queued for floor time, both chambers will soon be looking to hammer out differences between their separate versions, including the Senate bill provision that would block the use of Kaspersky software on DoD networks and require the Pentagon to \u201cimmediately\u201d sever any DoD-connected systems that are \u201cusing\u201d Kaspersky technology. The House-passed NDAA doesn\u2019t include such language, but lawmakers in both chambers told POLITICO that they expect some version of the Senate clause to make it into the blended legislation, despite some reservations. \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of which one of us has the best idea,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee.   Story Continued Below  A Kaspersky ban would serve as another piece of legislation meant to thwart Russian hacking \u2014 a cause both parties have taken up as many lawmakers chastise the White House for not doing enough in the wake of last year\u2019s alleged Russian election interference campaign. The Moscow-based company is one of the world\u2019s largest cyber firms, claiming over 400 million global users, and the fear is that its wide reach gives Russia a backdoor into key American networks. Kaspersky strenuously denies any ties to the Russian government and has offered up its source code for inspection.  Several potential roadblocks stand in the way of lawmakers reaching consensus on a Kaspersky ban. Russian officials have suggested they may strike back at the U.S. if it enacts a ban. Meanwhile, the Senate provision\u2019s language is \u201cproblematic,\u201d said a House Armed Services Committee aide, because it could prove too difficult to implement. Still, while the language may not appear verbatim in the final authorization bill, some form of it seems destined to make the final cut. \u201cThere are public reports that are showing Kaspersky has a relationship with the Russian government that has given a lot of people pause,\u201d according to Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on SASC. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue.\u201d Pros can read the full story here.   HAPPY WEDNESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity! All of the rocks.

FIRST IN MC: MASSIVE PETITION ADDS FUEL TO 702 DEBATE \u2014 Civil liberties groups from across the political spectrum will deliver to Congress today a petition bearing more than 100,000 signatures demanding reforms to a key government surveillance law, hoping to kick-start the debate over the program before Congress finds itself staring down the deadline to reauthorize it.The spying powers, part of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, target the communications of foreign targets, but also incidentally collect data on an unknown number of Americans. Government agents can currently obtain Americans\u2019 warrantlessly collected personal information by searching the Section 702 surveillance database. Critics call the move a \u201cbackdoor search,\u201d although proponents note there are procedures in place to hide Americans\u2019 identities in such situations. The new petition calls on Congress to change the law before extending it past its Dec. 31 sunset date.  \u201cThe electronic surveillance programs under Section 702 remain gross overreaches of the federal government into the privacy of American citizens,\u201d said Sean Vitka, policy counsel at Demand Progress, in a statement. The spy powers, he said, are \u201cin desperate need of reform.\u201d Others organizers of the petition include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the libertarian group FreedomWorks. Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, said the issue of 702 reform \u201ctranscends ideological boundaries.\u201d The groups are delivering the petition to House leadership, the leaders of House Judiciary Committee and several prominent surveillance critics, including Rep. Justin Amash and Fourth Amendment Caucus co-chairs Reps. Ted Poe and Zoe Lofgren.   BLACK HATS, DEF CONS \u2014 Black Hat kicks off the meat of its information security industry conference in Las Vegas today, with fellow hacker conference DEF CON set to do the same later this week. Some of the major vulnerabilities getting the spotlight at Black Hat this year are in the energy industry, from traditional electricity generating plants to wind farm stations to nuclear power plant radiation monitors. Digital defects in Apple products will also get attention, as will those in electronic consumer locks. DEF CON will feature a much-anticipated voting machine hacking village, a demonstration on how to unlock a smart gun and more. Of note: DEF CON founder Jeff Moss said a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at last year\u2019s event landed him in hot water with the Trump administration.   TODAY: A HOST OF HEARINGS \u2014 The House Small Business panel today will hold a hearing confronting the problems with encouraging small businesses to adopt cybersecurity insurance. \u201cThe widespread adoption of cybersecurity insurance policies is not without its challenges \u2014 both for small businesses and for the insurance providers,\u201d Chairman Steve Chabot will say, according to his opening statement. \u201cSmall businesses face significant hurdles in identifying what kind of policies and coverage options make sense for them and must be equipped well enough to carry out basic cybersecurity best practices.\u201d Chabot and the top Democrat on the panel, Nydia Velazquez, plan to raise some of the same challenges. \u201cA lack of adequate data underscores the complex nature of creating cyber liability policies for small firms,\u201d Velazquez will say, according to her prepared remarks. \u201cAlso, the type of business, the risk management procedures, and the continually evolving threats make it difficult for the insurers and the small business.\u201d  Elsewhere, citing a scheduling conflict, the House Foreign Affairs Committee postponed an intriguing hearing about cyber diplomacy, where outgoing State Department cyber coordinator Chris Painter was set to testify. Painter\u2019s testimony was to come just before his departure from the job and amid reports that his office will be closed and its operations moved elsewhere.   Finally, the House Homeland Security Committee is scheduled to mark up a bill renaming and elevating the Homeland Security Department\u2019s main cyber wing, changing it from the National Protection and Programs Directorate to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The legislation (H.R. 3359 (115)) appears to have bipartisan support. And the Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing entitled \u201cOversight of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and Attempts to Influence U.S. Elections: Lessons Learned from Current and Prior Administrations,\u201d with testimony from top Justice Department and FBI officials.   HOUSE PASSES RUSSIA SANCTIONS, WHITE HOUSE FATE UNCLEAR \u2014 The House on Tuesday passed new Russia sanctions legislation by a 419-3 vote, but what happens next is a mystery. The House made changes to the Senate version of the bill that passed 98-2, and Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs panel, suggested the two chambers might have to settle differences before it can move to the president\u2019s desk. Additionally, \u201cthe White House has yet to say definitively whether Trump would sign the bill, which his administration had criticized for failing to give him necessary \u2018flexibility\u2019 to work on warmer relations with Russia,\u201d our POLITICO colleague Elana Schor reports. Still, even if Trump vetoed the bill, the massive vote margins suggest Congress has the votes to overturn any veto.  Although Trump has cast doubt on whether Russia digitally interfered in the 2016 election, House Intelligence Committee member Mike Quigley said the vote means \u201cthat both parties acknowledged Russia\u2019s meddling in our election.\u201d   SPEND IT WISELY \u2014 The Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a spending bill for several Cabinet departments with key cyber responsibilities, and its report on the bill touts cybersecurity as a priority at several agencies. The fiscal year 2018 Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill would give the FBI $9 billion \u2014 $213 million more than Trump requested in his budget \u2014 and increase funding for \u201ccybersecurity activities to neutralize, mitigate, and disrupt illegal computer-supported operations,\u201d according to a committee statement. The bill would dole out $2.1 billion to the Justice Department unit that oversees the U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices. At least $60 million of that must be spent on \u201ccombating cybercrime, including the investigation and prosecution of cyberattacks and cyber intrusions\u201d \u2014 a figure $5 million higher than the cyber-specific funding that Trump requested.   The Commerce Department technical standards agency NIST \u2014 known for projects like the widely used cybersecurity framework \u2014 would get $944 million, an $8 million decrease from last year\u2019s budget, but the committee said it still wanted NIST to \u201cto strengthen the U.S. cybersecurity posture through cutting-edge research and development.\u201d   JUST A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT \u2014 Three Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill on Tuesday that would give tax credits to companies that train their employees in cybersecurity skills. The New Collar Jobs Act, from Reps. Ted Lieu, Matt Cartwright and Ann McLane Kuster, would amend the IRS code to create a tax credit for businesses that enroll their workers in undergraduate or graduate programs that teach cyber skills. It would also double the funding for the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service Program \u2014 a National Science Foundation initiative to help cyber-focused students pay for education costs \u2014 and give companies vying for government contracts a boost in their applications if they use the cyber training tax credit. \u201cOur legislation will re-tool our workers for careers of the future,\u201d Lieu said in a statement. \u201cOur vision is to improve our economy and national security by re-educating industrial workers with high-demand skills in cyber to fill these \u2018New Collar\u2019 jobs \u2014 positions that have competitive salaries, career growth potential, and cannot be outsourced.\u201d   THE MORE YOU KNOW \u2014 The Homeland Security Department on Tuesday issued an alert about the malware bug that researchers have blamed for causing a brief power outage in Ukraine last year. Dubbed \u201cCrashOverride\u201d by the cybersecurity firm Dragos, the malware can seize control of switches and circuit breakers and wipe servers to delete all traces of itself, according to DHS. It\u2019s suspected the virus can also disable equipment designed to prevent grid overloads, potentially letting hackers cause widespread physical damage \u2014 a feature that researchers said help separate CrashOverride from its predecessors. The department\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team is analyzing the malware\u2019s code and has developed a method to help detect malicious files.   RATCLIFFE LIKES KREBS PICK \u2014 The chairman of the House Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, Rep. John Ratcliffe, told MC he likes the latest addition to the Homeland Security Department\u2019s cyber team. \u201cI applaud President Trump for nominating Chris Krebs as the assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at DHS,\u201d Ratcliffe said in a statement, following Krebs\u2019 announced appointment this week. \u201cChris possesses an impressive wealth of public and private sector cybersecurity experience, which will allow him to play an invaluable role in advancing DHS' important cybersecurity mission. I look forward to working with Chris, [assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications] Jeanette Manfra, Secretary [John] Kelly, [deputy Secretary] Elaine Duke and others as we work to protect our nation against cyber threats moving forward.\u201d   RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Rep. Mike Conaway, who\u2019s leading the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia probe, said Trump senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner \u201csatisfied\u201d all of his questions. \u2026 The Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort as part of its Russia probe, then backed away after reaching an agreement with him. \u2026 Additionally, the Judiciary panel backed away from a subpoena of the co-founder of the company that produced the infamous Trump dossier, who will instead testify in private. \u2026 Trump said \u201ctime will tell\u201d on whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions stays in his job, after another critical tweet and renewed speculation about the president\u2019s intentions.  Meanwhile, a Justice Department inspector general probe might shed light on other elements of the 2016 election. \u2026 \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee federal criminal prosecutions today defended his work for a Russian bank with a mysterious digital connection to the Trump Organization.\u201d \u2026 Some Democratic groups are asking the Senate to hold off on voting for FBI director nominee Christopher Wray until the Trump administration promises to keep the special counsel. \u2026 Senate Democrats plan to drop a nominee blockade if a repeal of Obamacare fails.   PEOPLE ON THE MOVE  \u2014 Mlika Carroll will join the Internet Association as senior vice president of global government affairs. She comes to the group from the office of Sen. Brian Schatz, where she was a policy adviser.   TWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 We\u2019re gonna need more cat GIFs.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak  EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT ALWAYS UP \u2014 The House this week begins floor consideration of a series of fiscal 2018 spending packages, and a search through the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s bill reports finds cybersecurity in every bill but one. But, as your MC host determined, that doesn\u2019t always translate to spending increases, as the GOP-controlled Congress wrestles with budget pressures. Overall, concluded the story for Pros, big cybersecurity hubs like the Defense and Homeland Security departments trended toward increases, while departments with smaller cyber footprints would often see decreases in their cyber funding.  Story Continued Below  The bill reports also give a sense of appropriators\u2019 policy priorities. For instance, the Financial Services and General Government report notes that while appropriators are \u201caware\u201d of legislative efforts to upgrade aging federal information technology programs, the bill allocates no money (yet) for the most prominent bill that would do so, the House-passed Modernizing Government Technology Act (H.R. 2227). The reports also sometimes reflect how cybersecurity has infiltrated less-expected corners of the federal government, with the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill report noting that since U.S. Cyber Command and others moved into the NSA campus at Fort Meade, parking has become a major headache. More for Pros here.   ANOTHER RUSSIA AMENDMENT BID, AMID SANCTIONS VOTE \u2014 Democrats are trying to throw Russia-related amendments at one of the House spending packages (H.R. 3219) due on the floor this week. Rep. Brendan Boyle proposed amendments to two different sections of the bill to prohibit the United States from sharing sensitive cybersecurity information with Russia, although one Republican, Rep. Leonard Lance, offered a similar amendment, too. Reps. Bill Pascrell and Anthony Brown offered amendments preventing the administration from returning compounds to Russia that President Barack Obama vacated in response to alleged Russian election interference. Not all of the proposed cybersecurity amendments are Russia-related, however: Reps. Jim Langevin and Marc Veasey want to add $10 million to a Defense Department cyber scholarship program. The amendment bid comes as the House is set to vote today on Senate-passed Russia sanctions legislation that is expected to be approved with broad bipartisan support.

INTEL PUSH FAILS AMID RUSSIA PROBES \u2014 House Democrats scuttled an initial attempt to move the annual intelligence authorization bill Monday night, with lawmakers defeating the measure in a 241-163 vote. On Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blasted Republicans for their plan to bring the bipartisan legislation to the floor under suspension of the rules, an expedited process without amendments that requires a two-thirds majority. The move is \u201cunacceptable when critical intelligence decisions are being made that impact America's national security, and while the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are leading investigations into Russia's continued efforts to undermine our democracy,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her colleagues. The argument apparently worked. \u201cOn its merits, I believe the [intelligence policy bill] should and will become law," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on the chamber floor. But he added that the bill \u201cshould go through regular order so that members may offer amendments.\u201d   RUSSIAN HACKERS TOO GOOD, PUTIN TELLS TRUMP \u2014 Trump has recently taken to saying Russian hackers are too smart to be detected, casting doubt on their culpability for the Democratic National Committee hack \u2014 an idea he reportedly got from Russia\u2019s president directly. After meeting with Vladimir Putin two weeks ago in Germany, according to The New York Times, Trump \u201cemerged to tell his aides that the Russian president had offered a compelling rejoinder: Moscow\u2019s cyber operators are so good at covert computer-network operations that if they had dipped into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s systems, they would not have been caught.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201claughable\u201d notion, according to cyber experts, and contradicts even his hand-picked intelligence and national security leaders, who say Russia was behind the election season attacks.   SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING \u2014 The Trump administration must work harder to ensure that law enforcement agencies can access suspects\u2019 data when it is stored abroad, according to a leading technology think tank. \u201cExisting legal processes and treaties are woefully out of date and needlessly complex. Countries have mismatched legal assistance treaties, conflicting laws, and differing norms,\u201d the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said in a report released Monday. Cross-border data access has become a thorn in the side of American investigators, and the Justice Department is currently entangled in multiple lawsuits over its use of the Stored Communications Act to demand user information stored on overseas servers. ITIF said its report offered \u201ca path forward\u201d for U.S. policymakers to press other countries over access to foreign-stored data. \u201cSettling questions of jurisdiction over data will require global reforms,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cHowever, the United States can and should lead the way on these reforms.\u201d   SOME 702 DOCS \u2014 Documents obtained this month by the American Civil Liberties Union via a Freedom of Information Act request detail numerous \u201ccompliance incidents\u201d related to how the NSA implements its procedures under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a controversial surveillance program due to expire at year\u2019s end. The incidents include misuse of procedures for when the NSA destroys incidentally collected domestic communications, when it collects more information than it is supposed to and how it documents why it has targeted an individual. \u201cAmericans should be alarmed that the NSA is vacuuming up their emails and phone calls without a warrant,\u201d said Patrick Toomey, staff attorney for the ACLU\u2019s national security project. \u201cThe NSA claims it has rules to protect our privacy, but it turns out those rules are weak, full of loopholes, and violated again and again. It is time for Congress to embrace significant reforms that rein in this spying and give Americans the privacy protections they deserve.\u201d   A PEEK UNDER THE HOOD \u2014 The United States must be more transparent about its offensive cyber capabilities and its willingness to use them if it wants to deter cyberattacks and promote discussion of international norms, according to a former senior Pentagon official. \u201cBeing clear about U.S. capabilities would be a first step towards a more informed dialogue with the American people about the role they will and will not play in U.S. foreign policy,\u201d wrote Michael Sulmeyer, the former director of cyber policy plans and operations in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, in a blog post for the Council on Foreign Relations. When it comes to deterrence, he argued, \u201cthe problem is not the lack of definitions, but a lack of consensus about what bad conduct in cyberspace really needs to be stopped.\u201d Sulmeyer, now the director of the Cyber Security Project at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, also said the U.S. needed to have \u201ca more holistic conversation\u201d about cyber defense. \u201cThe U.S. defensive posture against cyberattacks,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis often comparable to a man leaving money on his lawn overnight and being outraged the next morning to find it stolen.\u201d   RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Christopher Krebs will serve as the Homeland Security Department\u2019s assistant secretary for infrastructure protection, a position expected to have a leading role in 2018 election security. \u2026 Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said he \u201cdid not collude\u201d with Russia during the 2016 elections, on the day he met with the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its Russia probe. \u2026 House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes is expected to sit in on Kushner\u2019s session with his panel today, despite stepping aside from the Russia investigation. \u2026 Top Senate Judiciary Democrat Dianne Feinstein wants Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify before the panel over a reported meeting with Russia\u2019s ambassador during the campaign where they discussed policy issues. \u2026 Trump continues to humiliate Sessions and might replace him.   A federal judge rejected a demand from the Electronic Privacy Information Center for Trump\u2019s election commission to conducta privacy assessment before gathering state voter data. \u2026 \u201cThe U.S. and Japan agreed during a meeting late last week to deepen their cybersecurity partnership on issues ranging from botnets to critical infrastructure, according to a joint statement.\u201d \u2026 The U.K. is pouring nearly $19 million into a cybersecurity innovation center.

aV \u000a            By TIM STARKS  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak  FOLLOW THE LEADER \u2014 The U.S. may have to follow European governments on encryption policy, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division admitted over the weekend. \u201cThe terrorism challenges in Europe are really kind of tough, and they may lead the way and carry some of our water on this,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security Dana Boente at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colo., over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how that goes,\u201d he added during a panel on balancing security and liberty issues.   Story Continued Below  The Trump administration has pressed tech companies to come up with a method that let law enforcement access encrypted communications, but has withheld from pushing for a legislative mandate. European countries such as the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have moved to implement laws that force tech companies to hand over locked data. \u201cIf enough countries do that,\u201d Boente said, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find some technological brilliance that will provide the necessary security but still allow the government to do it.\u201d His comments represent the bluntest admission by a senior Trump administration official that Europe, which has been rocked by several deadly terrorist attacks in the past two years, is racing ahead of the United States to propose, debate and enact laws targeting locked data.  Boente denied seeking a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into encrypted products and services like Apple\u2019s iPhone, saying he only wanted to ensure that investigators could execute court-approved search warrants. \u201cTo say that we can\u2019t have a system that is secure [in which], with appropriate judicial oversight, [communications are] provided to the government in a criminal investigation \u2014 I just don\u2019t accept that narrative,\u201d he said. Security experts, though, describe any guaranteed-access scheme as creating vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit. But Boente noted that American technology companies would soon have to meet the European demands to hand over encrypted communications. \u201cWhen you have a number of large countries with large market shares that are going to require this, I think you\u2019ll find a change,\u201d he said.  Elsewhere at Aspen, current and former intelligence officials bluntly and obliquely criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to cybersecurity issues, including:  \u2014 THAT RUSSIAN CYBER PARTNERSHIP: NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers offered a veiled rebuke of his boss when asked what he thought of Trump\u2019s proposal to establish a cybersecurity partnership with the Russian government. \u201cNow is probably not the best time to be doing this,\u201d Rogers said during a panel where he and his British counterpart discussed security threats. Trump proposed and quickly walked back the idea shortly after his G-20 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but both Trump\u2019s homeland security adviser and a Russian official later said they were still interested in some form of dialogue. Rogers, who in addition to leading the NSA also oversees the military\u2019s cyber warfare unit, said a cyber partnership with Russia was \u201csomething that you might want to build over time\u201d if the Trump administration saw \u201cchanges in [Russia\u2019s] behavior.\u201d  \u2014 DISRESPECTING THE PROS: Trump\u2019s disparaging of the intelligence community and his continuing unwillingness to accept its Russian meddling conclusion are \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d former CIA Director John Brennan said at the conference. Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper offered withering criticism of Trump for claiming that the intelligence community\u2019s Russia findings were politically motivated and that career staffers were part of a \u201cDeep State\u201d campaign to undermine his presidency. \u201cI was particularly distressed by, when in a foreign country Poland, he\u2019s disparaging his own intelligence community, which, to me, put him at a great disadvantage in the run up to the meeting with President Putin,\u201d said Clapper. Added Brennan: \u201cThese types of comments are just disgraceful, never should have happened and the person who said that should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d  HAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

TRUMP STILL NOT SOLD ON RUSSIAN HACKING \u2014 Trump still doesn\u2019t accept the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election, according to his newly-installed White House communications director. \u201cHe basically said to me, \u2018Hey you know, this is, maybe they did it, maybe they didn't do it,\u2019\u201d Anthony Scaramucci said during an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The president\u2019s seemingly ingrained position contradicts that of his national security team. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty clear and easy answer to this and it\u2019s 'yes,'\u201d White House homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert said just a few days ago when asked if Moscow tried to manipulate the election. Scaramucci said the president views the media\u2019s drumbeat of Russia election-meddling coverage as an attack on Trump\u2019s November win. \u201cThe mainstream media position on this, that they interfered in the election, it actually, in his mind, \u2018What are you guys suggesting? You are going to delegitimize his victory?\u2019\u201d he said.  RUSSIA SANCTIONS LEGISLATION DUE THIS WEEK \u2014 \u201cNegotiators in both parties on Saturday released a sweeping sanctions deal that does not include changes President Donald Trump's administration sought to make it easier for him to ease penalties against Russia,\u201d our POLITICO colleagues Elana Schor and Heather Caygle report. \u201cThe accord on a package of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea is set for a House vote on Tuesday, according to the announcement from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office. To resolve a partisan clash over giving House Democrats the power to force a vote blocking Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow, the deal expedites House consideration of any anti-Trump vote that the Senate has already passed.\u201d It\u2019s expected to pass by a broad bipartisan vote. Trump is reportedly now prepared to accept the bill.  ALSO THIS WEEK: THE NEW CISA \u2014 The House Homeland Security Committee is set this week to mark up legislation that would reorganize DHS\u2019s main cybersecurity wing. The draft legislation, sponsored by Chairman Mikel McCaul, would rename the National Protection and Programs Directorate as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, elevating it from a headquarters component. Outgoing DHS officials who worked under President Barack Obama repeatedly identified the idea as the top thing Congress could do to bolster cybersecurity efforts at the department. The Wednesday markup also includes on its calendar a bill (H.R. 3202 (115)), sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, that would require a DHS report on the federal government\u2019s procedures for disclosing software vulnerabilities it discovers.  ALSO ALSO THIS WEEK: GAO REPORT, COMMITTEE HEARINGS \u2014 Rep. Steve Chabot said late last week that a cyber-focused Government Accountability Office report critical of the State Department was coming down the pike. \u201cNext week, the GAO will release a report about suppliers to State Department\u2019s critical telecommunications infrastructure that will raise serious concerns about the security of foreign-purchased equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn light of the report, I will be making substantial recommendations to the State Department to strengthen its cybersecurity to help protect our national security.\u201d Chabot, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, is also holding a hearing of his panel Wednesday on cybersecurity insurance and how it can help protect small business.  Also Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on cyber diplomacy, featuring the State Department\u2019s outgoing cybersecurity coordinator, Christopher Painter. The week also brings three noteworthy committee meetings on Russia and election interference. The Senate Intelligence Committee is slated today to meet behind closed doors with Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and a top adviser, and the House Intelligence panel will meet with Kushner the next day. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold its own hearing on election interference Wednesday. Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort are listed as witnesses, but panel leaders said they wouldn\u2019t appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing after reaching an agreement to cooperate with the committee.  WHAT WE LEARNED \u2014 The technical standards agency NIST\u2019s cybersecurity framework has emerged as a key tool for promoting international cyber standards, according to an agency report published late last week. The report summarized what NIST learned from a May 16-17 workshop at its Gaithersburg, Md., headquarters, where industry, academia and government converged to discuss the framework\u2019s applicability to vulnerability disclosure, corporate governance, cyber insurance and the international environment.   \u201cMany private sector organizations engage foreign governments to encourage their consideration of the Framework or publication of complementary national frameworks,\u201d the agency said. \u201cNIST will continue reinforcing those private sector discussions with government-to-government dialogue.\u201d The agency also said in the report that it was expanding its focus on federal agencies\u2019 use of the framework, which is now a requirement under President Trump\u2019s cyber executive order.   WHY NOT US? \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission launched a series of cybersecurity blog posts late last week, with the inaugural edition focusing on why the FTC doesn\u2019t always pursue data breach cases. The commission said it takes into account whether a company took strong steps to protect information and whether the situation involved significant loss of sensitive information. It also considered whether other agencies have primary jurisdiction for specific circumstances. The blog post series emerges from industry demands that the FTC supply more guidance on when it decides to go after companies over digital intrusions. \u201cBusinesses have asked us to keep the guidance coming, which is why we\u2019re announcing a new initiative, Stick with Security,\u201d the agency said. Expect a new blog post every Friday for the next few months, according to the FTC.  CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET SERVICES \u2014 China and Russia are both stepping up their game against virtual private network, or VPN, software that allows people to circumvent their internet censorship systems, though for very different reasons. Beijing\u2019s actions are part of an effort to update its digital Great Firewall, a term used to describe the set of internet restrictions China imposes within its borders. Dozens of China-based VPN providers have already been shut down and some located overseas have experienced cyberattacks. Russia\u2019s parliament, meanwhile, outlawed VPN services in what they claim is bid to combat the spread of extremist material online. The measure still has to be approved by parliament\u2019s upper chamber and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin before it can go into effect.  RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 The top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence committees are warning Trump against pardoning former campaign aides under investigation for alleged ties to Moscow. \u2026 A top Obama administration official defended how the former president responded to election interference. \u2026 Some Republicans are tying Russia to environmental groups, citing hacked documents as part of their evidence.  TWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 It never hurts to have another big-league set of eyes on the problem.  QUICK BYTES  \u2014 Microsoft is going after Russian hackers in court. The Daily Beast.  \u2014 Sen. Ron Wyden scolded the FCC over not providing an analysis of an alleged malware attack, with the agency saying in a Freedom of Information Act request that it has no such records. Ars Technica.  \u2014 Local governments are using Russia-based Kaspersky Lab products despite the recent federal action. The Washington Post.  \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed a co-founder of the company that produced that controversial Trump dossier. The Hill.  \u2014 Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice met with the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its Russia probe. CNN.  That\u2019s all for today. Just saying.

aV \u000a            By DARIUS TAHIR  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from David Pittman (@David_Pittman) and Arthur Allen (@arthurallen202)  TRUMP AND VA UNVEIL TELEHEALTH INITIATVE: In an event at the Roosevelt Room Thursday, President Trump and VA Secretary David Shulkin promoted several new telehealth initiatives in the department:   Story Continued Below  \u2014 Big new reg: The most surprising for longtime readers is a new regulation allowing doctors to treat patients anywhere in the VA through telemedicine, regardless of location or state licensing laws. Shulkin called it "Anywhere to Anywhere VA Health Care."   Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, Senate Veterans Affairs Chairman Johnny Isakson and others in Congress were pushing for the change through the VETS Act (S. 925 (115)). A patient in northwest Iowa\u2014 such as Ernst, herself a vet \u2014 couldn\u2019t see a doctor in nearby Omaha, Neb., for example, because of arcane licensing VA rules. But the legislation was opposed by the American Medical Association.   Shulkin, we\u2019re told by those close to the issue, pressed for change after taking over as secretary, after championing the cause while undersecretary for health. The VA drew upon the advice of the Justice Department to make sure it was on solid legal ground. The devil is in the details, since the regulation hasn\u2019t been published, but look for the text over the next couple of weeks.   Ernst was pleased with the announcement, as were groups pushing for changes in telemedicine licensing like the National Council of State Boards of Nursing. \u201cUnder the current law, VA-employed providers can practice in any state without needing to obtain additional licensure when delivering in-person care,\u201d the group wrote Shulkin last month. \u201cNCSBN supports extending that same license portability for VA-employed providers who deliver care via telehealth so long as they maintain a valid state license.\u201d  Read the VA\u2019s announcement of the plan here and watch the video of Shulkin and Trump here.   \u2014 And an app or two, too: Also announced was a new mobile app called VA Video Connect, making it easier for veterans to connect with providers by video on their phones or computers. There\u2019s also a nationwide rollout of an appointment scheduling app.  \u2014 Praise and a suggestion: The American Telemedicine Association was delighted by the licensure announcement, and encouraged the White House to go a step or two farther: \u201cWe encourage President Trump to issue an Executive Order to eliminate the state-by-state licensure model for all federal and private-sector health professional employees servicing federal government programs \u2014 notably agencies (such as the VA and the Department of Health and Human Services), health benefit programs (such as Medicare and TRICARE), federally-funded health sites (such as community health centers and rural clinics), and during federally-declared emergencies or disasters.\u201d  \u2014 Whether this would be legally possible is an interesting question.   Health IT Now also praised the decision; its director, Joel White, thanked \u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Shulkin for expediting this process.\u201d   \u2014 A little tidbit: Teladoc paid the law firm of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas $320,000 to lobby on issues \u2014 including telehealth expansion within the VA \u2014 from June 2015 until it dropped the issue from lobbying disclosure forms starting early this year. Could it see the VA was going to build its own system and not use a system like Teladoc\u2019s? The company didn\u2019t respond to our questions.   \u2014 From the White House event: Shulkin demonstrated the telemedicine technology to Trump during the White House event, patching him into a call with Albert Amescua, a 26-year Coast Guard veteran at a VA clinic in Grants Pass, Ore., and Brook Woods, a VA internist in Cleveland.   The Oregon clinicians attending to Amescua transmitted a photograph of his skin for Woods to review, although we didn\u2019t learn what Woods might have been looking for\u2026   \u201cI hope your skin is going to be in perfect shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLooks pretty good to me, but what do I know.\u201d Trump then instructed Watts to \u201cmake sure his skin is perfect.\u201d  eHealth tweet of the day: Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump Our GREAT VETERANS can now connect w/ their VA healthcare team from anywhere, using #VAVideoConnect - available at: http://mobile.va.gov/appstore .

CONGRESS \u2014 NOMS NOMS NOMS (AND MORE): Congress went through a flurry of activity Thursday, which we\u2019ll helpfully recap for you:   \u2014 Nominees: Many, many nominees were confirmed for many, many positions. These included four HHS nominees (Lance Robertson, Assistant Secretary for Aging; Robert Kadlec, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Elinore McCance-Katz for Assistant Secretary for Mental Health; Jerome Adams for Surgeon General); three FCC commissioners (Ajit Pai, Jessica Rosenworcel, Brendan Carr); and three VA nominees (Thomas Bowman, deputy secretary for Veterans Affairs; Brooks Tucker, assistant secretary of Veterans Affairs; and James Byrne, general counsel). Unclear if a partridge and a pear tree will get approval today. Morning eHealth is keeping an ear out for a voice vote to that effect.   \u2014 FDA user fees: The Senate approved the FDA user fee bill by a 94-1 margin, with Sen. Bernie Sanders voting against. The user fees are pretty big for digital health. The bill authorizes a new category of over-the-counter hearing aids, a victory for the bipartisan group of legislators \u2014 running the spectrum from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Rep. Marsha Blackburn \u2014 who championed the measure.   The bill also gives new funding to a cadre of digital health employees. Given the agency\u2019s new digital health regulatory plan, those dollars could be quite important. \u201cThis measure will help ensure the agency has the funding needed to continue roll out of its Digital Health Innovation Action Plan and can set the stage for faster approval of health IT products, improved testing for preclinical innovation tools, and other reforms,\u201d said Joel White.   Finally, the funding will mean more dollars to the agency\u2019s surveillance programs, which rely on data from EHRs and claims forms.   \u2014 Jessie\u2019s Law: The Senate gave the thumbs-up \u2014 by unanimous consent \u2014 to Jessie\u2019s Law, which is intended to highlight patients\u2019 opioid addictions to doctors, so that they don\u2019t unwittingly contribute to an overdose. The bill directs HHS to come up with \u201cbest practices\u201d on the subject. There were some privacy concerns from Sen. Rand Paul, but they were solved.   \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to mess with HIPAA laws. We didn\u2019t want to violate any of that. We just thought there was a better way,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin told POLITICO.   Despite passage, those supporting the change called it only a \u201cgood first step.\u201d  Manchin says he\u2019ll introduce legislation soon that will give substance abuse records the same level of protection as HIPAA provides. Today, patients must sign off on such doctors viewing those records. Jessie\u2019s law must still pass the House, but next-step legislation is already being touted by Rep. Tim Murphy, who has already authored such a bill (H.R. 3545 (115)).  \u2014 Behavioral health bill: Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rob Portman introduced a bill Thursday for behavioral health providers seeking EHRs. The bill targets psychiatric hospitals, community behavioral health centers, residential and outpatient mental health and substance use treatment facilities, as well as clinical psychologists and social workers, and would get them EHRs through a CMS Innovation Center demonstration project.   FCC VOTES: The FCC unanimously approved three rural broadband items \u2014 one on a public notice for an auction of $2 billion over 10 years for providers interested in hard-to-service areas; the second an order helping to sort out which areas will receive the commission\u2019s Mobility Service Fund (for wireless); and a third concerning broadband data collections. You can see the full hearing here.   ONC UNVEILS NEW TESTING TOOL INITIATIVE: ONC is putting the call out for privately developed testing tools for the certification process. In general, such tools serve as ways to ensure EHR output is consistent and accurate \u2014 say, that the clinical measures reporting tool gives the same data every time.   ONC is describing the initiative as a way to harness the best of the private sector. The private sector has made major investment in the tools and "we don't want to make double investments," Posnack said in an interview.  Private sector tests may in some instances be better than the public tools, Posnack said, adding that by making a call for such tools, he hoped to encourage the best to emerge.  \u2014 GAO announces its part of the Health IT Advisory Committee roster: The Government Accountability Office announced its appointments for the Health IT Advisory Committee. They are: Michael Adcock, of the University of Mississippi Medical Center; Christina Caraballo of Get Real Health; Tina Esposito of Advocate Health Care; Brad Gescheider of PatientsLikeMe; John Kansky of Indiana Health Information Exchange; Kensaku Kawamoto of University of Utah; Denni McColm of Citizens Memorial Healthcare; Brett Oliver of Baptist Health; Carolyn Petersen, of Mayo Clinic\u2019s website; Terrence O\u2019Malley, of Massachusetts General Hospital; Raj Ratwani, of MedStar Health; Sasha TerMaat, of Epic; Andrew Truscott, of Accenture; Sheryl Turney, of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield; and Denise Webb, of Marshield Clinic. You can see a full list of these individuals\u2019 accomplishments here. Congressional leaders have announced four members: Anil Jain, of IBM; Patrick Soon-Shiong, of NantWorks; Steve Ready, of Norton Healthcare; and Steven Ready, of Sutter Health.   APPLICATIONS: Ever wanted to apply to stuff? Morning eHealth lives to serve. Here are some applications you can fill out:  \u2014 Hardship exceptions: CMS rolled out its application for hardship exceptions to the Quality Payment Program. Apply here. Also, if you are a first-time participant in the EHR incentive program, and want a one-year reprieve from MIPS, you can apply here by Oct. 1.   \u2014 Precision medicine studies: If you have a cool study on precision medicine, Health Affairs is requesting abstracts for its May 2018 issue. Submissions are due Aug. 14; more information here.   NOTES ON TELEMEDICINE: A few notes on telemedicine to share:   \u2014 Teladoc earnings call: The telemedicine company held its second-quarter earnings call Thursday. Its CEO, Jason Gorevic, wasn\u2019t giddy about the prospects of Medicare reimbursement. \u201cI think I would call it a long, gradual march,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to see positive steps, sort of one bill at a time that chip away at the barriers to larger-scale telehealth adoption and reimbursement, but I haven\u2019t yet seen a silver bullet come through in something that I think is going to change the game over night.  \u2014 Willis Towers Watson survey: A survey by the consultancy regarding employers\u2019 health care plans shows continuing enthusiasm for telemedicine. 78 percent of the 555 employers who responded said they offered telemedicine, and 16 percent are planning or considering adding the benefit in 2018.   WHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING:   Kansas City Star finds Express Scrips contributed $10,000 to Eric Greitens\u2019s inauguration.

aV \u000a            By DARIUS TAHIR  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from David Pittman (@David_Pittman)  CONGRESS \u2014 TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS: Congress took care of some items on its to-do list Wednesday, with some other important items coming up this morning. To wit:   Story Continued Below  \u2014 NOMINEES ADVANCED: A slew of HHS nominees got the Senate HELP Committee\u2019s thumbs-up on Wednesday: Lance Robertson (Assistant Secretary for Aging), Brett Grior (Assistant Secretary for Health), Robert Kadlec (Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response), Elinore McCance-Katz (Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use) and Jerome Adams (Surgeon General).   Separately, the Senate Commerce Committee gave its blessing to Ajit Pai, Jessica Rosenworcel, and Brendan Carr \u2014 all nominees for the FCC.  \u2014 Mental health data bill tweaked before Senate vote: HHS will establish \u201cbest practices\u201d for sharing patients\u2019 opioid addiction histories rather than create a standard for them appearing in EHRs, according to the updated bill provided to POLITICO. A vote on the bill is expected by the full Senate. Jessie\u2019s Law, named after a woman who overdosed after being prescribed oxycodone by a doctor who didn't know she was once addicted to painkillers, is expected to pass the Senate as a stand-alone bill with the FDA user fee bill.   The original bill, first introduced last April and then refiled in March by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, would direct HHS to create a standard that would display patients\u2019 opioid addiction history in electronic medical records. The updated bill has HHS \u201destablish best practices\u201d for sharing information about a patient\u2019s past opioid addiction, when that information is shared by the patient with his or her healthcare provider. Advocates of the change wanted to make it easier for doctors to know when a person with an addiction was sitting on the exam table before prescribing a drug that could cause a patient to relapse. The sharing of such information is currently barred by a 1970s-era law known as 42 CFR Part 2. A one-pager of the bill is here.   \u2014 Budget chair moving on? Tennessee Rep. Diane Black, a Republican often involved with a variety of health IT issues, announced she\u2019s running for governor Wednesday. The Republican primary is next August.   Black has been the lead sponsor of the CONNECT for Health Act (H.R. 2556 (115)), which would greatly expand telemedicine payments. She also pushed for relief from the ICD-10 coding update and helped gain exemption from meaningful use requirements for ambulatory surgical centers.   The Nashville Tennessean says Black is \u201cwidely considered a front-runner to an already-crowded Republican field.\u201d  \u2014 FDA vote today? Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander signaled a vote on the FDA user fee bill might come today \u2014 a welcome turn of events for industry and FDA alike. There were jitters that Congress would be too slow to approve the uncontroversial (as it\u2019s turned out) user fee bill, and thereby deprive the agency of needed funds.   \u2014 Also today: The Senate Finance Committee will consider two HHS nominations: Matthew Bassett for Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Robert Charrow for HHS general counsel.   \u2014 Resolved: Sens. Roger Wicker and Brian Schatz introduced a resolution affirming support for 5G mobile broadband Wednesday.   KUSHNER ON VA: White House adviser Jared Kushner\u2019s pep talk to a swarm of Congressional interns got attention for the burning issues it contained \u2014 Israel-Palestine peace, for one example. But we at Morning eHealth, after taking a listen to the full audio (posted here by Wired), noted another interesting subject: the Cerner/VA deal.   Kushner explains that getting the deal done is \u201cone of the great successes we\u2019ve had so far\u201d in overhauling the department. Here\u2019s how, according to Kushner, the deal got done: He was \u201ctalking about the issue\u201d with David Shulkin, and they called Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Mattis and Shulkin convened the top five EHR guys from each department.   \u201cWe said, guys, we want a solution to get us on one system. This is absolutely crazy,\u201d Kushner said, and apparently, the group of EHR experts were given a deadline of two weeks to solve the problem. They managed to solve the whole thing in that time \u2014 when, by comparison, \u201cthey\u2019ve been holding Congressional hearings since 2000. Sixteen years and nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d  eHealth tweet of the day: Chinmay Singh @cagefreesingh [re: the Epic/Simon discussion on patient access to full medical records discussed in Wednesday\u2019s Morning eHealth] Faulkner is right. If laymen cd understand medical records then @Yelp reviews wd be full medical terms as opposed to "no one answers phone"[For a full perspective on that debate, we also enjoyed David Shaywitz\u2019s and Eric Topol\u2019s tweets on the subject.]  THURSDAY: Your correspondent fears he is getting old, as he has been complaining practically all week about a locked-up hip that twinges at odd moments. (All moments are odd moments, since again, your correspondent fears he is getting old. Such twinges were not present in his youth.) Why did this occur? This is the worst part: your correspondent doesn\u2019t really know, besides speculation about \u2014 and this sounds really quite lame \u2014 a kayaking jaunt.

BIG CMS RULE DROPS: CMS dropped its final hospital payments rule Wednesday evening. When it comes to health IT, it\u2019s just what the hospitals wanted: they\u2019ll only need to report over a 90-day period in 2018, as opposed to the entire year; and they won\u2019t have to do a full-bore switchover to 2015 certified EHRs for at least one more year.   Clinical quality measures reporting requirements will also be reduced. As is typical for final rules, the agency summarizes comments before discussing them. When it comes to clinical quality measures, we found this summary amusing: \u201cHospitals have had challenges with data mapping (aligning the information available in an electronic health record (EHR), particularly if the information is not located in a structured field (for example, PDF attachment, free text section) \u2026 \u201d   Or, to sum up: interoperability is hard and expensive. It\u2019s probably not surprising that the agency is still affirming its intention to reduce the quality reporting burden. It writes: \u201cOur goal for the future is to continue to align those quality measurement requirements and to adopt a more streamlined set of clinical quality measures \u2026 \u201d   Naturally, hospitals are pleased; the American Hospital Association specifically praised the \u201cagency allowing hospitals and critical access hospitals to report meaningful use modified Stage 2 in 2018, as well as implementation of a 90-day meaningful use reporting period in fiscal year 2018.\u201d   FIRST IN MORNING eHEALTH \u2014 VIRTA HEALTH SNAGS FORMER CMS HEAD FOR BOARD: Startup Virta Health \u2014 which is hoping to reverse patients\u2019 type 2 diabetes \u2014 announced today that it had snagged former CMS administrator Don Berwick to serve on its board of directors. The board also features luminaries like former Sen. Bob Kerrey, among a crew of prominent researchers and academics.   SUPERCOMPUTING: NIH got the second piece of a really fast computer Wednesday, the agency\u2019s prime contractor announced.   LAWSUIT STILL ON: A class action lawsuit regarding a 2014 data breach of CareFirst Inc. is still on, notes Business Insurance. At issue is whether the damages arising from a data breach are strictly hypothetical or likely to occur.

aV \u000a            By DAVID PITTMAN  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Darius Tahir (@DariusTahir)   BIDEN, EPIC TALK MEANING OF \u2018EASY TO UNDERSTAND\u2019: Former Vice President Joe Biden took to task an Epic executive who questioned during a January meeting of the Cancer Moonshot why patients should have their full medical record, a Biden aide recounted Tuesday. Epic CEO Judy Faulkner asked Biden during an (until now) private meeting between EHR executives and administration officials, \u201cWhy do you want your medical records? They\u2019re a thousand pages of which you understand 10,\u201d recalled Greg Simon, who worked on the moonshot and is now president of the Biden Cancer Initiative.   Story Continued Below  Biden responded, \u201cNone of your business,\u201d according to Simon, who detailed the conversation during a MedCity conference in Philadelphia. \u201cIf I need to, I\u2019ll find someone to explain them to me and, by the way, I will understand a lot more than you think I do,\u201d the former VP said.   \u201cAnd it went downhill from there,\u201d Simon said.   \u2014 Someone familiar with the exchange tells us that Epic\u2019s comments were focused on the just-passed 21st Century Cures Act, which sets a goal of having patient records in a \u201csingle, longitudinal format that is easy to understand.\u201d The company\u2019s argument: How is having a thousand pages easy to understand?   The exchange was about a subjective portion of a recently enacted law. Epic supports a patient's right to access their full medical record, the company said.  Simon told Morning eHealth later via email the issue was that EHR companies \u201cwant to make \u2026 and are required to make \u2026 only summaries available.\u201d Instead, Simon prefers to \u201cfocus on [the] complete digital record.\u201d   Simon\u2019s account of the event offers a glimpse at the frustration the Obama White House faced in getting EHR companies to share patient records, despite giving billions in incentives for doctors and hospitals to buy systems. The software wasn\u2019t reaching its potential despite years of investments. \u201cWe\u2019ve made billionaires of the executives of these companies,\u201d Simon said of EHR vendors. \u201cThey\u2019ve had fun. Now, it\u2019s our turn. Let\u2019s get this thing changed.\u201d   Pro subscribers can revisit our coverage of the meeting here.   \u2014 Later in Tuesday\u2019s talk, Simon called concerns about HIPAA limiting data sharing \u201coverblown.\u201d   \u201cThat is not coming from the patient community, the HIPAA concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the legal community and the consumer community.\u201d He contends the overblown concerns about privacy and security are creating artificial barriers to doctors getting the patient information they need.   Watch the full chat here. Talk about data blocking, HIPAA and information sharing start around the 11:20 mark and run until 17:15.  McCONNELL MOVES FDA BILL FORWARD: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion to proceed to the FDA user fee reauthorization bill Tuesday night, meaning a procedural vote on the bill should come by Thursday. However, GOP aides said leadership is working on an agreement that could speed up a vote on the bill, (H.R. 2430 (115)), so it could come sooner this week.  \u2014 HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander told reporters there\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t pass the bill quickly. Remember it includes more money for the FDA\u2019s digital health work, expanded use of EHR data for device reviews and oversight as well as creation of a class of over-the-counter hearing aids.   eHealth tweet of the day: Thomas Goetz @tgoetz: Hospitals should do this to their staff.

TELEHEALTH GETS LOVE FROM HHS NOMINEE: The HHS nominee to be the first-ever assistant secretary for mental health gave a nod to telemedicine as a way to better combat mental health treatment shortages during her confirmation hearing Tuesday. As Pro\u2019s Adam Cancryn reports, Elinore McCance-Katz said care providers beyond psychiatrists, like nurses, should be able to treat mental health issues and that telemedicine is one way to reach more people.   MOVEMENT ON TRUMP NOMINEES: The Senate HELP Committee will vote on McCance-Katz\u2019s nomination and several others later today. Meanwhile, the Commerce Committee is expected to also approve three FCC commission nominees today. The goal is to get all of them into a \u201ccleared package\u201d of nominations, a process of negotiation now between Senate leaders and with the hope of confirmation before August recess, our friends at Morning Tech tell us.  FDA PILOT TO START SOON: The FDA plans to start the first of a "phased approach" for its digital health pilot next month, Darius reports. The agency wants to create a "pre-certification" program that endorses certain developers, rather than their products, as high-quality. \u201cThe first phase will involve three of the eventual nine participants,\u201d Darius writes. \u201cThe agency is hoping to have a public event in January to discuss its interim findings.\u201d More for Pros.   TELEMEDICINE\u2019S CBO STRUGGLES OUTLINED: Medicare\u2019s complex system of paying for health care makes it harder to predict whether expanding telemedicine payments will actually save the government money. The Congressional Budget Office explained as much in its score of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s chronic care bill (S. 870 (115)), released Tuesday. While paying for tele-stroke care would help keep patients healthier, Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for long-term care, which would presumably see savings from fewer stroke victims or less serious cases. Instead, Medicare gets the bill for more stroke treatment up front, the CBO said.   \u2014 While allowing accountable care organizations greater freedom to use telemedicine, Medicare would pay more in bonuses to those ACOs, who would be more likely to hold down costs because of using telemedicine. More here and the CBO score here.   CONCERNS WITH VA\u2019S CERNER SWITCH NOTED: With the VA's switch to the Cerner EHR looming, the Pew Charitable Trusts is pressing the agency to further patient matching and adopt better standards. Pew also singles out the VA\u2019s patient-matching struggles and other patient safety enhancements. The letter.   REACTION TO OPIOID REPORT: The Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness and Health IT Now separately called for the White House\u2019s opioid commission to finalize preliminary recommendations around enhanced interstate data sharing between state prescription drug monitoring programs. The recommendation would be a \u201csmart step forward and, if fully implemented,\u201d Health IT Now executive director Joel White said.   \u2014 New Hampshire Democrat Rep. Ann McLane Kuster demurred there was \u201clittle new in its findings,\u201d pointing to a June report from the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force that had similar recommendations including about privacy laws and PDMPs.   CHIME, AEHIS BACK DEVICE-CYBER BILL: CHIME and its cyber-focused sister organization have endorsed a bill that would raise the expectations for the cybersecurity of medical devices. The bill (S. 1656 (115)) by Sen. Richard Blumenthal would mandate a publicly available cyber report card and allow devices to upgrade the security of products without the FDA\u2019s OK.   \u201cThe recent cyber attacks underscore the importance of this legislation,\u201d said Deborah Stevens, board chair of the Association for Executives in Healthcare Information Security.

Chris Christie, which issued some preliminary recommendations on Monday. The panel wants to have state and federal prescription drug monitoring programs sharing information on patients\u2019 prescribing histories by July next year. That would include the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Story Continued Below  \u2014\u201cForty-nine states now have PDMPs but not nearly a majority of those are sharing their information,\u201d the 10-page report states. \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d  \u2014PDMPs need to be easier to use and include other data like overdose histories so doctors will be likelier to use them. But the report didn\u2019t offer ways to make this happen.   Update patient privacy protections: The report recommends \u2014 through regulation and law \u2014 alignment with HIPAA. Today, patients\u2019 addiction treatment professionals must obtain written patient consent before sharing information with the person\u2019s other providers. The report called 42 CFR Part 2 a \u201cparticular hindrance to comprehensive health care.\u201d The report even singles out Rep. Tim Murphy\u2019s recently reintroduced Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act (H.R. 3545 (115)), which would give substance abuse records the same level of protection as HIPAA, as a necessary step.   Other recommendations:   \u2014Use \u201cbig data analytics\u201d to devise targeted prevention messages   \u2014Develop CMS quality measures for substance use screenings and addiction treatment.   Not mentioned:   \u2014Using telemedicine to expand treatment options or changing the Ryan Haight Act to make prescribing anti-addiction drugs easier.   \u2014The full report. The final report is due Oct. 1.  eHealth tweet of the day: Steven J. Stack @StevenStackMD: Umm, or "This is a 43 year old man." Gotta love EHR voice recognition dictation![See the picture Stack, a former AMA president, tweeted to see the diction system\u2019s blunder.]  Welcome to Tuesday Morning eHealth and welcome to August, a time typically filled with slow-news days and out-of-office messages. But 2017 hasn\u2019t been a typical year in health care, so why should we expect August to be any different? Share tips and story ideas with dpittman@politico.com and connect with us on Twitter @David_Pittman, @athurallen202, @DariusTahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.   HOW TO MEASURE INTEROPERABILITY: Everybody in health care wants it easier to share patient records among doctors and hospitals, but how do we know how well providers or IT systems are hitting that goal? ONC floated a framework this spring based on measuring how widely interoperability standards were used by health IT vendors and providers. On Monday, public comments were due on that ONC draft. We summarize some notable responses below.   CHIME: Standards aren\u2019t to the point where they are worth measuring because each is used so broadly that together that don\u2019t offer a clear picture of information sharing.   HIMSS: Agrees, overall, that measuring standards adoption could help advance interoperability. \u201cMeasurement is critical to understanding how to improve efforts in this space.\u201d   EHR Association: A particular measure being widely used doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s successful, but volume shouldn\u2019t be ignored while other analysis are developed. \u201cSuch insights can help clarify when standards are ready for national adoption and to be included in a widely-supported standards floor for sentinel use cases.\u201d  Health IT Now: Measuring is a tool to expedite information exchange. \u201cOver reliance on counting successful transmissions will devalue actual improvement on use of data in improving care and allow the mere capability to exchange information to remain the future goal for health systems.\u201d  American Medical Association: Over measuring can place an undue burden on providers. \u201cSignificant attention must be paid to the value/burden ratio when developing a participant reporting system.\u201d   For what it\u2019s worth: The Obama administration\u2019s suggestion last summer for measuring interoperability was simply to use data on the number of doctors and hospitals sending, receiving, querying and integrating that information into practice for decision-making.   COMING TODAY, THEN TOMORROW: The Senate HELP Committee will hold a confirmation hearing on five senior HHS officials this afternoon. But on Wednesday, the panel will vote on sending their nominations to the Senate floor, HELP announced Monday. Those being considered include, Jerome Adams for surgeon general; Brett Giroir for assistant secretary for health; Robert Kadlec for assistant secretary for preparedness and response; Elinore F. McCance-Katz for assistant secretary for mental health and substance use; and Lance Robertson for assistant secretary for aging.   HILL WANTS TV AIRWAVES FOR BROADBAND: A bipartisan group of forty-three House lawmakers wrote the FCC Monday urging it repurpose unused television airwaves to broadcast high-speed internet to underserved America. Microsoft draw attention to the matter last month when it announced it would use so-called TV white spaces to offer the internet to 2 million rural Americans. The lawmakers, led by Rep. Kevin Cramer, say TV white spaces "have strong potential to revolutionize broadband internet accessibility in rural areas" and create dependendable internet connections that are "extremely cost-effective requiring minimal infrastructure investments." Cramer secured sign-on from senior Republicans such as House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) and Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), as well as tech-friendly Democrats including Reps. Peter Welch (Vt.), Suzan DelBene (Wash.) and Anna Eshoo (Calif.).   \u2014The letter drew the liking of the App Association, a supporter of telehealth and rural broadband expansion. They explain how repurposing unused television airwaves can help health care in this blog post.   FIRST IN MORNING EHEALTH: Eighty-two percent of health care executives say the never-ending battle to repeal Obamacare hasn\u2019t delayed their work on population health management. In fact, the survey of nearly 200 c-suiters from data analytics firm Health Catalyst found a small number \u2014 4 percent \u2014 are ramping up efforts on population health. Anecdotal evidence to this point had suggested hospitals were slowing their spending on health IT given the uncertainty in health care because of repeal-and-replace talk.   DON\u2019T BE AFRAID TO TAKE A CHANCE: If more Medicare ACOs operated in a model where they stood to lose money if they didn\u2019t sufficiently hold down costs, they\u2019d actually make money by taking on the risk, an analysis by Avalere Health found. In fact, 80 percent of such \u201cone-sided risk\u201d ACOs could have shared in $178 million if they had worked in a \u201ctwo-sided risk\u201d model and chanced losing money if they didn\u2019t hit Medicare-set spending targets.   \u2014\u201cFor those physicians who were dipping their toes in the water with low-risk ACO models, the incentives now make it advantageous for a majority of them to move more aggressively into greater accountability for population health,\u201d Avalere executive or former ONC official Josh Seidman said.   ON THE MOVE: Karen Groppe, who has been working part-time with HIMSS\u2019s government relations team in Washington for a couple of years, is joining the organization full-time as director of corporate communications. She\u2019ll be working with the HIMSS folks in Chicago more.   \u2014Former Army surgeon general, Lt. Gen.

POLITICO\u2019s Paul Demko and Heather Caygle scoop that a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers will unveil a slate of Obamacare fixes today \u2014 including cost sharing reduction payments, state stabilization funds and repeal of the medical device tax \u2014 they hope will gain traction after the Senate\u2019s effort to repeal the law imploded. Meanwhile, partisan efforts on repeal continue, despite leadership saying it\u2019s time to \u201cmove on.\u201d   Story Continued Below  There are two other pressing health issues facing Congress; reauthorizing the FDA\u2019s collection of industry user fees and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Senate leaders haven\u2019t given an indication when the FDA user fees will get a floor vote. (It\u2019s already cleared the HELP Committee and the full House.) More on CHIP reauthorization below.   OTHER HEALTH LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS MOTOR ON:   Substance abuse records bill introduced: Rep. Tim Murphy on Friday introduced legislation that gives patients' substance abuse treatment records the same level of protection as HIPAA, making it easier to share information among providers. Under a federal law known as 42 CFR Part 2, patients must sign off on each individual provider who can view such records. Changes in regulations around the law that took effect this year do allow a patient to make a general disclosure that allows record-sharing among doctors but only within a health system. "You cannot treat the whole patient with half of their medical record,\u201d Murphy said in a release.   Murphy\u2019s Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act (H.R. 3545 (115)) is supported by the Partnership to Amend 42 CFR Part 2 Coalition, which includes the American Hospital Association and many others.   Policymakers are making progress on bringing Part 2 into the 21st century, recognizing the problem with opioid addiction and other behavioral health issues, said Kevin Scalia, executive vice president at behavioral health IT vendor Netsmart. If those concerned about their privacy want to opt out of having their data shared \u2014 let them, Scalia said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t, because of those minority of people, stop the majority of people who want to share.\u201d  Another week, another telemedicine bill: Reps. Doris Matsui and Bill Johnson have filed legislation (H.R. 3482 (115)) giving the HHS secretary power to waive Medicare restrictions on what telemedicine it covers if the service improves quality of care or reduces costs. The CMS actuary would have to certify that the move would save money. Since each measure would have to be signed by the secretary if it saves money, it's thought the Congressional Budget Office won't contend that it will actually cost the federal government much money and erase a longtime hurdle for getting more telemedicine payments.  What it means: Telemedicine advocates on and off Capitol Hill are frustrated by the lack of progress on getting more Medicare reimbursement, despite years of trying. But realizing the environment they live in \u2014 dominated by Obamacare-repeal work \u2014 pro-telemedicine offices are trying to maintain momentum by introducing bills and keeping talk alive. Quietly, Democrat and Republican offices are saying odds are slim that more substantive telemedicine changes will be attached to larger must-pass bill later this year like CHIP reauthorization \u2014 but they want to stay ready in case an opening appears.   eHealth tweet of the day: JacquiG @JacquiFromSheff: But can your smart phone and telehealth deal with a broken leg, a case of plague, cat stuck in a tree???Retweeted Kainos Evolve @KainosEvolve: Join us & @InTouchHealth 12 Sept to learn more about Telehealth & the benefits of \u201ccare anytime, anywhere\u201d.

CERNER EARNINGS CALL: Lost in all the FDA and repeal-and-fail mess last week was Cerner\u2019s earnings call \u2014 which provided some interesting color from executives of the Kansas City company:   \u2014 VA: President Zane Burke said he expected a contract to install the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 new EHR by the end of the year.   \u2014 The tech giants: In a wonderful dance of euphemism, one analyst asked Burke about unnamed \u201cnon-traditional players entering into the [EHR] space in some way, shape or form.\u201d Amusingly, neither Burke nor the analyst specifically mentioned \u201cApple\u201d or \u201cAmazon,\u201d but we all know what they meant.  Burke expects to beat the tech giants at the EHR game. \u201cThe core transactional EMR is a place where I think we have a significant moat built around us,\u201d he said. He believes that if a software company isn\u2019t focusing specifically on health care and IT, it\u2019ll fail.   \u201cI actually don't think that those that are rumored to be doing things in this space are thinking about how they're going to create the next EHR,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey're thinking about how can they add value into the whole entire health care supply chain and how can they think about making the consumer experience a better one.\u201d   Full transcript here, for those who are interested.   MERCK CYBERATTACK: The Merck earnings call Friday was particularly interesting for our niche because of the cyberattack on the drug giant\u2019s computers last month, which reportedly kneecapped the company\u2019s operations.   The company\u2019s CEO said during the call that the attack halted the production of drugs which will hurt profits for the rest of the year. A full recovery from the cyberattack \u201cwill take some time.\u201d More here.   MARK YOUR CALENDARS: The FDA announced a workshop on incorporating real-world evidence into its decision making. The date is set for Sept. 13. Morning eHealth readers don\u2019t need to be reminded that it\u2019s hard to discuss real-world evidence for too long without drawing data from EHRs and other digital other tools. Find more info in the Federal Register notice.   HOW FOLKS REACTED TO RANSOMWARE: Despite FBI advice to not pay ransomware attackers to get them to release hostage data, that\u2019s exactly what 40 percent of surveyed health organizations are doing, according to a KPMG survey out today. Fewer than 20 percent actually worked with authorities on criminal action. The survey quizzed 100 c-suite executives at health care providers and health plans. More than a third said they were hit by ransomware in the past year.   Related: \u201cRansomware victims have paid more than $25 million in ransoms over the last two years, according to a study presented today by researchers at Google, Chainalysis, UC San Diego, and the NYU Tandon School of Engineering,\u201d The Verge reports.   WHAT TO WATCH TODAY:The presidential opioid commission chaired by Gov. Chris Christie is set to release its interim report today, our New Jersey colleague Katie Jennings reports. Among the recommendations will be more education for physicians about opioid prescribing. While the New Jersey governor didn\u2019t directly say prescription drug monitor programs would be mentioned, he did hint at it strongly while talking to reporters last week.   \u2014\u201c If you look at it, the amount of opioids that are being prescribed in this country would allow every adult to be medicated 24 hours a day for three weeks,\u201d Christie said, noting that four out of five heroin addicts start with prescription drugs. We\u2019ll be on the lookout.   LATER THIS WEEK:  Tuesday The Senate HELP Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for several HHS nominees, including Jerome Adams for surgeon general, Brett Giroir for assistant HHS secretary for health and Elinore F. McCance-Katz for the newly created position of assistant secretary for mental health.   WednesdayThe Senate Commerce will vote on three FCC nominations including two Republicans (FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and General Counsel Brendan Carr) and one Democrat (former Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel).  ThursdayThe FCC\u2019s monthly meeting will focus on expanding rural broadband.   The Senate Finance Committee will hold a confirmation hearing on Matt Bassett to be HHS assistant secretary for legislation.   Got an event coming up?

DEVICE TAX LEFT OUT OF SKINNY REPEAL: Within a matter of hours Thursday the medical device tax repeal went from a sure bet for being included in the Senate\u2019s \u201cskinny\u201d Obamacare repeal bill to being out. It\u2019s now back on the table in the aforementioned bipartisan offer, albeit as a three-year suspension. The full repeal of the tax was left out of the Senate package because it needed to save as much money as the House bill to be considered on the Senate floor, said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show any shortcoming on the part of the medical-device industry,\u201d he told Prescription Pulse. \u201cIn fact, they\u2019ve proven to be remarkably effective to this point.\u201d   ZUCK\u2019S BUCKS GO TO UCSF: Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan, are donating $10 million to the University of California San Francisco. The cash will endow big data guru Atul Butte\u2019s chair, and supporting Butte\u2019s \u201cdata recycling\u201d efforts. As Butte imagines it, he\u2019ll be combining the University of California systems\u2019 disparate EHRs together for a massive ocean of data, which can be analyzed and probed for various insights into health care.

aV \u000a            By DARIUS TAHIR  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from David Pittman (@David_Pittman) and Arthur Allen (@arthurallen202)  DEFEAT FOR OBAMACARE REPEAL IN THE SENATE: Late night drama. Sen. John McCain cast the deciding vote, killing the "skinny" fallback repeal legislation that the Senate had hoped would be the basis for negotiations with the House which had passed a far more expansive bill repealing much of Obamacare and fundamentally altering Medicaid. McCain put a stop to the Republicans' legislative priority -- and saved the top legislative achievement of Barack Obama, the man who defeated him for the presidency in 2008. What's next? Not yet clear. President Donald Trump tweeted "let Obamacare implode." There are also some whisperings of bipartisanship on the Hill.  Story Continued Below  FDA ANNOUNCES NEW DIGITAL HEALTH POLICY REGIME: FDA rolled out a new digital health policy Thursday. The announcement breaks down into two parts: a pilot \u201cpre-certification\u201d program and a broader policy road map. Let\u2019s consider each in turn:   \u2014 Pre-certification program: This is the pilot version of a long-discussed program: a strategy of certifying developers, rather than their products, as a way to deal with the nature of software development. Software, as anyone who\u2019s looked at the \u201cupdates\u201d queue in their iPhone knows, is frequently and iteratively constructed. New additions are processed all the time. That\u2019s long been a tough fit with FDA\u2019s medical device regulations, which allow manufacturers to make trivial updates without oversight (but still need agency approval for more substantive changes).   Hence the idea of certifying developers with sterling records. The pilot program will begin accepting applications Aug. 1, with a view to accepting nine developers Sept. 1. In a conversation with Morning eHealth, the agency\u2019s digital health director Bakul Patel told us that creating the specifics of the program \u2013 defining what a quality developer does, and perhaps whether and how to de-certify one-time good developers \u2013 would be built along with the developers who apply. From there, the agency is looking to unveil a draft version of the program in January.   \u201cCan we identify [a standard of] excellence that meets the small two-person company, and the large organization?\u201d Patel asked. \u201cThose are the goals.\u201d   \u2014 Roadmap: Separately, the agency also introduced a policy roadmap that includes a first-quarter 2018 timeline for anticipated guidance on subjects like clinical decision support and \u201cmulti-functional\u201d software. The clinical decision support software guidance is long awaited; it\u2019s been promised and never released for years now. While everyone Morning eHealth spoke with was upbeat about the policy maneuvers, we did hear some regret that the CDS guidance would be waiting for just a little bit longer. Patel said the delay allows the agency to align all its new policies.   \u2014 Reactions: We had several, and nearly all of them were happy. Let\u2019s start with the elected officials. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the driving force behind the SOFTWARE Act, said the pilot program was a fulfillment of her goals. \u201cBy employing a light-touch regulatory approach and establishing a thorough pre-certification program, developers will be able to efficiently deliver the latest technology to those who stand to benefit most from it,\u201d she said in a statement.   Rep. Gene Green, an early co-sponsor of the SOFTWARE Act, said the program \u201cgives certainty to innovators so we can unleash the next generation of health information technology.\u201d  AdvaMed, the big medical device group, issued a nuanced but upbeat statement. It approves of the pre-certification pilot program, and while the group is happy with most of the proposed guidance, one in particular is concerning: the International Medical Device Regulators Forum\u2019s software-as-a-medical-device guidance. The Forum is an international collaboration of regulatory agencies intended to harmonize medical device regulations; one part of its work has been its software-as-a-medical-device product. FDA has been leaning toward introducing the Forum\u2019s work as a guidance, but AdvaMed believes it doesn\u2019t fit FDA\u2019s statutory framework.   And former FDA commissioner Robert Califf was quite pleased, tweeting, \u201cFDA is leading, not following-much appreciated in Silicon Valley. Digital tech can reinforce healthful behavior & ++ healthcare quality.\u201d  With the official reaction out of the way, let\u2019s take a brief break for tweets and stuff, and then give you some thoughts from distinguished observers.   eHealth tweet of the day: Mats Berggren @Sanktmickel Brilliant regulatory move. #FastTrack 4 #digitalhealth FDA announces pre-certification for digital health start-ups  FRIDAY: Apparently it\u2019s supposed to rain today and tomorrow, creating a reasonably distressing possibility that your correspondent must prepare two sets of weekend plans. We know, there are many worse fates, but you try coordinating disparate groups of people to agree to a plan and a backup plan. You can try coordinating two disparate groups of people to agree to a plan and a backup plan at dtahir@politico.com. You can also try social planning on social media at @David_Pittman, @athurallen202, @DariusTahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.  MORE REACTIONS: We also got some reactions from individuals outside official orbits. Bradley Merrill Thompson, a digital health lawyer with Epstein Becker & Green, told Morning eHealth that it was \u201crather unbelievable how fast FDA is moving in a positive direction.\u201d   \u201cThis stuff is really hard to figure out in the abstract, and it\u2019s really only by working with companies and tinkering and experimenting that we can truly identify the best model,\u201d he said, calling the plan \u201cbrilliant.\u201d He also praised the policy road map as \u201cwell-conceived.\u201d   But who will apply? FDA is hopeful it can select a representative cross-section of developers \u2013 that is, from small and big companies, as well as developers who aren\u2019t traditional medical device manufacturers. Stephen Kraus, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners, is extremely excited about the program, calling it an \u201cexample of great market-driven policy,\u201d but isn\u2019t sure start-ups will rush to apply.   \u201cI doubt a lot of start-ups will have the time or capacity to be participants in the pilot here as they already have so much on their plate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is most smaller companies will pass on being guinea pigs and will wait to see how the regulation and process develops before they engage.\u201d   Another venture capitalist, Vijay Pande of Andreessen Horowitz, said the decision demonstrated the agency was repeating the same sort of process with software as it had with drugs: accommodating new innovations with a balance of oversight.   Looking to the future, Pande suggested that the next area for regulatory adjustment would be machine learning algorithms with diagnostics. \u201cI would expect there\u2019ll be [agency] expectations how to run those clinical trials,\u201d he said, though the software would continue to adjust as it gets more and more data.   FTC HEARING ON INTERSTATE LICENSURE: The chair of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact met with his home-state senator, Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar, and staff of the Federal Trade Commission to discuss ongoing issues with the FBI while in town for an FTC roundtable Thursday, he said.   \u201cMy message was, \u2018We need some help here,\u2019 \u201d Jon Thomas, head of the physician compact, told Morning eHealth following the FTC event on increasing professional license portability. Thomas is frustrated with the FBI, which continues to block access to its criminal background check system for doctors looking to gain approval to see patients in multiple states in the compact. The physician compact has tried \u2014 largely unsuccessfully \u2014 for months to get the FBI loosen its stance.   To date, 174 doctors have applied for a license through the compact, which would help doctors treat more patients through telemedicine. But it could be more, Thomas notes, if the FBI would stop objecting. The bureau says the compact commission isn\u2019t a state entity and therefore states can\u2019t share results of the background check among themselves.   \u2014 Remarks from the chair: FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen, in remarks to kick off the meeting, called convening an FTC task force on licensing one of her first tasks when taking over the commission in January. She wanted to shine a spotlight on the issue, which she called important for consumers and workers alike. \u201cWe plan to continue this dialogue in a number of ways,\u201d Ohlhausen pledged.   OTHER CONGRESSIONAL NON-REPEAL ACTIVITIES: Here are three tidbits on Congressional activities that don\u2019t involve Obamacare:   \u2014 Regulatory reigning-in: Pat Tiberi, chair of the Ways and Means health subcommittee, has no timeline for work on his committee\u2019s recently announced \u201cMedicare Red Tape Relief Project.\u201d Tiberi hopes to scale back regulations for doctors and hospitals, though there\u2019ll first be a public process of soliciting feedback.  \u201cTimelines always got us in trouble,\u201d Tiberi told Morning eHealth. HHS leadership is \u201cwildly interested\u201d in getting congressional feedback. (ONC brass say they\u2019ve already started regulation review around EHRs.) Tiberi is \u201copen-minded\u201d to all ideas and says \u201codds are good\u201d that legislation may result from this.   Remember, the American Hospital Association came up with nine pages of suggestions for the new Trump administration last December, including delays of Stage 3 meaningful use and use of 2015 edition EHRs.   \u2014 Behavioral health IT bill: Last week\u2019s legislation to help get EHRs into the hands of behavioral health providers is \u201ca key first step,\u201d members of the Behavioral Health IT Coalition wrote last week. In a letter made public Thursday, the group praised a bill (H.R. 3331) from Reps. Lynn Jenkins and Doris Matsui that would authorize a CMS Innovation Center project for psychiatric hospitals, community behavioral health centers, residential and outpatient mental health and substance use treatment facilities, as well as clinical psychologists and social workers to buy EHRs. The CMMI demo is a way around the billions the project would otherwise cost.   \u2014 Privacy: Rep. Suzan DelBene re-introduced her Birth Control Privacy Act Thursday, which would prevent wellness programs from disclosing personally identifiable information on birth control usage to employers. The bill was first introduced last session, after a Wall Street Journal report on employers\u2019 use of big data to keep an eye on their workers\u2019 health (and, perhaps, future pregnancies).

aV \u000a            By DARIUS TAHIR  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  VA TO EMPLOYEES \u2014 ZIP YOUR LIPS ON EHRs: Some VA IT officials Arthur has spoken to this week got emails instructing them to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding the Cerner deal with the agency. The emails were directed to people who \u201chave been selected to participate in the planning for an electronic health acquisition,\u201d and it prohibits them from discussing \u201call data, information and software\u201d related to the purchase.   However, many VA officials who got the email aren\u2019t working on the Cerner deal \u2014 yet, anyway. To date, a small group led by military officers who ran the DoD\u2019s Cerner purchase decision in 2015 has been overseeing this acquisition process. Some worried that the NDAs could make it hard for VA employees to give Congress straight dope on the Cerner implementation.   Story Continued Below  \u201cBefore, if VA employees spoke out against the Cerner deal they might have been worried about losing their jobs, but if they were ready to retire they might have taken the chance,\u201d said Nancy Anthracite, director of WorldVista, which commercializes VistA-based software. \u201cThis way they might not even be willing to do that.\u201d  ANNALS OF REPEAL \u2014 THE CONTINUING SAGA: Wednesday was another day slogging through another set of amendments to the Senate\u2019s repeal-and-TBD mystery bill. The Senate rejected a \u201crepeal-only\u201d proposal late in the afternoon, but also rejected a motion to send the process to relevant committees. Tune in today for more potential developments in the health care bill \u2014 including, perhaps, offerings of hundreds of amendments from Democrats.   eHealth tweet of the day: Greg Fulton @glfulton [on Arthur\u2019s open API piece] While the "specter"of regulation can be scary, ONC needs to align API so we don't repeat EHR exchange flaws and face closed API networks.  THURSDAY!: Your correspondent was recently shocked and appalled by news that rock band The War on Drugs is releasing a new album. You see, he\u2019s a fan. That\u2019s (sort of) the problem \u2013 he just learned today that the group had released, like, four or five songs from the album, and just fell down a rabbit hole listening to all of them. Why is this bad? Because your correspondent had no idea this was happening, in this, the epoch of the internet telling you about everything seconds after or even before it actually occurs. What kind of uninformed bozo (when it comes to music) is your correspondent? Tell him at dtahir@politico.com. Discuss socially at @David_Pittman, @athurallen202, @DariusTahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.  TODAY \u2014 FTC ON LICENSING: Today won\u2019t just be about a procession of votes to a health bill that may or may not ever become law. It\u2019s also about the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s event this afternoon on \u201cStreamlining licensing across state lines.\u201d You can see a description and agenda for the event here, but as you can probably guess, medical licensing will be a subject. Participants include Jon Thomas, of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission, and Katherine Thomas, of the Texas Board of Nursing.   The event provides the chance for comments; you can see the 22 comments collected so far (as of this writing) here. By our eye, the most notable is the American Medical Association\u2019s comment, which affirms the organization\u2019s support for the Interstate compact \u2013 with a specific shout-out to telemedicine.   \u201cProponents of telemedicine have often cited the time-consuming state licensure process for multiple-license holders as a key barrier to overcome in order for telemedicine to continue to grow and thrive,\u201d the trade group notes.   HABEMAS HIMSS CEO: HIMSS, the health IT organization, has a new CEO: Hal Wolf. The group announced the accession of the former Kaiser Permanente executive Wednesday.   Wolf has worked with HIMSS for the last four years, two as an advisor and two as a board member. (The last year was spent as vice board chair.) Given his familiarity with the organization, the chance to be CEO was too much to pass up, he told Morning eHealth.   One of his goals as CEO \u2014 aside from growing HIMSS\u2019 global footprint \u2014 is to dive deeper involved in polices around cybersecurity, interoperability and broader innovation. He recited the familiar line about how technology can help improve quality while providing better care at lower cost.    \u201cWhat the challenge [of health IT] has always been the development of information that comes out of EHRs,\u201d he told us. \u201cI think that\u2019s the maturity cycle that is picking up some steam now. It has been slower in its adaption than utilization than I would have hoped for. I think that\u2019s the light at the end of the tunnel that will start to add value.\u201d   Wolf got some attaboys from his peers in the health IT industry. CHIME\u2019s board chair, Liz Johnson of Tenet Healthcare, praised Wolf\u2019s \u201cdepth of experience and leadership skills\u201d in a statement.   INSTALLING EHRs IS COSTLY \u2014 FOR A YEAR: So concludes an analysis from Moody\u2019s of 39 hospitals and health systems. On average, during the year a hospital is converting to an EHR, it sees a 10 percent operating cash flow drop. Bad debt climbs by 4.3 percent in a conversion year, as opposed to 2.6 percent growth in the year after a conversion.   Nevertheless, the investment analysis service expects hospitals will continue to pour money into their EHRs. \u201cHospitals and health systems that enter into risk-bearing agreements with payors, or establish their own risk-bearing insurance products, will need sophisticated data analytics\u201d provided by EHRs, the analysis concludes.   MISSOURI PDMP DRAMA CONTINUES: Missouri continues to be a font of drama on PDMPs, despite Governor Eric Greitens\u2019s executive order:   \u2014 County-level program expands: The more comprehensive drug database offered by the county-by-county PDMP continues to expand. Earlier this week, Greene County elected to join; St. Louis County\u2019s executive \u2014 who\u2019s leading the project \u2014 cheered the decision, saying that about two-thirds of the state\u2019s population was now covered by their program.   \u2014 More questions on the order: The Missouri Times is questioning the process behind Greitens\u2019s order. To recap, Greitens established a state program primarily aimed at law enforcement through his executive order. The program\u2019s data derives from a contract with pharmacy-benefit management giant Express Scripts; the Missouri Times says the $250,000 contract was no-bid \u2014 an apparent evasion of the state\u2019s procurement regulations.   QPP SUBMISSION API PREVIEW: CMS sent around an email advertising a developer preview of its Quality Payment Program submission API Wednesday. (You can email QPP@cms.hhs.gov if you\u2019re interested in getting involved.)   Now, if this acronym pileup tickles your memory, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re a longtime Morning eHealth reader. (Thanks!) We mentioned it in context with the US Digital Service\u2019s July 2017 report to Congress, in which the federal government\u2019s hacker conclave noted that it was developing the API \u2014 which would help software developers create apps and such allowing participants to submit or check up on data easily.   HITRUST COMMUNITY EXTENSION PROGRAM: The HITRUST Alliance rolled out a \u201cCommunity Extension Program\u201d Wednesday. The cybersecurity company is hoping to convene health care organizations at town halls in 50 cities over the next twelve months, which will help educate providers about upping their cybersecurity defenses.   WHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING ON:   CNBC reports that Amazon has a secret EHR team called \u201c1492.\u201d We\u2019re not sure what this is supposed to imply about the, shall we say, indigenous EHR companies.   The Network for Excellence in Health Innovation has a report on the need for greater transparency for consumers.   Yelp is adding data on C-section rates (and more) for 250 California hospitals.

aV \u000a            By DAVID PITTMAN  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Darius Tahir (@DariusTahir) and Arthur Allen (@ArthurAllen202))  LIFE FOR OBAMA OFFICIALS IN A TRUMPIAN WORLD: For former ONC chief and Assistant Secretary of Health Karen DeSalvo, the meeting-packed days are gone along with the weekly trips to and from Washington. Since Donald Trump took office, she\u2019s just a private citizen with a familiar name. \u201cHonestly, you grieve a little bit because these things you\u2019ve been working on and the people that you\u2019ve grown to love, you\u2019re not with them every day, all the time anymore,\u201d DeSalvo told Morning eHealth in an interview from her New Orleans home.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 The first six months of the Trump administration have been trying for some senior Obama administration health care officials, who entered office with strong ideas about how to reform health care that have been largely marginalized by the new government. Few admitted to having expected posts under a President Hilary Clinton, but DeSalvo acknowledged she would have liked to have stayed on. Instead, she\u2019s still searching for her next opportunity during a \u201cself-styled sabbatical.\u201d  Vindell Washington, who took over as HHS\u2019s health IT lead last summer, only to lose the job in January, resurfaced in June as medical director of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. \u201cIt is clear that there\u2019s no other job you can go to where you are concerned about the wellbeing of the entire country,\u201d he said. Yet he didn\u2019t feel that the world was passing him by. \u201cWe all have a role to play. When you get tapped on the shoulder, you go and you play the role. Sometimes, you\u2019re the quarterback and sometimes a right guard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re no less important.\u201d   Helping adjust: In the final days of the Obama administration, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell arranged for tours of the recently opened African-American History Museum on the National Mall. The message was clear for employees who worried their work would be undermined by the Trump administration: social progress had setbacks along the way \u2014 but the trajectory, like the museum\u2019s exhibits, was upward.   Pros get the full story here.   eHealth tweet of the day: liv @livyylove: everyones stressed about our go-live date for the new EHR system but its on my anniversary that I took off so [shrug emoji]  Welcome to Wednesday Morning eHealth where we\u2019re still in the dark as to when the Senate will vote on its FDA user fee bill. After health care (more on that later) comes the Defense reauthorization bill, and it\u2019s not clear yet where user fee fits in.

OBAMACARE UPDATE: It\u2019s hard to follow anything in health care these days that isn\u2019t impacted by the never-ending Obamacare repeal efforts in Congress. On Tuesday afternoon, the Senate GOP narrowly approved a motion to open floor debate on repeal efforts. In the evening, nine Republicans voted against the chamber\u2019s first-draft repeal effort (H.R. 1628 (115)). What happens next? POLITICO\u2019s Paul Demko has you covered.   MORE REACTION FROM THE ONC MEETING: Monday\u2019s ONC meeting on building a trusted exchange network raised a lot more questions than answers, according to self-described health information evangelist Adrian Gropper in a soon-to-be-published blog post. For example:   \u2014 Algorithmic patient identity matching has no solution in sight;  \u2014 Interoperability between HIPAA and non-HIPAA entities has no solution in sight;  \u2014 Different frameworks with different governance principles can only interoperate at a lowest common denominator, frustrating both clinicians and families;  \u2014 All agree that accountability is important but nobody proposed how patients can hold anyone accountable for anything;  \u2014 The 21st Century Cures goal of a Longitudinal Health Record was not mentioned by anyone.  HHS \u2018WALL OF SHAME\u2019 GETS A MAKEOVER: The website listing health care organizations that had patient information stolen or lost has had a bit of a facelift. The new site posts data breaches currently under investigation, listing events reported to HHS over the last two years. The site, overall, is easier to navigate, HHS says. Test drive it here yourself.   \u2014 The 2009 HITECH Act required organizations holding patient information to report to HHS \u2014 and then post online \u2014 when 500 or more patients\u2019 information is lost, stolen or hacked.   AND WE\u2019RE LOOKING TO PARE DOWN EHRS?: Social factors account for anywhere between 20 percent and 40 percent of our health. The rest is genetic, the care we receive or choices we make, like smoking. ONC, recognizing this, wants to better incorporate social, psychological, and behavioral factors into electronic health records. During a half-day webinar today, HHS\u2019s health IT office will take a step toward doing that. ONC has worked with standards development organizations on the issue, and during today\u2019s event health officials will discuss ways to make such tools more usable and interoperable. More information here.   PMI HANDS OUT SOME DOUGH: The NIH announced the first four community partners who will begin building its national network of recruiters for its All of Us Research Program, part of the Precision Medicine Initiative. This initial group of awardees will receive a combined $1.7 million this fiscal year.   CHECK BACK AT A LATER DATE: The House Veterans Affairs Committee has postponed its planned telemedicine roundtable that was set for Thursday. Morning eHealth told you about it Monday, but no rescheduled date has been set.   \u2014 A committee spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond when asked if the cancelation had anything to do with Monday\u2019s setback in a vote to extend the VA\u2019s Choice program, which allows veterans to seek VA-reimbursed care with private providers. The bill failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required under the rules that brought the bill to the floor. Funding for the program is expected to run out by mid-August.   TELEMEDICINE BILL PASSES HOUSE: House lawmakers used little drama in passing by a voice vote the Medicare Part B Improvement Act (H.R. 3178 (115)), which makes monthly, at-home kidney dialysis treatments through telemedicine reimbursable under Medicare despite the program\u2019s otherwise restrictive mandates for payment. The measure is expected to be attached to the CHIP reauthorization bill that must pass in September.   ADD THIS BILL TO THOSE YOU\u2019RE TRACKING: Mississippi Republican Gregg Harper and California Democrat Mike Thompson have quietly reintroduced their Telehealth Enhancement Act (H.R. 3360 (115)). The bill filed in 2015 would add urban critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, home telehealth sites, and counties with fewer than 25,000 people as eligible for Medicare payments for telemedicine. Neither office got back to us in time to say whether the version filed Tuesday contained any changes.   TELLY-HEALTH UPDATE: Our colleague Arthur Allen has been attending the World Congress of Gerontology and Geriatrics in San Francisco this week and had the pleasure of learning about how they do tele-geriatrics in the wilds of northern British Colombia and in Queensland, Australia (they call it \u201ctelly-health.\u201d) Shannon Freeman of the University of Northern British Columbia (a France-sized region with 250,000 residents) described the growing telemedicine program in her region, which increased from about 1,000 to 24,000 teleconferences per year from 2012 to 2017, covering more than 40 specialties. Telemedicine is saving the state\u2019s sparse residents six million miles in travel and about $1.5 million a year, conservatively, reported Freeman. Meanwhile, Queensland University Professor Melinda Martin-Khan described how tele-memory clinics are replacing long drives to Brisbane.   MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The Senate HELP Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for five HHS officials next Tuesday, the panel announced. They include Lance Allen Robertson, assistant secretary for aging; Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health; Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response; Elinore McCance-Katz, assistant secretary for mental health and substance use; and Jerome Adams, surgeon general.   AMIA COMMENTS ON ONC INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS FRAMEWORK: The American Medical Informatics Association is one of the first industry groups out of the gate on ONC\u2019s proposed interoperability standards framework, an April 2017 document outlining the agency\u2019s thoughts on how to measure progress towards interoperability. In the report, ONC separated out two objectives \u2014 measuring which standards are actually implemented in IT products and how (and how much) standards are used when they\u2019re actually used in the field.   AMIA has a few thoughts, but most intriguing is one bottom-line proposal: that ONC try retrospectively reviewing cases. The office could select specific types of care \u2014 say, congestive heart failure \u2014 in which coordination would be expected. In those instances, if care is being done well, there\u2019d likely be a high amount of data-sharing. To confirm, auditors armed with questionnaires could interview congestive heart failure patients about whether the interoperability, in fact, occurred.   Comments are due Monday and we\u2019ll be on the lookout for what others have to say.   WHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING:  HIPAA is obstructing advanced genomics work on cancers like the one that struck Sen. John McCain, advocates of more data sharing argue in a Washington Post op-ed.   Traditional hearing aids are only slightly more effective than their over-the-counter counterparts, a new study found.   Data breaches in health care are up 30 percent in the first half of the year, according to a new report.   Trump\u2019s war on data hasn\u2019t materialized.   Tips, comments, suggestions?

aV \u000a            By DAVID PITTMAN  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Darius Tahir (@DariusTahir) and Arthur Allen (@ArthurAllen202)  SOME TRUSTED EXCHANGES: Monday at the Hubert H. Humphrey building, a conclave of health IT experts got together to help begin one of ONC\u2019s 21st Century Cures Act duties \u2014 defining a trusted exchange framework. The future of information exchange is widely perceived to be between networks. In order to accomplish those exchanges, different networks will need rules of the road \u2014 which is the purpose of getting all these folks together.  Story Continued Below  \u2014 Rucker talks new use cases: ONC head Don Rucker set out the broad agenda for ONC, which includes defining \u201ctechnical definitions of interoperability; technical definitions of information blocking; [and] technical definitions of API.\u201d Then he drilled into some of the specific use-cases of information exchange. Some of those will be familiar: exchanging data between providers, or consumers getting access to their data.  But Rucker included an interesting third category which isn\u2019t often dwelled upon: payer access to data. \u201cCan bulk payers get at the data and compare what they\u2019re getting?\u201d he asked. Later, in a brief chat with Morning eHealth, Rucker elaborated: because American health care involves large institutions negotiating against each other, accountability requires that each of the large entities have enough data. Including insurers. \u201cIt really goes beyond one provider sharing with another provider.\u201d   \u2014 Laying down markers: The emphasis from many of the big payers in information exchange was to reuse, repair, and not recreate existing capabilities in information exchange. David Kibbe, the Direct Trust CEO, and Mariann Yeager, of the Sequoia Project, circulated a statement to Morning eHealth urging ONC to \u201cleverage existing trust frameworks that have presence in the market and broad adoption nationally,\u201d \u201crecognize and appreciate the diversity of different data and information sharing approaches\u201d and note that the private sector was hard at work on trusted exchange already.   The Yeager and Kibbe tag team got a third partner during the public comment section of the meeting: Sasha TerMaat, an Epic executive speaking on behalf of the Electronic Health Record Association. She urges ONC to leverage \u201call of the effort\u201d that had gone into creating technical specifications and network-building.   That consensus was, to our ears, present on more than the floor. Kory Mertz, a former ONC staffer now with Audacious Inquiry, gave a presentation noting the diversity of approaches among different networks \u2014 for accountability, for the use of technologies like record locator services, and so on.   \u201cEach organization was founded at different time, with different set of stakeholders, for different purposes,\u201d Mertz said. At a later point \u2014 when emphasizing the multitude of paths different organizations traveled down \u2014 he noted that it wasn\u2019t as if \u201cone approach is better than another.\u201d   So a prescriptive approach in this area appears unlikely, at least by our ears.   IS THIS NOT CUTTING IT A BIT CLOSE?: Related to ONC\u2019s carrying out the 21st Century Cures Act, HHS is seeking applications for the newly-formed Health IT Advisory Committee. The HHS secretary appoints three people to the 25-member panel. But the GAO, which names 14 seats, issued a similar call early this spring, and congressional leaders have been busy naming their choices.   eHealth tweet of the day: Lucia Savage @SavageLucia: I wish refs to "local governance" in @ONC_HealthIT event today would distinguish between laws (change = hard) & org policies (change easier)  Welcome to Tuesday Morning eHealth where we are starting \u2014 finally \u2014 to watch Game of Thrones. Your author hadn\u2019t seen a single episode but watched the first two of Season 1 over the weekend. Only about six dozen more episodes to go. Reach out at dpittman@politico.com and connect with us on Twitter @David_Pittman, @athurallen202, @DariusTahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.   HEALTH IT LOBBYING PLUMMETS UNDER TRUMP: Morning eHealth has long suspected that debate around Obamacare repeal has sucked the preverbal oxygen out of the room. Now we have data to support that.   The number of groups lobbying Congress on MACRA dropped to 58 in the second quarter this year, more than a 25 percent drop from the 81 working on it in the same period last year, according to a POLITICO analysis of recent lobbying disclosures. Organizations lobbying on MACRA spent just over $18 million in the last three months, compared to more than $27 million in the same period in 2016. Those dropping the issue include Humana, AARP, Premier along with several state hospital associations.   \u2014Not only has Obamacare diverted attention, but the Trump administration\u2019s HHS is now run by folks more sympathetic to doctors and hospitals clamoring for a lighter legislative touch, lobbyists we spoke with said. HHS Secretary Tom Price, as a member of Congress last year, helped push HHS to lower the bar on MACRA. \u201cWith Dr. Price as the head of HHS, that congressional oversight is less critical. There is still public comment on the rule, but that technically would not require disclosure as its not direct lobbying,\u201d said Anders Gilberg, senior vice president of government affairs at the Medical Group Management Association.   Meaningful use: The number of groups listing \u201cmeaningful use\u201d fell nearly by half, from 64 last year to 34 this year. Since MACRA did away with the term for doctors, hospitals and Medicaid providers are the only ones left under meaningful use. As a result, lobbying on the topic was mostly done by hospitals.   Telehealth: The number of times \u201ctelehealth\u201d was listed in disclosure reports went from 82 this time last year to 64 in the quarter that just wrapped up. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why that would be, especially because there are more opportunities for progress on telehealth this year than there were last year,\u201d Krista Drobac, executive director of the Alliance for Connected Care, told Morning eHealth.   \u2014Groups like CVS Health, the ERISA Industry Committee, Intel and LeadingAge have all stopped lobbying Congress on the issue. The ERISA Industry Committee said telehealth legislation at the federal level has been in Medicare and Veterans Affairs, domains outside of the group\u2019s immediate focus. Intel said it was working more with the Alliance for Connected Care.   SECOND QUARTER LOBBYING NUMBERS FOR OTHER NOTABLE HEALTH IT GROUPS: Epic: $36,000Athenahealth: $180,000Cerner: $30,000Allscripts: $46,800McKesson: $212,000Siemens: $1,010,000CHIME: $15,000 West Health Institute: $20,000Health IT Now: $40,000Teladoc: $50,000 Alliance for Connected Care: $75,000Federation of State Medical Boards: $150,000  MEDICAL SCRIBES BILL PASSES HOUSE: The House passed a bill (H.R. 1848 (115)) that would create a two-year, 10-hospital pilot for using medical scribes in the Veterans Affairs health system. The pilot would cost $5 million and result in periodic updates to Congress and a \u2014 Congress would have more information to expand the program. There\u2019s no similar legislation in the Senate.   COMING TO THE HOUSE FLOOR TODAY: The House will vote on a bill (H.R. 3178 (115)) that, among other things, allows Medicare coverage of at-home end-stage renal disease treatment via telehealth. The overall bill would cut federal spending by $4 million over a decade, and the Congressional Budget Office has said previously that the measure is budget neutral.   Related: Members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus want to eliminate the CBO\u2019s budget analysis division \u2014 never a friend to the telemedicine world by its predictions covering the technology would balloon the federal budget \u2014 in amendments set to be offered to bills that fund the government.   THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU: The House Ways and Means Committee wants to work with doctors, nurses and others to cut the red tape and regulatory burden around health care through an effort it\u2019s calling the \u201cMedicare Red Tape Relief Project.\u201d The first step involves fielding feedback from health care groups. Responses are due by Aug. 25. That will be followed by roundtables and finally action.   \u2014Washington\u2019s doctor and hospital lobbies are sure to have a long list of ways to change the EHR incentive program, Stark Law and other billing programs \u2014 all involving health IT \u2014 as possible suggestions for the committee.   IT EXPENSES ON THE RISE: Physician practices spent between $2,000 and $4,000 more per employee on IT between 2015 and 2016, according to an MGMA survey. The overall practices paid between $14,000 and $19,000 on average for their IT systems. While the survey didn\u2019t dive into reason for the increase, likely options include maintaining EHRs and patient portals. Also, MGMA\u2019s health IT policy guru Rob Tennant said doctors are being more aggressive with their practice management software.   ICYMI: HEALTH IT EXEC SENTENCED: Sreedhar Potarazu, the ophthalmologist-turned-health IT entrepreneur who at one point had Newt Gingrich and Tom Daschle on the board of his data analytics firm VitalSpring Technologies, was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison. Potarazu defrauded investors of $49 million and committed $7.5 million in tax fraud, Justice Department officials said.

aV \u000a            By ARTHUR ALLEN  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from David Pittman and Darius Tahir  WHAT DOES \u201cWITHOUT SPECIAL EFFORT\u201d REALLY MEAN? The phrase deep inside the 21st Century Cures Act sets up a tricky little puzzle for ONC\u2019s new chief as he ponders the best way to get better usability and more interoperability into health care.   Story Continued Below  \u2014 With its budget slashed by a third, ONC\u2019s primary duty over the coming year is to fulfill the dictates of the Cures Act, including a section seeking to clear barriers to the flow of health data. On page 337, the law requires EHR vendors to make patient data accessible \u201cwithout special effort, through the use of application programming interfaces.\u201d Many EHR vendors are already developing the types of APIs required in Stage 3 of the meaningful use program. The question is, will these interfaces fit with the intent of the Cures Act? More than that, will they fulfill IT\u2019s promise to improve health care?  \u2014 They won\u2019t, some leading health IT advocates told me, unless the ONC regulates them. EHR vendors must create common, public APIs, in this view, writing the interfaces to specs that allow any eligible app to easily be popped onto any ONC-certified EHR. \u201cThe most useful form of interoperability is substitutability,\u201d says Harvard Medical School professor Kenneth Mandl, director of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program.   \u2014 Others, such as Argonaut Project leader Micky Tripathi, are leery of too much government intervention in setting standards for exactly how the APIs should look.   \u2014 The final decision is in the hands of ONC director Donald Rucker, who seems to bel open to suggestions.   The whole story for pros here.  Tweet of the Day: Harlan Krumholz @hmkyale Nice explanation by @Atul_Gawande for why hard for #AI and #bigdata to make diagnoses; the art is in eliciting info.   Welcome to Monday Morning eHealth from glorious San Francisco, where the Giants suck this year, a fact that is satisfying the schadenfreude needs of non-Bay Area sports fans. Share your undignified glee with aallen@politico.com, or tweet something spicy @David_Pittman, @athurallen202, @DariusTahir, @POLITICOPro, @Morning_eHealth.   SPEAKING OF INTEROPERABILITY \u2026 ONC today is hosting the first of three events to gather information about successful network-to-network exchange of health information as outlined in the Cures Act. As part of the meeting, ONC will share a recent analysis of existing frameworks that support the flow of health information across various networks, and principles for enabling trusted exchange. More here.   \u2014 The info-sharing networks Sequoia and DirectTrust took the occasion to issue joint recommendations on ONC\u2019s effort. In a statement to POLITICO, Sequoia\u2019s Marian Yeager and DirectTrust\u2019s David Kibbe encouraged the agency to leverage existing trust frameworks so as to avoid disruption or duplication of the activities of existing national exchange networks, such as their organizations. They also discouraged ONC from seeking a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to trust frameworks and urged the agency to recognize the diversity of different data and information sharing approaches.   \u2014 Genevieve Morris, ONC\u2019s principal deputy national coordinator, told Morning eHealth earlier this month that HHS was looking to resolve what she described as a roughly 20 percent difference among the various health information exchanges operating today. Our David Pittman asked Jitin Asnaani, executive director of the CommonWell Health Alliance, about that, but Asnaani wasn\u2019t sure what 20 percent Morris was referring to. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is and I don\u2019t know if that 20 percent is something that is actually reconcilable or not,\u201d Asnaani told us. \u201cI\u2019m more excited than nervous, but I\u2019d like to know what those differences are.\u201d   \u2014 Sounds like it could be an interesting day for those of us deep in the weeds enough to understand what\u2019s being discussed.  GETTING EHRS TO MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS: Reps. Lynn Jenkins and Doris Matsui last week introduced a bill (H.R. 3331) that would authorize a CMS Innovation Center project to incentivize behavioral health providers to buy EHRs. The program would apply to psychiatric hospitals, community behavioral health centers, residential and outpatient mental health and substance use treatment facilities, as well as clinical psychologists and social workers. More EHR use in mental health would improve care for patients and collaboration with physical health providers, goes the reasoning. But expanding meaningful use to that segment of health care would cost billions that Congress won\u2019t spend. Creating a program within CMMI might be a way around that.   \u2014 On a related matter, CMS\u2019s Innovation Center last week announced a September summit to design a payment and delivery model for behavioral health providers. The Federal Register notice specifically calls out telehealth as an item that CMS wants to hear about.   HOUSE ACTION ON VETERANS TELEMEDICINE: The House Veterans Affairs Committee on Thursday will hold a roundtable on telemedicine, the committee confirms to Morning eHealth. The agenda wasn\u2019t announced, and such events are typically closed to the press, but we expect licensing to be one issue that arises. Congress has long dragged its feet on easing medical licensing requirements so doctors can see patients in multiple states more easily via telemedicine. But some in the industry are trying to rally support for the VETS Act (H.R.2123), which would allow doctors to treat veterans anywhere in the VA system regardless of location. The AMA has successfully suppressed congressional action on the bill, though Senate Vets Chair Johnny Isakson has voiced his support for it.   NURSING COMPACT GOES LIVE: North Carolina last week became the 26 state to enact the enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact, triggering it to take effect in six months, the group is announcing this morning. The FBI has raised legal issues with the interstate physicians\u2019 compact over the sharing of FBI files on doctors, but it hasn\u2019t created the same difficulty for the nursing boards, said David Benton, chief executive of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing. The licensing compact should enable more telemedicine visits because it allows nurse providers to be licensed more quickly and easily in multiple states.  EVERYBODY\u2019S HEARD ABOUT THE BYRD RULE: But did you know that a 60-vote Senate majority is needed to repeal a tiny eHealth section of the Affordable Care Act? The provision in the GOP bill would require HHS Secretary Tom Price to report to Congress recommending whether expenditure data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) is preferable to data from state CMS-64 reports for making certain Medicaid decisions. There. Now you know.   FCC IS ALL EARS: The Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Connect2Health Task Force on Friday announced that it will convene several virtual listening sessions, starting Aug. 7, to generate more input on broadband health issues. The agency will also keep the rural broadband expansion docket open for comment on its Website through Sept. 29. Four listening sessions will held: for health care providers, administrators and CIOs; rural advocacy groups; telecommunications carriers and manufacturers, and finally for lawmakers and state and local health officials. Get a message to the FCC by the end of this week if you want to participate. More details here.   THE ORACLE OF WATERTOWN: Athenahealth\u2019s latest earnings call didn\u2019t contain any direct reference to the big drama consuming the company \u2014 the stock purchases by activist investor Elliott Management \u2014 but CEO Jonathan Bush provided a few interesting tidbits:   \u2014 \u201cMIPS has been largely defanged,\u201d he said \u2014 echoing what our own David Pittman pointed out about a month ago \u2014 and as a result, doctors won\u2019t need to buy new EHRs to improve their performance.   \u2014 The Trump administration, Bush said, deserves credit for helping athenahealth gain designation as a qualified entity, which allows the company to access Medicare claims data and provide a more complete electronic health record for its clients. The government ships the data on \u201ca drive in a padded envelope by certified mail,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe have people on eBay now looking for machines that can receive this drive.\u201d   \u2014 But CMS is \u201cearnestly trying,\u201d he said. Athena is also getting claims data from \u201call the commercial payers,\u201d he said. Full transcript here.

"We've added ... more than a million private sector jobs," Trump said on June 1, when the Labor Department's tally was about 600,000. On Monday White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, "We've created over a million new jobs since [Trump] took office," when DOL's tally was 863,000. With the Labor Department reporting today that the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, Trump can finally say, truthfully, that he's created more than a million jobs since entering office. Trump tweeted shortly after the report's release "Excellent Jobs Numbers just released \u2014 and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!"  Story Continued Below  July\u2019s jobs number was a decrease from June, when the economy added 231,000 jobs. But unemployment ticked down to 4.3 percent, compared to June\u2019s 4.4 percent. Average hourly private-sector earnings were up 2.5 percent over the previous year, as they were in June. The pattern of job growth in 2017 remains essentially the same as in 2016. According to the Labor Department, an average of 184,000 jobs per month have been created this year, compared to 187,000 in 2016. If you eliminate January, when President Barack Obama was still in office, the monthly average is a somewhat lower 179,000.   Analysts reacted positively to today's jobs report. "Kind of all-around strong headline number," Tony Bedikian, head of global markets for Citizens Bank, told  CNBC. "More people are coming into the labor force and finding jobs. It's difficult to find anything really negative in the report." Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted the creation in July of about 178,000 jobs, an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, and an over-the-year increase in hourly earnings of 2.5 percent. The payroll company ADP estimated Wednesday based on its own records that private-sector job growth in July was 178,000. More here.   GOOD MORNING!

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took aim at Nissan Thursday as balloting began at its Canton, Miss., plant. In an op-ed published in the Guardian, Sanders accused the auto company of launching \u201cone of the most vicious, and illegal, anti-union crusades in decades.\u201d Nissan supervisors, Sanders wrote, \u201chave called workers off assembly lines for one-on-one interrogations. Anti-union videos are being run on a constant loop in employee break rooms. Groups of workers have been called into \u2018roundtable\u2019 meetings to hear management disparage the United Auto Workers (UAW).\u201d (These allegations surfaced in a lawsuit brought by an NLRB regional director and in complaints from the UAW.)   \u201cCorporations like Nissan know that if they stop workers in Mississippi from forming a union, wages will continue to be abysmally low in this state,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cFurther, if workers are unable to form unions and engage in collective bargaining, Americans throughout this country will continue to work for longer hours for lower wages. As Americans, our goal must be to raise wages in Mississippi and all over this country, not engage in a destructive race to the bottom.\u201d   DNC chairman and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez weighed in with an op-ed of his own in USA Today. \u201cThey\u2019ve intimidated workers by threatening plant closures, pay cuts and all-out retribution against those who vote yes,\u201d Perez wrote. \u201cThese threats aren\u2019t only immoral, they\u2019re illegal. In fact, the National Labor Relations Board has recently filed multiple charges against the plant for unfair labor practices." Polls are scheduled to close at 7 p.m. today. Read Sanders here and Perez here.   ACOSTA DEFENDS TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION: Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Thursday seconded Trump\u2019s endorsement of a bill that would halve the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. over a decade. Speaking at the Western Governor\u2019s conference in South Dakota, Acosta said immigration can be \u201clegal and appropriate\u201d when a business can\u2019t fill a job, but that \u201cso much immigration\u201d involves foreign workers taking jobs that U.S. workers could fill, the Associated Press reports.   Most economists disagree. A 550-page report published last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found \u201clittle to no negative effects on overall wages and employment of native-born workers in the longer term.\u201d And in April, 1470 economists, Democrat and Republican, signed a letter by the nonprofit Center for a New American Economy that said "the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh their costs."

AFT JOINS ARMS WITH PUERTO RICO TEACHERS UNION: The American Federation of Teachers and the Asociacin de Maestros de Puerto Rico \u2014 which represents 40,000 teachers on the island \u2014 voted to affiliate Thursday. Both parties signed a trial affiliation agreement that will carry over through the next three years, as AFT works with AMPR and its locals to expand collective bargaining in the financially-embattled U.S. territory. \u201cEvery country wants to improve its economic and social situation, but in Puerto Rico teachers haven\u2019t been treated fairly,\u201d AMPR President Aida Diaz said. \u201cWith the AFT, we can work hand in hand to improve our working conditions and reclaim all that has been denied to us.\u201d   BORDER WALL BLUES: Trump\u2019s campaign trail vision of a 35-foot concrete wall that spans half of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border is starting to look a touch \u2026 unrealistic. (Did we mention Mexico would pay for it? More on that below.) \u201cSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) and three other Senate Republicans rolled out legislation on Thursday making it clear that, in their view, a stand-alone wall running the length of the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 a core Trump campaign promise \u2014 isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d report POLITICO\u2019s Seung Min Kim and Ted Hesson.   \u201cThe legislation, called Building America\u2019s Trust Act, would allot $15 billion over four years for what its backers call \u2018smart, multi-layered infrastructure\u2019 along the southern border,\u201d the pair write. \u201cThat may include a wall, fence, levees, technology or other barriers, according to a summary of the bill. \u2026 Trump may still insist that funding for the border wall be included in any must-pass government spending measure due by the end of September, provoking a potential government shutdown.\u201d   Cornyn appears to have done his homework. His legislation is backed by the National Border Patrol Council, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and the Southwest Border Sheriffs Coalition, among other law enforcement organizations, and he said he incorporated suggestions from DHS as well. \u201cThe Texas Republican stopped short of saying Trump backs the measure, but he sounded optimistic,\u201d POLITICO reports. \u201cWith this president in the White House, we think we have an ally who will help us,\u201d he said. More here.   PLEASE BABY PLEASE BABY PLEASE BABY BABY BABY: A transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto in late January indicated that the newly elected American president was fretting about his campaign promise to make Mexico pay the cost of building the wall. The transcript, published by the Washington Post Thursday, showed Trump pleading with Pea Nieto \u2014 not unlike Mars Blackmon, the character Spike Lee played in his 1986 comedy, "She's Gotta Have It" \u2014 to stop saying Mexico wouldn't pay. "The fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind," Trump said, "because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall \u2014 I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period, and the reason I say they are going to pay for the wall is because Mexico has made a fortune out of the stupidity of U.S. trade representatives." Trump told the Mexican president that he "cannot say [Mexico won't pay for the wall] to the press. The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances."   Pea Nieto was unmoved ("My position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that Mexico cannot pay for that wall"), and even Trump conceded the dispute was, as a substantive matter, trivial. \u201cBelieve it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut politically this might be the most important [to] talk about.\u201d Read POLITICO's summary here and see the whole transcript here.   TILLIS OPTIMISTIC ON H-2B: The Homeland Security Department added 15,000 additional H-2B guest worker visas last month, far below what businesses had hoped for. Employers can use the visas to hire temporary foreign workers in non-agricultural sectors, such as landscaping, but the program hit its 66,000-visa cap in March.   Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), an advocate for more visas, says he thinks a legislative or regulatory solution can move forward. \u201cWe have people that recognize the need for [agricultural visas] and want to see reforms," he told Morning Shift, "but then they have an irrational objection to H-2B, which is a different kind of work. \u2026 This season, we\u2019re going to see some real business impacts [because of the visa shortage]. We\u2019ve got to communicate that.\u201d   NO MINER SAFETY WORRIES: The White House doesn't worry that injuries will increase as production ramps up in coal mines and regulations are eased, a spokesperson said during a briefing aboard Air Force One Thursday en route to Huntington, W.V. \u201cThe regulations that the president is doing are to help create jobs,\u201d said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters in response to a press question. \u201cHe's not lowering any safety regulations. Safety is still a top priority, but as the president said, we need to create jobs, we need to bring jobs back to our shores, and send them to the people of West Virginia where coal mining is so prevalent.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t nominated a chief for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and Walters wouldn\u2019t comment on when he will.   STAYING PUT: The American tradition of leaving one part of the country to find a better job in another is dwindling, Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg report in the Wall Street Journal. The pair visited the town of West Branch, Mich., for some perspective. \u201cLike a lot of small towns in sparsely populated American counties, West Branch, population 2,067, is in an economic funk brought on by the decline of manufacturing and farm consolidation,\u201d they write. \u201cIn recent years, a handful of retailers, a flour mill and a carpet shop have all closed their doors.\u201d   \u201cWhat is troubling about this rural town and many places like it is that while lots of struggling residents see leaving as the best way to improve their lives, a surprising share remain stuck in place,\u201d they write. \u201cFor a number of reasons \u2014 both economic and cultural \u2014 they no longer believe they can leave.   \u201cIn rural America, which is coping with the onset of socioeconomic problems that were once reserved for inner cities, the rate of people who moved across a county line in 2015 was just 4.1%, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis,\u201d they write. \u2018That\u2019s down from 7.7% in the late 1970s.\u201d This is not a newly-identified trend; POLITICO's Timothy Noah wrote about it in the Washington Monthly in 2013 ("Stay Put, Young Man"). Others have, too. But the decline in job-related domestic migration remains an important, and still greatly under-appreciated, problem that plays havoc with the U.S. labor market and inhibits prosperity. More here.   ICE HITS LABOR HEARINGS: \u201cFederal immigration agents have shown up twice at California labor dispute proceedings to apprehend undocumented workers, in what state officials believe may be cases of employer retaliation,\u201d Natalie Kitroeff writes in the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office, the state\u2019s labor enforcement arm, said that since November U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up at locations in Van Nuys and Santa Ana looking for workers who had brought claims against their employers.\u201d More here.   KUSHNER COMPANY HIS WITH SUBPOENA: \u201cKushner Cos., the New York property development business owned by the family of White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, has been subpoenaed by New York federal prosecutors regarding its use of an investment-for-immigration program, according to people familiar with the matter,\u201d the Journal\u2019s Erica Orden, Aruna Viswanatha and Byron Tau report.   The program in question is the EB-5 investor visa, which offers foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in a commercial project a path to a green card. The subpoena is tied to a least one residential high-rise financed through the visa program, the 66-story One Journal Square in Jersey City, the Journal reports.   \u201cIn early May, the company drew attention for a marketing campaign in Beijing and Shanghai that solicited Chinese investors for One Journal Square, saying that up to 300 individuals who put $500,000 each into the project could be eligible for green cards under the EB-5 program, according to marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\u201d More here.

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine, Ian Kullgren, Seung Min Kim and Timothy Noah   WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH?: President Donald Trump has a new target: legal immigration. On Wednesday he endorsed the Raise Act, which would halve, over a decade, the number of lawful permanent residents admitted to the U.S. Sponsored by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), the bill would limit immigration through extended family ties and assign green-card "points" based on education, English-language ability, prospective salary, age, entrepreneurship, and past achievements.   Story Continued Below  White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller said at a press briefing that the bill would "add to the economy." But most economists would disagree, write POLITICO's Timothy Noah and Marianne LeVine. "Economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, is an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced by workers," they write. "The more workers, the more goods they can produce. And with U.S. population growing at its slowest pace since the Great Depression, the only way the workforce can expand is through immigration. Economists therefore tend to worry not about there being too much immigration, but rather not enough."   Economists aren't the only ones worried about slowing the workforce's growth. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday that while he's "always supported merit-based immigration," the bill's dramatic reduction in legal immigration "would be devastating to my state\u2019s economy." Randy Johnson, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that although the bill had "many interesting concepts," its halving of legal immigration "won\u2019t raise the standard of living for Americans" but "likely accomplish the opposite, making it harder for businesses, communities, and our overall economy to grow."   Cotton, weirdly, seemed to concede at a Wednesday press briefing that his bill would reduce overall economic growth. GDP "is an important measure, to be sure, but it\u2019s not the only measure of well-being in our society," he said, mentioning GDP per capita as an alternative metric. "We could increase our GDP if we imported the entire population of Bangladesh ... But would that really be in the best interests of the American people?"   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he supported the bill, but might not take it up in his committee. It's "a procedural issue," he told Morning Shift, because if the bill acquires too many amendments "Cotton and Perdue aren\u2019t going to get what they want anyway.\u201d Read more from POLITICO's Timothy Noah and Marianne LeVine here and Ted Hesson here.

SENATE CONFIRMS KAPLAN: The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Marvin Kaplan, one of Trump's two nominees for the NLRB, on a 50-48 party-line vote, with Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) absent. Democrats Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), and Patty Murray (Wash.), had some harsh words for Kaplan. Warren, in her floor speech, accused GOP leaders of trying to "sock it to workers one more time" before summer recess. Kaplan, she said, had "no experience practicing labor law," and spent his time while working for Republicans on the House Education and the Workforce Committee "actively stripping workers of their right to organize."   Republicans have high hopes that Kaplan and (when confirmed) NLRB nominee William Emanuel will use the board's new Republican majority to reverse Obama-era decisions. Both the International Franchise Association and National Restaurant Association said they hoped Kaplan will reverse the NLRB's 2015 Browning-Ferris decision, which made it easier for corporations to be held liable for labor violations committed by their franchisees and contractors.   "We are glad the Senate moved quickly on this timely confirmation, which will help move the board in a new direction," House Education and the Workforce Chairman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) said in a joint statement with Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich). "Hopefully, our Senate colleagues will act swiftly to fill the remaining vacancy so we can have a full slate of board members that puts workers \u2014 not special interests \u2014 first." ("Special interests" in this context means "unions.")   FISCHER INTRODUCES PAID LEAVE: Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) introduced a voluntary paid family leave bill yesterday along with Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) and Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Terri Sewell (D-Ala.). The Strong Families Act would give a 25 percent tax credit to companies that offer between two and 12 weeks' paid leave. It would cover women and men who need to care for a new child or a sick family member. The tax credit would apply only to wages at or below $72,000 and would be pro-rated based on the level of wage replacement.   Fischer and King introduced similar legislation previously and it went nowhere. To advance, it will likely require a nod from Ivanka Trump, but it's unclear that she will back the proposal; a spokesperson didn't respond to Morning Shift's request for comment. Fischer's bill doesn't offer the mandatory eight weeks' paid parental leave proposed in the president's budget proposal, but the White House may be getting desperate for a legislative victory.

TODAY: NISSAN VOTE BEGINS: More than 3,500 Nissan workers at a plant in Canton, Mississippi, will begin voting today on whether to join the United Auto Workers, in the most closely-watched union election in years. "Caught among an administration that is frequently hostile to labor, a long-term decline in membership, and a steady shift in jobs to the lightly unionized South, the United Automobile Workers long ago settled on this Mississippi town as a key to rebuilding its ranks and energizing the entire labor movement," writes the New York Times' Noam Scheiber. More here.   ACOSTA TO SOUTH DAKOTA: Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta today heads to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where he'll join Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) at the Western Governors\u2019 Workforce Development Initiative, an effort to connect workers and employers. They'll hold a joint press conference at 9:30 a.m. EDT, and Acosta will speak about workforce development at 1:30 p.m. EDT.   GREEN CARD LOTTERY, OUT OF LUCK?: The immigration bill endorsed by Trump Wednesday would eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which extends 50,000 visas each year to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S. While the program these days tends to serve African and Eastern European immigrants, its origins date to the 1980s, when Irish immigrants sought a way to live in the U.S. legally, writes Michael Miller in the Washington Post. More here.   FACEBOOK LEANS IN: Facebook's efforts to recruit female workers appear to be working, Yoree Koh reports Tn the Wall Street Journal. "Women now account for 35 percent of global employees, up from 33% the previous year, Facebook said Wednesday. In technical roles\u2014positions where there are typically the fewest female, black and Hispanic employees\u2014the percentage of women has increased from 17 percent to 19 percent." More here.   WORKERS LINE UP TO WORK AT AMAZON: Thousands lined up around the country Wednesday to apply for jobs at Amazon fulfillment centers as the online retailer sought to fill 50,000 positions. The company said "it made scores of job offers on the spot at a dozen locations from Buffalo, N.Y., to Oklahoma City," according to the Washington Post's Abha Bhattarai. More here.   GO MIDWEST, YOUNG MAN: Wichita has plenty of factory jobs, but it can't find workers to fill them, Shayndi Raice writes in The Wall Street Journal. "The problems in Wichita mirror those in other manufacturing areas, where a skills gap has emerged due in part to aging workers and changing technology," Raice writes. "But the turbulent aviation industry \u2014 which is easily affected by economic cycles \u2014 adds another wrinkle to the challenge." More here.   (We can't run an item like this without noting that we at Morning Shift remain less than convinced that a skills gap actually exists. So does the New York Times's Scheiber. Peter Cappelli of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business is quite brutal on the subject; he says the skills gap is utter hooey.)   EPN: BORDER CALL DIDN'T HAPPEN: Mexico denied Wednesday that Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto ever praised Trump's border enforcement policies, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Monday Trump gushed over his new chief of staff, former DHS chief John Kelly, by saying "Even the president of Mexico called me" and "said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment." But "a spokesman for [Pea Nieto] said on Wednesday that the last time the two presidents spoke was at the G-20 summit in Germany on July 7," the Journal reported. "The subject of migration was addressed by both leaders at that meeting, but the discussion was informative and not congratulatory, the spokesman added."   Tempting though it is to presume any given Trump statement false until proven otherwise, the president may very well have spoken truthfully in this instance. The two quotations, on examination, are not really contradictory, and arrests at the border really are down. More here.

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  08/02/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine and Ian Kullgren   DOWNSIZING IMMIGRATION: Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) head to the White House this morning to roll out a reworked bill to slash levels of legal immigration and shift the immigration system's emphasis away from family ties and toward skills, Anna Giaritelli reports in the Washington Examiner.   Story Continued Below  The senators first introduced a version of the legislation, S. 354 (115), in February. The bill sought to cut legal immigration in half over a decade (from roughly a million legal immigrants per year down to 500,000) and to limit to spouses and unmarried children the categories of family member who could be sponsored for a green card. In addition, the measure would have ended the diversity visa lottery, which offers 50,000 visas each year to people from nations with low rates of immigration to the U.S.   The pair met with President Donald Trump to discuss the bill in March. While the White House didn't endorse the measure, Cotton said Trump was engaged. \u201cThe president is interested in pursuing those reforms, but also a broader set of reforms that would examine some of the work-related [programs] that are being abused,\u201d he told POLITICO's Seung Min Kim at the time.   POLITICO's Eliana Johnson and Josh Dawsey reported last month that Trump planned to back the reworked bill, but officials stopped short of a confirmation to the Examiner's Giaritelli.

TODAY:   KAPLAN CLOTURE VOTE: The Senate will hold a cloture vote today on NLRB nominee Marvin Kaplan, POLITICO's Ian Kullgren reports. "The vote is expected to take place as soon as an hour after the Senate convenes at 10 a.m.," according to a leadership source. A vote on the nomination itself will likely occur tomorrow, though it may occur today.   "Kaplan is currently counsel for the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission," writes Kullgren. "He has held jobs on the House Education and the Workforce and Oversight and Government Reform committees, as well as the Labor Department's Office of Labor-Management and Standards. Senate leadership has not scheduled a vote on President Donald Trump's other NLRB nominee, William Emanuel, meaning it probably will be delayed until after the August recess." Once both nominees are confirmed, the five-member NLRB will flip from majority-Democrat to majority-Republican, allowing it to roll back precedents established under President Barack Obama. More on today's vote here.   PIZZELLA NOMINATION VOTE: The Senate HELP Committee is scheduled to consider the nomination of Patrick Pizzella to become deputy secretary of Labor. During a committee confirmation hearing in July, Pizzella faced sharp questioning from Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) over lobbying work he had done decades ago to keep federal labor laws out of the Northern Mariana Islands. The hearing takes place at 11 a.m. in S-216, the President's Room. Watch it here.   LAPAN EYED FOR WHITE HOUSE ROLE: Newly installed White House chief of staff John Kelly may bring his former Homeland Security colleague David Lapan to Pennsylvania Avenue as communication director, CNNMoney's Dylan Beyers reported Tuesday evening. "Lapan, who has worked with Kelly for over a decade, is at the top of a short list to serve as the White House's top official on messaging and communications," wrote Beyers, citing two senior administration officials.   The move would be a significant change in terms of experience from ten days' wonder Anthony Scaramucci. Lapan previously led press shops for the Marine Corps and the Defense Department, and brought a workmanlike professionalism to the DHS role while handling thorny policy issues like the travel ban and the border wall. Kelly has already recruited his former chief of staff at DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, to assist with his transition to the new role.   Would Lapan take the job? "Obviously I've known [Kelly] for a long time," Lapan told Beyers. "I would take seriously anything he asked. But I would also have to understand more about what it would be and all of those things. So I couldn't say today what my answer would be." Lapan would of course have to take into account that under Trump, White House communications directors turn over faster than Defense Against The Dark Arts teachers in the Harry Potter series. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, you'll recall, could never keep anyone teaching Defense Against The Dark Arts more than one school year. But the White House can't keep anyone in the communications director job more than three months. Three people have come and gone just since January (Sean Spicer; Mike Dubke; Sean Spicer, acting; the Mooch). More here.   WHAT ABOUT KOBACH? Who will replace Kelly as Homeland Security secretary? The Great Mentioner is talking up Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach \u2014 a vigorous opponent of illegal immigration and vice chair of President Donald Trump's much-criticized panel on alleged voter fraud. Kobach helped draft a controversial law in Arizona, much of it later overturned by the Supreme Court, that required immigrants to carry proof of legal status). Now he seems intent on a bigger role. (At the moment he's running for Kansas governor.) The problem with giving Kobach DHS is that he'd be a highly controversial choice \u2014 "radioactive," in the words of one former DHS official. And there's a decent chance Kelly would oppose putting Kobach in his old job.   SPEAKING OF WHITE HOUSE JOBS: "Bill Shine, a former co-president of Fox News and top lieutenant to the network\u2019s founder, Roger Ailes, has spoken with White House officials about taking a position on President Trump\u2019s communications team, according to several people briefed on the discussions," Michael Grynbaum writes in the New York Times. "Mr. Shine has no political experience outside of producing cable news, and he was forced out of Fox News in May after his name surfaced in lawsuits that accused him of abetting Mr. Ailes\u2019s harassing behavior toward women.

In late 2015, Seattle became the first city where drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft could join unions, but the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing Uber and Lyft) argued in court that the ordinance violated and preempted the National Labor Relations Act. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Lasnik blocked the law from going into effect while the court considered the case.   In an order issued Tuesday, Lasnik granted the city's motion to dismiss, a tentative victory for proponents of the measure. But the injunction against the law will remain in place until the court resolves a separate motion to dismiss in a companion case, Clark v. City of Seattle, brought by 11 drivers. Uber plans to appeal the decision, according to a written statement from Brooke Steger, Uber\u2019s general manager for the Pacific Northwest. "This ordinance was never about benefiting drivers or the community but really about helping Teamsters and protecting taxi companies,\u201d she said.

NISSAN HIT WITH RIGGING CLAIM: The UAW is accusing Nissan of taking extreme measures to influence a union election at the Canton, Mississippi plant this week \u2014 including threatening to fire employees and close the plant if they vote to organize. The union points to a consolidated complaint in which an NLRB regional director cites nearly two dozen instances, from 2014 to 2017, in which company officials allegedly intimidated workers.   "After seeing threats and intimidation escalate this month, it\u2019s now clear that Nissan has no intention of letting employees vote in a free and fair election," Gary Casteel, the UAW secretary-treasurer, said in a statement. \u201cNissan is running one of the nastiest anti-union campaigns in the modern history of the American labor movement."   The UAW says that Nissan stepped up its anti-union rhetoric this month after the election dates were set, delivering "threatening" messages in meetings and broadcasting anti-union videos. "Nissan has also prevented a fair campaign by denying Canton workers equal access to arguments in favor of a union," the UAW wrote in press release. "Since the election petition, Nissan has used each day to deliver its threatening anti-union messages in repeated, mandatory meetings with workers, all in order to pressure them to follow Nissan\u2019s instructions to 'VOTE NO.'"   Nissan officials told the Associated Press, which first reported the amended complaint, that it had done nothing wrong. \u201cWe\u2019re staying within the law,\u201d Rodney Francis, the plant's human resources director, told the AP. \u201cWe have the right to communicate our positions.\u201d More here.   COURT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned an NLRB decision Tuesday, saying that managers of a grocery store in a Portland, Oregon, suburb did not violate federal labor laws when they called the cops on union organizers \u2014 and a local lawmaker \u2014 in 2009. The court found that the union organizers, accompanied by an Oregon state representative, took things too far by lingering in the store and arguing with managers \u2014 and police.   "Under these circumstances \u2014 where the individuals arrested had broken with prior practice and then failed to obey the officers\u2019 commands despite repeated opportunities to comply and avoid arrest \u2014 we can hardly say the arrests amounted to a violation on the part of Fred Meyer," the court wrote. "In short, the Board\u2019s actions in this matter are more consistent with the role of an advocate than an adjudicator." More here.   HATCH HAILS END OF MYRA: Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised the Treasury Department Tuesday for ending its myRA program. Created under the Obama administration, the myRA program provided a savings option to employees without a retirement plan at work, offering investments only in government savings bonds.   The Treasury Department said last week that it would shut down the program because of "extremely low" demand. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Hatch wrote that "while perhaps well intended, the scheme has not been a net benefit to savers and American taxpayers, and was set up through executive overreach to sidestep the Congress." Hatch argued that employers who promoted the myRA program were "at risk" of becoming a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. He added that the Treasury Department only had about 30,000 myRA account holders and spent $70 million on the program. "The myRA Roth scheme clearly fails on a cost-benefit basis, and is a failed program," he said. Read the letter here.   CHIPOTLE: HOLD WORKER IN CONTEMPT: Lawyers for Chipotle requested Tuesday that a Texas district court hold in contempt workers who filed a lawsuit against the company. In June, Chipotle workers filed a class action lawsuit, alleging that the company withheld wages owed to them under the Obama administration's overtime rule, even though the rule never took effect because the same Texas court issued an injunction against it.   The workers argued the injunction applied to the Labor Department and not to private parties. But Chipotle disagreed. In its motion for contempt, Chipotle's lawyers argued that the workers' interpretation of the order was incorrect. "This court possesses the inherent authority to enforce its own injunctive decree and to punish those who disobey it," Chipotle argued, adding that the plaintiffs' "dismissive attitude towards this court and disregard for the sanctity of its order \u2014 at Chipotle's expense \u2014 cannot be condoned." Read the motion here.   BARLETTA FOR SENATE? Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), a long-time opponent of illegal immigration and Trump backer, plans to run for a Senate seat currently held by Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Marc Levy writes in the Associated Press. "Barletta won his House seat during the Republican midterm wave of 2010, catapulted by the attention he received while mayor of the small city of Hazleton for cracking down on immigrants in the country illegally," Levy writes.   "Casey plans to seek a third six-year term in next year's election," the AP reports. "Democrats' 4-3 ratio registration edge over Republicans gives him a built-in advantage, though that did not stop Trump from becoming the first Republican since 1988 to capture Pennsylvania's crucial electoral votes in the presidential race." The Democrat senator holds very different views from Barletta on immigration. Casey made an impassioned public plea on Twitter in May for then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to halt the deportation in progress of a Honduran woman and her son \u2014 both of whom hoped to seek asylum in the U.S. Kelly preceded with the deportation and contended that the woman had parroted certain phrases to establish an asylum claim when she entered the U.S. More on Barletta's possible challenge here.   ICE PICKS UP 'COLLATORALS': "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation to arrest people who entered the country without authorization as kids or as families ended up mostly sweeping up other people who officers encountered along the way," Elise Foley writes in the Huffington Post. "Of 650 arrests carried out during the operation last week, 70 percent of those detained were not the targets, ICE officials said Tuesday. One-fifth of the total arrested had criminal convictions."   "The Trump administration is carrying out what its officials promised: sweeping arrest efforts that do not exempt anyone, regardless of their criminal records or whether they\u2019re the person ICE set out to detain," writes Foley.

MUSLIM OUTREACH OFFICIAL RESIGNS: "George Selim, the federal counterterrorism official who works most closely with the organized American Muslim community, tendered his resignation on Friday," reports Peter Beinart in the Atlantic. Selim had been director of the DHS Office for Community Partnerships and the lead on the department's Countering Violent Extremism Task Force. \u201cThere were clearly political appointees in this administration who didn\u2019t see the value of community partnerships with American Muslims,\u201d Selim told Beinart.

OUTSOURCERS TOP LIST OF H-1B USERS: A newly released trove of visa data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows "the widely made complaint about the visa program is true: a small number of IT outsourcing companies get a disproportionately high number of H-1B visas and pay below-average wages to their workers," Youyou Zhou writes in Quartz.

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine and Ian Kullgren   WHITE HOUSE QUASHES SESSIONS-TO-DHS SCENARIO: DHS employees are still wondering who will get the top job now that former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has taken the White House chief of staff post.   Story Continued Below  A source close to Kelly told POLITICO on Friday that it's unclear who will replace him. But one scenario that circulated among Homeland Security staffers involved Attorney Jeff Sessions swinging from the Justice Department to DHS, a move that would extricate Sessions from the Russia investigation and allow Trump to put someone else into the attorney general role.   That option isn't being discussed, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who took over the lead spokesperson position when Sean Spicer resigned earlier this month. (In case you've lost track, Spicer reportedly quit over the hiring of Anthony Scaramucci as communication director. After 10 days on the job, Scaramucci was pushed out on Monday as Kelly assumed the chief of staff role.)   At a press conference mainly dominated by questions about Scaramucci's abrupt departure, Huckabee Sanders poured cold water on the possibility that Sessions could move over to DHS. \u201cThere are no conversations about any Cabinet members moving in any capacity,\u201d she said during the press conference. \u201cThe president has 100 percent confidence in all members of his Cabinet.\u201d   GOOD MORNING!

FORMER ICE BOSS ON DHS VACANCY: A former head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can envision Trump sticking with a military leader to helm the Homeland Security Department, she told Morning Shift. Julie Myers Woods \u2014 who oversaw ICE from 2006 to 2008 and is currently the CEO of Guidepost Solutions \u2014 said Kelly was liked and respected at DHS, which could set the stage for someone else from the armed forces.   On her list? Retired U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who now works as an executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton (Morning Shift couldn\u2019t immediately reach him for comment). Allen was involved in the response to Hurricane Katrina and served as \u201ca rare reassuring presence in the troubled federal efforts to control the Gulf oil spill,\u201d according to Time, which highlighted his work in 2010. \u201cI think he\u2019s really seen as a strong leader and someone the department could look up to,\u201d said Myers Wood. She added that \u201cDHS is about to implement some highly controversial policies,\u201d from so-called extreme vetting to an expansion of expedited removal, and could use an experienced hand on the wheel.   The former ICE official also said Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) would be an \u201cexcellent choice\u201d for secretary. \u201cHe has provided very thoughtful oversight \u2026 and been a strong advocate for the department,\u201d she said. And what about that #NeverMcCaul hashtag immigration restrictionists (who think the Texas Republican would be too soft) have been circulating on Twitter? \u201cAnyone that is nuanced on immigration in any way is criticized on both sides,\u201d she said.   MILLION JOBS? NOT QUITE: Trump's White House likes to say he has created a million\u2014even more than a million \u2014 jobs since he's been in the Oval Office. Problem is, it's been wrong the whole time. When Trump made the claim June 1 during remarks announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, the economy had actually added 600,000 jobs from February through May.   Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeated the million-jobs assertion during Monday's press briefing. This time it was slightly less wrong, since the economy had added 222,000 more jobs in June. But she was still 200,000 short. If Trump gets a good July jobs report on Friday, he might be able to correctly argue he's created a million jobs \u2014 but that's after months of missing the mark.   GADE TAPPED FOR EEOC: Trump plans to nominate Daniel Gade to the remaining part of a five-year term on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the White House announced Monday night. Gade is a veteran of the Iraq War and former official in the George W. Bush administration. He taught political science and public policy at West Point from 2011 until he retired from the Army earlier this year, according to the White House. The EEOC term would expire July 1, 2021.   OSHA LAGS ON PRESS RELEASES: Trump's OSHA continues to lag behind Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush in putting out press releases on safety fines given to companies, according to Jordan Barab, a former Obama OSHA official who runs the workplace safety blog Confined Space. "OSHA has issued two ... enforcement-related press releases this month, out of probably 50 cases that exceeded $40,000," Barab writes in a post published Monday. "In the first three weeks of July there were 13 cases above $70,000, the press release threshold during the Bush administration, and 7 cases over $100,000 during that time.   "I\u2019m hoping that Loren Sweatt, OSHA\u2019s new political deputy assistant secretary (the acting head of the agency) will have the courage to re-instate press releases, recognizing that press releases are not primarily about embarrassing employers," he wrote. "They are about making sure that employers and workers know that there is a law that requires employers to provide a safe workplace, and that OSHA inspectors are out there inspecting workplaces and enforcing the law." OSHA didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. More here.   GUILTY VERDICT FOR ARPAIO: "A federal judge in Arizona found former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt on Monday for violating an order in a racial-profiling case," POLITICO's Ted Hesson reports. "U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton said the evidence in the case showed a 'flagrant disregard' for a 2011 court order that required the sheriff to stop detaining people unless they were suspected of a crime."   "The 85-year-old Arpaio, who lost a reelection bid last year, earned a reputation during his tenure for his tough stance against illegal immigration and headline-grabbing approach to criminal justice, dressing inmates in pink underwear and operating an open-air 'tent city' jail in the scorching Arizona heat," POLITICO reports. "But his renegade approach to law enforcement also attracted litigation. One class-action lawsuit that began a decade ago accused the sheriff\u2019s office of racial profiling of Hispanics during traffic stops."   The order issued Monday by Judge Bolton found that Arpaio had \u201cwillfully violated\u201d an order for his office to stop detaining people (i.e., suspected undocumented immigrants) if they couldn't be charged with a crime. "The former lawman, who is scheduled for sentencing Oct. 5, faces a maximum of six months in jail for the misdemeanor offense," Hesson writes. Read the story here and the judge's order here.   HOTELS BOOM, EVEN WITH $15 WAGE: The $15 minimum wage is not stopping hotel developers from investing in SeaTac, Washington, Julie Weed reports in The New York Times. Nine hotels are under construction, and develops appear unfazed by the 2013 wage hike. Michael Mahoney, president of Western International, a Dallas-based development company, said that the $15 minimum wage was not a determining factor in his decision to build a Marriott Residence Inn.   "We are competing for quality people seeking the best jobs, so would likely have been at that threshold anyway,\u201d he told the Times. Jeff Robinson, SeaTac's director of community and economic development, said "hoteliers had adapted to the ordinance, which requires any hotel with at least 100 rooms or 30 full-time employees to pay the $15 minimum wage." He added that "nobody eliminated rooms to get under it." More from the Times here.   DEMS: AFFIRM BARGAINING RIGHTS: Democrats urged Trump last week to affirm the collective bargaining rights of workers at a Nissan facility in Canton, Mississippi. In a letter led by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), the lawmakers requested that Trump tell Nissan to "shift its posture towards the organizing drive at the facility in Canton to neutral." They said the Canton plant, along with two facilities in Tennessee, are Nissan's "only plants in the world without unions and meaningful representation."   Workers at the Canton plant will vote Thursday and Friday on whether to join the United Auto Workers union, which has tried since 2012 to unionize the facility. According to the Huffington Post's Dave Jamieson, last week managers called workers off the floor and into large meetings. "Using slides to make their case, they tried to show employees all the bad things that can happen after unionizing," Jamieson writes. Read the letter here.   7TH CIRCUIT DECLINES TO REVIVE ADA CASE: The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals declined Monday to revive a case that addressed whether the city of Evanston violated the Americans with Disabilities Act when it fired an employee after he experienced a brain injury. When the employee returned from temporary disability, the employer alleged that he was unable to perform the tasks and fired him. In response, the employee sued, arguing that he was fired because of his disability. A lower court sided with the employee and the appeals court agreed. Read the opinion here.   OIG: 15,000 IMM AGENTS ISN'T EASY: A report released Monday by the DHS Office of Inspector General lays out the challenges the Trump administration will face if it wants to hire 15,000 additional Border Patrol agents and ICE officers, as the president directed in a pair of executive orders signed in January. The report suggests that getting Congress to approve funding for the extra personnel would only be part of the battle.   One major concern is whether people will be interested in the jobs. For some perspective: Trump's executive order calls for 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents. To reach that level, the agency would need to attract 750,000 applicants, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimate cited in the report. "DHS needs to gather better data on attrition and understand why employees are leaving so it can potentially improve the use of incentives, both monetary and nonmonetary, for human resource and law enforcement positions," the report reads.   Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the report shows a hiring surge would "only exacerbate underlying problems" at CBP and ICE. Thompson said the administration "should understand that skimping on workforce planning is an irresponsible waste of limited resources." More here.   POLL: BORDER WALL, MEH: A majority of likely voters don't want a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a survey released Monday by Rasmussen Reports. The poll found 56 percent opposed the wall construction, while 37 percent thought it was a good idea. House Republicans passed a spending package last week that included $1.6 billion for 74 miles of border fence and wall, but dodged a risky floor vote to get the wall dollars approved. See the poll here.   CALIF FACTORY JOBS, FOR NOW: "Warehouses have hired tens of thousands of California workers over the last five years to help fuel the fast-rising industry of online retail," Mike McPhate writes in The New York Times. In the past year, Amazon has announced four new fulfillment centers in California's inland cities "where real estate is cheaper and the labor force is plentiful," McPhate writes. One researcher found the addition of 10,000 new warehouse jobs in San Joaquin Valley slashed the unemployment rate nearly in half over five years, a pretty impressive boost to the local economy.   "Still, the good economic news has been shadowed by questions over the growing role of automation in the retail business," the Times reports. "Amazon says robotic machines work in tandem with humans at its warehouses, rather than replacing them. But the industry is pushing hard to expand the frontiers of such technology, raising doubts not just about warehouse jobs but delivery work that could be made obsolete by driverless cars and drones." More here.   TEXAS SHERIFFS JOIN 287(G): Federal immigration officials on Monday announced agreements with 18 Texas counties that will allow local police to enforce immigration laws, Dianne Solis and Ray Leszcynski write in the Dallas News. The president signed an executive order in January that calls for the Homeland Security department to engage with state and local officials to broker what are known as 287(g) agreements. In addition to the aforementioned counties, the city of Carrollton has also agreed to cooperate with federal officials. "With 19 local entities on board, Texas accounts for almost one-third of the 60 pacts nationwide," the Dallas News reports. More here.

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  07/31/2017 10:00 AM EDT  JOB OPENING AT DHS: John Kelly will leave his leadership role at Homeland Security today and decamp to the White House, where he'll take over for Reince Priebus as President Donald Trump's chief of staff. The Cabinet shakeup rocked Washington through the weekend and effectively serves as a coda to the president's turbulent first six months in office. (Just how turbulent has it been? Peter Baker wrote in the New York Times that presidential historians had to look back more than 100 years to find examples of presidents who experienced such a "combination of internal warfare and external legislative troubles.")   The move means the top post at Homeland Security \u2014 a key administration position given Trump's central focus on illegal immigration and counterterrorism efforts \u2014 will be up for grabs. A person close to Kelly told POLITICO that it's unclear who will replace him, but Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke will become acting secretary today and gives the department a steady hand following Kelly's abrupt transition.   Story Continued Below  One leading contender is House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas), POLITICO's Ted Hesson and Andrew Restuccia wrote Friday. "The Texas Republican competed for the secretary role in November," POLITICO reports. "He introduced an immigration bill on Friday that would provide $10 billion for Trump\u2019s border 'wall,' a pot of funds that would pay for a mix of wall, fence, technology and aerial surveillance over four years, while boosting Border Patrol by 5,000 agents \u2014 the level Trump called for in a January executive order."   Still, McCaul would face intense opposition from some groups that seek to reduce immigration. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, tweeted "NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" to the suggestion that McCaul could see an easier path to confirmation than other candidates, and the hashtags #NoWallMcCaul and #NeverMcCaul made the rounds on Twitter over the weekend.   Other names that surfaced were Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Duke. The confirmation fight for any secretary will likely be heated, but Homan and Kobach in particular could encounter fierce resistance from Democrats. Homan has been the face of ICE's broad immigration crackdown; Kobach is helping to lead Trump's controversial commission on alleged voter fraud.   Rumors circulated among DHS staffers that Attorney General Jeff Sessions could swing over to the Homeland Security Department, a move that would let Trump appoint a new official to head the Justice Department and lead the Russia investigation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) doesn't like that idea, however, and voiced his opinion over the weekend. "AG Jeff Sessions has a good ring to it. Highly qualified, committed to the rule of law, tough on crime, and fiercely independent," he said in a two-part tweet Saturday. "DHS Secretary Jeff Sessions doesn't sound right, doesn't feel right. Bad idea."   The Trump administration doesn't need to rush to fill the position, as James Norton, founder of the consulting firm Play-Action Strategies and a former DHS official during the George W. Bush administration, told Morning Shift. Duke has "enough experience to guide the ship," Norton points out. And Congress is heading into its August recess, which means the confirmation likely wouldn't take place until the fall. More on possible candidates here.   GOOD MORNING!

NIELSEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE: John Kelly will bring DHS chief of staff Kirstjen Nielsen with him to the White House, POLITICO's Andrew Restuccia reports. Sources told Restuccia her title is still in flux, but CNN reported Saturday that she was expected to become deputy chief of staff. More from POLITICO here and CNN here.   TRUMP'S RUST BELT PUSH: The president has made a point of highlighting positive economic news in the Rust Belt states that helped hand him the election, Eli Stokols and Eric Morath write in the Wall Street Journal. "This week\u2019s announcement that the Chinese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn Technologies has committed to building a $10 billion plant continued the pattern," the pair write. "It was delivered in Wisconsin, a Democratic stronghold for three decades where Mr. Trump bulldozed through Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall on Election Night."   But some analysts see the job creation announcements as more braggadocio than substance. \u201cThe White House calling out Carrier and other employers is more about public relations than great economic impact,\u201d Adam Kamins, senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told the Journal. \u201cThe amount of taxpayer money being thrown at these firms to attract them to certain states is pretty exorbitant. That creates a high bar in terms of the number of jobs that need to be created for the investment to pay off.\u201d   Foxconn agreed to hire 3,000 workers when the factory opens in 2020 and may eventually expand that number to 22,000, the Journal reports. At the same time, however, the company will receive $3 billion in tax breaks from the state of Wisconsin. More here.   WISCONN VALLEY?: When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Foxconn founder and chairman Terry Gou signed a memo of understanding last week over the factory deal, badges distributed to attendees read "Welcome to Wisconn Valley." The Badger State is only the latest state or city to promote itself as the next tech hub, but it has a long way to go, as Sarah Kessler writes in Quartz. "Large factories alone do not a Silicon Valley make, partly because they\u2019re expensive," Kessler writes. She quotes Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University in China. \u201cWisconsin can only have so many $10 billion plant investments before they face a real budgetary problem,\u201d he said. More here.   HOW ABOUT CANADA?: President Trump's immigration crackdown has inspired Canada to vie for tech businesses that might have otherwise come to the U.S., David George-Cosh and Jacquie McNish write in The Wall Street Journal. "The pitch: Come to Canada, where there are cosmopolitan cities, affordable health care and, most important, more certainty around work permits and entrance requirements that many executives feel is lacking under the Trump administration," The Journal reports. "Ben Zifkin, chief executive of Hubba Inc., tells potential employees currently in the U.S.: 'You don\u2019t have to stay in Canada forever, just the current presidential term.'" More here.   EMPLOYERS LOOK TO EX-CONVICTS: The tight labor market has encouraged employers to consider former inmates to fill vacant positions, Jeffrey Sparshott writes in The Wall Street Journal. Karen Hellman, the director of inmate programs and re-entry at the Arizona Department of Corrections said more companies in the state are trying to hire ex-convicts this year, The Journal reports. "National data on hiring of ex-offenders isn\u2019t available, but other state correctional systems across the U.S. and training programs for ex-offenders report similar experiences."   From the Journal: \u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with employers who are more willing to hire ex-felons,\u201d said John Nally, who started working at the Indiana Department of Correction in 1967 and is now its director of education. \u201cIt is a totally different landscape when you have an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent. We have all these people in construction who are literally begging for workers.\u201d More here.   STEELWORKERS, GOODYEAR STRIKE DEAL: "The United Steelworkers and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. have reached a tentative contract agreement that covers about 7,000 workers at five plants," the Associated Press reports. "Goodyear says the five-year agreement covers workers at plants in Fayetteville, North Carolina; Akron, Ohio; Danville, Virginia; Gadsen, Alabama; and Topeka, Kansas. The agreement was reached late Saturday night, just before union officials said workers were ready to go on strike." More here.   GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER: The president's criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions (whom he's called "beleaguered" and blasted for a "VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes") has exasperated at least one immigration restrictionist group. \u201cThe administration is having a hard time getting out of its own way,\u201d Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told the New York Times. \u201cThe seeming disarray in the White House obviously makes it hard for the administration to carry out its policies.\u201d More here.   TRAVEL BAN STRANDS ORPHANS: A 16-year-old Eritrean orphan remains stuck in an Ethiopian refugee camp as a result of Trump's travel ban, the Washington Post's Justin Moyer reports. "On July 19, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban to stand, leaving about 100 unaccompanied minor refugees stranded overseas," he writes. "The decision comes after months of judicial back-and-forth over the ban, casting doubt on the children\u2019s plans to live in the United States. \u2026 The result: M.T., an orphan who fled child labor in Eritrea two years ago and was approved by the State Department to live in the United States, remains in legal limbo."

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine and Ian Kullgren   TRUMP TO LONG ISLAND: President Donald Trump will travel to Suffolk County, L.I., today, where he'll talk about the street gang that his administration is determined to make the most famous in America, MS-13. Is MS-13 scary? You bet. Is it growing? Not so's anybody can tell; its numbers have been estimated at around 10,000 for more than a decade. But MS-13 is Salvadoran, and that's what makes the gang useful to Trump.   Story Continued Below  "The president will use his Friday speech to urge Congress to back his border wall with Mexico and to greenlight funding for new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and immigration judges," writes POLITICO's Andrew Restuccia. At the same time, the emotionally bruised Attorney General Jeff Sessions will be in El Salvador, meeting with President Salvador Snchez Cern to discuss efforts against crime and illegal immigration.   The Trump speech is part of a larger push to link crime and immigration, and make the case for more enforcement funding. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be very hard for Democratic lawmakers to vote against hiring ICE officers and the other resources we need to remove some of these dangerous and violent people, like MS-13, from our country, who are quite literally terrorizing communities, committing the most heinous kinds of crimes imaginable,\u201d an administration official told Restuccia.   But that's assuming Democrats buy the idea that undocumented immigrants cause more crime than anyone else, which researchers consistently say isn't true. On top of that, alleged gang members \u2014 not just MS-13, but all gang members \u2014 make up a tiny proportion of ICE's arrest total. And the gang members ICE does arrest are usually \u2026 uh \u2026 U.S. citizens. Back in May, the agency announced it had picked up 1,378 suspected gang members and their affiliates. Of those, 933 were citizens. Fewer than one-third were in the country illegally.   Democrats have taken a hard line against Trump's deportation agenda, and it's hard to imagine this trek to Long Island will change their minds. During Trump's first 100 days in office, ICE arrests of non-criminals climbed 157 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. More from POLITICO's Restuccia here.   GOOD MORNING!

JOINT EMPLOYER PATH FORWARD: House Republicans who want to rewrite the joint employer standard got a boost Thursday when Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) introduced a bill supported by at least one Republican leader and a pair of Democrats.   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) signaled the House leadership would support his effort to roll back the NLRB's 2015 Browning-Ferris decision, which made it easier to hold corporations liable for workplace violations committed by their contractors and franchisees. "[The bill] will treat American businesses fairly again so they can go back to what they do best \u2014 hiring workers and providing quality products and services for their customers," McCarthy said in a written statement.   Is the bill a priority? House Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) told reporters she hadn't received word from leadership on when she might bring the bill to the floor. But Byrne insisted the bill would win over enough Democrats to get a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate, noting that Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) and Lou Correa (D-Calif.) are cosponsors. "We are dead serious about not just passing it out of the House," Byrne said, "but getting it over to the Senate and getting 60 votes."   Some on the left are determined not to let that happen, saying the legislation, H.R. 3441, would allow employers to shirk workplace protections. \u201c[The bill] immunizes joint employers from liability, even if they share contractual control of wages, benefits, scheduling, or discipline," Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the ranking member on House Ed and the Workforce, said Thursday in a written statement.   HOUSE PASSES BORDER WALL FUNDS: The House passed a defense spending package on Thursday afternoon that included $1.6 billion in funding for Trump's border wall. The bill, H.R. 3219 (115), doesn't technically fund a wall -- it would pay for 60 miles of new bollard-style fence and levee wall in South Texas and 14 miles of replacement fence in the San Diego area \u2014 but it spares House Republicans the embarrassment of giving Trump nothing at all, which seemed a real possibility this week.   The border funding was attached to the defense portion of the \u201cminibus,\u201d which also included funding for energy, veterans' affairs and the legislative branch. But despite what Democrats conceded was a tough vote \u2014 against military funding \u2014 they largely rejected the package. Five Democrats voted in favor: Reps. Sanford Bishop (Ga.), Charlie Crist (Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Tom O'Halleran (Ariz.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.). Likewise, five Republicans opposed the measure: Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), John Duncan (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Mark Sanford (S.C.).   The big question: Can Republicans convince any Senate Democrats to fund a similar border boost? Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the border wall a "poison pill" rider before it was rejected from an earlier appropriations bill, and he isn't likely to change that opinion this time. Morning Shift spoke with a pair of Democratic aides who similarly said, "Hell no" and "No way." Read more about the House spending package from POLITICO's Sarah Ferris here.   Meanwhile, construction of border wall prototypes "has been delayed until winter at the earliest after bidders who were passed over filed protests about the decision," CNN's Tal Kopan reports. "The delay pushes back construction of the potential wall designs months beyond when the administration had hoped to break ground."   Earlier this year DHS reprogrammed $20 million in existing funds to develop border wall prototypes. Hundreds of companies bid on the project, but this latest delay wasn't the first. "The plan had originally been to build in June, and in recent weeks the Department of Homeland Security has insisted it was still on track to begin work on prototypes this summer," writes Kopan.

Roger King has withdrawn his name for consideration for National Labor Relations Board general counsel," Chris Opfer reports for Bloomberg BNA, citing an anonymous source. King, who works for the HR Policy Association and is a usual suspect on the D.C. labor-policy circuit, was thought a shoo-in to succeed Richard Griffin when his term ends in November. King didn't respond to requests for comment. More from BNA here.   TODAY: DEM DREAMER BILL: Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) will introduce the American Hope Act, "a permanent legislative solution" for undocumented immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, along with other immigrant youth, according to a related announcement. He'll be joined by Democratic leaders and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus at a press conference today at 11 a.m. in Studio A of the House Radio/TV Gallery, House Visitor\u2019s Center. Watch it here.   MOST TOXIC WORKPLACE IN AMERICA: That would be the White House, where communications chief Anthony Scaramucci, with Trump's apparent blessing, was quoted yesterday in two news outlets saying exceptionally vicious and otherwise unhinged things about his coworkers Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. An interview the Mooch gave the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza was the more outrageous (that's where he said "\u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic" and "I\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock"), but Scaramucci's interview with CNN was no slouch either ("I don't know if this is repairable or not," the Mooch said, with breathtaking presumption, of his relationship with Priebus. Also: "The fish stinks from the head down. But I can tell you two fish that don't stink, and that's me and the president"). David Mamet, call your office.   APPLE IN A PICKLE: Earlier this week, Trump put Apple in an awkward position when he told the Wall Street Journal that the company planned to build three plants in the United States. Although Foxconn Technology (Apple's largest contract manufacturer) said Wednesday that it would invest $10 billion in a display-panel factory, that investment was not part of the "three potential Apple facilities to which the president had referred," Tripp Mickle reports in the Wall Street Journal.   "Supply-chain experts and analysts say the prospect of Apple building one plant in the U.S. \u2014 much less three \u2014 is highly unlikely," Mickle writes. "Apple has built a sophisticated supply chain in China because that is where component suppliers are located, and manufacturing workers are abundant there. Shipping iPhone or iPad materials to the U.S. for production would cut into Apple\u2019s profit margins, observers say." More here.   SPEAKING OF FOXCONN: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has offered up to $3 billion in state tax breaks for Foxconn to build a factory, Danielle Paquette reports in the Washington Post. "As long as Foxconn keeps hiring U.S. workers at the new flat-screen manufacturing facility, Wisconsin would cut the company $200 million to $250 million a year for up to 15 years," she writes. "That works out to a rough cost to the state of about $230,700 per worker, assuming the factory goes on to generate 13,000 jobs." More here.   AND SPEAKING OF FACTORIES: "Economic reports Thursday offered encouraging signals about U.S. factories, jobs and underlying demand in the economy ahead of a much-anticipated report on national output Friday," Josh Mitchell writes in the Wall Street Journal.

DHS CANDIDATE WITHDRAWS: "A candidate for a senior position at the Department of Homeland Security withdrew from consideration on Wednesday, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military," POLITICO's Andrew Restuccia and Kyle Cheney report. "John Fluharty, a former executive director of the Delaware Republican party, informed a DHS official in an email Wednesday morning that he was pulling out of contention to be the assistant secretary of partnership and engagement at the department." More here.   REUTERS: REFUGEES IN MILLER'S HANDS: The president can set the number of refugees the country should accept in the coming fiscal year \u2014 and White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, an impassioned opponent of legal and illegal immigration, will take the lead on the decision, Arshad Mohammed and Yeganeh Torbati report in Reuters.   The White House Domestic Policy Council, which reports to Miller, "is taking the lead on a decision about how many refugees to admit to the United States next year \u2026 a move that may empower those who wish to reduce immigration," according to Reuters. The council appears to be "adopting a role traditionally handled by National Security Council and State Department officials." More here.   PROVOST PROFILE: The New York Times' Ron Nixon profiled Border Patrol Acting Chief Carla Provost, "the first woman to lead the Border Patrol in its 93-year history," he writes. "When Ms. Provost joined [in 1975], agents patrolled wide-open borders with just their weapons and a few vehicles," Nixon reports. "Today\u2019s Border Patrol operates with drones, high-tech sensors, surveillance cameras, military-style body armor and high-powered rifles."   "What hasn\u2019t changed is the ratio of women to men," he continues. "Ms. Provost cites a number of reasons, among them the remote, rugged locations. It\u2019s often solitary duty, with large stretches of time patrolling alone, facing constant threats from dangerous drug and human smuggling organizations." More here.

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  07/27/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine and Ian Kullgren   IT'S JOINT EMPLOYER DAY: Republicans on the House Education and the Workforce Committee will introduce their much-anticipated "joint employer" bill at a 10 a.m. press conference. Republicans loathed the Obama NLRB's 2015 Browning-Ferris decision, which made it easier to hold corporations liable for workplace violations committed by their contractors and franchisees \u2014 and therefore, for instance, to sue McDonald's Corp. in an ongoing administrative law proceeding brought by NLRB general counsel Robert Griffin. (Griffin, an Obama appointee, is still there. Trump is stuck with him until Griffin's term expires in November.) The legislation to be introduced today will reverse Browning-Ferris, and more.   Story Continued Below  A discussion draft obtained by POLITICO's Marianne LeVine on Wednesday night indicated that the new bill will narrow the definition of joint employment under not only the National Labor Relations Act (the law that the NLRB enforces) but also the Fair Labor Standards Act (which is enforced by the Labor Department and was unaffected by Browning-Ferris). "The discussion draft, which may differ from [the] final version \u2026 would allow a company to be classified a joint employer with another business (typically a franchisee or contractor) only if the company exercised direct control over that other business's employees," LeVine writes. "Under the conditions outlined in the draft bill, 'a person may be considered a joint employer \u2026 only if such person directly, actually, and immediately, and not in a limited and routine manner, exercises significant control over the essential terms and conditions of employment.'"   "These conditions, according to the draft bill, would include determining employee pay, hiring and firing employees, and setting employee scheduling. Billed as a return to the joint employer standard established under two Reagan-era NLRB rulings that governed NLRB decisions until Browning-Ferris, the statutory language in the discussion draft may be more restrictive even than those earlier rulings," writes LeVine. The press conference will take place at the House Triangle and will include Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) and several lawmakers, including Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas). Watch it here and read LeVine's story here.   GOOD MORNING! It's Thursday, July 27, and this is Morning Shift, POLITICO's daily tipsheet on employment and immigration policy.

BORDER BUCKS HEAD TO HOUSE FLOOR: The House is expected to pass a spending package this week that includes $1.6 billion in border wall funding \u2014 all while dodging a vote that might have ended in an embarrassing failure.   The House Rules Committee approved a rule Wednesday that will attach that $1.6 billion to the so-called "minibus," a four-part spending bill that covers defense, energy, veterans\u2019 affairs and the legislative branch \u2014 but not, one can't help noticing, the Department of Homeland Security, which would do the actual spending. The appropriation would pay for 74 miles of \u2026 well, not wall exactly, but a combination of fence and wall (60 miles of new fence and levee wall in South Texas and 14 miles of replacement secondary fence in the San Diego area) \u2014 the same amount requested in President Donald Trump's proposed budget.   In a strange twist, the border wall/fence faced a threat from House Republicans who wanted the minibus to include a ban on Pentagon-funded sex reassignment operations \u2014 "something GOP leaders wouldn\u2019t give them," POLITICO's Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey report. "They turned to Trump, who didn\u2019t hesitate" to ban transgender troops altogether, causing the predictable ruckus that dominated the news Wednesday.   "After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow \u2026 Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming \u2026 victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you," Trump wrote in a three-part tweet on Wednesday. This was, Bade and Dawsey write, all about saving "a House proposal full of [Trump's] campaign promises that was on the verge of defeat." Including what Morning Shift is tempted to start calling the border wence.   \u201cThis is like someone told the White House to light a candle on the table and the WH set the whole table on fire,\u201d a senior House Republican aide told Bade and Dawsey in an email. More here.   FED LEAVES RATES UNCHANGED: The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it would leave interest rates unchanged, Binyamin Appelbaum writes in the New York Times. The Fed is expected to raise rates one more time before the end of this year, but that won't likely occur before December, the Times reports. The Federal Reserve acknowledged that inflation was not as robust as officials had hoped. More here.   WATERED-DOWN ETHICS: David Apol, Trump's choice to lead the Office of Government Ethics, tried to ease up on ethics requirements for federal employees when he worked at the agency, Eric Lipton reports in The New York Times. "As recently as this spring, Mr. Apol had a disagreement with Walter M. Shaub Jr., the departing director, when Mr. Apol suggested that Derek T. Kan, then a general manager at Lyft, the car-sharing service, should not be required to sell his vested stock options in the company before he accepted a job at the Department of Transportation as the head of policy." More here.   IT'S THE ECONOMY, DONALD: In the past Trump has posted favorable poll results about his ability to handle the economy, but don't be surprised if he goes quiet on that subject. The public's faith in Trump's economic policies appears to be eroding, Heather Long reports in the Washington Post. She cites a Fox News poll that found Trump's approval rating on the economy fell to 45 percent \u2014 "the first time in his presidency [that] more Americans disapproved of how he was managing the economy than approved." Reality check: The U.S. economy hasn't changed very much, for good or for ill, since Trump assumed office. More here.   WANT A TOP TECH JOB? MOVE HERE: A recent tally by the job-search website Indeed found that eight cities accounted for more than a quarter of all tech jobs posted to its platform, the Wall Street Journal reports. The cities \u2014 Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Austin, Raleigh, Washington, Baltimore and Boston \u2014 had an even bigger footprint with high-paying tech jobs. Nearly 40 percent of tech job postings paying $100,000 or more were in those cities. More here.   LACK A DEGREE? MOVE HERE: There are 30 million jobs in the U.S. that pay $35,000 or more but don't require a college degree, Lauren Weber writes in The Wall Street Journal. The downside? There are 75 million workers without degrees, which creates a lot of competition for those jobs.   Where are these jobs? "In 2015, Wyoming had the highest share of noncollege good jobs thanks to a boom in mining and other natural-resource industries, coupled with a low overall population," the Journal reports. "It was followed by New Jersey and Maryland, densely populated states with more diverse economies." More here.   AMAZON'S JOB FAIR: Amazon "aims to fill 50,000 new positions in the U.S. by hosting a giant job fair next week, where it will be making offers on the spot," Laura Stevens writes in the Wall Street Journal. "The event, scheduled for Aug. 2 in a dozen locations around the country including 10 of its warehouses, shows how Amazon is pushing to make good on its pledge to hire 130,000 full- and part-time employees, as it competes with other logistics companies for hard-to-find workers." More here.  SANCTUARY SUSPECT BACK IN COURT: The death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco has come to symbolize the dangers of sanctuary cities \u2014 and her alleged killer is due back in court Friday, the Wall Street Journal reports. The suspect, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, is an undocumented Mexican immigrant who was released by local police despite a request by federal immigration officials to hold him.   Trump spoke about Steinle's case on the campaign trail, and even mentioned her in his speech at last year's Republican National Convention. "Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border," he said. "My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle?"   The sanctuary debate has remained heated since Trump took office. In the latest salvo, the Justice Department announced this week that it would place conditions on a grant program, and now require localities to give federal immigration officials access to jails and 48-hour notice before the release of a suspected undocumented immigrant. More on the Steinle case here.   NRA'S JOINT EMPLOYER CARTOON: The National Restaurant Association released an animated video on Wednesday night arguing that the NLRB's joint employer standard under Browning-Ferris is all wet. Watch it here.   ASYLUM BILL CLEARS JUDICIARY: The House Judiciary Committee approved H.R. 391 (115) Wednesday, a bill that would toughen standards for asylum seekers and curtail the use of parole to allow people to enter the country on humanitarian grounds or for the public interest. One core provision would require asylum seekers to prove during a so-called "credible fear" interview that their fear of persecution in their home country is "more probable than not."   The measure was introduced by former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who left Congress in June, and is now sponsored by Rep. James Michael Johnson (R-La.). The Louisiana congressman said in a written statement that the bill "ensures our asylum programs are used not for the ill-intent of bad actors." Immigrant supporters, however, were outraged. David Bier of the libertarian Cato Institute entered a statement for the record that said the bill would "undermine the individual rights of people fleeing persecution and violence" and "obliterate the current asylum standards." Read Bier's full statement here.   SNYDER SIGNS JOBS BILL: "[Michigan] Gov. Rick Snyder on Wednesday signed into law a package of bills aimed at fostering job creation in the state," the Detroit News reports. "To receive the tax incentives, companies must create at least 250 jobs that pay 125 percent or more of the region's average annual wage, or at least 500 jobs that pay the region's average annual wage or more. Certain industries, such as retail and jobs at sports stadiums, are exempt." More here.   DREAM PROTESTERS ARRESTED IN TEXAS: "Fifteen immigrant rights supporters were arrested Wednesday outside the Texas Capitol after they blocked traffic in an effort to defend existing immigrant protections and demand permanent legal status," the Texas Observer reports. "The hourlong demonstration was led by so-called Dreamers \u2014 recipients of Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 and came on the heels of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s urging the Trump administration to end the program." More here.   Speaking of Dreamers, Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) on Wednesday introduced a version of the DREAM Act, which would offer an eventual path to citizenship to DACA enrollees and other undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age. The bipartisan bill is a companion to S. 1615 (115), legislation introduced last week by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Ian Kullgren, Marianne LeVine and Josh Gerstein   GOP TEES UP JOINT EMPLOYER: After months of talk, Republicans are set to unveil a bill Thursday that would rewrite the legal definition of joint employment as laid down under the NLRB's 2015 Browning-Ferris decision. Corporations hate Browning-Ferris because it made it easier to hold them jointly liable for workplace violations committed by their franchisees or contractors. Republicans are expected to impose a stricter standard in which only a business that wields direct control over another company\u2019s employees can be classified a joint employer jointly accountable for that other company\u2019s overtime and other violations.   Story Continued Below  What else might the GOP bill include? Roger King of the HR Policy Association, testifying before the committee last month, asked lawmakers to include a "safe harbor" provision that would preempt state laws and allow companies to remove the threat of joint-employer lawsuits through the adoption of certain social-responsibility standards.   Supporters of a safe harbor clause point to Microsoft, praised by President Barack Obama in 2015 for requiring its contractors to offer its employees paid leave \u2014 a decision that, by demonstrating Microsoft\u2019s influence over the contractors\u2019 labor practices, arguably left the software giant vulnerable to joint-employer litigation. In an appellate court brief, Microsoft said the Browning-Ferris standard "will cause companies to question whether [social responsibility] initiatives will contribute to findings of joint employment relationships, and ultimately deter adoption of such initiatives."   Will the idea of promoting corporate responsibility convince Democrats to join the cause? Probably not in most cases, but Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) \u2014 who typically leans right on labor issues \u2014 is set to join House Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), along with Reps. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) and Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) at the Thursday press conference. It's unclear who will sponsor the bill; Walberg and Byrne are both strong contenders.   GOOD MORNING!

BORDER WALL WORKAROUND: "House Republicans are poised to fund $1.6 billion for President Donald Trump's border wall through a procedural maneuver designed to avoid a floor vote that might fail," POLITICO's Ted Hesson reports.   "The House Rules Committee is expected to attach funding for the wall that Trump has proposed building along the Mexican border to the so-called minibus, a downsized spending package for the Pentagon, the Energy Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the legislative branch \u2014 but not DHS, the Cabinet agency responsible for the wall," Hesson writes. "If an amendment to fund the wall is adopted by the Rules Committee, this line item can circumvent a floor vote, sparing GOP immigration moderates and fiscal hawks from being pressed to approve a project that their constituents might view as xenophobic, misguided and wasteful \u2014 and sparing GOP leaders possible defeat." The committee is expected to report out the border-related part of the spending package today. More on the maneuvers here.   TODAY:   FED WATCH: "Federal Reserve officials are likely to hold monetary policy steady at the conclusion of their two-day meeting Wednesday," Harriet Torry writes in The Wall Street Journal. "With no press conference scheduled after the meeting and no new economic forecasts to be released, any changes in their policy statement will be scrutinized for clues about the path for interest rates and when they might start shrinking the Fed\u2019s portfolio of Treasury and mortgage bonds." For a list of things to watch, read the Journal's story here.   WALMART TALKS MANUFACTURING: Walmart will host a public discussion on U.S. manufacturing beginning at 9 a.m. today. Business leaders from the company and elsewhere will be joined by members of Congress, including Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.). The event takes place at 300 New Jersey Avenue NW, Suite 800.   TRUMP: APPLE PROMISED PLANTS: President Trump told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday that Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the company would build "three big plants, beautiful plants" in the United States.   \u201cI said you know, Tim, unless you start building your plants in this country, I won\u2019t consider my administration an economic success," Trump told the Journal. "He called me, and he said they are going forward.\u201d The president did not specify the location of the plants, and Apple declined to comment. More here.   SANCTUARY CRACKDOWN: "The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will impose new grant conditions in a bid to make sure that federal money does not flow to so-called sanctuary cities," writes POLITICO's Josh Gerstein. "Localities receiving funds through one of Justice's most popular grant programs will have to meet two new conditions: allowing immigration authorities access to local jails and prisons, and giving the feds 48-hour notice before an illegal immigrant wanted by the feds is released."   In a written statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions sought to tie a recent case of human smuggling \u2014 in which 10 migrants died after sitting in a scorching-hot tractor-trailer \u2014 to sanctuary policies. "These policies also encourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law," he said. "This can have tragic consequences, like the 10 deaths we saw in San Antonio this weekend."   The logic, presumably, is that people would risk their lives to travel to the relative safety of a so-called sanctuary city (although San Antonio's police chief has contested that label). But that argument could just as easily be used to blame harsh enforcement policies that send desperate migrants further underground. More from POLITICO's Josh Gerstein here.   TRUMP TO LONG ISLAND: President Trump will head to Long Island Friday to talk about steps to eliminate MS-13, a street gang with roots among Salvadoran immigrants, the New York Times reports. The administration has flagged the gang\u2019s horrific violence to link illegal immigration to violent crime. But studies have indicated that overall, immigrants are incarcerated at a much lower rate than U.S.-born individuals. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who visited Long Island in April for the same purpose, will not accompany the president due to other travel plans, a Justice Department official told POLITICO. (Sessions and Trump are not exactly besties right now.) More from the Times here.   LOCAL TIES: At least one of the victims in the tractor-trailer case was a 19-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who grew up in Northern Virginia and graduated from a Fairfax County high school, the Washington Post's Maria Sacchetti, Moriah Balingit and Fenit Nirappil report.   "Frank G. Fuentes was one of at least six Guatemalans packed into a poorly ventilated truck with scores of other migrants who had crossed the border illegally, said Cristy Andrino, the consul of Guatemala in McAllen, Texas," according to the Post. "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said he had been brought to this country before his third birthday and was deported on March 2 after being convicted of assault and battery by a mob. He was suspected of having ties to Mara Salvatrucha, the deadly street gang also known as MS-13." More here.   DEMS MAY END NOMINEE BLOCKADE: Senate Democrats pledge to lift a blockade against Trump nominees if the GOP's Obamacare repeal effort fails, POLITICO's Seung Min Kim and Burgess Everett report.   "In recent weeks, the Senate has slowed to a crawl, taking days to process nominees such as a federal judge from Idaho and the second-ranking official at the Pentagon as a protest of sorts against the Republicans' secretive health care drafting process," Kim and Everett write. "But Democrats plan to work with Republicans for a deal on the dozens of nominations lingering on the floor once the GOP's partisan health push ends, according to Democratic senators and aides." More here.   WORK FROM HOME NO MORE: Fewer businesses are allowing their employees to work remotely full-time, John Simons reports in The Wall Street Journal. In 2016, 22 percent of employees said that they did some or all of their work at home, down from 24 percent in 2015.   IBM, Aetna, Bank of America, Best Buy, Honeywell and Reddit "are among employers that have ended or reduced remote-work arrangements recently as managers demand more collaboration, closer contact with customers \u2014 and more control over the workday," the Journal reports. More here.   EMPLOYEES WANT ... MICROCHIP IMPLANTS?: Starting next week, employees at a technology company in Wisconsin will have the option to inject a chip into their body so that manual tasks like swiping into a building or paying for cafeteria food "can be accomplished with a wave of the hand," Maggie Astor reports in the New York Times.   But the program (as you probably guessed) could create health and privacy concerns. "A microchip implanted today to allow for easy building access and payments could, in theory, be used later in more invasive ways: to track the length of employees\u2019 bathroom or lunch breaks, for instance, without their consent or even their knowledge," the Times reports. More here.   FACEBOOK CAFETERIA WORKERS JOIN UNION: "More than 500 cafeteria workers who serve food at Facebook have unionized to push for higher wages and more affordable health benefits," the Mercury News reports, citing an announcement Monday from UNITE HERE Local 19. "The move to unionize comes as thousands of contract workers such as janitors, security guards and shuttle bus drivers at other major Silicon Valley tech firms, including Apple, Intel and Google, have done the same." More here.   JUDGE BLOCKS IRAQI DEPORTATIONS: "A federal judge in Detroit temporarily blocked the deportation of more than 1,400 Iraqi immigrants with criminal records who were detained by federal immigration agents last month," Kris Maher reports in the Wall Street Journal. "U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith granted a preliminary injunction sought by attorneys for a group of Iraqis until they can make their case in immigration courts that their deportation would be illegal." More here.   COMPARE TECH SALARIES: A new tool from the pay-tracking website PayScale allows users to compare pay and employee engagement at a range of tech companies, from Airbnb and Amazon to Twitter and Uber.   "Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook top the list among all tech companies when it comes to early-career median pay, coming in at $112,000, $110,000 and $110,000 respectively," the company found. "When employees reach mid-career, however, these social media giants become somewhat less attractive; only Twitter makes it into the top-10 of the 52 companies we surveyed, sneaking in at number 10 with mid-career median salary of $157,000."

aV \u000a            By TED HESSON  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Marianne LeVine and Ian Kullgren  BACKDOOR BORDER BOOST: The House Rules Committee is expected to slip $1.6 billion in border-wall funding into the \u201cminibus\u201d spending package that\u2019s headed to the House floor this week. Why in a rule? Why not just amend the bill once it\u2019s on the floor? Probably because the wall doesn\u2019t have enough Republican support to pass there.   Story Continued Below  Back in April, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Laura Meckler and Kristina Peterson surveyed border lawmakers from both parties and couldn\u2019t find any backers of a similar fiscal year 2017 proposal from the Trump administration. \u201cNot a single member of the House or Senate representing the region expressed support for the funding request,\u201d they wrote, and \u201csenior congressional Republicans have long indicated that they prefer to leave it out.\u201d GOP budget hawks are wary of the wall, too. So are Republicans who are immigration moderates.   The Rules Committee began consideration Monday night of nearly 300 amendments to the \u201cminibus,\u201d which would fund military construction and veterans' affairs; the legislative branch; energy and water; and defense. Border wall funding falls under the Department of Homeland Security, which isn\u2019t covered by the minibus, but no matter. The $1.6 billion will likely be attached via an amendment by Rep. John Carter (R-Texas). The amendment would fund 60 miles of new bollard-style fence and new levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley ($1.3 billion); 14 miles of secondary fence in the San Diego area ($250 million); and \u201cplanning for border wall construction\u201d ($40 million) \u2014 all, Carter says, \u201cnecessary to gain operational control of the border.\u201d  Democrats blasted Republicans for avoiding a floor vote. Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), ranking member on the Rules Committee, called the border wall \u201coffensive, expensive and ill-conceived,\u201d and said funding it through a rule would be \u201cundemocratic.\u201d Earlier in the day, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said the expected maneuver was a \u201csneaky gimmick\u201d and that the border wall spending was \u201cdeeply unpopular, especially in the border communities.\u201d The committee meets again today (2 p.m. in H-313 of the Capitol) and is expected to vote on the spending package.

TODAY:  DEMS CONTINUE WAGE PUSH: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and eight Democratic colleagues will hold a press conference this morning to promote their \u201cbetter deal\u201d to \u201cboost wages, lower costs and unrig the economy.\u201d  POLITICO\u2019s Marianne LeVine reports the Democratic plan includes a $15 minimum wage, an expansion of registered apprenticeships and work-based educational programs, a tax credit for employers who train and hire new workers, and more partnerships between businesses, community colleges and technical programs. Although everybody\u2019s labeling the plan \u201cpopulist,\u201d we haven\u2019t heard a whisper, as President Donald Trump and the Senate prepare to eliminate the NLRB\u2019s pro-union majority, about strengthening organized labor\u2019s hand in collective bargaining. That didn\u2019t escape attention from the Democrats\u2019 Sanders faction. In a CNN commentary, Jonathan Tasini, who challenged then-Sen. Hillary Clinton in the 2006 Democratic primary and campaigned for Sanders in 2016, called it \u201cperhaps the most glaring omission.\u201d The press conference will take place at 10:15 a.m. in the Capitol Visitor Center. Watch a livestream here and read more from LeVine here.  SCOTT PITCHES WAGE BILL: House Education and the Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott (D-Va.) hopes to revive his moribund Raise the Wage Act, a bill that would increase the hourly federal minimum wage to $15 over a seven-year period (it\u2019s currently $7.25 an hour). Scott and 16 fellow Democrats will send a letter today to Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) that requests a legislative hearing on the bill, which would also gradually eliminate the separate minimum wage for tipped workers.   Scott will also join Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to promote the legislation at a press conference today, POLITICO\u2019s Ian Kullgren reports. The press conference is scheduled for 1 p.m. in the House Triangle. Read the letter here and the bill here.  WAITING ON THE OVERTIME RFI: Morning Shift is still waiting on the Labor Department to publish its request for information on the overtime rule. We hear the request will likely solicit comment on how (and whether) to index the threshold to inflation. Have more info? Let us know!  YOU TALK, DOL LISTENS: The Labor Department posted a notification recently that said the department will consider comments on the fiduciary rule even after the deadline for public comment passes. The rule, part of which took effect in June, required that broker dealers consider only their client\u2019s best interest (and not commissions or fees) when providing retirement advice.   Earlier this month, the department issued a request for information that gave the public until Aug. 7 to comment about the rule\u2019s effect. But according to the new notification, \u201cif commenters submit thoughtful comments \u2026 after August 7, 2017, the department will endeavor to consider those comments,\u201d at least for awhile.  DOL GETS DEPUTY COS: Molly Conway was appointed deputy chief of staff at the Labor Department, a spokesperson tells Morning Shift. Conway came to the department in February from the Senate HELP Committee and has worked for the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.   SHERROD BROWN\u2019S RUST BELT TEST: Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s re-election campaign will likely be one of 2018\u2019s most closely watched races, and it may signal that the Democratic party is doing better than some think, Ben Terris writes in the Washington Post. Brown\u2019s success in Ohio could be a model for Democrats hoping to roar back in the Rust Belt.   \u201cPeople keep asking me how I\u2019m going to win back the Trump voters\u201d Brown told the Post. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever lost them.\u201d Terris writes that Brown retains his appeal to union members. \u201cHe\u2019s fluent in pension plans, overtime work rules, and what he calls the \u2018myths\u2019 of free trade. \u2026. In an alternate universe where Hillary Clinton picked Sherrod Brown as her vice-presidential candidate, which she almost did, the Democratic ticket could have won Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and the White House.\u201d More here.  SPEAKING OF THE RUST BELT: Rust Belt states diverged from a national trend of growth in blue-collar jobs and lost 5,700 manufacturing jobs in June, according to the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cPennsylvania continues to be the leading job loser in manufacturing since President Trump took office, with a loss of 8,300 jobs since January, or 1.5 percent of the manufacturing jobs in the state,\u201d the read reads. \u201cOhio comes in second with a loss of 5,400 jobs, 0.8 percent of total employment.\u201d More here.  WHY THE FED IS WORRIED ABOUT LOW INFLATION: The Federal Reserve is expected to fall short for the sixth straight year on a goal to keep inflation rising at 2 percent, the New York Times reports. And that has economists worried (seriously).   Conventional wisdom suggests that inflation is bad, and in most respects it is. We want money to retain its buying power. But Fed economists say the expectation of higher wages and greater profits can motivate people to work harder \u2014 giving the economy a boost. And that depends on there being enough inflation to make that expectation seem plausible.  \u201cA little inflation can brighten the economic mood, causing wages and corporate profits to rise more quickly,\u201d Binyamin Appelbaum writes for the Times. \u201cEconomists like to point out that this is an illusion. If everyone is making more money, then no one can buy more stuff. Prices just go up. But the evidence suggests people enjoy the illusion and, importantly, they respond to the illusion by behaving in ways that increase actual economic growth, for example by working harder.\u201d More here.   On the other hand, Harriet Torry writes in the Wall Street Journal, not that many people are paying attention. \u201cAlmost half of Americans surveyed, 44 percent, said they didn\u2019t know when the Fed most recently [raised] short-term interest rates, according to the survey by the personal finance website WalletHub,\u201d the Journal reports. \u201cFor the record, the Fed has raised its benchmark federal-funds rate twice this year, in March and in June, bringing it to a range between 1% and 1.25%. It is likely to leave the rate unchanged Wednesday.\u201d More here.  JUDGE OKAYS LEGAL HELP FOR IMMIGRANTS: \u201cA federal judge in Seattle said Monday that nonprofit legal groups around the country can keep assisting immigrants facing deportation, after a Justice Department decision threatened to curtail much of that work,\u201d the Associated Press reports.  \u201cIn April, the Justice Department told the Seattle-based Northwest Immigrant Rights Project that it cannot provide certain legal assistance to immigrants unless it undertakes full, formal representation of them in court,\u201d according to the AP. \u201cThe organization \u2014 and similar groups around the U.S. who could be hindered by such a rule \u2014 said they don\u2019t have the resources to do so, and that the order would force them to give up preparing motions and other documents on behalf of immigrants who represent themselves.\u201d   U.S. District Judge Richard Jones had temporarily blocked the policy but issued a preliminary injunction on Monday, citing First Amendment concerns. More from the AP here.  FOXCONN PLOTS BADGER STATE INVESTMENT: \u201cTaiwan\u2019s Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones, is nearing a decision to invest in Wisconsin and could hold an event in Washington, D.C., as soon as this week to discuss U.S. investment plans,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.   \u201cIn Wisconsin, Foxconn is looking at producing display panels that can be used in large-screen television sets, three people briefed on the plans said,\u201d according to the Journal\u2019s Yoko Kubota and Takashi Mochizuki. \u201cThe investment, if confirmed, would be the latest by Asian manufacturers in the U.S. as [Trump] seeks to revive manufacturing there.\u201d More here.  FEINSTEIN WORRIES ABOUT ASYLUM SEEKERS: The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter Monday to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly that urges him to issue guidance to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers about how to handle asylum seekers. The letter, from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), follows a lawsuit filed in California earlier this month that argues asylum seekers were wrongly turned away at the border.  \u201cRecent complaints and reports have raised concerns about whether CBP officials are following proper procedures in cases involving asylum seekers arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d Feinstein writes. \u201cFor instance, there are claims that the agency\u2019s officials have falsely informed asylum seekers that there is a \u2018daily quota for asylum cases\u2019 and that they need a visa to seek asylum. In some cases, it has been reported that officials have coerced individuals to withdraw their credible fear assertion.\u201d Read the letter here.  DISNEY UNION WANTS WAGE TALKS: A union that represents 38,000 Disney World workers wants to reopen wage negotiations this year, Paul Brinkmann writes in the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cThe last time [the Service Trades Council Union] held talks with Disney World was in 2014, and the company agreed to raise wages gradually to at least $10 an hour starting in 2016,\u201d Brinkmann reports. \u201cShortly after, the raises were extended to all Disney's approximately 70,000 Orlando employees, not just those represented by unions.\u201d More here.

aV \u000a            By MARIANNE LEVINE  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Ted Hesson  THIS WEEK \u2014 OVERTIME RFI: The Labor Department is expected to release this week a request for information on the Obama administration\u2019s overtime rule. The White House Office of Management and Budget completed its review of the request last week. Issued last year, the rule doubled (to $47,476) the salary threshold under which virtually all workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay if they work more than 40 hours in a given week. But the rule never took effect because a judge issued a preliminary injunction against it. Last month, the Trump administration defended its legal authority to set a salary test to determine whether an employee qualifies for overtime pay. But it did not defend the Obama administration rule. The request for information is the Trump administration\u2019s first step in reviewing the regulation. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta acknowledged at his confirmation hearing in March that the salary threshold for overtime pay, which hadn\u2019t been updated since 2004, was due for an update. But he questioned the Obama administration\u2019s legal authority to double it. He suggested that a threshold of $33,000 would be more in line with inflation.   Story Continued Below  The request for information will likely offer some clue as to what changes the Trump administration has in mind. But don\u2019t expect a proposed rule anytime soon. In its court filing last month, the administration said it would not propose a new rule until the court affirmed its authority to set a salary test.   GOOD MORNING!

JOINT EMPLOYER BILL THURSDAY: Morning Shift hears that House Republicans will introduce legislation Thursday to roll back the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s broadened joint employer standard under Browning-Ferris. The 2015 decision made it easier to hold large companies liable for labor law violations by contractors or franchisees. Last week, House Education and the Workforce Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) wrote in The Hill that congressional action \u201cis the most logical and straightforward way to undo the damage that\u2019s been done and protect local employers and their employees from future bureaucratic overreach. To fall short of this objective is to shirk our congressional responsibilities."  SECOND QUARTER GDP OUT FRIDAY: The Commerce Department will release Friday its first cut at estimating real Gross Domestic Product growth for the second quarter of 2017. Last month, the Commerce Department reported that GDP increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter, up from an initial estimate of 0.7 percent and a second estimate of 1.2 percent, but down from the fourth quarter of 2016\u2019s 2.1 percent and the third quarter\u2019s 3.5 percent. Economists are more optimistic about second quarter GDP. According to a Bloomberg survey, analysts predict that GDP will have grown 2.6 percent. That\u2019s still well below the Trump administration\u2019s stated goal to expand the economy by 3 percent.   TODAY: DEMS RELEASE PLAN TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY: Democrats will announce today their agenda to improve the economy, entitled \u201cA Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will discuss the plan at 1 p.m. at Rose Hill Park in Berryville, Va. Watch it here.  TRUMP\u2019S NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ON HOLD: President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat national infrastructure program\u201d isn\u2019t happening anytime soon, Glenn Thrush reports in the New York Times. According to Thrush, it must wait its turn behind budget negotiations, the debt ceiling, tax reform, immigration reform, and the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Trump said in April that he would provide more details about his plan \u201cvery soon,\u201d but he has \u201cyet to even name any members to a new board he claimed would green-light big projects.\u201d AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told the Times that \u201cthe president doesn\u2019t know what his own party wants, and he\u2019s not sure what he wants ... he can\u2019t get his own party to pony up the money for infrastructure.\u201d  Sean McGarvey, president of the North America\u2019s Building Trades Union, said that he\u2019d like to see \u201ca detailed proposal that can make it through committee, and be voted on through regular order by the end of the year.\u201d But that\u2019s optimistic. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said that lawmakers might not consider a proposal until 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of waiting on the administration to tell us what it is exactly they want to do,\u201d he told the Times. More here.  ACOSTA: OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING CREATES BARRIERS: Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta encouraged state lawmakers Friday to eliminate requirements for occupational licenses where they\u2019re unnecessary. In a speech at the American Legislative Executive Council\u2019s annual meeting, Acosta said that \u201cthe growth of occupational licensing is part of a nationwide trend where we regulate, and regulate, and regulate.\u201d He noted that in 1950, 1 in 20 jobs required an occupational license. But today \u201cmore than 1 in 4 Americans need a license to legally perform their work,\u201d he said. Acosta added that \u201cexcess licensing hinders the American workforce\u201d by creating barriers for workers who have less money; who want to move to another state; or who want \u201cto leverage technology and to expand their job opportunities.\u201d  CHRISTIE VETOES PAID LEAVE BILL: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed legislation Friday to expand paid family leave to 12 weeks, up from the state\u2019s current six. The program, funded by employee payroll contributions, allows workers to take time off for numerous reasons, including the birth of a child or a sick family member. In a statement, Christie described the bill as a \u201ccostly expansion\u201d that would \u201cresult in increased taxes to be paid by working citizens in New Jersey." He recommended that lawmakers amend the bill \u201cto focus directly on raising awareness of the benefits currently available.\u201d According to NJ.com\u2019s Samantha Marcus, \u201cthe Democrat-controlled Legislature can override his veto, something it lacks the votes to do without Republican support, or it can accept Christie\u2019s recommendations.\u201d More here.  ICE TARGETS TEENAGERS IN RAIDS THIS WEEK: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will target this week teenagers who came to the U.S. without a guardian or who are suspected gang members, Julia Edwards Ainsley reports in Reuters. According to an internal memo, the raids began Sunday and will go through Wednesday. They will focus on 16 and 17-year-olds. \u201cU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that a person can be identified as a gang member if they meet two or more criteria, including having gang tattoos, frequenting an area notorious for gangs and wearing gang apparel,\u201d Ainsley writes. \u201cThe agency said it does not comment on plans for future law enforcement operations, but that it focuses on individuals who pose a threat to national security and public safety.\u201d More here.  THE RESURGENCE OF THE BORDER WALL: House Republicans are expected to include funds for a border wall in the smaller-scale spending bill they plan to vote on this week, POLITICO\u2019s Jennifer Scholtes and Sarah Ferris reported last week. Republican lawmakers, who had hoped to pass a broader range of spending measures, downsized their ambitions last week, instead opting to focus on a four-bill \u201cminibus\u201d that includes military construction and veterans\u2019 affairs; the legislative branch; energy and water; and defense.   The House Rules Committee will meet today at 5 p.m. to set up floor debate for the package. \u201cMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy has warned that \u2018late-night votes are likely\u2019 once the legislation hits the floor next week, since hundreds of amendments are expected to be filed,\u201d Scholtes and Ferris reported. \u201cStill no word on when \u2014 or if \u2014 the Senate would/could follow suit.\u201d Over the weekend, newly installed White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci said that the Trump administration is on \u201cmissile lock\u201d to build the border wall, and a House Appropriations Committee aide told Morning Shift the funds would be added as an amendment.   EPI: MINIMUM WAGE VALUE DOWN 12.5 PERCENT: The purchasing power of the federal minimum wage \u2014 now at $7.25 \u2014 is down 12.5 percent from 2009, the last time it increased, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. According to EPI\u2019s David Cooper, the decline in the buying power of the minimum wage over the past eight years is not even half the overall decline in the minimum wage\u2019s value since the late 1960s ... At its high point in 1968, the federal minimum wage was equal to $9.90 in today\u2019s dollars.\u201d More here.  PENCE TOUTS JOB CREATION IN OP-ED: Vice President Mike Pence touted the number of jobs created under the Trump administration, in a Fox News op-ed published Sunday. \u201cPresident Trump inherited an economy that would barely budge \u2014 but under his watch, American businesses small and large have already created more than 800,000 new jobs since January,\u201d Pence wrote. Although Pence got the number of jobs created right, the pace of job creation is actually  slower under Trump than it was last year under President Barack Obama. Since the start of the Trump administration, the economy has added about 172,600 jobs a month. In 2016, the economy added about 187,000 jobs a month.   SMUGGLING TURNS FATAL: At least nine people died after being packed into a tractor trailer outside a Walmart during a scorching hot day in San Antonio, Texas, a tragedy officials described as a failed smuggling attempt, Eric Gay and Will Weissert report for the Associated Press. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus called it \u201ca human-trafficking crime\u201d and \u201ca horrific tragedy.\u201d   \u201cAuthorities were called to the San Antonio parking lot late Saturday or early Sunday and found eight people dead inside the truck,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cA ninth victim died at the hospital, said Liz Johnson, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u2026 Based on initial interviews with survivors of the San Antonio tragedy, more than 100 people may have been packed into the back of the 18-wheeler at one point in its journey, ICE acting Director Thomas Homan said.\u201d A least four people in the truck were children, Homan said.  DHS Secretary John Kelly said in a written statement that the deaths show the \u201cbrutality\u201d of smugglers, who \u201chave no regard for human life and seek only profits.\u201d The sweltering temperatures in cramped trucks have led to similar tragedies in past years, including a case in 2003 where 19 migrants died while trapped inside a truck in Victoria, Texas.

NON-DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENTS PROLIFERATE: Non-disparagement clauses in employment contracts are growing in popularity, Katie Benner reports in The New York Times. \u201cTheir use has become particularly widespread in tech employment contracts, from venture investment firms and start-ups to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google.\u201d  \u201cNondisparagement clauses have become so common that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces federal discrimination laws, and the National Labor Relations Board, a federal agency that protects workers\u2019 rights, have been studying whether they are having a chilling effect on workers speaking up about wrongdoing or filing lawsuits, said Orly Lobel, a law professor at the University of San Diego.\u201d More here.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  08/04/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Doug Palmer and Adam Behsudi  A SECTION 301 DREAM DEFERRED: President Donald Trump had been planning to announce today the start of an investigation into China\u2019s violation of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers. Now, that has been postponed, two people familiar with the issue said Thursday. There was no explanation immediately given, but sources said it was now rescheduled for next week with the substance still intact.  Story Continued Below  Still, news of the postponement comes amid a series of delays for trade-related actions \u2014 most notably, a pair of Section 232 reports led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross examining whether to limit imports of steel and aluminum for national security reasons. Those had been expected by the end of June but are in limbo, after Trump said last week that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to do it at this moment.\u201d  That delay \u2014 which came after months of tough talk and threats to limit imports of steel and aluminum with tariffs, quotas or both \u2014 prompted Sen. Ron Wyden on Thursday to blame the administration for an 18 percent surge in steel imports in recent months. Speaking during a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing, the Oregon Democrat said that spike was caused by countries and companies looking to avoid future tariff increases.  "There is a real cost to the all the overhyped rhetoric, when the follow-through isn't there,\u201d Wyden said. "This episode demonstrates how tough talk without a real strategy hurts American workers," he added, complaining that the administration now seems to be "backing off" plans to restrict steel imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

Learn more: jetprogramusa.org. **   EXPERTS RING THE ALARM BELLS OVER PROPOSED 301 ACTION: Before news of the postponement broke, leading trade experts had begun to express concerns over the planned 301 action, despite the fact that they agree that something must be done to stop Chinese policies forcing foreign companies to transfer data in order to do business in the country.  \u201cWhile the administration has identified a legitimate policy problem, Trump\u2019s proposed solution may only make matters worse,\u201d Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in a blog post earlier on Thursday. \u201cIn what is now a Trump administration habit, use of an unadvised and obsolete U.S. trade law is likely to shift attention away from a real and substantive concern \u2014 i.e., China\u2019s actions \u2014 and toward Trump's own policies,\u201d he wrote.  Choosing to play outside the trade rules by starting a 301 action instead of bringing a WTO case would invite China to retaliate in a similar fashion, Bown wrote. \u201cIf Trump acts unilaterally, what is to stop Chinese policymakers from enacting their own unilateral Section 301 process?\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis will surely be abusive and less transparent than the status quo, and will lead to retaliation that hurts other U.S. exporters.\u201d  There\u2019s further concern that the Trump administration might feel \u201cincreasingly boxed in\u201d and be driven to take extreme trade action \u201cconsequences be damned,\u201d said Nate Olson, director of the Stimson Center\u2019s Trade in the 21st Century initiative.   \u201cI worry that that only increases the odds Washington will pull the trigger on a high-risk, low-reward move like 301-related duties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're only one or two miscalculations away from a trade war. The margin for error is razor-thin.\u201d  HOUSE DEMOCRATS RALLYING CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY IN NAFTA TALKS: Democratic Reps. Bill Pascrell and Debbie Dingell are asking for their colleagues\u2019 support in trying to get the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to ramp up its engagement with Congress particularly in the coming NAFTA negotiations, Morning Trade has learned.   Pascrell, the ranking member on the House Ways and Means\u2019 Trade Subcommittee, and Dingell are circulating a \u2018Dear Colleague\u2019 letter asking for signatures on a separate letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that calls for, among other things, access to negotiating texts for personal congressional staff of any member and not just those on the committees of jurisdiction; the public release of U.S. negotiating proposals; access to other documents that don\u2019t fall into the category of a U.S. proposals or the consolidated negotiating text; and the appointment of a chief transparency officer.  \u201cWith NAFTA negotiations beginning later this month, it is imperative that the Trump administration develop a process for sharing negotiating documents with Congress and the public,\u201d the two Democrats wrote in the \u2018Dear Colleague\u2019 letter. \u201cSuch a process is necessary to get Congressional and public support for any eventual agreement.\u201d  The draft letter to Lighthizer, says negotiations must be as transparent and open as possible.  \u201cThe NAFTA renegotiation will not be successful if the administration does not consult meaningfully with Congress in an open and transparent process,\u201d they wrote.  TRUDEAU PROMISES TO KEEP PROVINCES IN THE LOOP: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talked with leaders of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories on Thursday, and the officials \u201cagreed to continue to work closely together to ensure that the message about the value of NAFTA and the trade relationship with Canada is understood by key U.S. decision makers,\u201d according to a readout of the call.  Provincial leaders have already been visiting Trump administration officials in Washington over past weeks to talk about NAFTA and other cross-border trade issues and Trudeau and other Canadian officials have also made an effort to connect to U.S. governors. Trudeau said he was \u201ccommitted to continued close collaboration\u201d with provincial and territorial leaders as the negotiations unfold. However, it looks less likely that the provinces will have the same level of access that they had during Canada\u2019s trade negotiations with the European Union, where provinces were directly involved in the talks.   THE SECRET TRANSCRIPT IN WHICH TRUMP TALKS BORDER WALL: Trump privately confessed to Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto just a week into his presidency that he felt politically cornered by his promise that Mexico would pay to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, according to a transcript of a phone call released Thursday by The Washington Post.   "The fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall \u2014 I have to," Trump said. "I have been talking about it for a two-year period, and the reason I say they are going to pay for the wall is because Mexico has made a fortune out of the stupidity of U.S. trade representatives."  Trump repeatedly threatened to levy a tariff at the border against imports of Mexican goods during the same call, vowing to reduce the United States\u2019 $60 billion bilateral trade deficit with Mexico. He said he planned to tax products \u201cat a rate to be determined.\u201d  \u201cBut you know, it could be 10 percent or 15 percent or it could be 35 percent for some products that, for example, are jobs ripped from their foundation and moved to Mexico,\u201d he said, according to the transcript. \u201cMost would be in the 10 to 15 percent range. That would make us very even with Mexico and it would make a lot of sense.\u201d  \u2014 The Canada card: Trump also showed that his preoccupation with NAFTA is focused almost entirely on Mexico and that he worries \u2014 or worried at the time \u2014 far less about the United States\u2019 northern neighbor.   \u201cCanada is no problem,\u201d Trump said after Pea Nieto urged that they should continue to work to maintain a trilateral trade relationship among all three NAFTA countries. \u201cThat is a separate thing and they are fine and we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair. So we do not have to worry about Canada; we do not even think about them.\u201d  IN LAST-MINUTE FRENZY, DOZENS OF CABINET NOMINEES PASS THE SENATE: The Commerce Department is a few steps closer to being fully staffed after the Senate voted on Thursday to confirm a number of its political nominees.   Relevant to the trade world: Mira Radielovic Ricardel was confirmed as undersecretary of Commerce for export administration; Richard Ashooh was confirmed as assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration; and Karen Dunn Kelley was confirmed as undersecretary of Commerce for economic affairs.  In other posts, Ray Washburne is officially headed to become president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; David Malpass won confirmation to become an undersecretary of the Treasury; and Mark Green is slated to become the next administrator of USAID. A handful of ambassadors were also confirmed by voice vote, including Kelly Knight Craft, the new envoy to Canada.  \u201cThe Senate has confirmed more executive branch nominees this week than all of the executive branch nominees confirmed this year \u2014 combined,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward. \u201cThis was an important step towards filling critical roles throughout the administration, including the deputies at multiple cabinet offices who had been lacking these key positions.\u201d Read the full list here.  TRADE REMEDY CORNER: COMMERCE BEGINS IRON CASE AGAINST CHINA: The Commerce Department announced on Thursday a new anti-dumping and countervailing duty case into imports of certain cast-iron soil pipe fittings from China. The petitioner, the Illinois-based Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute, is seeking dumping margins of about 92 percent on imports of the product, which were valued at an estimated $8.6 million last year.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  08/03/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Adam Behsudi, Doug Palmer and Luis Sanchez  TRUMP\u2019S PLANNED TRADE PROBE PUTS BEIJING IN THE HOT SEAT: If President Donald Trump moves forward Friday with launching an investigation into Chinese industrial policies surrounding forced technology transfer, it wouldn\u2019t launch a global trade war right of the bat.   Story Continued Below  It would, however, broadcast to Beijing that the United States is not afraid to limit imports or block Chinese investment \u2014 and it tarnishes Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s preferred portrayal of China as a champion of the rules-based international system, Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer reports.  \u201cI would expect the Chinese to be critical of the announcement and defend their practices, but also sharpen their pencils to prepare to retaliate in the event that the investigation concludes with penalties against China in some manner,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, director of the Chinese business and political economy project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  The anticipated announcement would likely launch a so-called Section 301 probe that would last somewhere between six months and a year. The U.S. pledged in the mid-1990s to settle disputes through the World Trade Organization\u2019s dispute system, but as long as Washington is trying to curb an action not covered by a WTO agreement, it could move outside of the global trading body to impose unilateral sanctions.   IT\u2019S THURSDAY, AUG. 3! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is wondering if maybe it\u2019s time to watch \u201cSharknado 3: Oh Hell No\u201d to find out how many parallels the plotline has to today\u2019s reality. Got any trade news or tips to share? Let me know what you\u2019re hearing: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella.  MEXICO\u2019S NAFTA DREAMS AT ODDS WITH \u2018AMERICA FIRST\u2019: The U.S. may already be set on a collision course with its southern neighbor ahead of the upcoming renegotiation of NAFTA, after the first official glimpse of Mexico\u2019s negotiating goals this week shows a government focused on using the talks to further bolster the country\u2019s production and export platforms, Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi reports.  That goal, laid out in a statement of priorities submitted to the Mexican Senate and released this week, is unlikely to be well received by the Trump administration, which wants to revamp NAFTA in a way that reduces the U.S. trade deficit south of the border.  From Adam: \u201cThose conflicting views are balanced by the fact that many of the objectives laid out by [Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso] Guajardo square with what the U.S. wants out of a deal. But some of Mexico's priorities could be anathema to the Trump administration's \u2018America First\u2019 agenda, including demands for easing movement of workers across the border, ensuring opportunities for Mexican firms in U.S. government procurement and defending a NAFTA dispute settlement process that the U.S. has been clear it wants to jettison.\u201d  U.S. LUMBER INDUSTRY HATCHETS CANADIAN ASSERTIONS: The U.S. lumber industry is pushing back against reports that the United States and Canada are close to reaching a new agreement managing the cross-border trade in softwood lumber.  \u201cWe should be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton said in a Canadian press report. \u201cThe ball is in their [U.S.] court. We have made clear we are prepared to manage to a market share \u2013 which is what they asked. We\u2019re just waiting for them to come back, and say yes.\u201d  MacNaughton said the U.S. and Canada have already agreed to cap Canadian imports at around 30 percent and major disagreement only remains on whether Canada or other countries would get first right to supply the market if the U.S. industry can\u2019t reach its domestic demand. Canada in 2016 committed to cap its supply to the U.S. \u201cat or below\u201d an agreed upon market share.  But U.S. Lumber Coalition Executive Director Zoltan van Heyningen said the industry\u2019s understanding \u201cis that the latest Canadian proposal would result in an \u2018at or above market share\u2019 agreement, which the industry will not accept.\u201d He added that the U.S. industry is working with the U.S. government toward a final deal that contains a \u201cclean quota\u201d for capping imports as a way to help a potential expansion of U.S. production.  MacNaughton\u2019s favorable attitude toward reaching a deal is a shift from the assessment at the end of June, when officials from both sides said the two sides were nowhere close to an agreement.  \u201cIt is disappointing that Canada continues to negotiate through the media,\u201d van Heyningen said.  GARRETT SPEAKS: REFORM EX-IM, BUT DON\u2019T KILL IT: Former Rep. Scott Garrett this week finally divulged his plans for the Export-Import Bank if he were confirmed as its head, telling the top senator in charge of vetting his nomination that he supports policies that would keep the agency operational.  In a letter to Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) after the pair met Tuesday, Garrett said he fully appreciated the role the bank plays in "aiding the global competitiveness of a number of manufacturers," including the U.S. aerospace industry. "I support the president's policy of having a fully staffed EXIM board and having EXIM functional as a U.S. export credit agency," Garrett said.  \u2014 Not so fast: "I also believe that EXIM must be reformed and modernized as outlined by Congress," Garrett wrote in the letter. He also pledged to pursue regular Export-Import Bank board meetings "to transparently and thoroughly review transactions that will help create American jobs and provide maximum value to the U.S. taxpayer."  \u2014 The Trump perspective: Amid mounting opposition from major corporations, business groups and lawmakers who support the bank, Trump had privately questioned whether to stick with Garrett just a few weeks ago. But the president has now decided to give the New Jersey Republican an opportunity to save his own nomination, POLITICO\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt and Andrew Restuccia report. Trump has also underscored his support for Garrett in conversations with conservative lawmakers, a White House official said.   "He's looking to get a reformer in there," the official said, adding that Trump hopes Garrett can change the agency. The administration is developing a plan to make sweeping changes to the bank, officials said, but it's unclear when it will be unveiled publicly.  ** A message from the Japan Exchange & Teaching (JET) Program: The JET Program celebrates 30 years of strengthening educational and cultural ties between Japan and the United States.

But to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the proposal goes further \u2014 and is \u201ceven tougher\u201d on China and other bad trade actors.  \u2014 A prosecutor to combat cheating: One section of the bill calls for creating a new trade prosecutor that could work outside the constraints of the WTO to revamp the U.S. trade enforcement system. Schumer highlighted the proposal as a more effective method to punish China than the Section 301 action the administration is expected to take that would examine Chinese policies that force U.S. companies to hand over valuable technology to do business there.  "We're tougher than Section 301 action," Schumer told POLITICO. "Our proposal with the new trade prosecutor is even tougher."  \u2014 Blocking foreign investment for economic security reasons: Another provision calls for the creation of an American Jobs Security Council, a panel that could block foreign purchases of U.S. companies for economic security reasons \u2014 similar to the way the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can block sales on the basis of national security.  "CFIUS has to certify that the proposed deal doesn't harm our national security, but no one ever checks if it hurts our economic security," Schumer said. "We're not opposed to foreign investment, but we're opposed to foreign investment that only benefits the bottom line and leaves workers out in the cold."  Read the full plan here, and more from Schumer here.  WYDEN TO USTR: INVESTIGATE CHINA\u2019S FORCED TECH TRANSFER POLICIES: Sen. Ron Wyden, ranking member of the Finance Committee, sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday urging USTR to investigate Chinese policies that force U.S. companies to transfer technology in order to do business \u2014 the same policies Trump is expected to take action on as soon as this week.   "I write to urge you to investigate China's forced technology transfer policies and take appropriate action to ensure that U.S. manufacturers and service providers are no longer pressured to sacrifice critical intellectual property and operational freedom as a condition for accessing China's market," Wyden wrote.  Wyden detailed in the letter ways that China forces U.S. companies to transfer valuable technology, such as by requiring or pressuring foreign firms that want to do business in China to establish a joint venture with a Chinese partner. The Chinese government also has created tools that provide Chinese agencies with broad authority to intervene in the daily operation of companies to enable the transfer of U.S. and other foreign technology, he said.   Noting that the administration had made little progress on these issues during the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue this year, \u201cI urge appropriate additional steps be taken promptly to counter China's attempts to strong-arm U.S. innovators into giving up their intellectual property and drive U.S. firms further out of the Chinese market,\u201d Wyden said.  USTR\u2019S ENFORCEMENT AGENDA EXCLUDES ALUMINUM CASE: A case filed late in the Obama administration against Chinese government subsidies for primary aluminum producers did not receive a mention in USTR\u2019s congressionally mandated report this week on its 2017 enforcement priorities.   However, two other late Obama-era cases challenging China\u2019s domestic support for farmers and its administration of agricultural tariff-rate quotas did make the cut in a section titled, \u201cRobust Pursuit of Ongoing WTO Dispute Settlement Actions and Continued Enforcement Against Traditional Trade Barriers.\u201d   There was no explanation as to why the aluminum case was excluded, but the main industry group, the Aluminum Association, has been lukewarm on the litigation. In addition, the Commerce Department has been exploring the idea of restricting both aluminum and steel imports in the name of national security.  USTR VOWS \u2018AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF U.S. TRADE REMEDIES LAWS\u2019: Aluminum did get a mention elsewhere in the report, which USTR posted on its website without publicizing its release. In a section labeled \u201cAggressive Defense of U.S. Trade Remedies Laws,\u201d USTR noted the U.S. steel and aluminum industries are suffering from \u201cexcessive and uneconomic capacity in China,\u201d which it said is one reason why the United States will aggressively defend its trade remedy laws at the WTO.   Two other sections of the 11-page report promised \u201crigorous enforcement of intellectual property rights\u201d and a continued emphasis on \u201censuring foreign product standards do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.\u201d USTR zeroed in on a number of Chinese measures, such as its new cybersecurity law, which it said \u201cappear to discriminate against foreign technologies in the name of protecting information security.\u201d China\u2019s draft Standardization Law also raises market access concerns, USTR said.   CHINA EXPERT: \u2018ONE BELT, ONE ROAD\u2019 IS ABOUT GROWING INFLUENCE: China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative isn\u2019t solely for infrastructure and economic development, as Beijing says \u2014 it\u2019s also for expanding China\u2019s global influence, Nadge Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, said on Wednesday.  Currently, \u201cthe Chinese don\u2019t have the material and military capacities to change things on the ground through military power,\u201d Rolland said Wednesday at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They want to increase their influence through these investments so that they can serve their own interests, he said.  For Beijing, the initiative is also a way for China to continue to grow its wealth without having to reform its economic or governmental structure, argued Rolland, who wrote a book on political and strategic implications of the initiative. Outside of the country, it sets the groundwork for a Eurasian continent where all roads lead to China.  \u201cWhen you put together all the puzzle pieces, you ... get China\u2019s vision of itself, for itself, as a great power and the preponderant power of the region,\u201d Rolland said. \u201cAnd when I say region, it\u2019s from China\u2019s eastern shores to Portugal, the Middle East, central Europe, central Asia and to the eastern shores of Africa. It is a big landmass that the [initiative] is supposed to serve.\u201d  TRUMP SIGNS, BUT CRITICIZES, RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL: Moscow is facing new sanctions from Washington for its interference in the 2016 election after Trump signed the bill into law on Wednesday. But Trump, angered by provisions in the law that limit his power to lift the sanctions without congressional approval, protested in a signing statement what he saw as congressional encroachment on the president\u2019s power in foreign affairs.  In Brussels, officials had been on alert \u201cto launch countermeasures within days\u201d if it found that European companies were affected by the new sanctions coming out of Washington. After Trump signed the legislation, however, the European Commission said it was pleased the bill calls for close coordination with allies \u2014 though the bloc will \u201cremain vigilant\u201d to ensure European firms are not hit.  NORTH AMERICAN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY UNITED ON NAFTA: The major oil and gas industry organizations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are presenting a united front on what they want to see out of the renegotiation of NAFTA. The American Petroleum Institute, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Mexican Association of Hydrocarbon Companies outlined priorities that include the preservation of tariff reduction or elimination in energy trade, better market access, a modernized system of certificates of origin and regulatory cooperation. The groups also support a strong investor-state dispute settlement system. Read the full joint position paper here.  INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT  \u2014 Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said Mexico will host the second round of NAFTA talks around Sept. 10, Reuters reports.  \u2014 To make up for its lack of negotiating experience as it prepares for Brexit, the United Kingdom has set aside 2.5 million pounds to pay for training of new trade negotiators and has already spent 1.2 million pounds on headhunting, Bloomberg reports.  \u2014 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called Washington\u2019s new sanctions against Russia a \u201cfull-scale trade war,\u201d the BBC reports.  \u2014 Vietnam has begun to rebound after its export-driven economy was jolted earlier this year when the United States discarded the Trans-Pacific Partnership, VOA reports.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  08/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Adam Behsudi, Doug Palmer and Andrew Restuccia  SOURCES: TRUMP TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CHINA FOR IP THEFT: President Donald Trump will soon call on U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open an investigation against China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 for violations of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers, two administration officials told POLITICO.   Story Continued Below  An announcement is expected late this week, but an official cautioned it could slip into next week. U.S. companies have complained they are often forced to share valuable technology with Chinese counterparts as a condition of doing business in the country. Section 301 allows the U.S. to impose unilateral duties against countries that impose barriers to U.S. exports.  The action would give Lighthizer a leading role in a lengthy investigation that could peer into all aspects of Chinese industrial policies and potentially result in unilateral U.S. trade sanctions. As talk of the possible move circulated this week throughout the trade community, USTR\u2019s press office has remained mum.   Frustration that China is not doing more to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear program seems to be motivating the administration to fire a shot across the bow on the trade front, one source said. Many in the business community are likely to silently cheer the action as long overdue, but others may be worried about a further souring of the business environment and possible Chinese retaliation, a second source said.   Read Andrew Restuccia and Doug Palmer\u2019s story here.  SCHUMER ALSO SETS SIGHTS ON CHINA: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats are set to roll out new trade legislation today with a special emphasis on stopping China and other countries from cheating on trade rules and manipulating markets for an unfair advantage.   Schumer has repeatedly goaded Trump to make good on campaign promises to get tough on China. On Tuesday, he urged the president to punish Beijing for its failure to stop North Korea by blocking it from making any further purchases of U.S. companies. \u201cIf China does not change its posture, the U.S. should take clear and firm action to seek to ensure China\u2019s cooperation," Schumer said.   The Democrats\u2019 new bill is part of their effort to convince voters they can offer \u201ca better deal\u201d for the middle class than the Republicans can under Trump. Look for a story on the new legislation later this morning.   IT\u2019S WEDNESDAY, AUG. 2! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is thinking that weekly oral histories might be the best way to help us remember what happened each day in this crazy news cycle. Any trade tips or news out there to shake up today? Let me know: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella.  NAFTA VISA ISSUES COULD PIT BIG BUSINESS AGAINST CAPITOL HILL: Businesses and major companies across North America are clamoring for reforms in the upcoming renegotiation of NAFTA that would ease the cross-border movement of workers and reduce the hassle Mexican and Canadian professionals face when trying to secure visas to work in the United States. But longheld views on Capitol Hill that free-trade agreements should not be used to negotiate immigration provisions make it unlikely anything will be changed in the updated trilateral deal, Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi reports this morning.  But frustration over the agreement's outdated labor provisions runs high: A new survey of 87 of some of the largest companies in the United States and Canada found that more than 90 percent said they want a NAFTA redo to make it easier for workers in today's high-tech economy to move across the border. The survey, which was conducted by the Canadian Employee Relocation Council and is set to be released later this week, reflects frustrations from businesses that differing interpretations and inconsistent decision-making at the border costs millions of dollars each year in lost production.  In Congress, however, lawmakers have been staunchly opposed to broaching the visa issue in the context of trade deals at least as far back as 2003, when the George W. Bush administration negotiated agreements with Singapore and Chile that set aside a specific number of work visas for professionals from those countries. At the time, leaders of the House Judiciary Committee warned USTR "in the strongest possible terms to never again agree to negotiate immigration provisions in bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements."  \u201cAnything that looks like a backdoor into the immigration system is going to be a challenge,\u201d said Daniel Ujczo, a lawyer based in Columbus, Ohio, who specializes in cross-border business issues between the U.S. and Canada. Plus, with the White House aggressively pushing \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d policies, there\u2019s even less of a chance that NAFTA 2.0 will lead to a major overhaul or clarification of provisions.

It\u2019s unclear from the report if that will cover work visa issues.  "Our objective is to have an expedited negotiation that maintains the benefits that we have achieved during the lifespan of NAFTA, but which at the same time serves as a platform for the modernization of the treaty," the document says.  Mexico will seek to retain unimpeded access for goods and services in the NAFTA region, promote greater integration of North American labor markets and establish rules of origin to guarantee NAFTA's regional benefits, the document says.  GETTING BACK TO NORMAL ON JAPANESE BEEF: Negotiating a solution to the recent setback for U.S. beef producers from Japan\u2019s decision to raise tariffs on U.S. frozen beef could help pave the way to a bilateral trade deal, the U.S. Meat Export Federation is arguing this week in visits with senior trade officials in Washington.  Japan last week put in place a safeguard on imports of frozen beef after U.S. export volume exceeded a certain level. The move ratcheted up tariffs from 38.5 percent to 50 percent in U.S. producers\u2019 most lucrative foreign market. The higher tariff will remain in place until the end of March 2018 and doesn\u2019t apply to Japan\u2019s free-trade agreement partners, like Australia, a major beef exporter that already has cheaper access to the Japanese market.  USMEF President Philip Seng told Morning Trade he\u2019s pitching a solution the two countries could aspire to when officials meet again for the broader economic dialogue that launched earlier this year. One possibility is eliminating the annual 200 metric ton tariff-rate quota the U.S. places on imports of Japanese beef. By comparison, the U.S. exported 1.2 million tons of beef to Japan in 2016. The move to eliminate the TRQ could play well with Japan, which is seeking to boost exports of high-value agricultural products like Wagyu beef. Japan already hit its limit on June 16 and now faces a steeper tariff of 13.2 cents per kilogram as opposed to the 4.4 cents per kilogram that was paid for in-quota beef shipments.  He said the goodwill gesture on the part of the U.S. could be offered as a motivation for Japan to ease its safeguard measure. However, it could present a challenge for Japan since any changes would have to be approved by the Diet, but Seng said the move is unlikely to generate a major political controversy.  \u201cThat to me is an area for creativity,\u201d said Seng, who is traveling to Japan to present that option to Japanese officials. \u201cThe FTA approach is going to take a long time.\u201d  TECH GROUP PUSHES TRADE WISH LIST: U.S. technology companies face an increasing number of trade barriers around the world, including in several countries that have trade agreements with the United States, the Information Technology Industry Council said this week in comments filed with the Trump administration, which asked for input on how U.S. trade pacts are being abused and violated.   However, ITI also stressed how the tech industry has benefited from existing trade agreements, even if they could be better enforced. \u201cThey have created new commercial and investment opportunities for U.S. companies, reinforced the rule of law in U.S. trading partners, given U.S. stakeholders new tools to address difficult trade problems, allowed U.S. firms to participate in the development of regulations, and created greater global economic certainty and predictability,\u201d the group said.   Trump ordered USTR and the Commerce Department to conduct the investigation, with results expected to be delivered to the White House by the end of October. ITI urged the agencies to focus on technology-related trade barriers that prevent U.S. companies from selling their goods and services overseas or impede cross-border data flows that are vital to the economy.   A partial list of ITI\u2019s concerns includes data localization and restrictions on cross-border data flows in China, Colombia, the European Union, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia, and Vietnam; restrictions on the ability of cloud-computing companies to compete in China and South Korea; and rules that treat foreign firms and local companies differently in China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Vietnam.  AFL-CIO: GET TOUGHER ON CHINA: The AFL-CIO, in its comments, zeroed in on the labor provisions of trade agreements, which they said experience has shown are obviously inadequate. \u201cThe United States has never imposed trade sanctions, or even a fine, as a response to labor violations by FTA partner countries, even though U.S. trade partners include the world\u2019s worst violators of trade rights,\u201d the group said.   A big chunk of the AFL-CIO\u2019s relatively short submission was focused on China, which it said should be the target of much more aggressive U.S. trade action.  It called on the Trump administration to go after China in areas including currency misalignment, the exploitation of workers, unfair and predatory practices by state-owned and state-supported enterprises, illegal government subsidies, non-tariff barriers such as onerous licensing and certification requirements, forced technology transfer, intellectual property theft and overproduction.  TEXTILE GROUP: TIME FOR OTHERS TO CATCH UP WITH U.S.: The National Council of Textile Organizations, which has seen its industry shrink dramatically over the past several decades, also weighed in with criticism of trade deals.   The WTO, in particular, \u201chas fostered an entitlement mindset among many of its members, leading to a belief that industrialized countries, such as the United States, should grant ever increasing access to their markets, while being satisfied with unfair and nonreciprocal treatment on the part of other WTO trading partners,\u201d the group said.   As result of WTO commitments, the average U.S. bound tariff is 3.5 percent, compared to the WTO member average of 39 percent, the group said. \u201cClearly, the United States should not make any additional tariff concessions until other WTO members reduce their tariffs and border-adjusted taxes to our level,\u201d the NCTO said.   DEMOCRATS NOT CONVINCED BY GARRETT\u2019S EX-IM PLEDGE: Senate Democrats who have criticized Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank aren\u2019t letting the former congressman off easy in his quest to convince them that, if confirmed, he would support the bank he previously wanted to shut down.  After a meeting with Democrats on Tuesday, Garrett struck a far different tone than he did while in Congress, telling Pro Financial Services\u2019 Zachary Warmbrodt that as president of the agency he would work to advance the administration\u2019s pro-manufacturing agenda. The comment marks a stark difference from his time on Capitol Hill, when he worked to shut down the agency that he said embodied \u201cthe corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201d   "My job would be to fulfill the administration's agenda of creating more jobs and helping manufacturing in this country," Garrett said Tuesday. "That's our agenda."  But Senate Democrats walked away unconvinced, branding the meeting \u201cbizarre\u201d and criticizing Garrett for his refusal to share his personal thoughts about the bank and its mission. In a joint statement following the meeting, eight senators including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also said Garrett refused to say whether he would \u201cunequivocally support\u201d the bank\u2019s reauthorization and said \u201che clearly knew very little about the critical work the bank is doing to support small businesses and expand opportunities for U.S. manufacturers, which was both surprising and concerning.\u201d  \u201cSo we\u2019re supposed to trust that someone who has extensive history undermining and disparaging the bank will now support and lead it even though he doesn\u2019t seem to believe his own words?\u201d the group of lawmakers, including Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, and Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.).   Brown, in a brief interview after the meeting, said Garrett has a "ways to go" before he wins the support of groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. "I think there will be difficulty for Scott Garrett,\u201d he said. Read more here.  PASCRELL LEADS CALL TO REFORM VISA PROGRAM TO PROTECT WORKERS: A bipartisan group of lawmakers is calling on the president to put his money where his mouth is when it comes to protecting U.S. workers, asking him to back legislation that would reform existing visa programs and crack down on companies that abuse current law to use significant numbers of foreign workers to displace American employees.  Led by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), the ranking member on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, the five lawmakers from both sides of the Capitol urged Trump to support the Visa Reform Act of 2017 that would help close loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs and provide more oversight.  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Reps. Dave Brat (R-Va.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) also signed the letter.  \u201cIn your remarks in Kenosha, Wis., you identified the issue with current law when it comes to \u2018allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay,\u2019\u201d they wrote. \u201cTo address that issue, our legislation provides protections for American workers and visa holders and requires more transparency in the recruitment of foreign workers.\u201d Read more here.

aV \u000a            By ADAM BEHSUDI  08/01/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Megan Cassella and Doug Palmer  BUSINESS GROUPS HAVE LITTLE TO SAY FOR TRUMP TRADE DEAL REVIEW: Some of the biggest cheerleaders of free trade, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Foreign Trade Council, aren\u2019t biting on a Trump administration request for comments on its review of trade agreement violations and abuses.  Story Continued Below  The Chamber\u2019s 18-page submission is primarily focused on the opportunities that trade deals have created for the U.S. economy as opposed to their drawbacks. The organization does note that enforcement of trade agreement rules is \u201cessential.\u201d   But when it comes to addressing the core question of identifying trade agreement violations per President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, the business group makes it clear that reports like the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers are already in place to do that.  \u201cPreparation of this annual report is required by statute,\u201d the Chamber said in its comments. \u201cU.S. Chamber member companies and associations have long contributed extensively to the preparation of this report, which is and should be the default resource for the administration as it considers the next steps in its trade policy actions.\u201d  The NFTC reminded the administration in its 12-page submission that the U.S. International Trade Commission published an economic impact analysis just last year that looked at all U.S. free trade agreements since 1984, as well as the 1994 Uruguay Round world trade agreement. That largely positive report was requested by Congress in the 2015 trade promotion authority bill.  The business group also stressed the geopolitical benefits of trade deals. \u201cIt is undeniable that one of NAFTA\u2019s most important benefits is the existence of a more prosperous, stable and democratic neighbor on our southern border than was the case prior to the agreement,\u201d while other deals have helped improve ties with countries in Latin America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific, the NFTC said.   IT\u2019S TUESDAY, AUGUST 1! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is quite sure where the summer is going. It\u2019s August already and we\u2019re hoping upcoming NAFTA talks don\u2019t send a cold wind our way. Got any news to share? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.om or @abehsudi.  MNUCHIN WON\u2019T RULE OUT BLOCKING VENEZUELAN OIL IMPORTS: After taking the dramatic step Monday of slapping sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro, the Trump administration kept open the possibility of also shutting down oil trade with the South American country to punish Maduro\u2019s government.   \u201cWe very much believe that sanctions do work,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at a White House briefing to announce the action, which came one day after what U.S. officials called a sham election to give the government sweeping new powers. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and consider additional sanctions.\u201d   Mnuchin kept to that script in the face of repeated attempts by reporters to pry out more details, including whether the Trump administration could impose an embargo on oil imports from Venezuela or shut down U.S. oil exports to the country. \u201cThis president is not going to advertise what he\u2019s going to do in the future. So all options are on the table and we will consider everything,\u201d Mnuchin said.   The United States imports about 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan heavy crude oil to refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. It also exports about 30,000 barrels per day of oil to Venezuela for blending with the heavier product.   Shutting down that trade would require oil companies in both countries to scramble to find other suppliers and customers. But unless the Trump administration persuaded other countries to follow along, the move might not have much impact beyond increasing transportation costs and gasoline prices, said Adam Sieminski, a former National Security Council official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Still, the Trump administration keeps \u201ctalking about energy dominance, using our oil as a way to look strong on a geopolitical stage,\u201d Sieminski noted. \u201cSo, yes, it sounds to me like they could do something. But it\u2019s not without its complications. I think the best word for this is messy.\u201d   ** A message from the Japan Exchange & Teaching (JET) Program: The JET Program celebrates 30 years of strengthening educational and cultural ties between Japan and the United States.

Ramos, the head of the trade and NAFTA office at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, will work just below Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo and Undersecretary for Foreign Trade Juan Carlos Baker in leading the negotiations, a Guajardo spokesperson told Morning Trade.  Guajardo, speaking to reporters on Monday, highlighted Ramos\u2019 past work in Mexico\u2019s agriculture department as well as its economy ministry in announcing his appointment. \u201cHe is a man who has had a very, very long, intense and brilliant career in all foreign trade topics,\u201d Guajardo said in Spanish.   SCARAMUCCI\u2019S FALL FROM GRACE MAY INCLUDE AN EX-IM EXIT: It remains somewhat up in the air whether Anthony Scaramucci, who was ousted from his position as White House communications director on Monday after 10 days on the job, will now return to his previous role in the administration as senior vice president and chief strategy officer at the Export-Import Bank.   Scaramucci does not have any administration role \u201cat this time,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday, though she refused to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his departure. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the process tick-tock. Look, as we\u2019ve said several times before, what matters most to us is not who\u2019s employed in the White House but who\u2019s employed in the rest of the country.\u201d  The financier and Trump loyalist joined Ex-Im on June 19, though he had been on leave from the day he started and gave up his $172,100 salary. The Ex-Im gig had been seen as a \u201cvery temporary move,\u201d a way to get Scaramucci to Washington before a more prominent role could be found, one White House adviser told POLITICO.

CANADA\u2019S STATE OUTREACH EFFORT EXTENDS TO MICHIGAN: Amid ongoing efforts in Canada to ramp up economic ties with individual U.S. states before NAFTA renegotiation begins, officials in Ontario and Michigan are pledging to enhance collaboration and further integrate the Great Lakes region\u2019s automobile sector.   The memorandum of understanding signed between Michigan\u2019s Department of Transportation and Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Transportation \u201cperfectly illustrates Ontario\u2019s commitment to strengthening our partnerships across the United States,\u201d Brad Duguid, Ontario\u2019s minister of economic development and growth, said in a statement announcing the deal. The partnership will focus in part on creating self-driving technology and enable \u201cjob-creating growth\u201d for both regions.  \u201cThe deep integration of the Great Lakes auto cluster helps foster industry-leading innovation and allows companies on both sides of the border to be competitive around the globe,\u201d Duguid said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be leveraging our shared ties to enhance a crucial, growing sector, and ensure a good future for workers in Ontario and Michigan alike.\u201d  TAI MOVES UP TO TAKE DEMS\u2019 CHIEF COUNSEL SLOT ON WAYS AND MEANS: Veteran trade attorney Katherine Tai will become the new chief trade counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, taking the place of Jason Kearns, who resigned late last week as he awaits confirmation to become a commissioner at the International Trade Commission.  Tai, who has worked with the Ways and Means Democrats as a trade counsel since 2014, also has eight years of experience at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. From 2007 to 2014, Tai worked in the general counsel\u2019s office at USTR and, in her later years there, as chief counsel for China trade enforcement.  "Throughout her service in two administrations at USTR and years with our committee, Katherine has proven she has the knowledge and experience to tackle and understand our nation's most pressing trade issues," Ways and Means ranking member Richard Neal (D-Mass.) said in a statement announcing the move. "I am happy to welcome her to this new role, and I am confident she will play an important part in helping Democrats improve our nation's trade policy in the years ahead."  EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD HOBBLES ALONG: A year-old data-sharing deal between the European Union and the United States has managed to survive despite expectations that it was doomed from the start. But the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield faces an uncertain future as policymakers start planning for the first annual review of the agreement in mid-September in Washington, D.C.  \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no definitive voice from regulators on Privacy Shield\u2019s future, there will be a sword of Damocles hanging over the agreement,\u201d said Wim Nauwelaerts, a data protection lawyer at Hunton & Williams in Brussels. \u201cA lot of companies have taken the trouble to get certified, but there are still so many uncertainties.\u201d  Discussions between European and American officials are focused on small tweaks to the agreement, and the upcoming review looks unlikely to solve that uncertainty. Instead, how companies move digital data \u2014 everything from social media posts and search queries to companies\u2019 payroll and pension data \u2014 is expected to be resolved eventually by legal challenges and other disagreements that still swirl over the data-transfer agreement.

WHITE HOUSE EYES SPEEDY TAX REFORM TIMELINE: The Trump administration expects tax reform legislation to move quickly through Congress this fall, advancing through the House in October and clearing the Senate in November, legislative director Marc Short said Monday. Markups will begin in September, he said during an event hosted by a pair of conservative political groups backed by the billionaire Koch brothers \u2014 Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity.   Short's ambitious timeline is the most specific laid out by the White House or Congress in recent months, reports Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo. It tracks with a joint statement issued by administration and congressional negotiators last week, which said the expectation is that tax reform legislation will move through committees \u201cthis fall,\u201d followed by consideration on the House and Senate floor. Republicans are planning to use special instructions in a budget resolution -- should it advance through Congress -- to pass tax reform with a simple majority in the Senate in order to short-circuit a Democratic filibuster. But Short also suggested a Republican-only pathway isn't completely necessary. Some Democrats might get on board, particularly those up for reelection next year in states Trump carried, he said.  WTO RELEASES A PUBLIC-FORUM PREVIEW: Sustainability, fisheries subsidies, Buenos Aires and inclusive trade will all be in the spotlight at various points next month when the World Trade Organization kicks off its annual public forum in Geneva, Switzerland. A provisional schedule released on Monday shows that the three-day conference, entitled \u201cTrade: Behind the Headlines,\u201d will feature more than 100 sessions exploring topics ranging from potential outcomes for the upcoming ministerial conference in December to Trump\u2019s trade policies and why such protectionist views are on the rise in developed countries. Check it out here.  SOUTH KOREA TRADE MINISTER PICK DEEPENS WTO TRADE-CASE STRAIN: South Korea\u2019s appointment of Kim Hyun-chong as trade minister punches another hole in the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body, where Kim had recently begun a four-year term. Kim will have to resign his position on the Appellate Body, bringing to three the number of current and expected vacancies on the critical seven-member board. His pending departure would increase the burden on the overworked judicial panel, which has become a de facto last stop for almost every trade case filed at the WTO, and add to heated debate over how to fill the vacancies without further delaying pending cases.  Delays at the Appellate Body are already seen as normal as the judicial panel strains under the buildup of ever-more complex cases, including a long-running fight between the U.S. and the European Union over commercial aircraft subsidies. In June, Appellate Body member Ricardo Ramirez-Hernndez's second and final term ended, and on Dec. 11, the same will be true for another member, Peter Van den Bossche. Ramirez-Hernndez is staying on to handle some of the pending appeals in which he is involved. Read the full story here.  FLAKE TAKES A STAND AGAINST TRUMP: Sen. Jeff Flake, in an excerpt from his book published in POLITICO Magazine, reflects on his party\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s presidency and advises his GOP colleagues not to lose sight of conservative ideals, including free trade.   \u201cSo, where should Republicans go from here?\u201d the Arizona Republican writes. \u201cFirst, we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to speak out if the president \u2018plays to the base\u2019 in ways that damage the Republican Party\u2019s ability to grow and speak to a larger audience. Second, Republicans need to take the long view when it comes to issues like free trade: Populist and protectionist policies might play well in the short term, but they handicap the country in the long term. Third, Republicans need to stand up for institutions and prerogatives, like the Senate filibuster, that have served us well for more than two centuries.\u201d Read the full piece here.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  07/31/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Doug Palmer  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u2019S CHINA PLAN COULD COME THIS WEEK: President Donald Trump and his administration are considering a handful of economic measures meant to punish China, with a final decision coming as soon as this week, administration officials told POLITICO.  Story Continued Below  Trump\u2019s aides met over the weekend to discuss options, including trade restrictions or economic sanctions, and they will continue those conversations today. It remains too early, however, to say what the president might decide, the officials said.  While the latest discussions come as the Commerce Department continues to conduct a review examining whether to limit imports of steel and aluminum for national security reasons \u2014 an investigation aimed largely at China \u2014 this week\u2019s talks are not solely centered on that, officials said.  The decision may come as the president grows increasingly frustrated with Beijing over its handling of the North Korea missile situation, including Friday\u2019s latest intercontinental ballistic missile test. "I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!\u201d Trump said on Twitter over the weekend.  On the trade front, Trump has also long complained about what he sees as unfair trade practices by Beijing, and he has been encouraged particularly by some of the harder-line aides in his administration \u2014 like chief strategist Steve Bannon and Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro \u2014 to crack down on China.

TOUGH HURDLES IN THE CHINA BEEF DEAL: In other China news, Trump's deal to reopen China's market to U.S. beef exports could turn out to be something less than a blockbuster -- unless a large portion of the U.S. cattle industry weans itself off its reliance on artificial growth hormones, which are not allowed in shipments to China under the terms of the pact.   In exchange for Beijing dropping a ban on U.S. beef that was imposed after a few cases of mad cow disease were found in U.S. stock nearly 14 years ago, the Trump administration agreed that U.S. producers would ship only beef that came from cattle raised without artificial growth hormones. It also promised the beef would be free of any trace of ractopamine or other beta agonists, a class of feed additives used to produce leaner meat.  \u201cThose compounds are used widely in the U.S. and to forgo them would cost cattle producers and feeders upwards of $275/head,\u201d one analyst, who asked not be identified, told POLITICO in an email. \u201cThat premium is not being offset by China. We will still ship some small (niche) volumes to China, but the China deal is not commercially viable.\u201d  In a sign of the mountain U.S. producers must climb, the U.S. sold just 130 metric tons of beef to China in the one month since beef trade resumed, compared with 37,000 tons to Japan \u2014 its largest export market \u2014 over the same period.

The results of that inquiry are due to Trump by Oct. 26, although many other trade-related deadlines have come and gone in recent months.   You may recall Trump signed another executive order on March 31 asking for an investigation into the causes of significant trade deficits. That report was due to the White House by the end of June, but has not yet been released. Two other reports looking into whether the White House should restrict steel and aluminum imports to protect national security are also still under wraps, even though Trump, at one point, indicated they would be out by June 30.   STEWART AND STEWART WEIGHS IN ON WTO WOES: Terry Stewart, managing partner at the law firm of Stewart and Stewart, sent us his comments on trade agreement violations and abuses by email. He focused most of his attention on the World Trade Organization, which he argued is much harder to reform than bilateral free trade or investment pacts.  That\u2019s because \u201cthere is no agreement amongst the major economic powers on their relative responsibility for moving the system forward,\u201d Stewart said in an email. \u201cMembers, unfortunately, appear to be pursuing short term interests versus protecting the importance of a balanced system for all members in the longer term.\u201d   One big problem that hurts U.S. export competitiveness are WTO rules that treat direct and indirect taxes differently, Stewart said. Every country that runs a significant trade surplus with the United States has significant indirect taxes that are assessed on imports and rebated on exports, putting U.S. goods at a price disadvantage, he said.  Stewart also argued the WTO has inadequate rules for dealing with large state-directed economies like China. In addition, it is unable to fix errors made by its dispute settlement panels or the WTO Appellate Body. Both problems, he said, hurt the United States.   KEARNS SAYS GOODBYE, FOR NOW: Jason Kearns, the longtime chief international trade counsel for House Ways and Means Democrats, stepped down from his job on Friday while he waits for Senate action on his next gig: judging anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases as a member of the International Trade Commission. Right now, he\u2019s in a queue with several other trade nominees, waiting for the Senate Finance Committee to announce a date for a hearing.   Kearns joined the Ways and Means staff in 2006 and became chief international counsel for the subcommittee in 2012. During his tenure, he worked particularly closely with Rep. Sander Levin, the former top Democrat on Ways and Means. \u201cHis knowledge and work ethic have been indispensable to the committee as the U.S. has considered specific trade deals from CAFTA to TPP and now, the renegotiation of NAFTA. The ITC will only benefit from his experience and talents once he is confirmed,\u201d Levin said.  Current ranking member Rep. Richard Neal also wished Kearns continued success. \u201cJason has been an outstanding leader and asset to the Ways and Means Committee for more than a decade, providing insightful analysis and knowledge on a range of trade issues for staff and members alike,\u201d Neal said.   U.S. BEEF PRODUCERS COULD HAVE BEEN SPARED NEW DUTIES: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is taking Japan to task for its decision to raise tariffs on U.S. frozen-beef exports. The situation could have been prevented if the administration had moved forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership earlier this year.  The move to increase tariffs an additional 11.5 percentage points \u2014 a level that will stay in place until Japan\u2019s fiscal year ends in April 2018 \u2014 has renewed tensions between the two nations and led the secretary to warn on Friday that the bilateral relationship was at risk of moving backward.  "I am concerned that an increase in Japan's tariff on frozen beef imports will impede U.S. beef sales and is likely to increase the United States' overall trade deficit with Japan," Perdue said.  Japan's action applies to all countries with which it does not have a free trade agreement. But it does have a deal in place with Australia, so that country will benefit by not being hit by the higher duty. U.S. producers would have been spared if Trump had not withdrawn from the TPP on his third day in office and if it had ultimately been approved by Congress. But for now, the administration can only complain.  "This would harm our important bilateral trade relationship with Japan on agricultural products," Perdue added. "It would also negatively affect Japanese consumers by raising prices and limiting their access to high-quality U.S. frozen beef. I have asked representatives of the Japanese government directly and clearly to make every effort to address these strong concerns, and the harm that could result to both American producers and Japanese consumers."

DEATH OF THE BAT LEAVES CONSERVATIVES NEAR CONSENSUS ON TAX REFORM: With Republicans still reeling from last week\u2019s failed Senate vote on health care, party leaders have set their sights on tax reform for a much-needed legislative win. To that end, House Speaker Paul Ryan is working on a plan to mix permanent changes with some temporary ones in order to comply with budgetary rules and write a bill that could get passed, POLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm reports.  Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said that conservatives were at \u201c97 percent\u201d agreement on tax reform after the tax on imports, known as \u201cborder adjustment,\u201d was tabled last week.  The top priority is to lower overall business and individual tax rates as quickly as possible, Ryan told conservative activists during a closed-door meeting in his office, according to multiple individuals present. Cuts to business and individual rates will likely be permanent, as will some sort of carrot-and-stick approach to prevent companies from offshoring revenues and other assets. Read more here.  SCOTT GARRETT\u2019S EX-IM WOES PILE ON: As former Rep. Scott Garrett faces an increasingly uphill battle in his quest to earn Senate confirmation to lead the Export-Import Bank, two prominent business and manufacturing groups in Texas are protesting his nomination.  The heads of the Texas Association of Manufacturers and the Texas Association of Business are calling on Trump to withdraw Garrett\u2019s nomination, saying that his history of anti-Ex-Im views and his record of voting against the bank undermine promises to create jobs and boost the U.S. manufacturing sector.   \u201cWe cannot support a nominee who is flatly opposed to the existence of the bank - one who would destroy the Texas jobs the bank helps create and unilaterally disarm American businesses on the global stage out of misguided ideology,\u201d Tony Bennett and Chris Wallace wrote in an op-ed in the Houston Chronicle. \u201cPutting such a committed opponent of the bank in charge of its operations will only yield more of the dysfunction and gridlock that the American people rejected when they voted to change business as usual in Washington by electing Trump.\u201d   Their calls are the latest in a growing chorus of bank supporters who fear that Garrett, if confirmed, would use his position atop the agency to try to hamstring it from within. They also signal the extent to which a Washington debate is filtering down to the state level, which could ultimately put pressure on the lawmakers charged with voting on his confirmation.

Kenny Marchant (R-Texas) is urging the administration and the USTR to abide by its own stated principle for the NAFTA talks to \u201cfirst, do no harm.\u201d In a Dallas Morning News op-ed, the congressman, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, touted a series of benefits Texans have reaped from the trilateral deal. He called on negotiators to maintain the original framework of the deal while modernizing it to allow for more trade, not less.  Rules governing digital trade should be a top priority in the coming talks, Marchant said, adding that the \u201crapidly expanding digital economy\u201d was \u201cin its infancy\u201d when the nearly quarter-century-old agreement came into effect.

aV \u000a            By ADAM BEHSUDI  07/28/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Doug Palmer, Megan Cassella and Catherine Boudreau  STEEL TARIFF THREAT COOLS DOWN: President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to hit steel and aluminum imports with tariffs and/or quotas will be put on ice for a while longer, according to House lawmakers briefed Thursday afternoon by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Story Continued Below  Ross, speaking to members of the House Ways and Means Committee, \u201csaid that the current forums that we have \u2014 the WTO and the global steel forum \u2014 have not been adequate in addressing this over-dumping issue, and that he is hoping for some way to negotiate in a dialogue with these countries to resolve the problem,\u201d said Rep. Judy Chu, a California Democrat.  Ross had initially been expected to deliver reports investigating the national security threats posed by steel and aluminum imports to the White House by the end of last month. But Trump, who will ultimately decide on how to proceed and has previously promised a crackdown on steel dumping, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this week that "we don't want to do it at this moment." The president added that the administration would most likely take action "fairly soon."  Ross read the president's recent statements out loud during the briefing and said that those are the orders he is following, Rep. Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who was previously ranking member of Ways and Means, told reporters afterward.  "I think the secretary, given his druthers, is up to being part of a negotiating team with other countries," said Rep. Bill Pascrell, the top Democrat on W&M\u2019s Trade Subcommittee. Get Megan Cassella\u2019s full rundown on the briefing here.   IT\u2019S FRIDAY, JULY 28! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your hosts wishes he might be cool enough to be jamming with a funk band when he turns 84. Got any cool trade news to help us on this hot day? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.  U.S. FROZEN BEEF EXPORTS TO JAPAN TRIGGER TARIFF HIKE: As if U.S. producers didn\u2019t have enough to lose in beef exports to Japan, Tokyo invoked a safeguard measure on imports of frozen beef from the U.S. and other countries, ratcheting up tariffs from 38.5 percent to 50 percent, per the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Under the terms of its Japan\u2019s WTO membership, it instituted a safeguard that would trigger if the quarter import volume exceeded the previous corresponding quarter by 17 percent. Imports during the first quarter of Japan\u2019s fiscal year (April 1-June 30) topped the threshold by a mere 115 metric tons, meaning the increased tariff will be applied for the remainder of Japan\u2019s fiscal year. About 45 percent of U.S. beef exports to Japan are frozen.  \u201cUSMEF recognizes that the safeguard will not only have negative implications for U.S. beef producers, but will also have a significant impact on the Japanese foodservice industry,\u201d USMEF President and CEO Philip Seng said in a statement. \u201cIt will be especially difficult for the gyudon beef bowl restaurants that rely heavily on Choice U.S. short plate as a primary ingredient.\u201d  For U.S. producers, it gets worse: The safeguard won\u2019t apply to imports of Australian beef, which will continue to enjoy a lower tariff of 27.2 percent and are not subject to safeguard tariffs per terms of a deal it signed with Japan in 2015. However, the USMEF argues the Japanese food service industry prefers U.S. short plate, a belly cut, which accounts for a majority of U.S. frozen beef exports to Japan. Still, the organization acknowledges the situation makes Australia\u2019s position even more advantageous.  FINANCE SETS KAPLAN CONFIRMATION HEARING: The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the nomination of longtime trade attorney Gilbert Kaplan to be undersecretary of Commerce for international trade, nearly four months after Trump tapped him for the job.   Kaplan is a partner in the international trade group at King & Spalding, a law firm that often represents companies seeking anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports. He served as deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary of Commerce for import administration during the Reagan administration, where he supervised over 500 trade remedy cases, according to a White House bio.   Kaplan also was a key negotiator of the United States-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, an example of \u201cmanaged trade agreements\u201d that many think could come back into fashion in the Trump administration. In 2010, Kaplan represented U.S. paper producers in a countervailing duty case against China, where the petitioners asked that Beijing\u2019s policy of undervaluing its currency be treated as an illegal subsidy under U.S. trade law.  The Commerce Department decided against taking that step, but Kaplan could soon be in a position to shape its views on such matters.   In other nomination news: The White House on Thursday officially sent to the Senate its nomination of C.J. Mahoney for deputy U.S. trade representative. Mahoney\u2019s nomination as deputy in charge of investment, services, labor, environment, Africa, China and the Western Hemisphere was announced last week.  R.I.P., BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX: White House and congressional leaders agreed to drop a controversial border adjustment tax proposal as they try to move forward with a broader tax reform effort. The proposal, which would have placed a blanket tax on all imports, had been an integral part of House Republicans\u2019 tax reform blueprint as a way to pay for a corporate tax cut.   "While we have debated the pro-growth benefits of border adjustability, we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform," House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a statement.  "[W]e are now confident that, without transitioning to a new domestic consumption-based tax system, there is a viable approach for ensuring a level playing field between American and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American jobs and the U.S. tax base," they said.  The BAT could rise again: Brady, who along with Ryan was a big supporter of border adjustability, told reporters that "in order for us to unify it was important to set it aside, for now. Perhaps there will be study in future years on it."  \u201cWe\u2019ve been actively exploring with the Senate and the White House a viable alternative," he added. "[We] still have work to do but I like the path we\u2019re going.\u201d Read the full story from Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo and Colin Wilhelm.  The view from Canada: Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland took to Twitter soon after hearing the tax would be dropped: \u201cCanada is pleased to see the border tax proposal dropped by the U.S. We know our people and economies prosper together.\u201d  DONDE ESTA SONNY? Livin\u2019 la vida loca in Mrida, Mexico. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue made his first trip south of the border for meetings on Thursday that will continue today with his Mexican counterpart, Agriculture Secretary Jos Calzada Rovirosa. On Thursday, Perdue toured a pork plant and dressed in matching shirts with Rovirosa.  More broadly, the two officials are discussing trade issues, as well as hosting panel discussions with U.S. and Mexican farmers and ranchers. The goal is build personal relationships in Mexico so the two countries can collaborate on agricultural trade issues, the USDA said. The U.S. agriculture industry has been trying to assure its customers in Mexico that they are valuable partners and that preserving NAFTA is a top priority following Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric -- delivering such a message is likely the aim of Perdue\u2019s visit. The U.S. grain industry has already lost sales since the beginning of this year as Mexico pursues other buyers, particularly in South America, amid political uncertainty over NAFTA 2.0. Perdue and Rovirosa will hold a press conference today at 10:40 a.m., so stay tuned for more.  BEEF INDUSTRY: DON\u2019T WRECK KORUS, PLEASE: Trump may not think much of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, but folks in the beef industry are pretty big fans. They\u2019re also worried sales to their second-biggest export market could be collateral damage as the Trump administration pushes for changes to the pact in its quest to return manufacturing jobs to the United States.  "Under KORUS, the U.S. beef industry has seen an 82 percent increase in annual sales to South Korea, from $582 million in 2012 to $1.06 billion in 2016," top officials at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, North American Meat Institute and U.S. Meat Export Federation said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Perdue.  "Simply put, KORUS created the ideal environment for the U.S. beef industry to thrive in South Korea," the groups said. "We would not support any changes in the terms of the KORUS that would jeopardize either our market share or the significant investment that has been made in rebuilding Korean consumer confidence in the safety, quality and consistency of U.S. beef."

Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and Karen Bass (D-Calif.), introduced legislation on Thursday that would modernize the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Millennium Challenge Act.  The bill would require a new website to collect and share information on AGOA, including information on AGOA benefits in eligible countries, available technical assistance and the outcome from meetings of the U.S.-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum. The bill would also call on the president to develop and implement policies to encourage trade cooperation among eligible sub-Saharan African countries. Read more here.  FOX ON THE RUN (IN MEXICO): United Kingdom Secretary for International Trade Liam Fox isn\u2019t just talking up a bilateral with the U.S. On Thursday, he gave a speech in Mexico City on the U.K.\u2019s desire for a free-trade agreement with Mexico after it completes its exit from the EU.   Toward that goal, Fox said he and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal launched \u201can informal trade dialogue\u201d to discuss how the U.K. can maintain the preferential arrangements it currently has with Mexico as an EU member. They also reaffirmed their support for quickly finishing talks to expand and modernize an existing EU-Mexico free-trade agreement, he said.   \u201cGoing forward, our priority must be to ensure stability, continuity and transitional agreements that minimize disruption for businesses,\u201d Fox told the group. \u201cIn the same way, the U.K. wants the closest possible relationship with our European neighbours, with no interruption of our trading relationship. This will provide the most stable platform for those companies from other countries, such as Mexico, who use Britain as an access point to Europe.\u201d   WTO MEMBERS AGREE TO NEW TRADE POLICY REVIEW SCHEDULE: World Trade Organization members agreed to adjust the frequency in which countries undergo trade policy reviews \u201cto ensure the effectiveness of TPRs amid the rising number of WTO members.\u201d  The changes to the trade policy review mechanism, which regularly analyzes trade policies and practices of each WTO member, will space out the reviews that take place every two, four or six years, depending on economy size, to frequencies of three, five and seven years. The new review schedule will be phased in starting in 2019.  Consensus was reached fairly quickly by WTO standards, given that the proposed changes were first introduced last June. The 2018 schedule for TPRs, which is not subject to the new rules, was also released this month, with 23 members getting reviews, including the U.S. for the 14th time.  BELL TOLLS FOR SCOTT GARRETT: Former Rep. Scott Garrett has a growing litany of questions he must answer \u2014 and answer \u201csatisfactorily\u201d \u2014 before lawmakers will feel comfortable approving his nomination to lead the Export-Import Bank. In a letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), whose panel will lead the confirmation process, four House Democrats urged their colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to push Garrett to repudiate his previous anti-Ex-Im statements and to commit to support the bank\u2019s full reauthorization before they vote to approve his nomination.  The four lawmakers \u2014 House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Reps. Maxine Waters, Gwen Moore and Denny Heck \u2014 also asked senators to ask Garrett whether he would commit to immediately scheduling a board meeting to approve transactions waiting in the backlog. A fourth request involved asked Garrett to \u201ccommit to aggressively using the bank\u2019s tools on a going-forward basis to counter the expansion of Chinese and other foreign export credit agency financing as a means of supporting U.S. production,\u201d as well as to make sure he would not use his position to block consideration of transactions.  \u201cIf confirmed as chairman of the board, Mr. Garrett would have wide latitude to control the board\u2019s agenda and substitute his personal views for the statutory mission of the bank, destroying it from within after failing in his efforts to persuade his colleagues to legislate its demise,\u201d the four lawmakers wrote. \u201cIf he were to do so, those supporting his confirmation would be complicit in off-shoring thousands upon thousands of American jobs.\u201d Read the full letter here.

aV \u000a            By ADAM BEHSUDI  07/27/2017 10:01 AM EDT  With help from Megan Cassella, Doug Palmer, Catherine Boudreau and Zachary Warmbrodt  HOUSE REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN SHOW THEIR NAFTA LOVE: President Donald Trump got elected last year railing against NAFTA and other trade agreements. But a new letter from the 32 Republicans who were elected to the House for the first time last year shows that is a lonely position within the party.   Story Continued Below  "We recognize that a 23-year-old agreement needs updating, and commend your desire to make improvements and ensure strict enforcement," the freshman lawmakers said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. "We are also keenly aware of the potential for damage to U.S. farmers, businesses, manufacturers, service providers and workers if long-standing agreements are suddenly vacated. Canada and Mexico are our largest export markets, and our $3.5 billion in daily trade with these two countries supports 14 million American jobs."  The letter came as the U.S., Canada and Mexico are preparing to hold the first round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA beginning Aug. 16. in D.C. Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA if the other two countries don't agree to new U.S. terms.   Twenty-seven of the 32 signatories are from parts of the country that Trump won in last year\u2019s election, including Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Michigan where his anti-NAFTA message seemed to resonate the most. The letter was led by Reps. Roger Marshall of Kansas and Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, whose states Trump also won.   The lawmakers told Lighthizer they were concerned that U.S. industry and farmers are already being hurt as other countries negotiate trade agreements without the United States. \u201cThis creates a sense of urgency that makes us glad our predecessors provided you with Trade Promotion Authority, empowering you to launch, negotiate and conclude trade agreements," they said.   IT\u2019S THURSDAY, JULY 27! Welcome to Morning Trade. Be sure to stay connected: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.  LAWMAKERS, AG INDUSTRY AGREE: WE NEED SWIFT ACTION ON NAFTA: While we\u2019re on NAFTA, most members of the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday zeroed in on three issues related to the upcoming renegotiation of the trade deal: expanding U.S. dairy exports to Canada and Mexico; balancing America\u2019s $5.3 billion produce trade deficit with Mexico; and ensuring the updated pact is finalized as soon as possible, because the current political uncertainty has already hurt U.S. grain exports south of the border. Chairman Mike Conaway and Reps. Frank Lucas and Tom O\u2019Halleran, among others, emphasized the importance of expeditiously wrapping up the trilateral talks after officials from the U.S. grain industries testified that there\u2019s already been a 4 percent decline in sales of corn and a 13 percent decline in sales of soybean meal to Mexico this year when compared with 2016.   Dairy dilemmas: Former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, now president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, fielded a deluge of questions about what he described as tactics used by the Canadian government to keep U.S. dairy exports out on a whim -- most recently with the establishment of a pricing program for ultrafiltered milk (a key ingredient in cheese). Any renegotiation of NAFTA needs to ensure more predictability and transparency, as well as reduce high tariffs on U.S. dairy exports, he said.   But Canada is standing firmly in defense of both the Class 7 program for ultrafiltered milk and their supply management program, which sets production quotas and restricts imports to stabilize farmers\u2019 incomes, arguing that these policies are not the cause of the United States\u2019 milk oversupply problem. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, said during the hearing that the Canadians \u201care going to defend this no matter what,\u201d highlighting a potential rift in the coming negotiations.   U.S. produce growers want level playing field with Mexico: Lawmakers in key agriculture states like Reps. Al Lawson (D-Fla.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Austin Scott (R-Ga.) are also searching for ways to help the U.S. fruit and vegetable sector deal with what one industry official said is unfair trade practices by Mexico. Reginald Brown, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, said U.S. produce growers will face economic ruin if the renegotiation of NAFTA doesn\u2019t secure a way for regional industries to bring anti-dumping and countervailing cases against Mexico. The country prices fruits and vegetables below the cost of production, employs a web of subsidy schemes to boost production, and pays farm workers about 10 percent of what U.S. agricultural workers earn, Brown added.  BRITISH COLUMBIA PREMIER PUSHES PROVINCIAL LUMBER INTERESTS WITH ROSS: New British Columbia Premier John Horgan is the latest top Canadian provincial official to meet with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on the issue of softwood lumber trade, but U.S. industry sources say the meeting doesn\u2019t signal that any meaningful progress has been made on reaching a new softwood lumber agreement.  \u201cWe are not aware of any uptick in the negotiations process,\u201d an industry source told Morning Trade. \u201cCanada appears still unable to have a cohesive position that is consistent with their prior commitment to an \u2018at or below market share\u2019 or quota agreement construct.\u201d  British Columbia is the largest exporter of softwood lumber to the United States. Lumber producers in the province have been opposed to a new deal that would impose a straight quota. Instead, they want to see a deal similar to the one that expired in 2015, which restricted exports through a mix of quotas and export taxes. Producers in the eastern provinces, which produce and export less lumber, are less opposed to a straight quota.  Prior to his trip to Washington this week, Horgan, a New Democrat Party member who succeeded embattled former Liberal premier Christy Clark after she failed to form a majority government in elections earlier this year, said his goal is \u201cto fight for B.C. jobs in the softwood lumber dispute.\u201d  Despite the U.S. industry\u2019s misgivings, Horgan said in an editorial earlier this week that \u201ca deal is in the making \u2013 a 10-year agreement to assure Canadian producers a fair portion of U.S. market share, based on export performance since implementation of the last softwood lumber agreement, and adjusted to ongoing market conditions.\u201d  AFL-CIO PROMISES NAFTA OFFENSIVE SIMILAR TO TPP: The AFL-CIO\u2019s Executive Council issued marching orders to members on Wednesday promising to \u201cmobilize with the same level of intensity as our campaign to defeat the TPP.\u201d  The labor group body laid out a comprehensive campaign to push its demands in the NAFTA talks, which will include lobbying of elected officials; reports on the impact of NAFTA on jobs, wages and negotiating power; and joint actions with labor allies in Canada and Mexico.  \u201cWe will work to advance a set of positive and forward-looking trade rules through a comprehensive public campaign on the ground, online and over the air,\u201d the council said in its statement.  STEELWORKERS DEVASTATED BY 232 DELAY: The United Steelworkers union says Trump\u2019s decision to delay action on steel imports could have \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences as foreign trading partners rush to export steel to the U.S. under a long-delayed threat of tariffs.  \u201cSince the president announced an investigation in April, attacks on the U.S. steel sector have skyrocketed, with imports up 18 percent,\u201d USW President Leo Gerard said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cTrading partners have targeted the U.S. market for fear that the United States will finally stand up for its producers and workers and protect our national security.\u201d  Trump pushed for a report into the national security threat of steel imports and a similar one on aluminum imports to be concluded by the end of June. However, the reports have become subject to intense internal administration debate on the implications a broad tariff might have on U.S. trade relations and downstream industries. The European Union has already threatened swift retaliation if it is hit with tariffs.  Gerard acknowledged that trading relationships in the steel sector are \u201ccomplex.\u201d   \u201cBut enough time, attention and investigation have passed to know what needs to be done,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cSteel, the foundation of our national security, is crumbling under the onslaught of foreign imports. Much of that is illegally traded.\u201d  SENATORS PRESS CHINA ON CHICKEN ACCESS: More than three dozen senators signed a letter pressing Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to step up USDA\u2019s efforts to get China to end its ban on American poultry. U.S. poultry has been banned in China since 2015 over concerns of a highly pathogenic avian influenza that was detected in a wild duck.  "We encourage you to remain focused on the next steps to officially reopen the Chinese market as soon as possible," they write. "Expanding market access in growing regions in the Asia Pacific, especially China, is essential for our poultry producers and will result in the creation of new jobs and higher wages in rural communities."  The letter, which was led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), notes that China has begun its animal health audit of the U.S. poultry industry \u2014 one of the crucial steps necessary for China to resume acceptance of U.S. poultry imports.  Going forward, the lawmakers urge USDA to "remain diligent in seeking final Chinese approval for U.S. poultry\u2019s first successful shipment as quickly as possible" \u2014 preferably before Chinese New Year celebrations, as "our farmers would very much like to be able to offer their products during that time."  TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAILS A JOBS WIN: The self-proclaimed \u201cgreatest jobs president that God ever created\u201d claimed a win on Wednesday in his bid to revive the U.S. industrial sector, announcing a $10 billion investment from Taiwanese company Foxconn to open a new plant in Wisconsin and create between 3,000 and 13,000 jobs.  A senior White House official told reporters that the electronics manufacturer, whose Chinese factories supply parts for Apple\u2019s iPhones, chose to invest in Wisconsin because of \u201cconfidence\u201d in the Trump administration\u2019s business policies, including efforts to roll back regulations and overhaul the tax code.  And while it\u2019s a politically beneficial move for Trump, it might not come cheap: The deal to lure the company could include a $1 billion to $3 billion package of local, state and federal incentives including tax breaks and infrastructure improvements, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported this week.

LIGHTHIZER PLEDGES TO \u2018TAKE ON\u2019 CHINA\u2019S INDUSTRIAL POLICY: The Trump administration is focused on confronting Beijing over its industrial policy \u201cone way or another,\u201d including by holding the country accountable to the rules of the World Trade Organization, Lighthizer said in a rare media interview this week.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that China has an industrial policy that is designed to create jobs and wealth in China, and in many cases there are things that are outside of the norm of the WTO,\u201d Lighthizer told conservative talk-show host Kevin McCullough. He acknowledged that some actions were in violation of the WTO, whereas others simply weren\u2019t covered by the rules of the global trading body.   \u201cThere are examples of them subsidizing and dumping and doing other things that we would find to be noneconomic,\u201d he added. \u201cOur objective is not to let that go on in an unfair way, and that\u2019s really where the president is focused.\u201d  \u2014 No near-term demise for NAFTA: Asked during the same interview what the president\u2019s current thinking is on NAFTA and whether he still believes the deal should be \u201cscrapped,\u201d Lighthizer tamped down the idea. \u201cScrapped is too strong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the president wants very, very substantial changes.\u201d Listen to the full interview here.  A \u2018NO\u2019 FOR GARRETT: Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto plans to vote against former Rep. Scott Garrett\u2019s nomination to lead the Export-Import Bank because of his views on LGBT issues and his record of trying to shut down the bank, a spokesman for the Nevada Democrat told POLITICO on Wednesday. That comes just hours after the National Association of Manufacturers and the Nevada Manufacturers Association ran an ad designed to persuade Cortez Masto and her Republican Senate colleague, Dean Heller, to oppose Garrett\u2019s confirmation.   A spokeswoman for Heller did not respond to a request for comment. Cortez Masto and Heller sit on the Senate Banking Committee, which is vetting Garrett's nomination.  Sen. Bob Corker, another committee member, is keeping more of an open mind. \u201cWho knows,\u201d the Tennessee Republican told POLITICO, "someone like that who\u2019s opposed it but now knows they\u2019re going to lead it could end up being an inspired choice.\u201d Corker said he wanted to sit down and talk with Garrett, whom he described as a \u201cvery knowledgeable guy."  TREASURY ANNOUNCES MORE VENEZUELA SANCTIONS: The Treasury Department on Wednesday announced a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, the latest in a string of Trump administration restrictions aimed at the beleaguered Latin American country before a pivotal election on Sunday.  Sanctions were levied on nine current and former government individuals and four people connected to the state oil company PDVSA. As a result of these actions, all assets of these individuals that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and Americans are prohibited from dealing with them.   The sanctions focus on current and former officials associated with the elections or the undermining of democracy, the Treasury said.  "Anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly should know that their role in undermining democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela could expose them to potential U.S. sanctions," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  07/26/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Doug Palmer and Zachary Warmbrodt  EU PLACES A TARGET ON CHINESE INVESTMENT: Washington is no longer the only international capital aiming to impose strict new regulations on foreign direct investment \u2014 particularly when it comes from Beijing. The European Commission, aiming to strengthen its hand in limiting Chinese takeovers of some of the bloc\u2019s most strategic and valuable companies, is weighing plans to implement a radical new rulebook governing how the European Union treats FDI, five senior EU diplomats told our POLITICO Europe colleagues.   Story Continued Below  The new regulations, which are likely to be unveiled during a \u201cstate of the European Union\u201d speech in September, could mandate that all EU member countries introduce strict investment screening. It would also create a common legal base for states to stop certain investments on the basis of principles of \u201cnational security\u201d and \u201cpublic order\u201d laid down in the WTO\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services, though trade diplomats in Brussels cautioned there is still heated debate over the legal scope of the plan.  The move to screen and potentially limit foreign dollars from flowing into EU countries comes as Chinese buyouts of critical European infrastructure and high-tech businesses have emerged as one of the bloc\u2019s most contentious political issues, particularly in France and Germany.  At the same time, on this side of the Atlantic, lawmakers led by Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, are exploring methods to revamp the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to make it harder to sell companies that have advanced technology to China.

Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host is wondering if there might be something to the theory that Anthony Scaramucci got the job of White House communications director because of how well he has learned to mimic President Donald Trump\u2019s own hand motions. Any trade tips or news floating around out there? Let me know: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella.  TRUMP HITS THE BRAKES ON 232 REVIEWS: The Trump administration is unlikely to make any decisions regarding whether to limit imports of steel and aluminum for national security reasons any time soon, after the president himself told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to do it at this moment.\u201d  The administration had already missed its initial deadline of wrapping up the pair of Section 232 reports by the end of June, and Trump indicated Tuesday that was in part because of various regulations regarding any decisions. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk in and say I\u2019m going to do this,\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cYou have to do statutory studies \u2026 It doesn\u2019t go that quickly.\u201d  Back of the queue: Trump was confident that his administration would eventually be \u201caddressing the steel dumping,\u201d which he called \u201ca very unfair situation.\u201d He did not, however, indicate the action would be imminent: He started by saying it would come \u201cvery\u201d soon, but then backed off and said it would be \u201cfairly soon.\u201d  It will also likely come after other high-profile items on his policy agenda are completed. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting \u2018til we get everything finished up between healthcare and taxes and maybe even infrastructure,\u201d he said.

CANDIDATE TRUMP RETURNS TO THE STUMP IN YOUNGSTOWN: The White House had branded Trump\u2019s return to Ohio on Tuesday night as a campaign event, and in many ways, it felt like one, with the president returning time and again throughout his speech to trade. Over the course of nearly an hour, he pledged several times to bring back manufacturing jobs, promising that \u201cthey\u2019re all coming back.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told the crowd of about 7,000. \u201cDon\u2019t sell your house.\u201d  In a roughly 15-minute speech just before the rally to American veterans, Trump mentioned that he heard \u201cwe\u2019re doing better in the polls\u201d because \u201cthey see what we\u2019re doing with jobs.\u201d  He promised that audience that \u201cwe\u2019re doing trade deals\u201d and, with an apparent reference to the various regulations wrapped up in Trade Promotion Authority legislation, he defended the fact that nothing concrete has happened yet on trade. \u201cYou know, we have statutory length problems where you have to wait statutorily before you do them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everybody has been put on notice.\u201d Read more from the rally here.  FOX: HARD TO SAY HOW LONG U.S. FTA TALKS WOULD TAKE: Free-trade talks between the United States and the United Kingdom haven\u2019t even officially started, and already folks are asking how long it will take to reach a deal. That\u2019s hard to answer, but a lot will depend on how much progress is made in preparatory talks over the next two years, U.K. Secretary of International Trade Liam Fox told Bloomberg TV at the Capitol on Tuesday.   The U.K. cannot formally negotiate with the United States until it completes its exit from the EU, which is currently expected in March 2019. So the further the preparatory talks with the United States get, the faster the two sides can become FTA partners, Fox said.   However, the British official indicated he expects the U.K. will negotiate its new trading arrangement with the EU at the same time it is negotiating with the United States on a free-trade agreement. \u201cWe can\u2019t be making concessions or agreements on one of those agreements, but not on the other one. They need to proceed at around about the same pace,\u201d Fox said.   He sidestepped a question about whether the U.K. would have to lower its regulatory standards in areas like agricultural food safety to strike a deal with the United States. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re setting U.K. conditions. We\u2019re setting U.K. standards. We\u2019re neither going to be members of the European Union, nor are we going to be totally bound to the United States,\u201d Fox said.

MORE LAWMAKERS SQUEEZE SCOTT GARRETT: Three Democratic members of Congress are joining the push for Trump to withdraw his nomination of former Rep. Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank, arguing that putting a critic of the bank atop the agency \u201cmakes no sense.\u201d  \u201cGiven your expressed intention of making the U.S. more competitive, the nomination of Mr. Garrett makes no sense,\u201d Reps. Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic whip; Gwen Moore, the ranking member on the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee; and Denny Heck wrote in a letter to Trump on Tuesday.   \u201cIf confirmed as chairman of the board, Mr. Garrett would have wide latitude to control the board\u2019s agenda and substitute his personal views for the statutory mission of the Bank, destroying it from within after failing in his efforts to persuade his colleagues to legislate its demise,\u201d they added.  On the other side of the Capitol, Garrett is beginning to make the rounds among Senate Banking Committee members who ultimately will have the responsibility of vetting their former colleague\u2019s nomination. Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) both said Tuesday they had plans to meet with Garrett in the coming weeks, while Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said she was working with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to set up a time for him to speak with Democrats.  POLITICO reported last week that Trump is reconsidering his decision to nominate Garrett, who has become a political headache for the White House amid opposition against his appointment from manufacturers and major corporations. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a close Trump ally and a supporter of the bank, told Morning Trade this week that Garrett \u201cis facing a pretty bumpy road.\u201d  Collins, who worked alongside Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) to convince Trump to appoint nominees to revive the bank and offered him a list of potential names to fill the empty slots, added that he currently has \u201ca couple\u201d of names \u201cthat could be a good fallback\u201d if Garrett\u2019s nomination falls through.  \u2014 Manufacturers take the fight to print: The National Association of Manufacturers is also working to hinder Garrett\u2019s path to the agency, running full-page newspaper ads today in South Carolina and Nevada pressuring the state\u2019s two senators to oppose his nomination. The ads, slated to run in the Charleston Post and Courier and the Las Vegas Review-Journal, warn that Garrett would be "a terrible trade deal for the American manufacturing worker."  "He sent American jobs and wealth overseas," read the ads, which feature a photo of Garrett at a podium adorned with an "#EndExIm" sign. "He spread misinformation without regard to the impact it would have on the jobs of thousands of Americans."  The ads urge readers to reach out to Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), who sit on the Senate Banking Committee tasked with vetting the nominees.  \u2014 A Republican divide: Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) threatened on Tuesday to oppose Garrett\u2019s confirmation \u201cabsent a clear, public statement that ensures he will not dismantle the bank,\u201d he said in a statement. But Shelby, meanwhile \u2014 who as chairman of the Banking Committee hindered the bank by refusing to move on any of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees \u2014 has emerged as one of Garrett\u2019s staunchest supporters.  \u201cIf they were to drop him and send somebody else up, they\u2019ll have a fight on their hands,\u201d Shelby said in an interview Tuesday.  SENATORS PUSH FOR \u2018REAL RELIEF\u2019 IN LUMBER DISPUTE: Seven members of the Senate Finance Committee are pushing the administration to bring its ongoing softwood lumber dispute with Canada to a close, calling for a resolution that would provide \u201creal relief\u201d for U.S. industry and support American jobs, particularly those in the rural sector.  In a letter sent to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Tuesday, the bipartisan group of lawmakers said that "the American economy depends on a vibrant domestic lumber industry" and emphasized the need for close consultations with Congress throughout any negotiations.  Led by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Crapo, the lawmakers called for an enforceable clean quota agreement that maintains Canadian exports at or below an agreed market share, adding: \u201cAny long-term agreement must stop the harmful effects of subsidized and unfairly traded Canadian lumber on fair competition with the U.S. producers.\u201d  The two countries remain closely engaged on the issue, but senior-level officials warned late last month that it was unlikely they will reach a deal to manage cross-border trade ahead of the start of NAFTA talks on Aug. 16.  Still, officials on both sides have said they would like to resolve the issue before negotiations, and Canadian officials, including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, expressed optimism earlier this month that such a deal might be possible.  \u2014 Fueling the speculation: John Horgan \u2014 the newly sworn-in premier of British Columbia, which is Canada\u2019s largest exporter of lumber into the U.S. \u2014 is traveling to Washington to meet with Ross today and press him on a potential deal, a Commerce spokesman confirmed to Morning Trade.   WTO OFFICIAL: NEED TO \u2018SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATE\u2019 AG TALKS BEFORE DECEMBER MEETING: World Trade Organization member countries must ramp up their current talks surrounding agricultural issues and narrow the number of topics they would like to address if the global trading body wants to see any concrete outcomes settled by its ministerial conference in December, one ambassador is warning.  Stephen Ndung'u Karau, Kenya\u2019s ambassador to the WTO and the chairman of the committee on agriculture in special session, said in a report summarizing the current status of talks that member countries need to prioritize discussions and begin to move into a \u201creal intensive negotiation mode\u201d ahead of the year-end event in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After holding a series of meetings with member countries on specific proposals and areas for negotiation, the most likely areas for achievable outcomes this year are public stockholding for food security purposes, domestic support, export restrictions, and cotton, he said.  \u201cI am of the view that we will need to significantly accelerate the rhythm of our discussions after the summer break, if we are committed to progress on substance and achieve convergence on the negotiating issues in time for MC11,\u201d Karau said in the report.   TRADE REMEDY CORNER \u2014 SPANISH OLIVES CASE SETS OFF EU FARM LOBBY: Europe's largest farm lobby is urging the European government to fight back against Washington's plan to impose anti-dumping measures against Spanish olive imports, POLITICO Europe\u2019s Emmet Livingstone reports.   Copa & Cogeca boss Pekka Pesonen said Tuesday that such a move would eliminate thousands of Spanish jobs and that "imposing protectionist measures against our products without justification" is "unacceptable." The remarks come after the Commerce Department decided earlier this month to launch an investigation into whether Spanish olive were being dumped illegally in the United States and whether Spanish olive farmers were receiving subsidies under the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy that gave the Spanish industry an unfair advantage.  A European Commission spokesman confirmed that U.S. authorities had received the request from domestic producers to investigate Spanish olives on June 21. He said the Commission is intervening to defend the rights of the Spanish producers to export to the U.S. in line with World Trade Organization rules.   Brussels has already registered as an interested party in the investigations, the spokesman added.  MEMORY LANE: ITC RELEASES REVIEW OF 2016 TRADE YEAR: The International Trade Commission released on Tuesday its annual report on the year in trade, which dives deeply into everything from import and export data and analysis of all of the U.S.\u2019s existing free-trade agreements to policy developments with countries the U.S. does not currently have a deal with, like Taiwan and Cuba. The full report, which totals nearly 300 pages, is available here.  INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT  \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that \u201ca fair dispute resolution system is essential\u201d for NAFTA 2.0, setting up a possible conflict with the U.S. over Chapter 19, Reuters reports.  \u2014 Some European leaders are warning that sweeping sanctions against Russia that the House passed overwhelmingly on Tuesday could backfire, hindering transatlantic efforts to curb Moscow\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, the Washington Post reports.   \u2014 A pending decision in the trade case brought by U.S. solar manufacturer Suniva has led U.S. solar companies to purchase large amounts of cheap imported solar panels out of worry the prices could soon skyrocket, Reuters reports.  \u2014 Quartz writes an explainer piece on the United States\u2019 chlorinated chicken and whether the U.K. will accept imports of it under a new trade deal.

aV \u000a            By MEGAN CASSELLA  07/25/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Doug Palmer and Adam Behsudi  TRUMP RETURNS TO THE RUST BELT: President Donald Trump is heading back to the heartland that elected him to give a speech this evening in Youngstown, Ohio, a city he visited twice as a candidate. The White House branded the sold-out 7 p.m. rally as a campaign event, and it remains unclear what, if any, policy announcements the president might make when he returns to the stump.  Story Continued Below  But his freewheeling, improvisational style leaves open the possibility he\u2019ll touch on any number of trade-related topics that would likely resonate in Ohio, from ongoing reviews of steel and aluminum imports to his efforts to push \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d policies. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected to brief the House Ways and Means Committee on the Section 232 reviews on Thursday, suggesting that Trump is unlikely to announce any final decisions at the event this evening.  Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown on Monday called for Trump to address the administration\u2019s Buy America initiative during the event, writing on Twitter that \u201csteelworkers in Youngstown would love to hear your plan to enforce Buy America rules.\u201d  \u201cI want to help,\u201d Brown added in the three-tweet thread. \u201cMy Buy America bill w/ @senrobportman requires American infrastructure tax $ to be spent on American iron & steel. That means jobs in Ytown.\u201d The senator attached a photo of a letter he sent to Trump shortly after the election \u2014 which the president signed and sent back \u2014 and added: \u201cYou said you'd never let our workers down\u2014w/ my bill, we can work together to support what they make in the USA.\u201d  Stay tuned for more from POLITICO\u2019s Annie Karni, who is on the ground in Youngstown, later today.  IT\u2019S TUESDAY, JULY 25!

FOX BLASTS BRITISH MEDIA\u2019S CHICKEN \u2018OBSESSION\u2019: U.K. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused the British media of trivializing preparations for free-trade talks with the United States by narrowly focusing on whether London would open its market to U.S. poultry that has been treated with a chlorine solution to kill pathogens.   He made the comment at the American Enterprise Institute after being asked by a British reporter if he was prepared to eat \u201cchlorine-washed chicken\u201d and thereby signal his acceptance of a U.S. industry practice banned in the EU. That\u2019s a sensitive issue on both sides of the Atlantic. While many European consumers are repelled by the idea of eating \u201cchlorinated chicken,\u201d U.S. industry complains the EU ban is not based on sound science.  \u201cIn a debate which should be about how we make our contribution to global liberalization and increase the prosperity of both the U.K., the U.S. and our trading partners \u2026 the British media are obsessed with fully washed chickens,\u201d Fox said. He added the issue would only be addressed at the \u201cvery end stage\u201d of free-trade talks with the United States, which can not formally begin until the U.K. completes it exit from the EU in two years.   Back home in London, a food fight is looming over the idea that a U.S.-U.K. trade deal could align the U.K. more closely with U.S. food safety standards. To read more about that, click on Charlie Cooper and Adam Behsudi\u2019s story.  FOX URGES PUSH TO FINISH SERVICES TRADE TALKS: Fox also called for countries to finish talks on the Trade in Services Agreement \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d which he said would be good for both the United States and the U.K. since the strength of their economies depends so much on the services sector.   Those negotiations have been on ice since November, when Trump was elected. However, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recently made positive noises about starting them up again. "That certainly is an important one, and I don't expect it to fall by the wayside," Lighthizer told Congress in June. "We're doing an evaluation right now across the aboard, and when that is done we'll move forward where appropriate."  Asked Monday for an update, a U.S. trade official added: \u201cUSTR is still evaluating the status of these negotiations. However, given that this was only the first session of the Working Group, I think it's a bit premature to speculate. I imagine that this, among a myriad of other issues, will continue to be [an item for] discussion in future sessions of the Working Group.\u201d  The United States, the EU and 21 other WTO members have already held 21 rounds of talks on the TiSA pact. Fox said concluding those talks would be an important step toward modernizing the international trade architecture, while shifting away from a 20th-century preoccupation with \u201cgeographical\u201d trade arrangements.

U.S., U.K. TAKE FIRST STEPS TOWARD \u2018AMBITIOUS FREE TRADE DEAL\u2019: The main event of Fox\u2019s visit was the official start of preliminary bilateral trade talks under the newly established U.S.-U.K. Trade and Investment Working Group, which the two nations will use to eventually create an \u201cambitious free trade agreement,\u201d the top trade officials from each country said.  \u201cThe immediate priority is to give businesses on both sides of the Atlantic certainty and confidence," Fox said in a statement released after the first meeting. "Early discussions will focus on providing commercial continuity for U.S. and U.K. businesses as the U.K. leaves the EU."  Lighthizer added in the joint release that the working group would be a "key mechanism to deepen our already strong bilateral trade" and will help "lay the groundwork" for a bilateral trade deal once the U.K. completes its exit from the European Union sometime around April 2019.

SOUTH KOREA PUSHES BACK AGAINST REOPENING KORUS: South Korea\u2019s newly installed trade minister is pushing back against the Trump administration\u2019s request to convene a meeting in Washington on possible amendments to the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement, writing in a letter to Lighthizer on Monday that the two countries should first examine the bilateral trade deficit \u2014 and its causes \u2014 before looking to make changes to the deal. Multiple South Korean news outlets reported that South Korea's new minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Paik Ungyu also suggested the talks be held in Seoul, not Washington, \u201cat an appropriate date in the near future.\u201d  The letter to Lighthizer comes less than two weeks after USTR wrote to Seoul with a formal request to make changes to the five-year-old agreement, with a focus on reducing the trade deficit.  232 TUG OF WAR: BEVERAGE INDUSTRY PUSHES FOR ALUMINUM CAN EXCLUSIONS: Leading food and beverage companies and industry associations are adding their voice to the chorus of groups chiming in on the administration\u2019s ongoing review into whether to limit imports of aluminum, arguing that tariffs or other restrictions could lead to \u201chundreds of millions in costs\u201d for companies that rely on the material to make aluminum cans.  In a letter sent to Trump on Monday, heavyweights like the Coca-Cola Company and Anheuser-Busch argued that the administration should make an exception for can sheet aluminum because it is not widely available in the United States, so American companies that use it are dependent on imports. \u201cAny import restrictions or tariffs,\u201d they wrote, would \u201cdetrimentally affect over 82,000 American manufacturing jobs in industries that rely on these products.\u201d  Steps to restrict imports of the material would also invite retaliatory actions on U.S. exports, further damaging the industry, they wrote in the letter, which was also signed by industry associations like the American Beverage Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute.  The letter comes on the heels of a separate note sent to the administration last week by the main aluminum industry group that argued against allowing any exceptions, including for aluminum can sheet and related products used for food and beverage containers.  China does not deserve any exclusion because it subsidizes its aluminum industry and blocks foreign producers from lower-priced Chinese inputs, Aluminum Association President Heidi Brock said in a letter to Ross. Granting one exception would open the door for other products to get through because of the potential for misclassification, she wrote.  OHIO SENATORS CELEBRATE ALUMINUM EXTRUDERS\u2019 WIN: In other aluminum news, Brown and fellow Ohio Sen. Rob Portman are lauding the Commerce Department\u2019s recent finding that aluminum extruders in the United States are being harmed by unfair trade practices by foreign competitors.  \u201cI applaud Commerce\u2019s decision to fight back against Chinese efforts to avoid our trade laws and protect American jobs,\u201d Portman, a former U.S. trade representative, said in a statement. \u201cOhio aluminum producers can compete and win against anyone if they get a fair shake, and I will continue to work to ensure they are protected against those who refuse to play by the rules.\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hold cheaters accountable,\u201d Brown added. This ruling will help crack down on China\u2019s trade abuses and support American workers.\u201d  The bipartisan pair wrote to Ross last month to argue in support of the Aluminum Extruders Fair Trade Committee, pushing for the agency to rule against Chinese producers\u2019 steps to circumvent anti-dumping and countervailing duties.  MINISTERIAL ON THE MIND AT THE WTO: It may be the dog days of summer in Washington, but officials at the World Trade Organization are focused squarely on December, ramping up plans for the global trading body\u2019s ministerial conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo is set to brief the organization\u2019s full membership later this week on ongoing preparations ahead of the biennial event, where members are hoping to achieve concrete outcomes on areas including e-commerce, fisheries subsidies and agriculture.  Azevedo and Susana Malcorra, the chairwoman of this year\u2019s conference, held a meeting with the heads of all WTO negotiating group chairs on Monday to discuss their plans.  \u201cMinister Malcorra and I are working closely together to prepare the ground for a successful Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires which puts the multilateral trading system on a strong footing for the future,\u201d Azevedo said after the meeting. \u201cThe discussion with Negotiating Group Chairs was constructive, but it highlighted again what is very clear to all WTO members \u2014 there are still significant gaps between positions in many key areas. Continued engagement will be essential in the coming months in order to make progress in closing these gaps.\u201d   ENERGY DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT NEW GAS EXPORT REGS: ICYMI, the Energy Department kicked off a rulemaking to determine whether it can or should establish a special application process for the export of \u201csmall\u201d quantities of natural gas to countries the U.S. doesn\u2019t have free-trade agreements with.  According to an updated list of federal rules posted Thursday, the agency opened a new docket aimed at improving \u201capplication procedures related to natural gas exports, reduce the administrative burdens associated with the small-scale natural gas export market, and result in more efficient processing of applications for small-scale natural gas exports.\u201d  Finalizing the rulemaking, which seeks to \u201cclarify\u201d DOE\u2019s interpretation of its public interest responsibilities, would allow the agency to \u201cissue an order upon receipt of any application that seeks to export natural gas to non-FTA countries, provided the application meets the criteria for small-scale exports.\u201d  TRADE REMEDY CORNER \u2014 SOLAR INDUSTRY WINS CASE AGAINST CHINA, TAIWAN: The solar industry is celebrating a pair of appeals this week after the U.S. Court of International Trade decided to uphold the scope of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders brought against China and Taiwan. The rulings, which were handed down on Friday, upheld the Commerce Department\u2019s decision that the duties should apply to all solar modules assembled in China, including those from cells produced in any other country.  The U.S. company SolarWorld, which participated in both appeals, was \u201cextremely pleased with the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Timothy Brightbill, a partner in Wiley Rein\u2019s International Trade Practice and lead counsel to the company, said in a statement. \u201cThese broad-scope definitions were necessary to address the injury to U.S. solar manufacturers caused by the unfair trade practices of solar producers and exporters from China and Taiwan and, in particular, from Chinese producers\u2019 attempts to change their operations and sourcing patterns in order to evade duties.\u201d  Parties will have 30 days to appeal the decisions.  INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT  \u2014 Sen. Sherrod Brown, a onetime favorite to be the vice presidential candidate on the Democratic Party\u2019s ticket, gears up for his 2018 bid for reelection with an eye toward the 2020 presidential campaign, The Washington Post reports.  \u2014 Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue writes in an op-ed that while the organization feels that most of its recommendations for NAFTA \u201chave been largely heeded so far\u201d by the administration, the focus on the trade deficit is a mistake.  -- U.S. and U.K. union leaders voice skepticism about the benefits of a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement, and complain they haven\u2019t been consulted on preparatory talks, the Huffington Post reports.  \u2014 An increase in factories does not lead to as many jobs as it used to, nor does it bring higher wages, and factory closures do not always lead to a loss of prosperity, Quartz reports in an extensive data analysis project.

aV \u000a            By ADAM BEHSUDI  07/24/2017 10:00 AM EDT  With help from Megan Cassella and Doug Palmer   24 REASONS TO LOVE U.S.-U.K. TRADE RELATIONS: The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and British trade officials will begin their Trade and Investment Working Group today, with the hope that it could lead to a bilateral trade agreement after the United Kingdom officially exits the European Union. However, the two days of talks are likely to focus on a raft of near-term measures the two sides could achieve, according to business sources briefed on what to expect.  Story Continued Below  \u201cOur exit from the European Union offers an unprecedented opportunity to reshape our independent trading ambitions and build on the already strong trading relationship with our single largest trading partner \u2014 the U.S.,\u201d U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said in a statement, ahead of the meeting with USTR Robert Lighthizer and members of the USTR\u2019s European office.   Fox is expected to arrive with a list of as many as 24 \u201cconfidence-building measures\u201d that fall well outside the EU\u2019s purview, business sources said. The British government is keeping the specifics on those items close to the chest, but sources said they didn\u2019t expect them to be controversial. Separately, the two sides are also planning to review existing U.S.-EU regulatory deals on issues like air travel and mutual recognition agreements.  The other items on the agenda will dabble in longer-term prospects, such as an early effort to scope out what an eventual free trade agreement might cover, sources said.  \u201cAlthough it\u2019s too early to say exactly what would be covered in a potential deal, the working group is the means to ensure we get to know each other\u2019s issues and identify areas where we can work together to strengthen trade and investment ties,\u201d Fox said.  A U.S. trade official told Morning Trade the talks will lay the groundwork for \u201ccommercial continuity,\u201d adding that early discussions will also explore ways to strengthen trade ties that are consistent with the U.K. trade obligations as an EU member.  IT\u2019S MONDAY, JULY 24! Welcome to Morning Trade! Please, forgive us for the easy wordplay, but as we look toward the U.K. minister\u2019s visit, we have a certain ditty and video from a few years ago stuck in our heads: \u201cWhat Does the Fox Say?\u201d As that song so beautifully reminded us, the secret of the fox is an ancient mystery. Somewhere deep in the woods, we know he\u2019s hiding. If you know what this Fox has to say \u2014 or have any other news tip \u2014 let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.   FOX ON THE RUN, D.C. STYLE: Fox\u2019s schedule includes a speech at the American Enterprise Institute at 8:30 this morning; then separate meetings with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and other members of Congress; and finally dinner with U.K. and U.S. business representatives.  He will also host a breakfast with members of Congress on Tuesday to highlight a new report showing the strong ties between the U.K. and each of the 435 U.S. congressional districts. That is the companion to a previous study on trade and investment relationship between each of the 50 U.S. states and the U.K.  South of the border: Fox will then travel to Mexico for talks with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal about how the two countries can maintain their trade relationship after the U.K. leaves the EU. He will also meet with U.K. and Mexican companies and explore opportunities for U.K. companies to participate in Mexico City\u2019s new airport project, which is the biggest infrastructure project in Latin America, the British Embassy said.   Deep in the heart of Texas (industry): Fox will complete his visit by traveling to Houston to hold meetings with the chemical, oil and gas sectors. Texas exported $3.8 billion in goods in 2016 to the U.K. with nearly 900 U.K. subsidiaries operating in the state, according to the embassy. More than 53,000 Texas jobs are supported by exports to the U.K., it said.  DOW\u2019S CHINA BIOTECH BLUES: As part of the 100-day plan between the Trump administration and China, the government of President Xi Jinping pledged that its National Biosafety Committee would hold a meeting by the end of May 2017 \u201cto conduct science-based evaluations of all eight pending U.S. biotechnology product applications to assess the safety of the products for their intended use.\u201d  That wording suggested an agreement was reached between the United States and China on the eight biotechnology products in question --even if it did not promise all eight would be approved by the end of the 100 days on July 16. But now it seems that the United States and China may have been talking about two different groups of eight.   Dow AgroSciences said it previously understood that its Enlist variety of soybeans was one of those referenced under the 100-day plan. Therefore, it was surprised when China\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) recently told the company that the herbicide-tolerant variety was not actually one of the eight products on the list for potential approval under the plan.  \u201cWe are seeking to clarify MOA\u2019s position related to Enlist soybeans,\u201d Dow said in a press release. \u201cWe will continue to work cooperatively with MOA to ensure this much needed new technology will soon be available to farmers located in the U.S. and throughout the Americas.\u201d  The U.S. grain industry does not want to produce and export biotech varieties that have not been approved in China because of the potential for cargoes to be rejected. However, China does not even begin its approval process for a biotech variety until it has been cleared in another country, such as the United States. That creates an avoidable lag that frustrates the introduction of new genetically modified crops around the world.   China has approved four biotech varieties since the May 11 announcement of the 100-day plan. One of those was Dow\u2019s Enlist corn. China also approved Monsanto's Vistive Gold soybean and its 87427 glyphosate-resistant corn, which is sold under the Roundup Ready brand; as well as Syngenta's 5307 insect-resistant corn, which is sold under the Agrisure Duracade brand.  Morning Trade has asked the Trump administration whether Enlist soybeans was one of the eight varieties it expected China to evaluate under the 100-day plan, but has not heard back yet. MT has also asked the administration to provide a list of the four varieties not yet approved under the 100-day plan.   MCLARTY EXPERT SEES DIFFICULT NAFTA TALKS: The Trump administration\u2019s insistence on reducing bilateral trade deficits with Canada and Mexico in the new NAFTA negotiations could make those talks impossibly difficult, Nelson Cunningham, president of McLarty Associates said Friday during a discussion hosted by the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University.   \u201cI see three ways you can adjust a bilateral trade deficit: one is tariffs, one is quotas and one is managed trade. If those are put on the table, I don\u2019t see how either of our trading partners are going to continue. I look at the impending NAFTA negotiations and I see some very rough sledding coming up,\u201d Cunningham said.   That\u2019s particularly true for Mexico, since the United States had a $63.2 billion trade deficit with that country in 2016. \u201cYou take $60 billion of the Mexican economy, that is hugely significant,\u201d Cunningham said.   FORMER HILL AIDE: TRADE POLICY CAN\u2019T FIX TRADE DEFICIT: During the same discussion, former Ways and Means Republican aide Stephen Claeys spilled what he called the \u201cdirty secret\u201d about trade policy. (To be honest, it\u2019s a similar to the argument that a number of economists have made since Trump\u2019s election.)   \u201cYou want to get rid trade deficits? It\u2019s not trade policy that gets rid of trade deficits. It\u2019s tax policy, it\u2019s education policy, it\u2019s health care policy, it\u2019s labor policy. Those are the real things that are going to drive whether U.S. workers or U.S. companies are competitive globally,\u201d Claeys said.   Claeys went on to add that the fact the National Retail Federation ran an ad on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d against the Republicans\u2019 proposed border adjustment tax -- but failed to run any in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 \u201cshows they recognize what actually drives their competitiveness and affects them the most.\u201d   CANADA GETS READY TO RUMBLE: Canada\u2019s priorities for NAFTA 2.0 haven\u2019t been formally laid out in a convenient document, as the U.S. had to recently do under domestic fast-track legislation. But we hope to get a better sense of its goals when Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland addresses her Parliament\u2019s trade committee on Aug. 14, just two days before the first round of talks start in Washington. In a recent tweet, Freeland said she would be discussing Canada\u2019s NAFTA priorities when she appears before the committee.  It\u2019s no secret what Canada \u201cpines\u201d for during the talks \u2014 and no, we\u2019re not talking softwood lumber. Ottawa has had a long-held interest in cracking open government procurement markets in the U.S. at the federal, state and local levels. In addition, Canadian firms want better mobility for professionals back and forth across the border.   The question of whether Canada should publicly outline its negotiating objectives has been the source of internal debate in Ottawa, said Lawrence Herman, a former Canadian trade official and current adviser to the government on NAFTA issues.  \u201cIt\u2019s strategically important for Canada to set down its negotiating agenda rather than just be reactive to the U.S.,\u201d he said.  PERSONNEL SWAP: ITA\u2019S SINGH TO KPMG: Vinay Vijay Singh, an Obama-era appointee at the Commerce Department\u2019s International Trade Administration, is headed to KPMG to work as a director in the Global Infrastructure practice. As former deputy assistant secretary at the ITA, he oversaw more than 90 export assistance centers while also focusing on trade and investment policy as well as promotion efforts.  TRADE REMEDY CORNER: COMMERCE HITS TAIWAN ON REBAR: The U.S. has come after at least one country over steel this year. The Commerce Department on Friday set final anti-dumping duties, ranging from 3.5 to 32 percent, on imports of steel rebar from Taiwan, which totaled $53 million in 2016.  The decision is a victory for the Rebar Trade Action Coalition, which includes Byer Steel Group, Commercial Metals Company, Gerdau Ameristeel, Nucor Corporation and Steel Dynamics. The coalition filed a petition last year asking for import relief. The U.S. International Trade Commission still has to give final approval for the duties. That vote is scheduled for Sept. 5.  INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT  \u2014 Congressional trade leaders send comments to the U.S. International Trade Commission ahead of next month\u2019s final Miscellaneous Tariff Bill report.  \u2014 Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said there could be six to nine rounds of NAFTA talks in the event a quick deal can be reached, Reuters reports.  \u2014 Mexico\u2019s solution for rebalancing trade with the U.S. is more cross-border trade, the Wall Street Journal reports.  \u2014 The Wall Street Journal editorial board defends the choice of Scott Garrett to lead the Export-Import Bank.  \u2014 The leaders of auto worker unions in the U.S. and Canada urge a major rethink of NAFTA.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  02/06/2016 04:29 PM EST  Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign has spent the past six months shopping a story to news organizations that suggests my reporting has been influenced by some long-held personal grudge between Rubio and myself. It's an interesting narrative, but it's not true.  Several reporters have called this afternoon saying the Rubio camp is shopping this story again with increased intensity because of my interview with Rick Santorum. I had the temerity to ask Santorum to list one accomplishment of Rubio. He couldn't, but the campaign is trying to limit damage by suggesting there is some hidden back story. There isn't.   Since the Rubio campaign has been shopping this false tale for six months now, and since reporters always find there is nothing to the story, I thought I would save editors some time.   I have never met Rubio. Though we both come from the same state, Florida is a really big state.   We were both in Congress, but I left Washington nearly a decade before Rubio arrived. We never crossed paths politically, professionally, or socially. And I know nothing of him personally other than what I read in newspapers.  I have never once said a single thing negative about Rubio personally off the air. Not once.  There is no one in the entire state of Florida, in Washington, D.C., in New York, in the political world, the media world, or the business world that can name a time that I have ever spoken an ill word about Rubio as a person.   Why? Because I do not know him.  The same can be said of Peyton Manning. The Broncos' QB is the last guy I would want to take into the Super Bowl because he seems to underperform in big games. I've even criticized his performances through the years, but I have no opinion of him as a person because, like Rubio, I don't know him.  I'm sure Manning and Rubio are wonderful guys, but I wouldn't know. I've never met them. Even if I had, that would not impact my coverage, which has been tough on George W. Bush, John Kerry, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney, and just about every major candidate for national office. I even hung up on Donald Trump on live television.  Sometimes I miss the target. The biggest example of this was my take on then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, when I said the candidate was sold like a Coke can with a cool label that read "Hope and Change." I considered Obama's 2008 campaign to be as vacuous a major candidacy as I had ever seen. I never believed Americans would elect someone so untested to the presidency. I was wrong.   Rubio may prove me wrong as well. But if I am wrong, it is not because of some long-buried personal grudge between Rubio and myself. As I've said, I don't know him. Instead, I have questions about Rubio's ability to govern the country. And like any smart voter, I have questions about all the other candidates' abilities as well. But when I ask someone endorsing Rubio to list a single accomplishment of the Florida senator -- and that is seen as a trick question -- there may be a deeper problem with the candidate that can't be fixed by spinning false tales about a news host.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  04/04/2015 01:15 PM EDT  On my long commute home at the start of this holiday weekend, I did an interview with Hugh Hewitt, who asked as he always does if I am thinking of running for president next year.  I said \u201cNo.\u201d  Hugh then asked if I would consider running for Marco Rubio\u2019s seat in 2016. Again, I said \u201cno\u201d but said if I were running for anything, it would be in Florida and that 2018 would make more sense than 2016. Hugh then said he was going to trumpet the breaking news that I was running in 2018. I laughed and said"Well, you can make that up if you want to.\u201d  We then got on to the topics I called in to discuss. Proving that it takes very little to make news these days, several blogs began talking about a future Senate run. The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple wrote and asked whether I was serious about a run.  This was my response by email:   Never given it a serious thought. I've always thought about getting back in public service one day but was just responding to 2016 question he always asks. I said no to POTUS run and 2016 Senate run and then suggested 2018 was more realistic, but that's not realistic either. I'm in a contract with NBC until 2019 and have a 6 year old and 11 year old in school very far away from Florida. Besides, I love what I am doing.  If I ever get back into public service, I suspect it is at least a decade away. And I doubt I will even then. Hugh got me talking when I was on my commute home on a Friday at the end of a long week. It's not going to happen.  Thanks for the question.  All the best,   Joe  Now back to painting Easter eggs with the kids.  Happy Easter!

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  02/22/2015 04:09 PM EST  Much has been written and said about Chris Christie\u2019s fall, from being hailed as the GOP\u2019s brightest rising star in 2013 to being dismissed in the New York Times and Washington Post as an out-of-touch has-been. Those articles, like much of the commentary on news shows like \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d have picked apart Governor Christie\u2019s management style, his approach to the press, and a series of miscues that followed his massive reelection landslide just 15 months ago.  Does Chris Christie seem prickly, out-of-touch, and temperamentally overmatched by the challenges of a long-running presidential campaign? Maybe. But right now, all the chattering about the New Jersey governor\u2019s failings means about as much as the kudos Rudy Giuliani was receiving at this point in the 2008 election cycle. The fact is you never know how a candidate and his family will respond to the rigors of a presidential campaign until they actually jump into the campaign.  \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d was not up to the challenges of the process required to become America\u2019s president. And the same Bill Clinton who Sen. Bob Kerrey and many others predicted would be \u201copened up like a rusty can\u201d by the glare of a presidential campaign staggered through the snows of New Hampshire in 1992 with sex scandals, draft controversies, and a slew of other challenges chasing him down to his supposed political death. He went on to be the first Democrat to get elected twice since FDR.  (More columns and blogs from Joe Scarborough)  Despite everyone\u2019s best guesses about Chris Christie, the fact is that you never know whether a batter can hit a curveball in the Bigs until, well, he steps into the batter\u2019s box and takes a swing. All the missteps from Trenton to 10 Downing Street won\u2019t mean a thing if Christie hits it out of the park in his first few New Hampshire town-hall meetings. If he does, you can bet the star-maker machinery will slowly start churning his way and we will excitedly start talking about \u201cThe Christie Comeback.\u201d  Will it happen? Who knows? But we will all get a better clue about whether it can happen or not when the governor has to handle that first curveball aimed at his head once this long political preseason finally comes to an end.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  01/30/2015 04:36 PM EST  Mitt is out. Jeb is in. The race is over. Right?  If the past half century of GOP history is any indication, the planning for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 coronation should begin at once. Republicans do not take chances on unknown first-term senators or peanut farmers from Plains. They find the most established characters in the room while taking few chances.  If you want a glimpse into just how risk averse Republicans are, consider that the GOP ticket has won the White House since 1928 only when a Nixon or Bush has been on the ticket. Also note that six of the last seven nominees for the party inherited their political fame from their fathers.  In 1988 and 1992, the GOP nominee was the son of a patriarch and U.S. senator. In 2000 and 2004, the nominee was the son of a U.S. president. In 2008, the nominee was the son of an admiral who ran the United States Navy. In 2012, the nominee was the son of a Michigan governor who also ran one of the largest car companies in the world.  This lust for legacy may be a great way to run Skull and Bones or exclusive country clubs, but it is no way to win the White House back. Maybe that is why Republicans have lost six of the last seven popular votes in presidential elections. And maybe that is why Mitt Romney urged Republicans earlier today to start looking for new leaders to move the GOP forward.  Still, the smart money in 2016 is on the son of a president, and the brother of another president, whom he helped make president when he, himself, was still the governor of Florida.  Will this South American-styled one-family-rule routine work next year? Perhaps, but at some point, the Republican Party will either find new leaders to shake up the GOP establishment or it will keep doing what it does so well in presidential years: lose.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  01/10/2015 07:01 PM EST  Democrats and Republicans are scrambling to take credit for this month's jobs report. They should save their energy.  There is some good news. America created more jobs last year than anytime since 1999, and it continues to be unaffected by weak economies in Europe and Japan. The U.S. unemployment rate also fell to 5.6 percent in December, but the .02 percent drop in unemployment was driven more by workers leaving the labor force than by new jobs. More troubling than that was the continued curse of flat wages on working-class Americans. Last month, average hourly earnings for all private-sector workers dropped, and economists expect wages to stay flat for the foreseeable future.  That continues a troubling 40-year trend.  Washington's great challenge is to move beyond the smallness that has defined politics over the past decade and get to work on improving wages that have been on the decline since 1973. American workers deserve as much \u2014 or at least a little more than having party leaders rushing to take credit for an economy that is improving but still leaving too many behind.

aV \u000a                AP Photo  \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  01/05/2015 09:33 PM EST  I remember the warnings early in my first campaign.\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time, son. They don\u2019t send Republicans to Congress around here.\u201d  Maybe they were right. Maybe Florida\u2019s 1st District hadn\u2019t sent a Republican to Washington since 1873. But I couldn\u2019t care less.  \u201cYep. They never will until they do,\u201d is all I said.  And that year they did.  I learned that political lesson while following the most important political campaign of my lifetime, Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide win in 1980. For weeks leading up to the election, all the smart guys were saying that Ronald Reagan was a joke, an intellectual lightweight, a political extremist, and a lousy B-list actor. There was no way a hack like that would ever be elected president. But after Americans finished voting, the network\u2019s maps started lighting up in blue (back when GOP states were shaded that color).  Before supper was over in the Central Time Zone, the Reagan Revolution had swept across the nation in a way that shook political elites and the media establishment.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d one network commentator barked after reporting on the loss of one liberal senator after another.  What was going on was a dramatic sea change \u2014 the kind that happens not only in politics but also in business, the media, and this week, college football.  For a decade, the easiest bet in sports was putting money on a Southeastern Conference team when it played a painfully slow Big Ten power. When Alabama faced Michigan State a few years back, the outcome was obvious before the opening kickoff despite the fact the Spartans were feared across the Midwest. Earlier that year, I had gone with my family to see the Crimson Tide take on Penn State. By halftime, I pitied the plodding Nittany Lion players and the long-suffering home-field fans. It shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to any of them.  After all, SEC football was so dominant over the past decade that seven straight national championships were brought South by SEC teams. There was no reason to believe that Nick Saban\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t drag another championship trophy back to Dixie again this year. And then TCU kicked off to Ole Miss. After the Rebels got routed, it was Mississippi State\u2019s turn to underperform. And then Auburn\u2019s.  And then, most painfully, my Crimson Tide was beaten at the Sugar Bowl by the Big Ten\u2019s Ohio State. It was an outcome that I couldn\u2019t have imagined a week earlier. But by the time the Sugar Bowl kicked off, it was already obvious to most that instead of being the most fearsome conference in the land, the SEC West was instead the most overrated. Its teams were considered the best in the land\u2014until the moment they weren\u2019t.  And even though football is just a game, sometimes it can teach us a lesson or two. And what this year\u2019s bowl games taught us is that the only thing that is constant in this world is change.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  12/02/2014 01:32 PM EST  There are times when symbolic gestures pack a powerful punch. Fifty-nine years ago yesterday, Rosa Parks refused to give her bus seat to a white passenger. Parks' action became an important symbol for the Civil Rights movement and an inspiration to those fighting to end segregation in America. Thirteen years later, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists while lowering their heads during their medal ceremony at the Mexico City Summer Olympics in 1968. That symbolic act jarred America and shoved the topic of racial prejudice into the face of millions of TV viewers. Their protests were an act of defiance against a system that still treated black Americans different than white Americans.  Forty-six years later, Barack Obama is president of the United States, Eric Holder is attorney general, and the CEOs of corporations like American Express, McDonald\u2019s, and Xerox are African-Americans. Despite the remarkable progress made over the past generation, America's criminal justice system still treats black Americans worse than it treats white Americans. That is the reality in the streets, in courtrooms, and in prison. This tragic reality has been the excuse given by some for violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri and for other marches across America. And while this is a conversation worthy of heated debate, the spectacle that has unfolded on TV screens since August has poorly served those who want to remove the stench of discrimination from our criminal justice system.  The latest chapter in this made-for-cable-news cultural drama unfolded in a football stadium this weekend when five St. Louis Rams players held up their arms in an attempt to show solidarity with the growing "Hands up, don't shoot" movement that grew out of the Michael Brown case. The same gesture was made by members of the U.S. House this week. That is a shame. Actually, it is offensive because the gesture suggests that a police officer pointed a gun and shot a black man whose arms were in the air while he said "hands up, don't shoot."  (Also on POLITICO: DOJ probing N.Y. police case)  The fact is that there is no credible evidence that remotely supports the absurd claim that ever happened. But then again, protesters also falsely claimed that Officer Darren Wilson stood over Michael Brown while shooting bullets into his dying body. And, of course, Brown's friend who accompanied him during the convenience store robbery also claimed that Michael Brown was shot in the back.  That, too, was a lie. But I guess that is irrelevant in a social media and cable news culture that promotes partisanship and controversy to improve their bottom line. And apparently it matters even less to protesters whose goal it is to drive the false narrative that white cops are patrolling neighborhoods hoping to find a young, defenseless black man to shoot in the back. "Hands up, don't shoot" is a lie that divides and makes President Obama's stated goal of bringing together police officers and communities more difficult. But there is greater damage that is being done. By basing this movement on a lie, those claiming to promote the cause of social justice are actually offending those they should be converting, and they are obscuring the ugly fact that the criminal justice system still discriminates against black Americans 60 years after Rosa Parks changed the world by refusing to give in to injustice.  When the truth is on your side, why resort to a cheap lie?

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  10/08/2014 11:47 AM EDT  Napoleon said, "if you start to take Vienna, take Vienna." The Austrian capital seems to be the one place east of Paris where we haven\u2019t sent troops over the past decade.  But we are now ensnarled in a war in Syria and Iraq, facing off against the most radical form of Islamic extremism. And when America's at war, there is no substitute for victory.  How should winning be defined against ISIL? Like it was in World War II--the forces of evil, yes evil, must be crushed.  And yet today, ISIL is on the march. Today, the beheadings continue. Today, towns and cities continue to fall. And still today, this evil virus keeps spreading.  Like most Americans, I have supported the president's steady approach to this war. But now that we\u2019re there, it's time for the commander-in-chief to tear a page out of General Colin Powell's handbook. As the former secretary of state and Joint Chiefs chairman liked to say, "when America goes to war, we don't want a fair fight."  For the president, that means our military commanders should be allowed to throw everything they have at the enemy so our troops can kill and capture their leaders, destroy their war-making machine, and bring our sons and daughters home as fast as possible. Unfortunately, that's not happening in Iraq and Syria.  Handwringing against ISIL is not an option. Our weakness is radical Islam\u2019s strength. We are at war. And it's time we start acting like it. If we\u2019re going to take Vienna, then we better take Vienna.

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  09/29/2014 11:18 AM EDT  There was tragic news out of Moore, Oklahoma, on Friday afternoon when 54-year-old wife, mother and grandmother Colleen Hufford was attacked and beheaded by a former co-worker who had spent the past weeks trying to convert fellow employees to Islam.   Local news outlets reported he was shouting Muslim phrases during the attack so the feds were called in to investigate.   Their response, according to the Washington Post: There was also no indication that Alton Nolen was copying the beheadings of journalists in Syria by the Islamic State, the officials said, adding that they are treating this as an incident of "workplace violence."   Really? Despite the fact that the attacker's Facebook page had pictures of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, a gruesome beheading by ISIL, pictures celebrating the destruction of the Twin Towers, and the promise that America would go up in flames, and also his declaration that "Islamic terrorists behead their victims' because of a 'precedent bestowed by their Prophet."   No indication that Nolen was copying ISIL? No religious motivation? How stupid does the FBI think we are? Who exactly are they afraid of offending? ISIL?   And is political correctness now so pervasive throughout our government that the FBI can't tell Americans the truth about the beheading of a grandmother in middle America out of fear of offending Muslims?   If the FBI weakly resorts to political correctness after a beheading on U.S. soil, can they really confront the evil America now faces and the threat of copycat killers?   The answer is no.  Opinion: How stupid does the FBI think we are?

aV \u000a            By JOE SCARBOROUGH  09/25/2014 08:47 PM EDT  When I was growing up, my dad coached most teams my brother and I played on. And he was pretty great at what he did. Winning more championships than I could remember. I asked him when I coached high school football between college and law school what his secret was. He told me he never worried about filling positions. He said find talented kids who wanted to learn, inspire them, and the positions would fill themselves.  This week Eric Schmidt told us that was his strategy at Google as well. Find good people -- and the projects and positions would take care of themselves.  What applies to football and corporate culture applies to nation building as well. After trillions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of deaths, including thousands of American deaths, we find ourselves on the other side of epic failures in Iraq and Afghanistan. Why? Because instead of Jefferson and Madison, we found out that Americans' sons and daughters fought and died for Karzai and Maliki.  This is a tragic, teachable moment. Today, the United States finds itself in another Mideast war with no heroes on the ground. Just an ugly choice between Assad and ISIS. Any politician or diplomat who assures you there is a clean third way in Syria is lying. Does that mean we bury our heads in the sand and ignore terrorists who seek to destroy American cities? No.  But it does mean we move into this tragedy with eyes wide open and with the high level of caution this conflict requires -- and that the president is giving.

aV \u000a                The court simply said Kris Kobach's arguments did not meet the court's standards to act. | Orlin Wagner/AP  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  08/02/2017 04:02 PM EDT  A federal appeals court has turned down Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach's emergency request to escape a deposition set for Thursday about voter registration proposals he took into a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump last November.  The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals offered no detailed reason for rejecting Kobach's plea but simply said his arguments did not meet the court's standards to act.  "We conclude that Mr. Kobach has not made the necessary showing to obtain a stay pending appeal," the court said in an order Wednesday.  The order was issued by Judge Timothy Tymkovich, an appointee of President George W. Bush, and Judge Robert Bacharach, an appointee of President Barack Obama.

The Denver-based appeals court acted less than five hours after Kobach filed the emergency motion.  Kobach is facing a deposition in connection with a lawsuit pending in federal district court in Kansas City, challenging the state's law requiring proof of citizenship when individuals are seeking to register to vote. A federal judge already ordered Kobach to turn over a memo he took into the meeting with Trump in November at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.  Kobach currently serves as vice chairman of a federal advisory panel Trump set up to explore strategies to combat voter fraud.

aV \u000a                Robert Mueller's office confirmed Tuesday evening that former fraud and corruption prosecutor has agreed to join the special counsel staff.  | Saul Loeb/Getty Images  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  08/01/2017 11:09 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 08/02/2017 01:46 PM EDT  A federal judge who is the wife of a lawyer joining special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation recently recused herself from a pair of lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump's business dealings with foreign governments.  Mueller's office confirmed Tuesday evening that former fraud and corruption prosecutor Greg Andres has agreed to join the special counsel staff.   The development offers an explanation for the previously unanswered question of why U.S. District Court Judge Ronnie Abrams, who married Andres in 2001, suddenly recused herself last month from the emoluments lawsuits. One of the cases was filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington and the other was brought by White Plains, N.Y. attorney William Weinstein.  On July 11, Abrams \u2014 an Obama appointee \u2014 recused from the suits without any explanation or warning to the parties. A person familiar with the situation said Abrams had recused, but the public court docket showed only that the cases were both reassigned that day to Judge George Daniels, a Clinton appointee.  Recusals are not unusual, although they most often occur at the outset of a case. The CREW suit was filed in January. Weinstein's case was brought in February.

Andres, the 16th attorney known to have joined Mueller's squad, is a specialist in fraud and foreign corruption cases. He became a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York,  in 1999, eventually rising to be head of the criminal section in that office. From 2010 to 2012, he served as deputy assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington.   After leaving the federal government, Andres joined the Davis Polk law firm in New York, where he has often worked on cases involving executives from banks and hedge funds. His hiring for the Mueller team was first reported by Reuters.  A CREW spokeman declined to comment on the recusal.  Weinstein said he was unsure why Abrams stepped aside. \u201cI have no idea or knowledge at all," he said Wednesday.  Other suits about Trump's income from foreign sources are also pending in federal courts in Washington, D.C., Greenbelt, Maryland, and West Palm Beach, Florida.

aV \u000a                Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives during a conference on Aug. 1 in Atlanta.  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  08/01/2017 08:16 PM EDT  As Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday delivered his usual recitation of the ills of violence and drugs plaguing America, he added in a problem he rarely brings up unprompted: police misconduct.  Sessions often chastises others for badmouthing police and, indeed, his remarks to an African-American law enforcement group in Atlanta included just such a passage.  But what was more notable was his public acknowledgment that "bad" officers were contributing to a lack of community trust.  "We all know the cases of the last several years when, in confrontations with police, lives have been cut short," Sessions told the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives conference. "Just as I\u2019m committed to defending law enforcement who lawfully have to use deadly force to defend themselves while engaged in their work, I will also use the power of the office I\u2019m entrusted with to hold any officer responsible who violates the law."  "You know all it takes is for one bad officer to destroy the reputations of so many who work every day to build good relationships in these communities and who serve with honor and distinction," Sessions added.  The attorney general also said it is a serious problem that minority communities are distrustful of police. And he called the difficulty in recruiting a "catastrophe."  "Only 30 percent of African-Americans say they have confidence in the police," Sessions said. "In the last three years, that number dropped by 5 points. This is a trend that we must reverse. This is important. We have to have good relationships with our communities, and we have to be effective at preventing crime in every community."

You can unsubscribe at any time.  Sessions' latest remarks hardly demonstrate a conversion to a liberal stance on police abuse issues. Even the framing of police misconduct as limited to bad officers suggests he's skeptical of claims that some large police departments systemically violate the rights of individuals they encounter.   Sessions has also been critical of consent decrees that the Obama administration Justice Department entered into to resolve such allegations in places such as Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri. Shortly after Sessions was sworn in, the department made a move to potentially ditch or revise the Baltimore agreement, but a judge there finalized it anyway.  The attorney general also alluded Tuesday to stop-and-frisk policies, arguing that police were unwise to abandon the practice, even though it angers many civil rights activists and can increase tensions with minority communities.  "We cannot let the politicians, as they sometimes do, run down police and communities that are suffering only to see crime spike in those communities," Sessions said. "We don\u2019t need to be telling police not to do their job in those communities; that helps no one that protects, and tends to depress the morale of our police. We absolutely must not abandon proven, constitutional techniques and procedures."  Sessions' remarks came several days after President Donald Trump appeared to endorse rougher handling of suspects. Those comments drew an unusual repudiation from a top Justice Department official, acting Drug Enforcement Administration chief Chuck Rosenberg. Sessions did not address them directly in his speech Tuesday, but The Washington Post reported that an official from the group that hosted Sessions said the attorney general said Trump appeared to be joking. The White House has also said the comments were a joke.  Sessions told reporters earlier this year that he believes police misconduct cases should generally be handled by local authorities, although critics say it is often difficult for local prosecutors to pursue such cases vigorously while maintaining the usual working relationship between police and prosecuting attorneys.  During his remarks to the NOBLE meeting Tuesday, Sessions also expressed personal affection for the 41-year-old group of top-ranking, African-American law enforcement leaders.  "I have always understood the value of this organization," the attorney general said. "A number of my good friends have been members."

aV \u000a                United States District Court Judge Royce Lamberth denied the watchdog group Common Cause's motion for a temporary restraining order focused on data requests the panel's vice chair, Kris Kobach (left), has issued to all 50 states. | Saul Loeb/Getty Images  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  08/01/2017 06:39 PM EDT  Another federal judge has turned down a request to prevent President Donald Trump's voter fraud commission from going forward with plans to collect information on about 200 million American voters.  After an hourlong hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth denied the watchdog group Common Cause's motion for a temporary restraining order focused on data requests the panel's vice chair, Kris Kobach, has issued to all 50 states.  The requests \u2014 seeking publicly available voter information, including dates of birth, partial Social Security numbers and criminal conviction details \u2014 led some state election officials to say they didn't plan to comply or would limit the information they would share. Civil rights groups also complained that the entire effort was aimed at disenfranchising minority voters.  Lamberth didn't explain in detail why he was denying the restraining order, but he said the request fell short "on the record before me." He also seemed irked the lawyers seeking the order had not provided the court with a full transcript of the panel's July 19 meeting at which Kobach talked about seeking the data from the states and cross-checking it with federal agencies.  A lawyer representing Common Cause, Josephine Morse of Democracy Forward, argued that Kobach's statements at the meeting and in media interviews made clear he intends to involve federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security in trying to find voters who aren't eligible to vote.  However, Lamberth said he wouldn't rely on attorneys' assertions about what Kobach had said there or in media interviews.  "I don't use internet evidence like videos as court evidence," said Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan. "I don't take judicial notice of TV interviews. ... I don't take judicial notice of news articles and all that junk."  The main issue in dispute is whether the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has essentially converted itself into a federal agency because of its plan to gather and manipulate a large volume of personal data on individuals. Common Cause and other groups have argued that kind of investigation makes the body an agency.  Intelligence and analysis on lobbying \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

"This is the kind of activity, we would submit, that an agency conducts."  It is "textbook-classic agency behavior affecting individual rights."  Another lawyer for Common Cause, Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, emphasized that the group is not seeking a halt to all the panel's work.  "We're not trying to shut the commission down from everything that it's doing. ... It's really our desire to stop the collection of First Amendment data," Perryman said. She said details like party affiliation show who a voter associates with and isn't the kind of information the federal government should be collecting.  "This is not something that dollars and cents can compensate for down the line," she added.  Lamberth signaled that he understood that concern, but he noted that Kobach's request has been for data that are already public under state public records or election laws.  "I think that makes a difference," he said.  \u000aCongress  \u000a            By ELIANA JOHNSON  Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Shapiro said the public nature of the information undercut the notion that the request was imposing  irreparable harm on those covered by it.  "Normally, you get much more information under a state  [Freedom of Information law] than under federal FOIA," observed the attorney, who oversees the federal government's defense in FOIA cases.  Shapiro also raised technical issues, claiming that Common Cause could not sue under the Privacy Act because it is an organization, not a person.  "The commission should be able to proceed with doing its work," she said.  In the past few weeks, another judge in Washington, D.C., Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, turned down requests for preliminary injunctions against the voter fraud panel in three separate lawsuits brought by the other groups.  Two of those cases are already on appeal to the D.C. Circuit. Lamberth said he expects the Common Cause case will soon be as well.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By JOSH DAWSEY, ANNIE KARNI and TARA PALMERI  "We've just got to tee it all up for the court of appeals," he said.  It's unclear why the suit was assigned to Lamberth, since the other cases were deemed related and assigned to Kollar-Kotelly. The judge said the assignment was a mystery to him.  While the case found little traction with Lamberth on Tuesday, he's not hostile to Privacy Act claims, and he has sometimes issued rulings giving a broad scope to the privacy protection law. In 1997, he ruled that the White House was an agency subject to the Privacy Act. However, more than a decade later, he reversed that decision. The judge said intervening precedents had rendered his earlier ruling incorrect.  In addition to the suits brought in Washington against the commission, another case challenging the panel's legal legitimacy is pending in New York.

aV \u000a                News reports during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign said Gilbert Chagoury, a billionaire who lives in Lebanon, was denied a visa in 2015 because of allegations suggesting the Nigerian-born businessman was fundraising for a U.S.-identified terrorist organization.  | Andrew Burton/Getty Images  \u000a            By DIAMOND NAGA SIU and JOSH GERSTEIN  07/31/2017 03:20 PM EDT  Major Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury and the U.S. government have struck a deal to settle a lawsuit over leaks that suggested the Nigerian-born businessman was fundraising for a U.S.-identified terrorist organization.   News reports during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign said Chagoury, a billionaire who lives in Lebanon, was denied a visa in 2015 because of those allegations.  Last September, Chagoury filed a lawsuit against the FBI and other agencies for damaging his reputation and denying his constitutional rights. Chagoury had visited the U.S. throughout the past 35 years, he said.  Under the settlement, Chagoury is essentially dropping the lawsuit, but he managed to extract a confirmation from the government that he's never been on a U.S. sanctions list and that financial institutions are free to do business with him.  \u201cAs I have often said, I have loved America my whole life because it was the land of freedom and justice,\u201d Chagoury said in a news release. \u201cI am pleased that the U.S. Government has officially recognized that I am not and have never been on the SDN list, and that this matter that began due to someone spreading false and injurious information about me is finally closed.\u201d  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

In the settlement, the U.S. government also recognized that the anonymous leaks possibly violated both internal policies and federal law.  "Unauthorized government disclosures, including of personally identifying information, may violate internal agency policies, as well as federal law under certain circumstances. Such disclosures may be subject to different types of punishment or disciplinary actions depending on the nature of the violation," the settlement declares.  In the deal, the Justice Department did not concede that any U.S. official broke the law.  Still, Chagoury said he hopes the agreement will ameliorate some of the damages that the allegations caused his reputation and business ventures.  The settlement was filed with the court Friday and approved Sunday by U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan. Each side will bear its own legal fees, the pact says.  The suit initially looked to have the potential to set precedent because it sought recourse under the Judicial Redress Act, a 2016 law protecting the privacy rights of foreigners. However, Chagoury later dropped that element of the case.

aV \u000a                FBI Headquarters building as seen on August 23, 2016.  | John Shinkle/POLITICO  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  07/29/2017 01:17 PM EDT  Getting answers to Freedom of Information Act requests is often a protracted and tiring process, but how long a wait is too long?   One federal judge just came up with an answer: 17 years.  U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler bluntly rejected the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s proposal that documentary filmmaker Nina Seavey wait until the year 2034 to get all the law enforcement agency\u2019s records for a request pertaining surveillance of anti-war and civil rights activists in the 1960s and 1970s.  The request involved an unusually large amount of material \u2014 about 110,000 pages of records at the FBI and more at other agencies \u2014 but Seavey said waiting almost two decades for the complete files wasn\u2019t viable for her.  \u201cLiterally, they were talking 17 years out. I\u2019m 60 years old. You can\u2019t do that math,\u201d the George Washington University professor and documentarian told POLITICO this week. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to work for me.\u201d  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  The FBI said it has a policy of processing and releasing large requests at a pace of 500 pages a month, while Seavey, represented by D.C. transparency lawyer Jeffrey Light, had proposed 5,000 pages a month. (At one point, the FBI thought it had about 150,000 pages of responsive records, which would\u2019ve meant a 25-year wait.)  Justice Department lawyers and the FBI argued that going faster than 500 pages a month would disrupt the agency\u2019s workflow and create the possibility of a few massive requests effectively shutting down the rest of the their FOIA operation.  Kessler didn\u2019t buy it.  \u201cNeither proffered justification is persuasive,\u201d the Clinton appointee wrote. \u201cIn the name of reducing its own administrative headaches, the FBI's 500-page policy ensures that larger requests are subject to an interminable delay in being completed. Under the 500-page policy, requestors must wait 1 year for every 6,000 potentially responsive documents, and those who request tens of thousands of documents may wait decades.\u201d  Kessler\u2019s 12-page opinion issued last week noted that there is a legal provision to hold a FOIA request at bay when an agency faces \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d but the FBI did not invoke it.  \u201cThe agency's desire for administrative convenience is simply not a valid justification for telling Professor Seavey that she must wait decades for the documents she needs to complete her work,\u201d the judge wrote.  Kessler also said the figures the FBI gave the court didn\u2019t really prove that speeding up large requests would slow down smaller ones.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By JOSH DAWSEY and ELIANA JOHNSON  \u201cIf the FBI really wanted to demonstrate that processing larger FOIA requests would impact the processing of other requests there are numerous data points it could provide the Court\u2026Instead, the limited data the FBI has provided suggests exactly the opposite,\u201d she wrote, calling the workload information provided to the court \u201cunilluminating.\u201d  The judge also said the FBI\u2019s policy of treating multi-part requests as a single request when doling out the 500 pages a month creates a perverse incentive to break up a request in order to game the system.  Ultimately, Kessler ordered the FBI to process 2,850 pages a month, which should get Seavey the records she\u2019s seeking within three years.   Seavey said she was heartened by the ruling, which she believes will help other requesters in a similar predicament.  \u201cThe import of this case is much bigger than we anticipated,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said the government\u2019s case was without merit and untenable\u2026She allowed this case to be used as precedent.\u201d  Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment on the decision.  \u000aWhite House  \u000a            By ANNIE KARNI and CRISTIANO LIMA  It\u2019s not the first FOIA case to produce staggering estimates of how long the government would need to make records public. Last year, the State Department rebuffed a request for emails of aides to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying it could take 75 years to work through the material.  Seavey\u2019s film project focuses on what she called the \u201cripple effects\u201d of the May 4, 1970, shooting deaths of four students by national guardsmen at Kent State University in Ohio.  Seavey said she is going through records now every day from similar requests filed with the CIA and the National Archives.  \u201cWhat I\u2019m finding in this material is really astonishing,\u201d she said, adding with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s worth the wait, but I probably started this ten years ago.\u201d

aV \u000a                The voter fraud panel is headed by Vice President Mike Pence (right) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a leading figure in the crusade against illegal voting that many experts say is extraordinarily rare. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  07/24/2017 01:58 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 07/24/2017 03:33 PM EDT  A federal judge has turned down a watchdog group's demand that President Donald Trump's controversial voter fraud commission be forced to conduct a privacy assessment before gathering data on millions of American voters.  In a 35-page opinion Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction the Electronic Privacy Information Center sought against the panel formally known as the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.  Kollar-Kotelly said the commission and a White House information technology office did not appear to qualify as federal agencies and therefore did not trigger the requirement for a privacy impact assessment.    The voter fraud panel is headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a leading figure in the crusade against illegal voting that many experts say is extraordinarily rare.  A key issue in the suit filed by EPIC and at least three other suits brought by other organizations and individuals is Kobach's June 28 request for states' publicly-available voter roll information, including felony conviction information and partial social security numbers.   The panel initially asked states to upload that data to a site hosted by the Defense Department, potentially implicating federal laws covering executive branch agencies. However, the panel is now having the information collected by the White House itself, effectively avoiding the impact of those federal statutes.  "Given the factual circumstances presently before the Court\u2014which have changed substantially since this case was filed three weeks ago\u2014Defendants\u2019 collection of voter roll information does not currently involve agency action," wrote Kollar-Kotelly, an appointee of President Bill Clinton.  "Under the binding precedent of this circuit, entities in close proximity to the President, which do not wield 'substantial independent authority,' are not 'agencies' for purposes of the [Administrative Procedure Act.] On this basis, neither the Commission or the Director of White House Information Technology\u2014who is currently charged with collecting voter roll information on behalf of the Commission\u2014are 'agencies\u201d for purposes of the APA, meaning the Court cannot presently exert judicial review over the collection process," the judge added.

You can unsubscribe at any time.  Kollar-Kotelly also noted that \u201cThe disclosure of a Privacy Impact Assessment may very well be in the equitable and public interest, but creating a right to such disclosure out of whole cloth, and thereby imposing an informational burden on the Commission where none has been mandated by Congress or any other source of law, is not.\u201d  Kobach welcomed the judge\u2019s decision.   \u201cThis ruling is a major victory for government accountability, transparency and the public\u2019s right to know about the integrity of our elections processes,\u201d the panel\u2019s vice chairman said in a statement.    \u201cThe President formed this commission to identify ways to enhance the American people\u2019s confidence in the integrity of our elections. The Commission requested this publicly available data as part of its fact-gathering process, which is information that states regularly release to political candidates, political parties, and the general public. We look forward to continuing to work with state election leaders to gather information and identify opportunities to improve election integrity,\u201d Kobach added.   EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said the group will press on with the litigation.   \u201cEPIC will push forward. The Commission cannot evade privacy obligations by playing a shell game with the nation\u2019s voting records,\u201d he said.   The privacy advocacy group also pointed to a passage in the opinion where Kollar-Kotelly indicated she expects the panel to abide by various statements that officials made in connection with the suit, such as pledges to only seek publicly available data and to anonymize the information collected before releasing it.  Last week, Kollar-Kotelly denied injunctions against the voter fraud commission sought in a pair of other suits focused primarily on access to the panel's meetings and records. The ruling Monday, by contrast, primarily addressed the privacy issues raised by the commission's data collection.  Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups have denounced the commission as an effort to discourage minority voting and to try to vindicate an unsubstantiated claim by Trump that millions of voters were cast illegally in favor of his opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

aV \u000a                President Trump\u2019s lawyers are also trying to a block a demand that he sit for a deposition in the case. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  07/23/2017 08:33 AM EDT  President Donald Trump is facing a new legal demand for his tax returns in a lawsuit from protesters who say they were roughed up at Trump\u2019s instigation at a campaign rally last year.  Lawyers for the demonstrators recently made a formal request for the tax returns as part of the discovery process in a suit over altercations at a  Trump campaign event in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2016.  \u201cWe want to know where his money is going and where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d said Greg Belzley, an attorney for the protesters. \u201cWhat are his connections with the hate groups that regularly attended his rallies? What security did he have? Did they make any arrangements? Does he have the money to pay a jury verdict in this case?\u201d  While Trump seems likely to be able to cover any direct damages the protesters are claiming, they are also seeking punitive damages, Belzley noted. The suit contends that Trump egged on the crowd to injure the demonstrators by declaring, \u201cGet \u2018em out of here.\u201d The attorney said punitive damages tied to Trump\u2019s income and worth may be appropriate to make sure Trump doesn\u2019t do anything similar in the future.  \u201cWhat is it going to take to get [Trump\u2019s] attention?\u201d Belzley asked. \u201cThe jury should be given the opportunity to decide what they need to do to deter the wrongful conduct and prevent it from happening again.\u201d  Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

An attorney for Trump did not respond to a request for comment Friday, but in a court filing last week,  Trump\u2019s legal team complained that the suit is being used to dredge up "embarrassing" information on the president.  \u201cFrom the moment Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, it has been clear that their primary objective has been to use the court system and the discovery process to inflict maximum political damage on President Trump,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. They dismissed as \u201cclearly irrelevant\u201d the request for the tax returns and another request for the identities \u201cof all medical providers from whom Trump has sought or received any psychological and/or psychiatric and/or mental health treatment or counseling.\u201d  Trump\u2019s lawyers are also trying to a block a demand that he sit for a deposition in the case. That request is pending before U.S. District Court Judge David Hale, an appointee of President Barack Obama.  The Kentucky case is one of at least five pending lawsuits in which plaintiffs have publicly indicated a desire to obtain Trump\u2019s tax filings.  They include several suits contending that Trump\u2019s foreign business ties violate the Constitution\u2019s foreign emoluments clause. Lawyers for the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, for the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia and for Democratic lawmakers have all stated plans to request the tax returns as litigation on those issues moves forward.  \u000a  \u000a            By STEVEN SHEPARD and JON MCCLURE  Even if a judge orders Trump's tax returns turned over in one or more of those cases, there is no guarantee they'd be made public. Such information is usually subject to a court order that limits its distribution to the lawyers and parties to the suit, as well as others directly involved in the litigation.  At least one group \u2014 the Electronic Privacy Information Center \u2014 is trying to obtain the tax returns directly from the Internal Revenue Service through a Freedom of Information Act suit.  The Kentucky suit appears to be the first to progress to the point where lawyers have made a formal discovery request for the Trump tax returns.  Every president since Jimmy Carter has released at least some personal tax returns. Trump has declined to do so, saying that his recent returns are under audit \u2014 although that is no legal barrier to releasing them under those circumstances,.  At the moment, there is no law requiring presidents to make their tax returns public, although Democrats in Congress and in state legislatures have filed legislation that would force such a disclosure for presidents or presidential candidates.

aV \u000a                Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with reporters for about a half-hour Wednesday to discuss the  Justice Department's decision to reverse an Obama-era policy. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  07/19/2017 11:35 AM EDT  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein turned down opportunities Wednesday to discuss the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia, including a question about whether he has a conflict of interest overseeing the probe because of his role in the firing of FBI Director James Comey.  Rosenstein met with reporters for about a half-hour Wednesday to discuss the  Justice Department's decision to reverse an Obama-era policy and resume allowing local law enforcement to use federal agencies to seize assets suspected to be involved in crime.  At the outset of the session, the No. 2 Justice Department official said he wouldn't take any off-topic questions. And when asked on two occasions to talk about the Trump-Russia probe, Rosenstein declined.  "We\u2019re going to have to move on to the next question. I\u2019m not going to be talking about that. It\u2019s not asset forfeiture," he said after a Washington Post reporter asked how Rosenstein could help supervise a probe where he may be a witness.  And when asked by a Bloomberg reporter to comment generally on the investigation, Rosenstein again declined.  "If I answered the Post\u2019s question, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten to talk about asset forfeiture at all. So, I'm not going to answer that," the deputy attorney general said.  After Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from election-related investigations, Rosenstein made the decision in May to name former FBI Director Robert Mueller to conduct a criminal investigation into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials or agents during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Sessions' recusal and Rosenstein's decision to appoint a special prosecutor angered President Donald Trump, according to the president's aides and allies. Rosenstein was also said to have protested the White House's description of his role in Comey's firing, although he publicly denied threatening to resign over the issue.

Despite those reported tensions, Rosenstein projected an upbeat demeanor Wednesday, insisting that he's enjoying the role he assumed after nearly 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Maryland.  "I like my job. I'm very happy to have this job," the DOJ No. 2 said. "I'm proud to be working in the Department of Justice\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a great honor and privilege for me."   Some experts have argued it is inevitable that Rosenstein will have to cede his role overseeing Mueller's investigation.  Rosenstein said in an interview last month that he was open to recusing himself if it became necessary.  \u201cI\u2019ve talked with Director Mueller about this,\u201d Rosenstein told the Associated Press. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make the appropriate decisions, and if anything that I did winds up being relevant to his investigation then, as Director Mueller and I discussed, if there\u2019s a need from me to recuse I will.\u201d

aV \u000a                Lawyers battled during a courtroom argument session that stretched to nearly two full hours. | J. David Ake/AP  \u000a            By JOSH GERSTEIN  07/18/2017 11:39 PM EDT  \u000a                    Updated 07/19/2017 10:08 AM EDT  A federal judge is mulling whether the Justice Department is defying the law by ignoring an obligation to proactively release legal opinions to the public.  U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson gave an extensive airing to the issue Tuesday as lawyers battled during a courtroom argument session that stretched to nearly two full hours.  Jackson seemed skeptical about aspects of the lawsuit filed last year by the liberal group Campaign for Accountability. However, she issued no formal ruling and her comments left open the possibility that the organization might get a chance to repackage its case in order to press forward with its demand for access to opinions issued by Justice's Office of Legal Counsel.  An attorney for the group, Alex Abdo of the Knight First Amendment Institute, argued that the Justice Department is failing to comply with a rarely litigated provision in the Freedom of Information Act that obliges agencies to make public "statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency."  While a better-known portion of FOIA requires agencies to disclose records upon request, official statements of policy are supposed to be affirmatively released by the agencies even in the absence of any request.  In the 50 years FOIA has been on the books, that has never happened with regard to any Office of Legal Counsel opinion. Instead, since the mid-1970s, OLC has published about 1300 opinions following what it calls a "voluntary" process of deciding which issuances to make public and which to keep under wraps.   Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.  By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.  "It is instead publishing a subset of...opinions under criteria that have nothing to do with the statutory criteria," Abdo complained.   OLC also sometimes releases opinions in response to FOIA requests, but it insists those releases are "discretionary" and not required by the statute.  Justice Department attorney Daniel Schwei said OLC hasn't ruled out the possibility that its opinions might qualify for proactive disclosure under FOIA, although he was unable to cite any instance where it had actually occurred. He said this wasn't surprising since OLC's opinions did not reflect policy decisions, but offer views on the interpretation of various federal laws, regulations and executive orders.  "That legal advice is still just one of the predecisional impacts," he said.  However, Abdo said the government's contention that it doesn't have a policy against affirmative disclosure was a kind of contrivance\u2014in his words "a fiction" \u2014 aimed at trying to head off legal challenges like the suit filed last year after the government rebuffed Campaign for Accountability's request for access to any such records.  Aside from that issue, Jackson seemed troubled by some procedural aspects of the case. Her biggest hang-up appeared to be a lack of specificity in the CFA suit which seeks all legal opinions issued by OLC, without regard to time or subject matter.  "Don't you have a little bit of a ripeness issue?" Jackson said to Abdo. "It's up to you to tell me which ones" you're asking for, she suggested.  Schwei agreed with the judge that the vagueness might present an obstacle to the case moving forward since it wasn't clear what concrete harm CFA was alleging. "They haven't identified any actual opinions that have been unlawfully withheld," he noted.  "How can they know that?" Jackson asked, observing that it was a bit bizarre to ask the plaintiffs to provide a list of documents the government is keeping secret.   \u000a  \u000a            By JAKE LAHUT  The judge suggested that categories of records might be good enough. Indeed, Abdo offered some Tuesday. He said some OLC opinions sought by independent agencies are issued only after the agency pledges in advance to abide by the Justice Department's ultimate view on the point. Others are explicitly issued as resolutions of interagency disputes and are binding on the agencies under an executive order.  Abdo also insisted that CFA's request was no broader than others adjudicated by the courts, including the Supreme Court, in similar disputes over the line between deliberative legal advice that is entitled to protection and official agency positions which could amount to a body of "secret law" if the public cannot access them. He noted that the courts have previously ruled that some legal opinions issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the National Labor Relations Board and the Energy Department must be disclosed.  Towards the end of the protracted hearing, Schwei rolled out the big rhetorical guns. He warned that requiring the disclosure of the legal  opinions "would really threaten OLC's role in the executive branch, as well as raise Article II constitutional concerns."   He did not elaborate, but in legal briefs the Justice Department argues that allowing the suit to proceed could "threaten the rule of law" by imperiling executive officials' ability to receive confidential legal advice, including the president's ability to get advice covered by executive privilege.  Jackson signaled no timeline for ruling in the case, which was filed last June. The issue before her at the moment is the government motion to dismiss the suit. One possibility is that she could do that, while leaving open the possibility for CFA to narrow its case to certain categories of documents like the ones Abdo identified Tuesday.  However, one thorny issue is the group's insistence that it is entitled to an index of all opinions that serve as binding policy. Abdo argued Tuesday that the plain text of the law requires OLC to make that information public. Publishing a complete index of simply the title and date of opinions would be a major departure from the agency's current practice. At the moment, FOIA requests for lists of opinions issued in specific years are often met by page-after-page of blacked out titles, with only an occasional heading left for public consumption.

aV Pick a spot on the map in the United States and you\u2019re likely to come away fairly disappointed at that city\u2019s ability to do anything sustainable with its trash. Take arguably the country\u2019s most progressive city, San Francisco, which has set itself the goal of becoming the first \u201czero waste\u201d city in America by 2020: Even as its recycling and composting efforts have gained traction, leading residents to carefully separate their coffee grounds from their aluminum soda cans, it hauls much of its trash to landfills in nearby counties\u2014and would have sent the remaining refuse all the way to Nevada had its original plan not been shot down.    The sheer volume of trash that Americans throw out\u2014we represent 5 percent of the world\u2019s population yet produce 30 percent of its waste\u2014overwhelms the valiant efforts of most municipalities. Nationwide, recycling rates have stalled over the past decade after rising steadily throughout the \u201990s. Curbside recycling is too expensive for some communities.   Story Continued Below   That challenge and unhappy outcome, repeated daily in cities across the country, is what makes it so amazing to breathe deeply as you walk the streets outside of the Minnesota Twins' relatively new stadium, Target Field, in downtown Minneapolis.    Incredibly, it smells just fine.    You would never know that you\u2019re standing next to what is arguably the nation\u2019s most successful trash incinerator, a massive 12-acre project that has emerged as an unlikely, low-profile resident of one of the city\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods. Just blocks away is Bachelor Farmer, a nouveau Scandinavian restaurant that has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s hottest restaurants and hosted Barack Obama for dinner when the president passed through town in 2012. Loft condos nearby sell for a half-million and above. There\u2019s a Caribou Coffee right next door, which itself is across from the renovated historic building that houses the city\u2019s top architectural and advertising firms. And assuming things break right, all of these offices will one day be powered by that incinerator, which gobbles up 1,000 tons of trash a day\u2014some of it from the surrounding North Loop neighborhood.    The Hennepin Energy Recovery Center, better known as the HERC, has emerged as the centerpiece of Minneapolis\u2019s own push to be carbon-neutral by 2030, as Minnesota\u2019s largest city looks to vault itself into the world\u2019s top tier of sustainable cities. In doing so, it hopes to join places like Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm that have a long reputation of balancing the environment and human impact. It\u2019s an ambitious goal for the Midwestern city of 400,000, but one that Minneapolis hopes to achieve by transforming its residents\u2019 relationship to their own trash, and one that it\u2014and 17 other global cities, including Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm and San Francisco\u2014all joined together to announce in 2014 during a meeting in Copenhagen when they created the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance pact.    Carbon neutral; zero waste; sustainable. These are the buzzwords of an environmentally-conscious, not to mention terrified, time. The push to limit, reuse or even recapture some energy from the things we no longer think we need has led some cities to push themselves toward hopeful, some might say unlikely, goals.    In Minneapolis\u2019 case, though, it all began long before Al Gore\u2019s alarmist documentaries ushered in the modern focus on carbon and climate change. It began nearly a generation ago, in 1985, with Randy Johnson\u2019s headline-grabbing trip to Europe.    ***   \u000a                            The New Neighbor in North Loop: Workers and neighbors mingle in Minneapolis' trendiest neighborhood. (Click to view photos.) | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine   HERC was born of an earlier environmental movement. Prior to today\u2019s obsession with sustainability, many American cities were much more concerned about a more basic environmental problem\u2014the festering sores of a century of the Industrial Age.    It was 1985 and Randy Johnson, then (as now) a commissioner for Hennepin, the county that surrounds Minneapolis, was leading the charge for the city\u2019s newest, most controversial\u2014and least tourist-friendly\u2014landmark.    First elected not long after Love Canal horrified the nation, Johnson and the county he served were eager to find some better way of dealing with the vast amounts of trash the city produced and shipped to faraway landfills. A former attorney with the Federal Election Commission, Johnson\u2019s buttoned-up job papered over a bohemian streak: early in their marriage, he and his wife sold nearly all their belongings and set off on a trip hitchhiking through Europe, North Africa and Turkey. Johnson knew that at the time Minnesota had over 100 moldering, decomposing pits full of waste. And though the state may have never had its Cuyahoga-on-fire moment of environmental reckoning, the landfills leaked often enough to offend politicians like him, who considered the issue of water quality a sacred matter in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, and especially so in Minneapolis, divided as it is by the Mississippi River.   \u000a                            Hennipen County Commisioner Randy Johnson in his office; Johnson calls himself \u201cthe trash guy.\u201d | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine   Looking back on it now, Johnson says there are a number of reasons why he became, in his words, \u201cthe trash guy.\u201d As a Republican he was in the political minority, without a caucus and mostly left to find his own pet issues. When he was first elected in 1979, the state Legislature had just mandated that counties find a way to limit landfilling. Most had ignored the order, but Johnson found something he could burrow into and began poring over federal and state regulations, coming to the conclusion that waste-to-energy was the best alternative. There also was one ulterior motive, too.    As a kid, Johnson and his dad were often admonished by his mom when they came home from trips to the dump. \u201cShe used to tell us not to bring home more than we brought,\u201d he says. The landfill issue, then, was Johnson\u2019s way of itching a scratch for scavenging he\u2019d had since childhood. It gave him an excuse to learn about Minneapolis\u2019 trash ecosystem, and therefore an excuse to wake up early and shadow the city's garbage haulers. Trips that inevitably began with his wife giving him the same warning his mother had years before: \u201cDon\u2019t bring anything back,\u201d he says she told him.    Johnson, for better and worse, became the face of HERC. For weeks in the mid-\u201980s, he and a few other county commissioners led the local nightly news as they traveled from Germany to Sweden to Austria to see what it looked like when trash was turned into electricity. In keeping with Hennepin, and Minnesota at-large\u2019s, history of good governance, the trips were funded entirely by the companies bidding for the project. \u201cSome of these vendors said we couldn\u2019t see their plants because they were overseas,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018That\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll go.\u2019 My German back then was still pretty good. And I was able to muddle my way through Sweden.\u201d    Even with a tremendous amount of due diligence, he and his fellow supporters were vilified. \u201c[Protesters] put on Hazmat suits and paraded through our office,\u201d he recalls. The first day cranes appeared on the job site, some of the more limber members of the opposition clambered up to the top and unveiled banners. The project may have been completed on time, under budget, and\u2014because this was progressive Minnesota\u2014using only union labor, that didn\u2019t stop someone, Johnson says, from spiking the first batch of burned trash.   \u000a                            The North Loop, the Minneapolis neighborhood that HERC calls home, has been revitalized in recent years, seeing an influx of new business and nightlife. | Mark Peterson/Redux   On its first air quality test, the incinerator failed and registered distressingly high numbers. As Johnson recalls, \u201cThe speculation was that someone snuck in a large amount of batteries.\u201d Though that rumor was never confirmed, what is true is that in the 25 years since HERC started burning greater Minneapolis\u2019 trash, the facility has never come close to going over the strict pollution control limits it exceeded on that very first test.    Johnson was told a lot of things about what HERC would do to Minneapolis. The facility was separated from downtown by only the width of a freeway, but it may as well have been in Wisconsin. The only sign of life nearby was the Ford Center, a 10-story monument to the logistical genius of the car company\u2019s founder that had once pumped out Model T\u2019s, but in the intervening decades had, like everything else in the neighborhood, gone to seed. \u201cThere was nothing there,\u201d Johnson recalls.

aV Abdi Warsame might be the only city council member in the nation who lies awake at night thinking about how to fight ISIL. Fighting terrorism half a world away wasn\u2019t what brought the 37-year-old to politics\u2014he\u2019d originally hoped to fix employment and education disparities, create affordable housing and transportation and give his community a voice in local politics. Yet just months after he took office in 2014, the first Somali-American elected to the Minneapolis City Council, members of his south-central ward began to disappear, lured to the Mideast to join the brutal and ambitious terrorist group. By summer, the first Minnesota man had been killed fighting for ISIL; two more would die by the end of the year in Syria.    The local radicalization problem led former U.S. Senator Norm Coleman to dub Minnesota in April, \u201cthe land of 10,000 terrorists,\u201d a phrase that set off a firestorm of criticism locally. \u201cThe Global War on Terror is not taking place in some amorphous \u2018over there\u2019 any longer,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is taking place in our own back yard, in the heartland of America, and it\u2019s a grave danger to our state.\u201d   Story Continued Below   Terrorist recruitment was unfortunately not a new problem for the Twin Cities\u2019 Somali community, which had struggled since 2008 as Somali-American teens\u2014many of whom had never visited East Africa\u2014left to join the Al Qaeda affiliate known as al-Shabaab, fighting in their ancestral homeland. ISIL, though, represented a new, more insidious threat\u2014there were no nationalist or ethnic ties, no obvious appeal to the young men and women leaving Minnesota for a vicious war in the Mideast. Yet authorities believe more than 20 Minnesotans have left for Syria and Iraq in the past two years, and the fight against ISIL has put Warsame\u2019s community at the forefront of a national effort to combat radicalization efforts. Warsame and the Minneapolis Public Schools system were front and center at a White House summit on countering violent extremism earlier this year, where they presented an innovative school-parent intervention program meant to head off the appeal of online terrorist recruiters.    Now, midway through his first term as a city council member, Warsame finds himself balancing foreign policy with local problems, like fixing potholes on Cedar and Riverside avenues or improving taxicab ordinances in the wake of a new legalizing the app-based companies, like Lyft and UberX. In many ways, Warsame understands the alienation and isolation that can breed radicalization. As he has said, \u201cI have children growing up in the city who are no different [from] those young individuals that left.\u201d But more than that, he himself has lived this bifurcated identity. He with his family, after all, has over the past two decades made the opposite journey\u2014fleeing political persecution in Somalia as a child and growing up on social welfare in London before landing in the Twin Cities.    The Twin Cities were for Warsame and tens of thousands of Somalis like his family meant to be a fresh start\u2014and, in many ways, they have been\u2014but unfortunately, the refuge community has also found that they haven\u2019t been able to leave the wars and unrest behind.    ***    Warsame\u2019s birthplace of Mogadishu and the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood in Minneapolis he represents today feel much closer than the 8,000 miles that technically separate them. The neighborhood forms the core of the largest Somali population in the United States, an estimated 100,000 Somalis and East Africans who began streaming into the country in the 1990s. On a recent warm sunny afternoon during Minnesota\u2019s all-too-brief summer, Warsame sat at a coffee shop in the U.S. Bank Plaza that towers over his downtown Minneapolis City Hall office as he painted a picture of his past and present. \u201cMy dream was to be successful,\u201d he says, \u201cto fulfill my mother\u2019s dream\u2014that we could be whatever we wanted to be, that we could excel in life, take responsibility for our lives.\u201d   \u000a                            Hodan Hassan, an associate vice president at Save the Children, left, and Warsame participate in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Pilot Program presentation during the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism in February in Washington. | AP   Warsame came to Cedar-Riverside through a winding path that started in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, where he was raised in a middle-class lifestyle until he was 8. He says his success is owed to two important people in his life\u2014his mother Kaha Ali, an ex-midwife, and his stepfather Mohamed Mohamud Guled, who became a distinguished politician after the collapse of the Somali government and held important ministerial posts in various administrations in Somalia, which took its independence from Italy and Britain in 1960.    But the Mogadishu that Warsame knew in the 1980s is far different than what it is today: A city submersed in anarchy and chaos with episodic suicide bombings and gun rampages by al-Shabaab fighters. During Warsame\u2019s years, Mogadishu was a glamorous city with growing economic prosperity, military power and improved infrastructure. But in the late 1980s, the East-African country began to crumble as a consequence of the 1977-78 territorial war between Somalia and Ethiopia. Somalia lost the war; its once-strong economic muscle debilitated. This created a national mood of despair, leading to the birth of organized and armed opposition against the totalitarian regime of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, who had ruled the country for more than two decades in a grip of steel.   A civil society campaigner, Guled went toe-to-toe against the military government, demanding justice and democracy. Guled, as a consequence, was imprisoned. At 8, Warsame and his family moved to London in 1987, fearing they would to fall victims to Barre\u2019s worsening political repression that employed imprisonment, torture and punishment against those engaged in organized resistance and their families.   \u201cMy mother was smart enough to get us out of Mogadishu,\u201d Warsame says, his British accent a memento of his London upbringing. \u201cShe understood that the fighting was to happen and would separate our families.\u201d    In London, life unfolded with a dreadful beginning for the Warsame family. \u201cIt was a difficult situation because we went from having a comfortable life \u2026 to being poor, being asylum seekers, having a single parent in a country that I was not familiar with,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy mother didn\u2019t speak English. She had to raise six kids by herself. We had no relatives. We were probably some of the earliest Somalis. It was difficult. We basically grew up on social welfare.\u201d    Warsame was also the father-figure for the family: By the time he was 10 in London, he helped raise his siblings. He took his brothers to parent-teacher conferences and served as an interpreter for his mother when she had doctor\u2019s appointments, among other responsibilities.    Warsame, who earned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in London, met a Somali-American woman from Minnesota in London through family. The two later, they got married, and Warsame joined her in Minneapolis.    ***     Ibrahim Hirsi is a journalist in Minneapolis. Follow him on Twitter @IHirsi.

aV The leaders of America\u2019s cities have serious concerns about race relations, minority communities and policing issues as the nation approaches the one-year anniversary of last year\u2019s unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a POLITICO Magazine survey finds. And urban public schools\u2014widely identified by experts as the key to improvement of neighborhood conditions, racial equity and social mobility\u2014won\u2019t offer a solution anytime soon, according to large majorities of mayors who also expressed deep dissatisfaction with the state of their city\u2019s public education systems, citing lack of funding, high drop-out rates and racial segregation as their leading causes of concern.    Fully nine out of 10 mayors surveyed expressed concern about the state of race relations and police in their city, according to the survey, with nearly a third describing themselves as \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about race and policing in their cities. The revelation illustrates the intensity and seriousness with which mayors have taken up the issue, as cities from Baltimore to New York City to Ferguson have dealt with public unrest over the last year.   Story Continued Below   The findings were part of POLITICO Magazine\u2019s second quarterly national Mayors\u2019 Survey, conducted over the course of July as part of the magazine\u2019s award-winning \u201c What Works\u201d series, which heard from 31 mayors spanning the country from Philadelphia to Tampa to San Francisco to New Orleans to Anchorage. While not scientific\u2014the large majority of respondents were Democrats, 77 percent, as well as three independents and four Republicans\u2014the survey represented a diverse range of cities from across the nation and showed clear trends across cities of varying sizes, political traditions and geographic regions.    Debates and flare-ups around alleged police misconduct have seized cities as disparate as Philadelphia, Madison and Houston\u2014each governed by mayors who participated in the POLITICO Magazine survey\u2014and across the nation, mayors have begun to lead efforts to repair community trust and broach policy discussions about department conduct.    Still, experts have suggested that the most fundamental improvement departments can adopt still remains the simplest: creating a police force that resembles the citizens it\u2019s sworn to protect. However a majority of the mayors surveyed\u201456 percent\u2014said that their police departments did not accurately reflect the racial makeup of their cities, and fully 13 percent said their force was \u201cextremely\u201d different than the racial makeup of their cities, underscoring that communities like Ferguson\u2014which received harsh criticism in the wake of last year\u2019s protests for its largely white police force overseeing a majority black city\u2014are nationally less the exception than the rule.    Yet even as they reported their concern over race and policing issues and expressed that their own police departments did not adequately reflect the racial diversity of their cities, the mayors surveyed say they believe their own police departments have solid relationships with local minority communities. Three-quarters of those surveyed\u201476 percent\u2014said they believed their police had \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d relationships with local minority communities, suggesting perhaps the recognition of a national problem coupled with an apprehension to apply it to their own departments. Indeed, the same contradiction is borne out in social science: In a recent New York Times poll in which a historic low number of respondents positively described national race relations, an overwhelming 77 percent described race relations in their own community as generally good\u2014a trend that has held true for 20 years. Mayors, it would seem, are hardly themselves immune from this phenomenon.    The mayors are enthusiastic supporters of the federal government taking a larger role in issues of police and criminal justice reform. One much desired area of reform: The surveyed mayors, themselves uniquely positioned to feel the brunt of the federal drug policies, overwhelmingly encouraged the decriminalization of marijuana, with 79 percent of the mayors suggesting that the federal government follow the lead of an increasing number of cities like Washington, D.C., and even whole states like Colorado.    Mayors expressed strong approval of President Barack Obama\u2019s speeches and actions in the wake of the unrest in Ferguson and the other policing controversies of the last year; 86 percent described the president\u2019s handling of the national debate over race and policing generally as \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cvery well.\u201d The mayors also broadly supported the president\u2019s decision this year to end the transfer of certain military surplus to local police departments like theirs\u2014the same Pentagon program that endowed the Ferguson police with military-grade equipment, with 57 percent supporting the president\u2019s ban. (The next largest response was \u201cNot Sure,\u201d at 29 percent; only 13 percent of mayors said they would have preferred the program to continue.)    The warm feelings for the federal government quickly dissipated, however, when the survey turned to matters of public education. Most mayors were cool to the legacy of No Child Left Behind; a plurality, 45 percent, said the measures had hurt their school districts, and 31 percent said it had no effect. A strong majority\u2014nearly three-fourths\u2014expressed approval for the controversial Common Core standards.    SURVEY PARTICIPANTS (in alphabetical order): Mayor AC Wharton, Jr., Memphis, TN; Andrew Gillum, Tallahassee, FL; Mayor Andy Berke, Chattanooga, TN; Mayor Anthony Silva, Stockton, CA; Mayor Bao Nguyen, Garden Grove, CA; Mayor Betsy Hodges, Minneapolis, MN; Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Tampa, FL; Mayor Carolyn G. Goodman, Las Vegas, NV; Mayor Dan Clodfelter, Charlotte, NC; Mayor Edwin Lee, San Francisco, CA; Mayor Eric Jefferson, Jackson, MS; Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, Anchorage, AK; Mayor Garrad Marsh, Modesto, CA; Mayor Hardie Davis, Augusta, GA; Mayor Harry LaRosiliere, Plano, TX; Mayor Jesse Molina, Moreno Valley, CA; Mayor Jorge Elorza, Providence, RI; Mayor Libby Schaaf, Oakland, CA; Mayor Marni Sawicki, Cape Coral, FL; Mayor Mary Casillas Salas, Chula Vista, CA; Mayor Annise Parker, Houston, TX; Mayor Michael A. Nutter, Philadelphia, PA; Mayor Mitch Landrieu, New Orleans, LA; Mayor Mayor Paul R. Soglin, Madison, WI; Mayor Ralph Becker, Salt Lake City, UT; Mayor Rick Kriseman, St. Petersburg, FL; Mayor Sam Liccardo, San Jose, CA; Mayor Steve Hogan, Aurora, CO; Mayor Tom Tait, Anaheim, CA; Mayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh, PA.    Indeed, probing into the mayors\u2019 views on school reform revealed a roughly even philosophical split in the school reform wars, even among the survey\u2019s large cache of Democratic respondents. Asked to identify the greatest challenges facing their school districts, many mayors expressed an outlook consistent with nationwide concerns for lack of funding and recourse. \u201cOverall funding\u201d topped the list of concerns, garnering 27 percent, with racial segregation coming in fourth (10 percent) and poor facilities coming in fifth (7 percent). But another contingent voiced concerns typically associated with a focus more on school performance: 16 percent of responses cited the student drop-out rate, coming in second overall; and clocking in at third was \u201cteacher pay\u201d at eleven percent.    Only 30 percent of the mayors said that they were satisfied with the performance of their school districts, and some mayors shared stern words for their city\u2019s school administrators. \u201cThe central administration is a relic of the past,\u201d griped one Democratic mayor. Others described their school systems as \u201cpoorly managed\u201d and another Democratic mayor complained, \u201cteachers unions [have] too much influence on local elected officials.\u201d But regardless of their feelings for administrators, these mayors don\u2019t abide any fantasies for changing the leadership. Some 93 percent said they have no control over hiring their public school\u2019s superintendent, and 90 percent said they\u2019ve never attempted to get such authority.    POLITICO Magazine also asked about the broader political landscape in the United States, and according to the mayors\u2019 surveyed, the rising U.S. economy appears to also be making a difference at the local level, as fully 70 percent of the mayors said that they were more optimistic their local economy is improving than they were at the beginning of the year. (Another 27 percent said they felt the saying they felt the \u201csame\u201d; only one mayor reported being less optimistic about the economy than at the beginning of 2015.)    On the question of which presidential contender they\u2019d most like to see elected for president in 2016, mayors provided a wide panoply of options, including several candidates who aren\u2019t in the race, like Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. One mayor offered only: \u201cNot Donald Trump.\u201d But it seemed that the heavily Democratic set of mayors had caught Clinton fever\u2014or, perhaps, Clinton fever had caught them. While a narrow majority thought Hillary Clinton should become president, at 52 percent, when asked who would win the election, nearly 70 percent of responses went to Clinton.    Strikingly, only two of the 31 mayors predicted that a Republican would win next year\u2019s presidential race, with one vote going to Jeb Bush and one vote going to Marco Rubio.    \u2014    The next POLITICO MagazineMayors\u2019 Survey will be published in October.

aV Success, it turns out, is quiet. It\u2019s a sunny and warm spring Thursday at Thurgood Marshall Academy in Anacostia, one of the poorest areas of Washington, D.C. The halls are hushed, and students walk by wearing maroon polo shirts embroidered with the school name. They smile and greet teachers respectfully. There are no jangling PA announcements, no clanging bell to mark the end of class, no metal detectors at the front door.    It\u2019s quiet too inside teacher Joshua Biederman\u2019s AP history class as Jeremiah Garland, a tall junior, wraps up his opening argument in a mock trial of Lt. William Calley, the officer behind the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. In the art room down the hall, it\u2019s downright peaceful as students put finishing touches on their portraits in pastels, while a three-paneled mural honoring the life of the school\u2019s namesake rests against a nearby wall.   Story Continued Below   But make no mistake: These almost Rockwell-esque scenes represent a genuine revolution, a triumph of a two-decade-long education reform experiment that has turned the nation\u2019s capital into ground zero for an ambitious overhaul of its failing schools. Thurgood Marshall\u2014and dozens of other public charter schools that range across a wide variety of teaching styles and program themes\u2014are the result.    It\u2019s a success that\u2019s seen in student lives: At Thurgood Marshall Academy, 100 percent of the school\u2019s graduates are accepted into college. And two-thirds of those students finish college, a rate that is higher than the national average\u2014and about eight times the rate for D.C. students in general, says principal Alexandra Pardo.    Keep in mind that about a third of TMA\u2019s entering ninth-graders start off at or below a fifth-grade level of proficiency in math and reading, and come from 50 to 60 different middle schools across Washington, Pardo adds.    This, the academy\u2019s leaders explain, is charter schools done right.   ***    The nation\u2019s capital is perhaps an unlikely place for education reform to take such firm hold. Its school system had long been regarded as a failure; for years it served as Exhibit A for congressmen and U.S. Department of Education bureaucrats who pointed to their hometown as the poster child for underperforming schools. D.C. schools graduated just 48.8 percent of its students in 2006; only one in twenty students who started high school earned a college degree. Nearly a third of D.C. residents tested as functionally illiterate. Even as late as 2011, years into a massive reform push, D.C. still boasted the worst graduation rate in the country: 59 percent.    The city\u2019s schools were\u2014and still are\u2014deeply segregated. Many white parents sent children to local elementary schools and then pulled them out for high school, leaving many D.C. high schools overwhelmingly black and Hispanic.    The interior of Thurgood Marshall Academy, "one of the crown jewels of the D.C. charter system." | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine    Congress, in instituting the District\u2019s Charter School Reform Act of 1995, sought to remedy some of the deepest problems, but it wasn\u2019t until the election of Mayor Adrian Fenty in 2006 and the appointment of Michelle Rhee to lead the school system that the city really committed to reform. For many of the years in between, charter schools and a few limited-entry magnet schools, were the few shining lights in the city\u2019s education system; the reform efforts since 2006 have in many ways accelerated and compounded that growth and success.    The latest push for education reform has also come\u2014not coincidentally\u2014as the downtown has undergone a dramatic transformation, with an explosion of restaurants and nightlife. New condos and gentrifying neighborhoods have brought tens of thousands of residents back into the city. While the city\u2019s charter schools ran independently of Rhee\u2019s efforts to reform the public school system, the slow improvement in the schools overall paralleled the city\u2019s growth\u2014as the city\u2019s population grew over the last decade, more parents chose to enroll their children in the city\u2019s school system, creating pressure for better schools and more schools.    Nationally, charter schools got started in 1991 as an answer to a failing traditional public school system. Although they are also publicly funded, they generally run independently of the local public school system, giving them autonomy in hiring and firing, more flexibility to make changes and a much greater likelihood of being shut down if students don\u2019t enroll or make significant progress once they\u2019re there. Since the first authorization in 1991, 43 states and D.C. now allow charter schools and 2.3 million children in the U.S. attend charters, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.    Charter schools have been seen as a way to give parents in low-income areas a choice in schooling much like what more affluent families have always had by moving into a better school district or putting their children in a private school. Instead of attending the school in their district, charter school students might go to school on the other side of the city.    D.C. today stands out because a whopping 44 percent of all its public school students\u201436,565 young people in 112 schools\u2014are enrolled in charter schools, the highest state percentage in the nation. It\u2019s a number that has grown rapidly, increasing more than ten-fold since the 1998 school year. It\u2019s a figure that also stands out because D.C. charter school students consistently score higher on tests than those at traditional public schools in the capital.    The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, in an October 2014 report monitoring the health of public charter schools in terms of growth, innovation and quality, ranked D.C. number one in the nation. Its top ranking stems from a variety of factors, says president and CEO Nina Rees, including its substantial growth, its broad array of educational options and the higher test scores. According to the Office of State Superintendent of Education, 2014 marked the eighth year in a row that the number of charter school students who are proficient in multiple subjects has increased\u2014and that number continues to exceed the state average.   \u000aAn Eduction in Reform 44 percent of D.C. public students are enrolled in charter schools.

Association of Chartered Public Schools, a membership group for charter school administrators, says, \u201cWhat\u2019s so powerful to me as an educator of 45 years is that some of these schools are having stunning success with the students that so many are concerned about. Students of color from impoverished backgrounds are doing dramatically better in charter schools in D.C. than they are in the traditional public school system.\u201d    ***    The ecosystem of D.C. charter schoolsthat has evolved over the last two decades represents a cornucopia of creative and nontraditional approaches to education, in addition to fairly traditional college-prep schools.   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Harry Jaffe  Two Rivers Public Charter School uses what it calls an \u201cexpeditionary learning model,\u201d or hands-on learning.

aV Police chief Cathy Lanier is tooling around the rougher regions of the nation\u2019s capital on an idyllic summer afternoon when she slows down to point out an intersection where she encountered a guy spaced out on synthetic drugs a week before. \u201cHe was lying in the middle of the street, eyes rolled back, drooling,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stuff does strange things to people. It\u2019s the new scourge.\u201d    Earlier this month, Jasper Spires is thought by police to have been high on synthetic drugs when he allegedly stabbed a recent American University graduate 40 times and left him dying on a crowded Metro subway car over the July 4 th weekend. It was, by all accounts, a senseless crime reminiscent of an earlier era in Washington when drug markets flourished\u2014the type of crime that horrified waves of recent D.C. arrivals who have known only gentrifying neighborhoods, trendy restaurants and rising home prices. The new drugs have Lanier worried. \u201cThey\u2019re imported from China,\u201d she says. \u201cDrug markets are changing by the day. It\u2019s hard to keep up.\u201d   Story Continued Below   The District\u2019s 47-year-old top cop is behind the wheel of her spit-shined, personal patrol car. She\u2019s wearing a starched, white, short sleeve shirt, regulation blue trousers, black leather boots polished to a high sheen. Her chief of staff, Inspector Ralph Ennis, rides in the back, with me at shotgun. Her Glock 17 is strapped to her belt.    We\u2019re cruising Bladensburg Road, an industrial stretch in the city\u2019s Fifth Ward, along the eastern border with Maryland. This is the Washington that tourists\u2014and even local politicians\u2014fear to tread. You can see the Capitol dome from high points along Bladensburg, but the intersection by Benning Road is decidedly down at the heels, lined with tire dealers, empty lots, fast food joints and store-front churches. The neighborhood is both synthetic drug central and ripe for redevelopment; real estate speculators are snapping up corner lots. \u201cNot fast enough for me,\u201d Lanier says.    She hooks a left onto a side street and heads into Trinidad. Seven years ago these streets ran with blood. Thugs would drive in, shoot rivals and speed off. Lanier threw up roadblocks. A judge would later rule them unconstitutional, but they helped stem the violence. Now row houses in Trinidad are going for seven figures.    Lanier rolls down her window and flashes her winning smile.    \u201cHey ladies,\u201d she says to a pair of young women sitting in a car.    \u201cHey, chief!\u201d they respond. They dish about the enormous house under construction across the street. \u201cCrazy,\u201d Lanier says.    This is how Chief Lanier presents herself to Washingtonians: folksy, accessible, unadorned. Casual conversations like this help explain why she remains the most popular public official in Washington, D.C. She shows up at public hearings, community meetings or the occasional gala absent an entourage. No security, no phalanx of deputy chiefs, no body woman. Many big city chiefs scowl. Lanier hugs. At nearly six feet, with thick, shaggy blond hair, cocoa brown eyes, and a habit of embracing cops, pols and community leaders, she packs plenty of presence.    Even as other major cities have in the last year struggled with police-community relations, and protest movements like Black Lives Matter have spread nationwide, Lanier has presided over a capital that has remained relatively free of conflict between cops and the community\u2014largely the result of stringent use-of-force regulations the Metropolitan Police Department implemented years ago following its own controversies.    Even as police chiefs across the country are under siege\u2014defending police practices in Ferguson, North Charleston, New York and Baltimore that have resulted in the killing of unarmed black men, Cathy Lanier is unassailable, roundly revered and breezing through her eighth year as chief under what is now her third mayor. Lanier is so well thought of that bestselling thriller writer David Baldacci created a character based on her a starring role in his 2009 novel True Blue. One public opinion poll pegged her approval rating at 84 percent in the District.    \u201cBeing a chief of a major city for eight years is way beyond normal,\u201d says Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit research group. \u201cThe average is three to four years. She\u2019s had a remarkable run.\u201d    She\u2019s represented a cool and competent presence in the capital during a period where many of the city\u2019s other major institutions bordered on deplorable. The city\u2019s fire chief stepped down last year after reports of glaring mismanagement, including a jury-rigged ambulance fleet where one truck spontaneously combusted. The region\u2019s transit system is beset by financial woes and systemic failures\u2014including an incident earlier this year where a rider died after the subway train was caught in a smoke-filled tunnel. The city\u2019s elected leadership has had its own struggles: Three D.C. city council members have pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges since 2012, and two others have been investigated. Last year Mayor Vincent Gray lost reelection amidst a wide-ranging F.B.I. investigation into his 2010 campaign finances that netted a half dozen of his closest aides.    Through much of that period, Lanier presided over a steadily falling crime rate. Homicides stood at 181 in 2007, the year Lanier became chief. They dropped to a historic low of 88 in 2012. The number of murders is now climbing, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it was. Some parts of the city are still plagued with shootings, robberies and theft, but the city feels safer.   What Works  By DEBRA BRUNO   Today, though, Lanier faces some of the most challenging terrain she\u2019s encountered in her career\u2014violent crime, after years of remarkable decreases, is beginning to tick back up, largely because of the new wave of synthetic drugs. And Cathy Lanier knows that in an era of increased public sensitivity and YouTube videos, she and the capital are just one bad shooting or police encounter away from tragedy.  ***    As we cruise the city, I ask Lanier how she has managed to keep her job through three mayors, stay in good standing with the community and avoid the pitfalls that have broken other chiefs. She slows down, places her arm across the top of my seat and says, \u201cResponsiveness is huge. Everybody has to be responsive. I give out the cell phone numbers of watch commanders on duty. If someone doesn\u2019t get a response from 911, they can call their watch commander.\u201d    Her personal style of community relations has been key to her success. Mark Tuohey, a veteran prosecutor and white-collar litigator who has worked with many police departments and is now counsel to Mayor Muriel Bowser, explains: \u201cCathy is a good listener. A lot of chiefs don\u2019t have that quality. She talks with you, not to you.\u201d    During her first two years as chief, Lanier says she tried to show up at every murder. Now she or an assistant chief makes every homicide scene. \u201cHomicide is the worst thing that can happen to a community,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be there. You\u2019re a lot more passionate about a crime if you witness the horrible outcome.\u201d     Harry Jaffe is an editor at large at Washingtonian magazine and co-author of Dream City: Race, Power, and the Decline of Washington, D.C, with Tom Sherwood.

aV Orlando doesn\u2019t seem like ground zero for the debate over higher education and social inequality. This Florida city, after all, is still best known for Disney World, the iconic Cinderella Castle and endless days of butter-yellow sunshine.    Yet for much of the past decade, Orlando\u2019s University of Central Florida and four Florida state colleges (formerly known as community colleges) have been forging a path that could be as groundbreaking as the dreams that once carved out a magical kingdom here amid cow pastures.   Story Continued Below   At first glance, the innovative program\u2014known as DirectConnect to UCF\u2014seems to represent a modest goal: Ensure that students who enroll in community college graduate successfully, then make a seamless transition to UCF, a four-year degree and, later, a career. That straightforward mission, though, actually cuts to the heart of the national conversation about access to higher education: Who gets it? Who can afford it? And where will it take you?    Community colleges were originally designed to be affordable and accessible gateways to four-year colleges and middle-class professions. Yet the myriad pressures on community college students\u2014from poor academic preparation, to financial challenges, to the need to often balance education and outside employment\u2014means that the best intentions often don\u2019t lead to positive results. Studies have found that while more than 80 percent of the 1.5 million students who enter community colleges every year nationwide say they want a bachelor\u2019s degree, just 17 percent reach that goal within six years. And, in a society where high-paying jobs increasingly require advanced or specialized education, the difference between a degree and no degree can mean the difference between making it into the middle class or remaining in poverty.    UCF and its partners are proving a new model, though\u2014heavy on individual attention and clear academic goals\u2014that paves a surer path to a degree. Together, they\u2019re charting a new course in a geographic zone roughly the size of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined.    Graduation rates at DirectConnect\u2019s two-year colleges have climbed, even as national graduation rates at similar schools have dropped or stalled. Once at UCF, 71 percent of the program\u2019s students are completing a bachelor\u2019s degree.    \u201cIf you want to diversify opportunity, it is the way to go,\u201d says Sanford \u201cSandy\u201d Shugart, one of the architects of DirectConnect and the longtime president of the Orlando area\u2019s Valencia College, which is consistently ranked as one of the top two-year colleges in the nation.    What Shugart saw on the horizon in Central Florida more than a decade ago would become instrumental in the formation of DirectConnect. UCF, the regional university and second-largest public university in the nation, was becoming increasingly selective and out of reach for local students. At the same time, the Hispanic population in the area was exploding, particularly among Puerto Ricans, involving some of the fastest and largest growth rates in the country. High tech in the Orlando area was booming, creating the need for highly educated workers in the fields of medical and military simulation, gaming, information technologies and health care.   \u000aOPTICS: Like Alex Castro, Kayshli Rodriguez is a child of working-class immigrant parents who also attends Valencia College's Osceola Campus. Click here for the photos of her daily life, and the barriers that so many from both women's backgrounds have to overcome to attend college. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine   Shugart knew more needed to be done to give his students a better shot at these jobs. Valencia\u2014named after the local citrus\u2014has nearly 60,000 students, about 60 percent of whom represent minority groups. If Shugart couldn\u2019t figure out how to get his students prepared for Orlando\u2019s growing high-tech and medical fields, they could be relegated to the low-wage tourism sector, the area\u2019s biggest employer.    Twenty-year-old Alexandrea Castro is exactly the kind of student Shugart had in mind. The daughter of a single, working mother wanted to go to college close to home after high school, but she lived hours away from UCF and was worried about the cost and whether she was academically prepared. Remedial classes and intense academic advising first at Valencia helped shape her career path. \u201cThey made you want to do more because they knew you could,\u201d Castro says.    Policy discussions about community college often focus on cost\u2014as President Barack Obama did when he proposed in his 2015 State of the Union address that community college should be \u201cas free and universal in America as high school.\u201d    The Osceola students gave Gov. Rick Scott a group hug after he came to visit the campus earlier this year. Alex Castro is pictured here directly to the right of the governor. | Valencia College/Flickr    \u201cForty percent of our college students choose community college,\u201d Obama said in January. \u201cSome are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.\u201d    But Shugart understands that cost is just part of the equation\u2014and part of the challenge\u2014facing his students. To address the needs of students like Castro, UCF and its college partners needed to tackle other challenges too, such as language barriers, lack of preparation by underperforming high schools, transportation and\u2014most critically\u2014the often bumpy and complicated transfer process itself.    \u201cThe biggest impediment to community college students getting a bachelor\u2019s degree is the inefficiency of the transfer process,\u201d says Davis Jenkins, senior research associate at the Community College Research Center at the Columbia University Teachers College.    Jenkins called DirectConnect \u201ca very important model for the country.\u201d    As the program took root and grew, so did its reach. DirectConnect is now trying to become one seamless pipeline of social mobility, pushing its tentacles both down into local school systems and upward into the private sector.   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Barbara Liston   \u201cThat is enormously powerful,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cbecause if you want some of the students to get onto a STEM path and into nursing or into the tech field, which, of course, are going to be the high growth fields in Orlando, you are going to have to start early.\u201d    That\u2019s exactly what UCF and its partners had in mind.    ***    It all began in a parking lot. Shugart remembers a decade ago sitting through a boring meeting of local higher education administrators that included the highly regarded UCF president, John Hitt.

aV No company guards its squeaky clean image more fiercely than Disney. The company is generally low-key when it comes to political wrangling and has earned a reputation as a stellar citizen through its generous charitable giving in Florida.    So it was jarring to see the company name attached to the scandal known as \u201cTextgate\u201d in the Magic Kingdom\u2019s home in Orange County, Florida. Behind the controversy was a multimillion dollar question: Should employers in all but the state\u2019s smallest businesses be required to pay their workers for sick time off? In the tourist economy in metro Orlando, where median pay tends toward rock bottom in national rankings, a grass-roots group in 2012 collected the 50,000 signatures needed for a vote to mandate such payments. It\u2019s a benefit taken for granted in most of the Western world, but typically unavailable in America to the sort of low-paid service workers who staff the Orlando-area hotels, restaurants and attractions visited by more than 60 million tourists a year.   Story Continued Below   With the requisite signatures in hand, all that was needed was a ministerial vote by the county commission to place the sick leave referendum on the November ballot. Disney and its allies had other plans. During a public hearing on the matter, text messages began to fly between commissioners, Disney corporate lobbyist Sharon Smoley, and other businesses with an interest in defeating the sick leave measure. Most of the texts were deleted and unrecoverable, but Smoley told investigators her 65 deleted messages with three commissioners primarily concerned how the meeting was going and how they were holding up.    But not all of the texts were lost. Mayor Teresa Jacobs asked for and got direction from a partner at the BakerHostetler law firm, which has ties to Disney. \u201cThis is so bizarre. Pls help me with a written explanation of my position. This is most distressful to me,\u201d Jacobs wrote to BakerHostetler attorney Kevin Shaughnessy, in texts published in the Orlando Sentinel. Shaughnessy, at some point, texted back, \u201cThen take a break stating you want the County Attorney to review the NEW (ballot) language and you and your colleagues want to study it too and you need to determine what we can and cannot do with the new language.\u201d    Jacobs voted against the delay, but she was in the minority: By a 4-3 vote, commissioners voted to put the question on hold. In an email to a reporter that later became part of a local prosecutor\u2019s investigation, longtime Orange County GOP Chairman Lew Oliver took credit for lining up the votes and writing the script for the motion to delay.    The delay gave Florida\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature and Republican Gov. Rick Scott time to bury paid sick leave in a new state law blocking local regulation of wages and benefits. A Florida court later ruled that the commission violated the county charter by failing to place the measure on the ballot. Four commissioners and the mayor agreed to pay $500 fines to settle with the prosecutor who found that they violated Florida\u2019s public records law when they deleted the exchanges with Disney and others during the meeting.    Disney did nothing illegal. The company handled the matter in the same way it deals with casino gambling or gay rights or myriad issues that touch its vast kingdom: speaking softly and carrying a big stick. But this is a state weighted down by a growing class of working poor who sometimes live in cars, and where Gov. Scott shows up for photo-ops at convenience store openings to brag about his jobs program. And when you\u2019re in the business of promising fairy-tale endings and dreams that come true, the optics are bad.    \u201cThe fact we have some of the lowest wages in the country is in large part because we have Disney, which sets the tone for how others pay and treat their employees,\u201d says petition drive leader Stephanie Porta, director of Organize Now, a liberal group.    Or, as Richard Foglesong, political science professor at Rollins College and author of Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando, puts it, \u201cIt exposed their hand as a self-aggrandizing business corporation, belying their warm-puppy image as purveyor of fantasy and fun.\u201d    Disney, while understandably declining to address the criticism regarding its position on paid sick leave, disputes Foglesong\u2019s characterization. \u201cWe are active in the public policy arena on issues that are important to our company,\u201d says Disney spokeswomanJacquee Wahler. \u201cAnd we support candidates who support pro-growth and pro-tourismpolicies in Florida.\u201d    For sure, it was a rare case of Disney, with its deep bench of ingenious \u201cimagineers\u201d and relentlessly on-message publicists, allowing anything to disturb the mirage of The Most Magical Place on Earth.    Bare-knuckle political brawling and Disney are not usually paired in the headlines around the state. Disney is the 800-pound mouse protecting its cheese in the backrooms of city hall and state government. And, like the fuzzy rodent, it is typically quiet.    \u201cA lot of things that Disney is able to do, you really don\u2019t see,\u201d says John Morgan, a Democratic powerhouse and businessman whose interests sometimes conflict with Disney\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wizard of Oz. You really don\u2019t know who is behind the curtain.\u201d    ***    Walt Disney World is the biggest player in the state\u2019s $76 billion tourism industry, and the No. 1 amusement park by attendance in the world. Florida and Disney\u2014or, Orlando and Disney\u2014are synonyms to many people around the world.   What Works  By SAUNDRA AMRHEIN   Disney directly employs 74,000 people in Central Florida, and pegs the Orlando resort\u2019s economic impact at $18.2 billion, or 2.5 percent of the state\u2019s gross domestic product, based on 2009 data.  The company gave back to the community $37.9 million in cash and in-kind donations in 2014 in Central Florida alone.    Hospital wings, performing arts theaters and many smaller Orlando projects have benefited not just from the company\u2019s cash but the unique creative talents that an entertainment giant has to offer.    \u201cThey wear a 24-hour halo because of all the good they do for so many,\u201d says Morgan, who calls Disney the region\u2019s best corporate citizen. And this is from a man who built a personal injury law empire in Orlando out of a 40-year-long rage at Disney\u2019s treatment of his brother, formerly a resort lifeguard, who broke his neck during a rescue dive.    Disney\u2019s sheer size and charitable giving translate naturally into goodwill and clout in the political arena.     Barbara Liston is a freelance writer based in Orlando.

aV Opening night for the Houston Astrodome\u2014April 9, 1965\u2014couldn\u2019t have gone better. The newly renamed Houston Astros (they had been the Colt .45s from their inception in 1962) hosted the mighty New York Yankees in an exhibition baseball game\u2014the first Major League game played indoors. Yankee slugger Mickey Mantle hit the first home run as President Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird looked on from an air-conditioned luxury suite\u2014a novelty at that time. (The Astros won the game, 2-1.)     The next 50 years were just as eventful for the world\u2019s first domed stadium. Judy Garland was the first entertainer to play the Dome, with the Supremes as her opening act. Elvis Presley performed there six times. The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, the Jacksons, Pink Floyd and dozens of country superstars played there. Muhammad Ali fought there. And it was in the Astrodome where Evel Kneivel jumped over 13 cars on his motorcycle; where the University of Houston beat UCLA in 1968\u2019s \u201cGame of the Century\u201d\u2014the first college basketball game that aired on prime time TV; where tennis queen Billie Jean King, in her prime, whipped 55-year-old Bobby Riggs in the \u201cBattle of the Sexes.\u201d And, of course, it was for a time home to the Houston Oilers football team, baseball\u2019s Astros and the world-renowned Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.   Story Continued Below   The official name of the Astrodome, which was built with $35 million in local taxpayer dollars, was the Harris County Domed Stadium, but nobody called it that. It was the Astrodome, known as the Eighth Wonder of the World, a remarkable, imaginative structure for its time that immediately became the symbol of the city, right along with America\u2019s pulse-pounding space program.    Today, the Astrodome sits there, wasting away, abandoned and unloved, declared an uninhabitable fire trap by the Houston Fire Department. The Oilers left in 1997, relocating to Nashville and becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Astros left in 1999 for new digs, Enron Field, in downtown Houston. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo left in 2002, moving to Houston\u2019s new football palace, NRG Stadium, built next door to the vacant Astrodome. The Houston Texans are now the local NFL favorites.    It is also a political mess that has Houstonians\u2019 emotions at the boiling point. In 2013, voters rejected a $213 million proposal to convert the Astrodome into a multipurpose event facility. The vote went 53 to 47 percent against the Dome. Essentially, voters said they no longer wanted their tax dollars spent on anything to do with the Astrodome. The Houston Texans want the Astrodome demolished to make way for parking. Livestock Show and Rodeo officials favor tearing down the Dome, too.    ***    So why is the Astrodome still there?    Harris County chief executive Ed Emmett, 65, can\u2019t seem to say goodbye to the Astrodome. Emmett\u2014whose formal title is \u201cjudge\u201d due to quirky Texas nomenclature\u2014presides over the five-member Commissioners Court that runs Harris County, which is the third largest in the United States with just over 4 million residents.    Emmett, a Republican, spent nearly a decade in the Texas legislature and some three years as a George H.W. Bush-appointed commissioner on the Interstate Commerce Commission before becoming the elected head of Harris County. His argument to save the Astrodome is simple: The stadium is paid for, and owned by county taxpayers; to him, it makes no sense to tear down a building that he insists is \u201cstructurally sound.\u201d He desperately wants to save the Dome, even though to many he looks like a wacko chaining himself to the building to thwart the inevitable bulldozer.    In 2005, Emmett's predecessor, Robert Eckels, was instrumental in opening the Astrodome to 25,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees from Louisiana. He arranged for cots and clothing and meals for the mostly women and children, giving them a chance to dry out and catch their breath before figuring out their new lives. The evacuees stayed in the Dome two weeks. It was the last time the Dome had people inside it in an official capacity.    Emmett became county judge in 2007. One year later, Houston was hit by Hurricane Ike, and Emmett gained the confidence of Houstonians and a national reputation for his calm, mature leadership. As rain and wind pelted Houston, Emmett went on TV, standing shoulder to shoulder with Houston Mayor Bill White, a Democrat, and helped residents stay safe with a steady statesman\u2019s hand.    Emmett gained the nickname \u201cHunker Down Ed,\u201d possibly the most respected and well liked politician in South Texas.    Emmett may find that weathering Ike and Katrina was a breeze compared to the fire storm gathering on what to do with the Astrodome.    After the 2013 bond proposal was rejected, Emmett went back to his Dome drawing board. Now he\u2019s promoting a $242 million plan to turn the Astrodome into an indoor park that will have free admission and free parking. He wants green space for picnics and concerts, also museums and sporting events. He thinks a biking and hiking trail would be popular, especially during hot Houston summers. There are dozens of festivals in Houston each year. He\u2019s sure many of them would love to relocate indoors.    Emmett says most of the money will come from the private sector, but admits that taxpayers will have to kick in an undetermined portion.     Emmett recently visited Germany to tour an indoor water park that was converted from an abandoned zeppelin hangar several times bigger than the Astrodome. He wanted to check out the building, meet the architects, and get gardening tips from the Germans, who grow lush tropical plants inside a building 50 miles from Berlin.    This new plan has many taxpayers fuming. \u201cDidn\u2019t we already vote on this?\u201d    The anger seems to come from conservative Republicans in Houston\u2019s suburbs. A conservative radio talk host rails against Emmett and his obsession with saving the Dome. The Houston Press, an alternative weekly, ran a major story: \u201cWhen it comes to the Dome, Ed Emmett thinks you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d    Letters pour into the Houston Chronicle:    \u201cHe\u2019s sticking us taxpayers with a bill for his free vacation in Germany.\u201d    \u201cWhen will his madness stop?\u201d    \u201cI\u2019m a fiscally conservative Republican. Emmett is wasting millions on his \u2018pet project.\u2019 He\u2019s turned into an arrogant political hack who pays no attention to voters.\u201d    \u201cI guess Emmett learned a valuable lesson from his Democratic counterparts when he denied the results of Harris County voters on the future of the Dome.\u201d    So much for avuncular, admired \u201cHunker Down Ed.\u201d    ***    Emmett fumes that Houstonians are buying a lot of misinformation about his new Astrodome plan, while they\u2019re not willing to pay to save Houston\u2019s once-defining structure.    \u201cWe are not proposing a $242 million expense of public money,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a public-private partnership. I would hope that only a fraction of that would be public money to build the park itself. We have an Astrodome that is fully paid for, and it would cost tens of millions of dollars to tear it down. So I\u2019d rather spend that amount, or less, to turn it into something useful, and give it to the people who have already paid for it once.\u201d    He is emphatic. The public did not vote to tear down the Astrodome.    \u201dThe polls that I\u2019ve seen say people overwhelmingly support saving the Dome. They just don\u2019t want to use their money to save it. The bond election in 2013 was poorly presented to voters. To this day, people still think they were voting for a convention center. That\u2019s what failed. People did not vote to tear it down, that wasn\u2019t on the ballot.\u201d    And he did not use taxpayer money on his trip to Germany, he notes. He expensed it to his private campaign fund.    One reason that some think they were voting to tear down the Astrodome was this 2013 warning from Emmett himself: \u201cIf we can\u2019t spend tax dollars to repurpose the Dome, and there are no private dollars to repurpose the dome, then the only thing at that point is we can\u2019t leave it sitting there. So it would have to come down.\u201d    Emmett now admits that \u201cI did say something similar to that.\u201d    Not similar\u2014word for word.    There\u2019s another wrinkle that could work in Emmett\u2019s favor: The push to designate the Astrodome as an historic landmark. The Texas Historical Commission has yet to act, largely because officials with the commission said they worried that such a designation could hamper efforts to raise money to rehabilitate the stadium. But Emmett is still hopeful. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is, we couldn\u2019t tear it down now, anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Texas Historical Commission has to approve everything we do with the Astrodome, and I don\u2019t see them approving that.\u201d    So the Astrodome sits, forlorn, depending on its hero Ed Emmett to make it pretty again.    \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to make a proposal, if there is a bond attached to it, I will be front and center, along with other people, to sell it,\u201d he says. \u201cWere there lessons learned from the 2013 election? Absolutely. Whatever we present, we will present in a much more vigorous fashion. The taxpayers have to realize that whatever we do, it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d    Correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Ed Emmett was involved in the decision to open the Astrodome to Katrina refugees. It was in fact his predecessor who made that decision.     Ken Hoffman is a columnist for the Houston Chronicle.

aV The first time Madelinne Gomez journeyed from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to Houston it was 2008 and she was 8 years old. Madelinne\u2019s father had been killed when she was four and she hoped to rejoin her mother, who\u2019d been in Texas for several years. So, she trekked into Guatemala with the coyote her mother hired, took the train they call La Bestia through Mexico, spent a month ransomed in Reynosa before her mother could pay more, and was set free, alone, in the South Texas wilderness where she was found by the Border Patrol. After seven months with her mother, a judge ordered Madelinne back to Honduras.    She tried to cross again at age 12, but was caught on the train and deported from Mexico. By then San Pedro Sula was known as the most dangerous city in the world and her mother worried about Madelinne\u2019s future as a young woman in the city ruled by the brutal Maras gangs. Madelline had seen death and violence on her journeys to the U.S., but faced great danger too if she remained in Honduras. Early last summer, at age 14, she set out again.   Story Continued Below   On one of the last legs of the trip, she watched the current of the Rio Grande pull an old man from her boat. Madelinne survived, and today she lives in an apartment with her mother and two American-born sisters. She is an eighth-grade student in Houston\u2019s public schools.    She tells me her story at a table at Las Americas Newcomer School, a special Houston program designed to soften the adjustment into the American education system. A world map hangs on the wall behind Madelinne along with the words \u201cwelcome home.\u201d In another corner sits Sarah Howell, a social worker hired last year to help students like Madelinne who arrive from Central America, Afghanistan, Burma, Congo and other parts of the world that have been ravaged by violence or poverty. \u201cNobody came here for fun,\u201d Howell tells me. \u201cYou left because you didn\u2019t have another option.\u201d    That may not be the most glowing endorsement a school or a city could ask for, but it is a point of pride for Las Americas, and for Houston generally. Houston will soon be America\u2019s third-largest city\u2014its metro area grew more than any in the country from 2000 to 2010\u2014and the Houston region is already the nation\u2019s most diverse. According to the Houston Refugee Consortium, the city has been nation\u2019s top destination for refugees, popular for its relatively low cost of living, strong job market, warm weather and well-established ethnic pockets. That Houston is where so much of the world makes its American arrival is the city\u2019s great challenge and its great opportunity. Nowhere is that more evident than in the city\u2019s schools, and no school embodies it more than Las Americas.    In a city with such wealth and promise, and more Fortune 500 companies than anywhere but New York, the school system preparing the next generation of Houstonians is performing a delicate dance of highs and lows: a reputation for bold, impressive innovation, and a student body that\u2019s increasingly poor and challenging to teach.    Eighth grader Sabrin Haile,second from left, chats with a friend between classes at Las Americas; she once lived in an Ethiopian refugee camp. Last year's wave of migrant children fleeing from Central America has balooned Las Americas' enrollment this year to triple capacity. | Mark Peterson/Redux    Two years ago, the Houston Independent School District (HISD) became the first two-time winner of the Broad Prize for Urban Education. The prize is a high honor for school districts, often called the Nobel Prize of school reform, and comes with $550,000 in college scholarships for the winner\u2019s graduating seniors. The Council of Great City Schools\u2014a consortium of the largest urban school districts\u2014named Houston\u2019s superintendent, Terry Grier, its urban educator of the year for 2014. Onstage at a recent school district event, Grier recalled a visit to the White House, when President Obama told him, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think anyone innovates quite like HISD.\u201d    Principal Marie Moreno says that nothing in her first nine years at Las Americas could have prepared her for the challenges of this year. "It's not just teaching them English," she said. "It's teaching them a way of life and how to live in a western society." | Mark Peterson/Redux    It\u2019s hard to disagree. HISD, for example, has 52 \u201cdual language\u201d schools, where students spend at least half of the school day learning in Spanish; the district boasts more such schools than Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and El Paso combined. HISD also has one dual language school for Arabic and another for Mandarin Chinese and soon plans to open Texas\u2019s first Hindi dual language school. Through its fledgling \u201cEmerge\u201d program, Houston public schools last year sent 64 low-income, minority students to Ivy League or top-tiered schools; it\u2019s on track to matriculate 91 this year. The district began \u201cHome Field Advantage\u201d recently after it realized that 13 of its schools had mobility rates of 40 percent or more with students changing schools multiple times throughout the year because of family financial stresses. To maintain continuity and stability, students are provided free transportation to the school where they started the year, regardless of where they currently live.    In the schools as in the city, the free market rules: Teachers who are deemed effective receive bonuses; principals are paid to take marketing classes at Rice University to better pitch their schools to prospective students who can choose to go to any school in the district, space permitting. There are also\u2014as in most school districts\u2014teacher/edu-preneurs and Teach for America grads like Adeeb Barqawi and Rick Cruz who go beyond their classroom lessons to build new systems to support students.    As a result, the district has achieved some impressive results: The \u201cachievement gap\u201d in high school math and science between white and minority students has been cut in half; HISD has the country\u2019s highest rate of minority participation in SAT and Advanced Placement tests; passage rate for AP exams has increased by 80 percent since 2007, according to Grier.   \u000aOPTICS: Click here to see the faces of the Las Americas Newcomers School. | Mark Peterson/Redux   But the district\u2019s long history of concerted school improvement efforts hasn\u2019t altered the reality of poverty and economic segregation in Houston. And while it\u2019s nave to expect any new school management strategy to have that kind of impact, some around the district worry that the attention to discrete innovations and improvement strategies\u2014the sort of things that win awards and create good buzz in policy circles\u2014has come at a cost to the stable support network students desperately need their schools to be.    \u201cHouston\u2019s always been the city of the future,\u201d says Houston school trustee Juliet Stipeche, \u201cbut if we don't make meaningful change we\u2019re gonna be left behind.\u201d    Superintendent Grier all but acknowledged that point in a February speech. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he said, \u201cthe list of Houston schools that most of us in this room would refuse to send our own children to, is longer than the list of schools we consider acceptable for our own children.\u201d     Patrick Michels\u2014a former teacher\u2014is a staff writer for the Texas Observer.

aV The cities\u2019 CEOs are disgusted with Capitol Hill. Sure, we\u2019ve known the American people have little regard for Congress, which has been experiencing record-low approval ratings. Yet fellow elected officials working in America\u2019s cities also hold Washington in disfavor, and they had a clear message for their representatives on Capitol Hill: Gridlock has gone too far.    Some 82 percent of mayors queried said they had very little or no confidence in Washington lawmakers to address the nation\u2019s most pressing problem, according to Politico Magazine\u2019s inaugural Mayors\u2019 Survey. What did mayors find most grating? Was it lawmakers\u2019 almost genetically-encoded aversion to solving important challenges? Their tendency to grandstand? Their inability to resist kowtowing to powerful special interests? All of the above, nearly half of the respondents reported.   Story Continued Below   \u201cWe must do what we can on our own, locally and regionally,\u201d said one mayor, \u201cand support Washington to get past gridlock and invest in infrastructure that will create quality jobs and stimulate sustainable quality jobs.\u201d    And what does Washington do well? Procrastinate, wrote one West Coast mayor, without a hint of humor.    The revelations in Politico Magazine inaugural Mayors\u2019 Survey, which was conducted as an extension of the magazine\u2019s award-winning \u201c What Works\u201d series, were part of a survey that heard from 21 mayors in more than a dozen states, in places as far-flung as Miami and Oakland, Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, and New Orleans and Yonkers.    The mayors were asked in the survey to answer a series of questions about economic development, their biggest challenges, the most stubborn obstacles and Washington\u2019s role in helping\u2014or hurting\u2014their city\u2019s fate. The vast majority of the respondents\u201416\u2014identified themselves as Democrats, with two Republicans and three mayors elected in non-partisan races also taking part. While Congress fared poorly, President Barack Obama was given high marks in this Democratically-heavy (and non-scientific) poll. Roughly 67 percent of respondents said the president deserves \u201ca great deal of credit\u201d for the country\u2019s economic turnaround, even though a majority believes that the Affordable Care Act\u2014and not his bailout of the auto industry or the federal stimulus program\u2014will be his greatest economic legacy.    Not everyone is an Obama fan, however. One respondent said the president would be remembered for the \u201cgovernment takeover of banking, auto, healthcare and energy industries.\u201d What could the president do that he hasn\u2019t done already to spur the economy? This mayor answered: \u201cGet out of office.\u201d    Yet regardless of the feelings about the president and with the near universal condemnation of Congress, mayors were united that the federal government and Washington officials weren\u2019t doing enough to help their cities and their citizens and instead were ignoring key crises in infrastructure and education.    Closer to home, most mayors reported that their greatest challenge involved fixing crumbling infrastructure\u2014a problem they overwhelmingly believed should be a top priority in Washington. Their view that Washington needed to provide more funding for roads, bridges, and other infrastructure was bipartisan and comes as Congress is locked in a sustained battle over providing money for the nation\u2019s Highway Trust Fund.    While many city leaders thought that improved roads and transportation would help their citizens, a full 50 percent of the mayors cited a \u201cbetter educated workforce\u201d as the most important factor in improving their city\u2019s economic trajectory.    The survey also asked what action would mayors take if they if they had unilateral power and were guaranteed no political fallout? Almost one-third said they would significantly raise the minimum wage, an issue that has become an increasingly potent political debate in cities and states around the country in the last year. Meanwhile, just 16 percent of the mayors said they\u2019d raise taxes if given a chance.    Four of their mayoral colleagues garnered multiple mentions when those responding to the survey were asked to name the current city leader they most admire. Philadelphia\u2019s Michael Nutter topped the list, cited by four of his counterparts. \u201cI watched as he came from being an underdog to becoming a mayor, with a commitment to fiscal discipline, innovation and social equity,\u201d wrote one mayor about Nutter. \u201cHe understands the problems faced with being a blue city in a predominantly red state and how to maneuver to get Philadelphia much of the aid they\u2019ve needed. In a short period of time he has risen to national prominence as a dean of American mayors and at the same time stays grounded to everyday issues facing the people of Philadelphia.\u201d    SURVEY PARTICIPANTS (in alphabetical order): Mayor William V. Bell, Durham, NC; Mayor Andy Berke, Chattanooga, TN; Supervisor Judi Bosworth, North Hempstead, NY; Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Tampa, FL; Mayor Hardie Davis, Jr., Augusta, GA; Mayor Greg Fischer, Louisville, KY; Mayor Andrew Gillum, Tallahassee, FL; Mayor Carolyn G.

aV Mitch Landrieu looked around New Orleans when he became mayor in 2010, and got angry. The thousands of houses still abandoned and rotting in the city, five years after Hurricane Katrina? The thousands more empty lots where 10-foot-tall weeds had taken over?    That, Landrieu says, was \u201cbasically property owners walking away from their responsibility and leaving it to the rest of the public to clean up their mess.\u201d   Story Continued Below   It\u2019s not that the city had done nothing since the mammoth storm washed ashore in August 2005. Many home and business owners had rebuilt. The public and private sectors had helped other displaced residents come back. The government bought and razed properties from absentee landlords and owners who had no intention of returning. Despite these efforts, New Orleans remained No. 1 in blight when Landrieu took the reins, in far worse shape than Detroit, Flint, Cleveland or Baltimore.    It was past time, the mayor decided, for delinquent property owners to step up\u2014or step aside.    \u201cI told my team we have to go everywhere in America where they\u2019re solving difficult problems,\u201d Landrieu says. \u201cWe have to figure out not only what they\u2019re doing but how they\u2019re doing it. And then we have to bring best practices here.\u201d    The city adopted or adapted ideas from places like Boston and Philadelphia\u2014from special phone hotlines for reporting blight to market studies that helped planners understand where best to focus efforts. Then New Orleans added new tools, one by one: Creating a state-of-the-art database to track the status of every blighted property; passing laws that allow the city to enforce blight codes with lightning speed (at least bureaucratic lightning speed); and targeting specific neighborhoods that, while not exactly jewels before Katrina, were teetering on the brink of collapse because added blight brought more crime and instability.    Landrieu\u2019s administration reached its first-term goal to demolish, rehabilitate or clear 10,000 of the city\u2019s 44,000 blighted residential properties when the eradication program was launched in fall 2010. Roughly a year into his second term, the count is up to 13,000 properties, officials say.    \u201cHurricane Katrina was an awful event,\u201d says Ryan Berni, a senior aide to Landrieu. \u201cBut it presented the opportunity for New Orleans to become this country\u2019s laboratory and hub for innovation and change.\u201d    New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, above, has cleared up to 13,000 properties during his tenure. | Mark Peterson/Redux    The blight fight has aided a recent resurgence. New Orleans has recovered some 85 percent of its pre-Katrina population. The food-mad city now has 1,400 restaurants\u2014far more than before Katrina. New high-tech companies are helping diversify the economy. Tourism, a top employer, is all but back; some 9.5 million visitors spent a record $6.8 billion in 2014, drawn by Mardi Gras, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Sugar Bowl college football game, conventions, cruise ships and myriad parties the city and its neighborhoods throw on any given week.    Yet for all its progress, New Orleans still has roughly the same number of blighted properties as before Katrina, proving that while blight is easy to spot, it is deceptively difficult to attack.    Where recovery has taken hold, affordable housing is scarce; some poor and moderate-income people are being priced out of the market. And progress has been painfully slow in many neighborhoods with concentrated, long-term decay and poverty like the Lower Ninth Ward\u2014the community that provided iconic images during Katrina of its residents frantically waving down rescue helicopters from the roofs of submerged homes.    The Lower Ninth once boasted the highest rate of homeownership among African-Americans in New Orleans. About 18,000 people lived in its 5,400 houses and apartments when Katrina made landfall. A mere 1,800 residences received mail in mid-2014\u2014an indication of how many people have restarted elsewhere and how little the neighborhood has recovered in the last decade.   \u000aOPTICS: A Walk Down Flood Street: Life amid blight in the Lower Ninth Ward. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux  Yes, Brad Pitt\u2019s Make It Right Foundation has built 100 colorful and futuristic houses in the Lower Ninth and plans to build 50 more. The city has spent tens of millions to build a new community center and fire station.    But 10 years after the storm, only three-dozen private residences are occupied in 11 blocks of Flood Street near Harry Simms\u2019 rebuilt home in the Lower Ninth Ward. \u201cWe had houses all along this street,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at all the slabs. There was a house here, a house over there and three over there before Katrina.\u201d    He points to a dilapidated property around the corner.    \u201cSee that house?\u201d he says. \u201cThey ain\u2019t torn it down yet.\u201d    He singles out another structure on Flood Street, vacant and crumbling.    The owners?    \u201cThey\u2019re in Ohio.\u201d   ***    New Orleans was buried in blight long before Katrina.    A national nonprofit prepared a study on how to address the problem, its report due on September 1, 2005. Katrina hit New Orleans two days earlier, creating even more blight in even more places. City population plummeted; 105,000 homes suffered major-to-severe damage or were destroyed.    Several co-authors of the earlier blight report helped develop the Landrieu strategy. The ends were simple: \u201cPreserve houses that needed to be preserved, demolish houses that needed to go and maintain vacant lots,\u201d says Jeff Hebert, who joined the administration in the summer of 2010 and heads the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority.    Lower Ninth Ward, just off of Flood Street. | Mark Peterson/Redux for Politico Magazine    The means, Hebert says, were complex: \u201cWe needed to understand the real estate market and have a strategy for infill development to push the comeback. And that all had to be tracked.\u201d    The Center for Community Progress, established in January 2010 with initial funding by the Charles Stewart Mott and Ford foundations, worked with New Orleans officials to visit and study practices in cities such as Cleveland, Boston and New York.    The first order of business: how to effectively count blighted properties and track enforcement. The task is harder than it sounds. Compiling information from the 12 city departments involved in fighting blight was painstaking because they were not linked. None knew what the others were doing.    \u201cFor 18 months we were hacking at a system that wasn\u2019t built to do what we were trying to do,\u201d says Oliver Wise, who heads the administration\u2019s Office of Performance and Accountability.   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Tyler Bridges  They needed one-touch summaries on each lot that showed violations, citations, hearing dates and construction permits issued. \u201cWe had to find a solution innovative enough so we could draw a line around part of the city and have data pop up for every property inside that line,\u201d says Hebert, who also serves as the city\u2019s chief resilience officer with funding under the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities initiative.    New Orleans officials found inspiration in tracking software viewed on fact-finding trips to Baltimore and Philadelphia. Once home, they began to craft specifications for their own lot-by-lot system that would provide the data needed to track each step of the blight fight and aid creation of performance standards to measure its efficiency. The city put all that data and its progress reports online, recognizing the need to engage the community and mend tattered public trust.

aV She has butted heads with Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who once called her a \u201cloudmouth,\u201d but has since made amends. She won a seat on the New Orleans City Council despite an embarrassing and potentially career-ending incident involving her husband\u2014an attorney for the city\u2014and a marijuana joint.    And she was instrumental is saving her neighborhood from being razed and turned into parkland after Hurricane Katrina submerged it in seven feet of water.   Story Continued Below   This, in a nutshell, is LaToya Cantrell\u2014the most interesting up-and-coming elected official in New Orleans today. Now that Landrieu is a lame duck\u2014he\u2019s term-limited and his tenure ends in 2018\u2014Cantrell has attracted enough notice that she is frequently mentioned as a possible successor. But she gets a little shaken up when people refer to her as a politician.    \u201cI will always, always be tied to the community and the grass-roots network,\u201d Cantrell says at a recent gathering at St. John Institutional Missionary Baptist Church. She is wearing a turquoise dress and New Balance running shoes and explains that she\u2019s just come from walking a nearby neighborhood, documenting houses that remained blighted. During that event, all of the dozen neighbors who fanned out with her were white. Cantrell mixes as easily with them as she does with the 150 or so African-Americans in the church crowd.    In a city where African-American and white groups often choose to do their own thing, Cantrell bridges the racial divide and can point to a record of getting things done.    \u201cShe has a record of success as a community organizer,\u201d says Edward Chervenak, a political science professor at the University of New Orleans. \u201cShe\u2019s a coalition builder.\u201d Chervenak notes that Cantrell stands a demographic advantage in a mayoral race, given that 59 percent of voters are African-American and 56 percent are female.    In years past, African-American elected officials in New Orleans came mostly from the civil rights movement. Their focus was making sure constituents got government jobs and contracts and were not excluded from social functions. But Cantrell represents a new generation of African-American officials with broader concerns.    This is on display as she speaks to the church group. She highlights her latest political fight, a measure approved unanimously by the city council in January that bans smoking in the city\u2019s bars, hotels and gambling halls. Cantrell typically tries to find common ground among competing interests. But in this instance, she pushed for the strictest smoking ban possible.    Her concern, she tells the group, is protecting bartenders, customers and musicians from second-hand smoke. The smoke frequently causes death and chronic illness, which, she says, \u201care more prevalent in the African-American community.\u201d    Cantrell notes that political opposition to the ban continues. The casino giant Harrah\u2019s, which operates the only casino in New Orleans, is pressing for a partial exemption. \u201cI will continue to fight the good fight,\u201d Cantrell promises the crowd.    Chervenak says Cantrell\u2019s laser focus on her constituents isn\u2019t unique\u2014New Orleans residents expect more leadership out of their elected officials now. \u201cVoters are more performance-oriented now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see a repeat of the disaster in [Hurricane] Katrina so they are paying more attention to government.\u201d    ***    Cantrell, 43, came of age politically after Katrina and the collapse of the federal levee system that protects New Orleans from surrounding waters. The August 2005 catastrophe killed more than 1,800 people and left 80 percent of the city under anywhere from six inches to 14 feet of water. Cantrell was instrumental in getting whites and African-Americans to work together to rebuild their neighborhood, called Broadmoor.    Cantrell went on to win an open seat on the seven-member city council in 2012, and she won a full four-year term in 2014. Her racially-mixed district reflects the disparate faces of New Orleans. The poorer neighborhoods inhabited by African-Americans remain downtrodden, and shootings there are common. Blight remains, although it has declined.    But in the more affluent neighborhoods, population and job growth are up. Investors are lining up to buy and retrofit historic buildings in the Central Business District and the Warehouse District, which she represents. That puts Cantrell in the middle between developers who petition the City Council for variances to zoning laws and preservationists demanding that she hold the line.    She grew up in the Los Angeles area, in a mixed neighborhood of Hispanics, Asians, whites and African-Americans and came to New Orleans to study at Xavier University. After graduating with a degree in sociology, she went to work for an education foundation in New Orleans that assisted public schools.   What Works  By ERIC VELASCO   Her life changed after Katrina broke the unsound levees, and Broadmoor, was swamped in floodwaters seven feet deep. While Cantrell was still stuck in Houston, a retired General Motors financial analyst named Ernie O\u2019Steen returned two weeks later, before anyone else had come back. The stench of death and decay were overpowering. \u201cIt looked like a napalm bomb had hit,\u201d O\u2019Steen, an Air Force veteran, told me in 2007.  A mayoral planning committee held little hope for Broadmoor. Its pro-bono land-use consultant proposed turning the neighborhood into green space that would help absorb future flooding in the city. Residents would be resettled.    O\u2019Steen and the neighborhood\u2019s other white leaders turned to Cantrell, who headed the Broadmoor Improvement Association, an unpaid position. She and neighborhood volunteers found a captain for each of Broadmoor\u2019s 151 blocks, and they created a web page that served as a crucial community bulletin board. In the meantime, Cantrell rebuilt her own two-story home. \u201cWe said, \u2018our community will return,\u2019\u201d Cantrell said in 2007. \u201cWe will make it return. We can\u2019t wait on government. We have to do it ourselves.\u201d     Tyler Bridges, a freelance writer based in New Orleans, is a former Nieman Fellow and reporter for The Miami Herald and The Times-Picayune.

aV Newark is building again. Yes, that Newark\u2014the city in Jersey that burned after the \u201967 riots, the one that helped to define \u201cwhite flight,\u201d that struggles still with almost impenetrable unemployment and homelessness and crime. That city is building.    And here it all is\u2014its past and present and future\u2014pouring through Irene Hall\u2019s floor-to-ceiling windows downtown: the whites and browns of the Old First Presbyterian Church, founded in 1666; haggard red brick facades with windows sealed off by cinderblock; the neon blue lights of Hotel Indigo, which opened last year in a long-vacant, century-old building near the busiest intersection in Brick City.   Story Continued Below   \u201cThe colors are amazing,\u201d Hall declares on this late February morning.    Though the five-year-old Courtyard Marriott, just up the block, doesn\u2019t take Hall\u2019s breath away, it is the first new hotel built in Newark\u2019s downtown in 40 years.    If the story of Newark\u2019s revitalization is all about buildings, Hall, a 60-year-old principal at a charter school here, is living inside one of its newest characters. Her eclectic, fifth-floor apartment is one of the residential units in Teachers Village, a $150 million, mixed-use project financed through a consortium of private and public investments and blessed with mammoth government tax credits. The development lives along five blocks of Halsey Street, just off of the city\u2019s main thoroughfare and was designed to convert into residents some of the 6,000 teachers and administrators who commute to this city of 280,000 each workday.    \u201cWhen we started thinking about middle income housing,\u201d says Ron Beit, the project\u2019s lead developer, \u201cwe thought, \u2018Whoa, wait a minute. We have this crop of teachers coming into Newark every day and the energy they bring would be a great catalyst for our plan.\u2019\u201d    Beit started buying up downtown Newark in 2005 with financing from private investors, including Nicolas Berggruen\u2014the chairman of private equity firm Berggruen Holdings who has pledged to give away most of his fortune. (Berggruen is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe homeless billionaire\u201d because he lives mostly in posh hotels.)    Thirty-three transactions and $130 million later, Beit and partners had amassed 79 properties, eight of those destined to become Teachers Village. The rest lie in wait for the next phases of the plan: a hotel; more residential, retail and office space; even an aeroponic farm smack in the middle of the city.    When the first Teachers Village buildings debuted in 2013, Beit was joined at the ribbon cutting by Sen. Cory Booker, then the city\u2019s mayor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and a host of public officials, investors and students. There were also protestors, chanting \u201cWe need real jobs\u201d and wondering why the city wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about pouring millions of dollars into creating employment opportunities for its beleaguered residents. When construction\u2019s done in 2016, Teachers Village will consist of eight, low-rise buildings housing three charter schools and a daycare facility, 65,000 square feet of retail, and 205 residential units designed by the world-renowned Richard Meier, Newark\u2019s native son and architect of the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art in Spain.    Ron Beit, once called the "James Brown of development," is leading the charge to revitalize Newark | Mark Peterson/Redux for Politico Magazine    Beit, who was once described by Booker as the \u201cJames Brown of development,\u201d uses words like \u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \u201cecosystem\u201d when discussing his vision for Teachers Village. Berggruen is even more elegiac. \u201cNewark basically got abandoned, it was like a blank canvas,\u201d he says by phone from Paris in early March. \u201cMy feeling is every neighborhood deserves beauty and quality, not because it\u2019s challenged. Newark needs love. Paris doesn\u2019t.\u201d    But this also is true: The project in all likelihood would not have gotten off the ground without the potential for profit. Investors and financial institutions, after all, rarely throw money at something without the prospect of a return on that investment. There are also some in Newark who are skeptical about the plan. Erecting a few residential buildings in the center of town, they say, does not a community make; it also does little for long-time Newark residents in the poorest neighborhoods beyond the city center. Nor does this type of project create the kind of high-tech jobs in high-growth industries so often needed to kickstart and sustain a modern economy.    But Beit and his partners sensed an opportunity. Newark\u2019s relatively cheap land prices and its proximity to New York City\u201420 minutes or so by train\u2014had attracted new investors and development to the city for the past decade. But there was still a \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d in the center of Newark\u2019s downtown, a circle of blight ringed by the city\u2019s more established businesses and government institutions. What this urban abyss needed most, Beit thought, was middle-income earners willing to live and spend money there.    OPTICS: An Education in Downtown Newark: A day at one of the city's charter schools (Click to view gallery.)    Soaring real estate prices in Manhattan pushed people to Brooklyn, then over the Hudson River into Hoboken and Jersey City. Newark, Beit wagered, would be next, and teachers would lead the way.    ***    People have been trickling out of Newark for years. The exodus started during the 1950s, with the advent of better transportation and the emergence of suburbs that fueled the American dream of home ownership. L. Bamberger & Co., Kresge\u2019s and Hahne & Company\u2014the iconic \u201cBig Three\u201d department stores that in the 1920s and 1930s lured crowds that rivaled Times Square\u2019s\u2014began to sag.    But the watershed for the city came on July 12, 1967, in what the late Rutgers University professor and historian Clement Price called the city\u2019s most defining and most misunderstood moment. On that day, a crowd descended on a police precinct to protest the arrest and beating of a black cabbie by white officers. Protesters looted and tossed Molotov cocktails and police moved in.    Charter school principal Irene Hall, at left, and teachers Stephany Copeland and husband Tyler Dockins, right, in their Teachers Village apartments. | Mark Peterson/Redux for Politico Magazine    All told, 26 people were killed, and over 1,000 were wounded over five days.

There were others with even bigger dreams for Newark\u2019s revival, men like Harry Grant, who proposed a 121-story tower near city hall in 1986. It would have been the tallest building in the world at the time and part of a project Grant called, without irony, \u201cRenaissance Mall.\u201d Grant went bankrupt and the mall sat half-finished for nearly two decades. It was torn down in 2005 and replaced by the Prudential Center, which was completed in 2007 through a private-public consortium.    \u201cThat Harry Grant project was an individual\u2019s dream, and it reminds us of how individual dreams often fall,\u201d then-Mayor Sharpe James saidin 2005.

aV Matt Popola\u2019s family has owned Paddy\u2019s Service Station in Newark\u2019s Ironbound neighborhood for more than 80 years. Popola\u2019s father was part of a generation of men who manned the rooftops of their homes and businesses, some of them armed, to save the neighborhood from destruction during the 1967 riots that scarred Newark. Now 48 years old, Popola looks to another son of the post-\u201967 generation to save Newark in another time of crisis. Spoiler: It\u2019s not Cory Booker.    \u201cWhen Cory Booker came around, I said to myself \u2018Here\u2019s a guy who believes in us. He\u2019s young. He\u2019s good looking. He\u2019s a rock star,\u2019\u201d Popola says. \u201cBut he\u2019s no better than any other politician. He left Newark high and dry. As soon as something better came along, he was gone.\u201d Popola also hasn\u2019t forgotten the hikes in commercial property taxes and cuts in the police force that occurred during Booker\u2019s watch. \u201cNow, Cory Booker comes off like a playboy,\u201d Popola adds, \u201cand Ras Baraka seems more like a businessman.\u201d   Story Continued Below   To which some people might respond, Ras Who?    Baraka succeeded Booker\u2014he of the golden resume, with boxes checked for Stanford, Yale, Rhodes Scholar. After serving almost two terms as mayor of New Jersey\u2019s largest city and garnering more than 1.5 million Twitter followers, Booker moved politically up and out of the city, winning the 2013 special election to replace the late U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.).    Baraka may not be the media darling that his predecessor was, but he\u2019s slowly emerging from Booker\u2019s shadow. And he has some in this city betting he\u2019ll be the better mayor.    Baraka is the son of the late poet and activist Amiri Baraka, an iconic figure of the 1967 Newark civil disturbances, which were termed a race riot by some and a socioeconomic rebellion by others. Baraka is a published poet himself and has contributed a spoken-word intro to the critically acclaimed album The Score by the hip hop group The Fugees. While building a career in education that led to the principal\u2019s spot at Newark\u2019s Central High School, Baraka honed his political chops by serving on the city council.    Poet. Principal. Pol\u2014not exactly the typical trajectory for those seeking public office.    But in other ways, aspects of Baraka\u2019s career are familiar to students of the American political game. Ras Baraka has a strong personal and political bond with his brother, Amiri Baraka, Jr., who served as his campaign manager in the fiercely fought 2014 Newark mayoral race that brought the brothers to power. Now, Amiri is Ras\u2019 chief of staff, an urban New Jersey version of Bobby Kennedy as fraternal enforcer to Ras\u2019 Jack.    If Baraka is to turn Newark into Camelot, he faces problems endemic to many American cities\u2014high violent crime and unemployment rates among them. And, as he closes in on the end of his first year in office, he also faces problems related to another New Jersey politician who, like Booker, has sought the national spotlight: Republican Gov. Chris Christie.    Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at an environmental event in Newark in March. | Mark Peterson/Redux for Politico Magazine    Newark has been at the center of an ongoing battle stemming in part from Christie\u2019s education policies. Christie stood alongside then-Mayor Booker and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2010 when the social media magnate pledged $100 million to revamp Newark\u2019s schools, which were placed under state control in 1995. It is unclear whether the dramatic attempt to jump-start school reform in Newark has had any lasting effect. Even more unclear in the ultimate impact of the controversial \u201cOne Newark\u201d school reorganization scheme, put in place by Newark Schools Superintendent Cami Anderson in September. (But a lengthy piece in The New Yorker last year certainly casts doubt on the program\u2019s success.)     Christie\u2019s decision to appoint Anderson to head Newark\u2019s public schools in 2011 has created what many see as an educational standoff. The \u201cOne Newark\u201d plan, meant to improve the city\u2019s public education system by increasing students\u2019 school choices and expanding charter schools, has left many parents frustrated and confused. Despite widespread community protests, including from Baraka, the Christie administration recently renewed Anderson\u2019s contract\u2014and rewarded her with a pay raise.    Although somewhat stymied on education issues, Baraka has found opportunity in another Christie-generated crisis.   What Works  By JASON NARK   While the governor has travelled the nation and the world to drum up support for a potential 2016 presidential run, New Jersey\u2019s fiscal situation has grown so dire that \u201cTaps\u201d could serve as its soundtrack. New Jersey is staring down long-term budgetary woes such as the troubled state pension and benefit system and an evaporating transportation fund, with the result that cities around the Garden State are recognizing that the funding stream once provided by the state has all but run dry.

aV Tears stream down Lakeisha Jeffries\u2019 face and over her chin onto a few dried splotches of bright indoor wall paint. Words falter and she apologizes for the surge of gratitude. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s so \u2026 I can\u2019t talk about it \u2026 My whole life \u2026 changed.\u201d    Jeffries is part of a work crew renovating a house in Glenville, one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, on a street of empty lots and abandoned wrecks of homes, many strewn with trash or old tires and crudely bandaged with plywood and sheets of plastic. It\u2019s a place that for decades has seemed unalterable no matter how many government programs and well-meaning philanthropies got involved; a place where abject poverty, joblessness and crime reinforce the racism in a city long divided, and where infants still die at a higher rate than almost anywhere else in the country.   Story Continued Below   Unemployed for most of her life and reliant on her mother, friends and food stamps, Jeffries scraped by as her husband took care of their eight children, squeezed into small digs in Cleveland public housing. \u201cThose were some dark days,\u201d she recalls.    Now, at age 33, she is a crew chief for a worker-owned cooperative in which she owns an equity stake, from which she receives health insurance, and through which she may soon buy a subsidized home of her own\u2014\u201csomething I can say is mine.\u201d    The cooperative is a key component in an audacious experiment aimed at dissolving a decades-old divide between an area known as University Circle and the six destitute neighborhoods, including Glenville, that surround it.    University Circle is home to the sumptuous and sprawling institutions of the privileged: Severance Hall, the Georgian temple of the famous Cleveland Orchestra; the Cleveland Museum of Art, the marble residence of Rodins and Renoirs; Case Western Reserve University; and within a half-mile of each other, University Hospitals, one of Ohio\u2019s biggest employers, and the Cleveland Clinic, so globally eminent that celebrities and sheikhs jet in for bypass surgery. For decades now, University Circle has been a destination for the mostly affluent commuters, scholars, concert-goers and museum visitors who parachute in and then head back to their far-flung homes, while seeming inaccessible to tens of thousands of people living only blocks away.   Business and community leaders are giving poor neighborhoods in Cleveland the chance to succeed.  \u000a                                WATCH: A Cleveland Renaissance?       Today, though, University Circle\u2019s boosters describe a community where felons are getting jobs, hospitals are hiring from the neighborhoods, dilapidated houses are being refurbished and banks are making loans to collectives of the previously unemployed. A \u201chealth technology corridor\u201d has given birth to 170 startups, many located in new office space on brownfields cleansed of contamination. \u201cUptown\u201d is hot: A new retail and residential real estate development bustles with students, their parents, doctors, and people from the nearby neighborhoods who dine, shop and attend concerts before walking back to their homes.    The Cleveland program, now entering its 10th year, expands on preexisting models\u2014from recent initiatives in West Philadelphia to a priest\u2019s campaign to empower Basque workers after the Spanish Civil War. It has been in place long enough that it has seen its share of successes and experienced invaluable setbacks that have forced a rethinking of approaches when economic realities didn\u2019t align with the vision. Buffalo, Atlanta, Amarillo and at least a dozen other cities are closely monitoring the program.    Is Cleveland really coming back? Is the Greater University Circle Initiative, as the grand experiment is known, a solution for other cities? \u201cHold on,\u201d says Ronn Richard, a former diplomat and CIA executive widely credited as the catalyst for Cleveland program. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hype it. It\u2019s not a national model yet.\u201d    ***    Cleveland is the second most impoverished city in the country, after Detroit, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated as recently as 2014 that one in every three people and half of all children live below the poverty line. Both cities have suffered from industrial decline, suburban flight and the distressed neighborhoods left behind, conditions worsened by the housing crisis of 2008 and the recession. Forbes, ranking the nation\u2019s cities five years ago, called Cleveland the \u201cmost miserable.\u201d    OPTICS: Saving Cleveland's Poorest Neighborhood (click to view gallery) | Mark Peterson/Redux    The six neighborhoods targeted by the Greater University Circle Initiative are among the worst of the worst, with one in every three houses vacant, and one in every four residents unemployed. Shops are shuttered and factories with broken windows are reminders of the Rust Belt\u2019s decline. As of 2012, the median income for a household in these neighborhoods was $18,500, which has barely budged for years. Glenville, where Jeffries lives, is almost entirely African-American, and is where in 1968 a deadly shootout between the police and an armed militant group triggered a rash of fires and looting. Two years earlier in nearby Hough, riots spurred by racial tensions between white business owners, the predominantly white police force and African-American residents led to six days of violence. Such events leave scars, and the disparities between the haves and have-nots are particularly pronounced where the main avenue from downtown, Euclid Avenue, intersects University Circle.    The strange separation between the ivory tower establishment and the beleaguered neighborhoods shocked Richard when he arrived in 2003 to head the Cleveland Foundation, an organization with around $2 billion in assets dedicated to \u201cthe greater good of citizens.\u201d Raised in Washington, D.C., to parents involved in the civil rights movement, he had traveled the world as a State Department diplomat and taken risks in R&D as an executive at Panasonic and at In-Q-Tel, the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s venture capital fund that invests in data-mining and other secretive technologies. \u201cIt was so weird seeing Euclid boarded up. In any other city, that would be prime territory,\u201d Richard says. \u201cCan you imagine if Pennsylvania Avenue [in Washington] were like that? It was so depressing.\u201d   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Dan Moulthrop   His wife, Bess, an artist, had been teaching minority students at the Cleveland School for the Arts, minutes from the art museum with its banner advertising the price of admission, \u201cfree.\u201d When she assigned students to compare elements in three paintings there, one of them said, \u201cMiss Bess? Where\u2019s the art museum?\u201d Another student knew, but volunteered that \u201cit\u2019s not for us.\u201d That night, returning home, her husband opened the garage door to find her waiting there, upset. \u201cSo? What are you going to do about it?\u201d she challenged him. The following Monday, Richard summoned his troops at the foundation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of that invisible barrier,\u201d he instructed.    ***    In West Philadelphia, the outlines of a powerful new approach awaited discovery by Clevelanders. Judith Rodin, then president of the University of Pennsylvania, had responded to a period of crisis over the safety of its students and staff\u2014and a socioeconomic divide\u2014by forging new bonds with the poor neighborhoods just west of the school. Drexel University, also in Philadelphia, embarked on a similar project. As in Cleveland, wealth and inner city poverty abutted at the border, with a collision that threatened expansion, security and a sense of community. By 2002, half a billion dollars in university and private investment transformed and blurred the wall between town and gown, while Penn systematically shifted nearly $100 million of procurement each year to businesses in distressed West Philly neighborhoods.

aV Come to Cleveland for a day and you\u2019re likely to hear about The Renaissance: LeBron James is back; downtown development is booming; planning for the 2016 Republican National Convention is underway and prompting a major public facelift.    But stick around, and you\u2019ll learn about something else: that economic growth seldom seems to reach any of the city\u2019s poor, predominantly African-American neighborhoods. You\u2019ll learn about a race problem that long predates the November deaths of 12-year-old Tamir Rice and Tanisha Anderson at the hands of white police officers. It\u2019s a race problem that is bigger than the U.S. Department of Justice findings of systemic excessive use of force by the mostly white police force serving a majority African-American city.   Story Continued Below   As chief executive of the City Club of Cleveland\u2014a 102-year-old institution created to foster dialogue about local, national and international issues\u2014I often find myself in the midst of conversations about the city. So when I\u2014a white guy\u2014am in a meeting about policing or witnessing the inability of some white people here to understand why Tamir\u2019s death catalyzed such vocal and visible protests, I remember what a divided city this really is. And when I pull on those threads and look at the gulf between, say, African-Americans who believe the criminal justice system is rigged against them and whites who don\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t just follow police orders, I wonder if our longstanding inability to confront our collective history, unconscious bigotry and the deep structural inequities they feed could undermine the exciting story of Cleveland\u2019s rebirth. And then I think, what if we could confront it? What if we could actually overcome it?    ***    It is the beginning of Black History Month, and Blaine Griffin is in his office in the basement of Cleveland\u2019s City Hall. While many departments in this building are quiet places where functionaries silently file and execute the work of municipal government, the Community Relations Board is not such a place. There is high volume conversation, laughter, loud greetings. Griffin is the director of the board. He closes the door to his office. \u201cSorry about the noise,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re community,\u201d in a way that, along with a slight grin, seems to explain it all.    At this moment, Griffin has one of the most difficult jobs in the city. He is at the center of the conversations that are informing the consent decree that the DOJ and the mayor\u2019s office are negotiating to respond to the excessive force findings. He is the man tasked with keeping people at the table, even when community members are contemplating a recall of the mayor. Griffin is a self-described \u201cbig black man\u201d and as he talks, he holds his arms open wide as if he is the rope in a tug of war. His arms seem to encompass the whole of his office. \u201cPeople want everybody to pick a side, but it\u2019s not about picking a side right now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to get to the next level. We have a historic opportunity to have these conversations.\u201d    Griffin and his colleague Peter Whitt, an African-American community relations facilitator, talk about the obstacles and challenges African-Americans face, the divisions in the community. Whitt points to the structure of communities as individuals experience them.    \u201cPolitically, if you don\u2019t have a network of individuals who can help you get a job, a network of individuals who can connect you with opportunity, you\u2019re stuck,\u201d Whitt says. \u201cYou\u2019re asking, \u2018Where\u2019s my economic ladder? Where\u2019s my opportunity?\u2019 And no one can answer that right now.\u201d    Griffin underscores this by pointing out that Cleveland was ranked last year among the top five most segregated cities in America. The prevailing characteristics of Cleveland\u2019s near East side are intense poverty and a largely African-American population. Griffin says this has created an insular enclave that real opportunity seldom reaches.    Nevertheless, he points out that this community went through a historic integration of the schools when the NAACP sued the Cleveland schools and the State of Ohio in 1973. The success of that is debatable, but today, some district schools are actually attracting white families from the suburbs. Five years prior to that historic lawsuit, city voters elected the nation\u2019s first African-American mayor of a major American city\u2014Carl Stokes. \u201cHe set the stage for President Obama,\u201d Griffin says.    Griffin and Whitt say they believe Cleveland can have this dialogue. To do it, though, they need something: \u201cWhite males,\u201d Whitt says.    ***    Rob Falls owns one of Cleveland\u2019s largest and most successful communications firms. It bears his name and it serves national clients (Moen, Duck Tape, Susan G. Komen Foundation). He also sits on the local host committee that successfully wooed the 2016 Republican convention to Cleveland. He understands civic fabric and the narratives that can either keep that fabric strong or tear it apart. He says the issue of deep structural racial biases is \u201cthe silent elephant in the room.\u201d    \u201cPeople give it lip service,\u201d he says. \u201cThey leave a meeting and nothing happens.\u201d    Falls is a white guy. He\u2019s originally from Detroit, and he\u2019s been thinking about this knot of issues since he returned to Detroit after working in D.C. as a young man in the Reagan era.    \u201cIn Detroit, every night the lead story was about race. Here [in Cleveland], I see a much greater acceptance and integration at so many levels. And at the professional level, Cleveland\u2019s making headway. But there are issues,\u201d he says, and he lists the same indicators many do\u2014education, single parent households, teenage pregnancy, poverty.    He imagines an ongoing dialogue among corporate and civic leaders\u2014the top echelons of Cleveland\u2014about these issues, and he envisions a kind of safe space that allows people to speak openly, the kind that Whitt and Griffin have worked to create in their neighborhood-based sessions.    \u201cThe leadership in Cleveland, black and white, has been better than I\u2019ve seen in any city. There\u2019s a camaraderie that looks beyond skin color. If that leadership and attitude can continue and help to permeate the next level down, do I think we have a chance to make a difference? Yeah, I do.\u201d    Falls isn\u2019t the only white male CEO thinking along these lines.    Akram Boutros runs MetroHealth, Cleveland\u2019s public hospital system. He came to town from New York in 2013 and set about restoring internal morale and public confidence in the beleaguered institution. An Egyptian Coptic immigrant, Boutros quickly developed a reputation as a big thinker in a town full of pretty big thinkers in the health sector and as one of the warmest and most magnanimous CEOs in the city. The leader of the biggest provider of care for the poor, Boutros sees his job shining a spotlight on social injustice and economic inequality.    This month, Boutros began a series of appearances on public panels and in keynotes in which he plans on issuing very clear challenges to people in a position to support and implement systemic change.    \u201cTo break through the cycle of hunger requires a systemic effort to deal with dozens and dozens of obstacles,\u201d he explains. By way of example he talks about the now-viral story about the 56-year-old Detroit man who walks 21 miles to and from work because his car died and he hasn\u2019t had the money to replace it. You or I would never be in that position, he says. That\u2019s not a hard luck story. That\u2019s about racial inequity and a lack of access to real opportunity. That\u2019s the work that needs to be done, he says, but \u201cno one wants to support that work because there\u2019s no direct benefit. [Many of Cleveland\u2019s most affluent residents] think, \u2018I can give my money over here and then I\u2019ll get my name on the building.\u2019\u201d     Dan Moulthrop is chief executive of The City Club of Cleveland, the nation\u2019s oldest continuous free-speech forum and an award-winning former public radio show host in Cleveland.

aV When you think about great places to grow old and retire, New York City doesn\u2019t immediately spring to mind. It\u2019s outrageously expensive. It can be particularly dangerous for the elderly: Being struck by a vehicle is the second leading cause of injury-related death for seniors. The subway, which opened its first subterranean trains in 1904, is a system mainly reached by long, crowded stairways into the underground\u2014not exactly senior-friendly. And although the city is no longer notorious for its murder rate\u2014annual homicides dropped from 2,262 in 1990 to just 332 in 2014, according to the New York Police Department\u2014areas like East Harlem, with one of the city\u2019s largest populations of low-income seniors, still have comparatively high levels of violent crime. And\u2014to state the obvious\u2014it gets cold, really cold.    But you won\u2019t see Norma Negron moving to Florida or Arizona anytime soon.   Story Continued Below   Negron starts her day with a dance choreography class. That is, unless she has her Zumba workout. Or her doll-making lessons. The chatty 69-year-old retired homemaker says she would take guitar lessons, quilting and painting, but those classes conflict with her salsa group and with a multimedia workshop where she makes jewelry, greeting cards and pillows.    It wasn\u2019t always this way. Negron fell into a deep depression after her grandson was killed, sometimes not leaving the house except to run essential errands. She was reluctant to accept a girlfriend\u2019s invitation to visit the senior center in her neighborhood, she says, because she thought she would only find \u201celderly people sitting around drawing; it wasn\u2019t going to be any fun. But when I got here, it was totally different.    \u201cIt really, really has changed my life,\u201d she says of the Carter Burden/Leonard Covello Senior Center where she takes classes. \u201cI love it. And I would be here every day if I didn\u2019t have stuff to do at home.\u201d    Home for Negron is East Harlem, the bustling, ethnically diverse neighborhood just north of Central Park, where the smell of shrimp fried rice mixes with the sound of Latin music. The center\u2014on the outskirts of East Harlem\u2014is one of New York City\u2019s 251 places for older residents to have a meal, play billiards, tinker with computers or learn Chinese fan dancing. It\u2019s just part of what the city that never sleeps is doing to accommodate its growing population of older residents who, like 90 percent of their contemporaries across the country, would rather age in place in their own homes.    New York is \u201cone of the global leaders\u201d in adapting to the needs of older residents, says John Beard, the Geneva-based director of the Department of Aging and Life Course for the World Health Organization.    In 2007, WHO initiated an ambitious project to encourage age-friendly cities, with a range of goals that could apply to every metropolis in the world. The details included tangible things like non-slippery pavements, buildings with elevators, easy access to public toilets, and plenty of outdoor seating, along with fuzzier concepts like \u201crespect and social inclusion.\u201d New York was the first to join WHO\u2019s global network of age-friendly cities.    A glimpse into the lives of New York City's seniors and how the city is working to hear their voices and meet their needs.  \u000a                                WATCH: East Harlem: New York City's Senior Hotspot  \u201cThere was a genuine attempt to consult with older people in the city\u201d on what mattered to them, Beard says. In addition, the city drew from a number of different municipal departments, including parks, health and police, to figure out \u201cwhat slipped through the net,\u201d he says. \u201cArising from that, the whole world has been interested.\u201d    What it\u2019s meant for New York is a slew of 59 initiatives, from the creation of pedestrian \u201csafety islands\u201d (so that slower walkers can have a place to stop if they only make it halfway across the street before the light changes) to seniors-only hours at public swimming pools to the use of off-duty school buses to take seniors grocery shopping or to a laundromat. The program is jointly steered and funded by the New York Academy of Medicine, the New York City Council and the mayor\u2019s office.    The improvements have been pushed, in large part, by the reality of a graying world. As birth rates drop and people live longer, many countries in the next 20 years are going to have as many citizens over the age of 65 as they have schoolchildren. \u201cMany people think this is just the rich world,\u201d Beard says. \u201cBut some of the most rapid aging is occurring in lower and middle-income countries like China, Vietnam, Iran and Chile.\u201d WHO reports that the global population of people over the age of 60 was 11 percent in 2006 but will reach 22 percent in 2050.   \u000aOPTICS: How Does a 73-Year-Old Live in Manhattan? A day in the life of one of New York's super-active seniors. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux   Some 1 million people over the age of 65 call New York City home, according to the academy. And that number will only continue to grow as baby boomers head into retirement age. By 2030, the number of older New Yorkers is projected to be 1.5 million, according to the academy.    In addition to being a leader in WHO\u2019s age-friendly cities initiative, New York has gone a step further by creating what it calls \u201caging improvement districts,\u201d where many of the age-friendly initiatives are concentrated. The city started pilot programs in 2010 in three neighborhoods\u2014East Harlem, the Upper West Side and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.    City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who represents East Harlem, says the academy of medicine approached her and asked for her support. \u201cI said, \u2018It sounds great.\u2019 Anything we can do to make life easier for seniors, to improve their quality of life\u201d is good. In October, Mark-Viverito announced that the city would expand the aging improvement districts to 10 more city neighborhoods, with the goal of having every city district covered by 2018.   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Colby Hamilton  Ruth Finkelstein, who helped launch the program, says that, for seniors, these districts are about nothing less than \u201creclaiming your neighborhood and reclaiming your world.\u201d And, in that process, \u201cpushing the boundaries of the world out, out, out.\u201d    ***    Many of the changes in New York probably wouldn\u2019t have happened without Finkelstein. \u201cOne of my jokes was that my measure of success would be to meet in a dark alley an age-friendly initiative I\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d she says over lunch near her new office at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health.

aV Bill de Blasio should be having the best year of his political life.    The local economy in this city of 8.5 million is doing well. School test scores are up ever so slightly. The city\u2019s crime statistics are headed in the right direction: murders down four percent from last year, robbery down 14.1 percent, felony assaults down nearly one percentage point.   Story Continued Below   The freshman Democratic mayor has achieved a host of policy goals\u2014from raising the local minimum wage for certain workers to extending paid sick leave to thousands and implementing his signature universal pre-kindergarten program\u2014that most liberal politicians only dream of.    And the plague of locusts some feared would descend on Wall Street with the election of an avowed progressive, the lover of Sandinistas, hasn\u2019t materialized.    \u201cIf you take away the police stuff, I think he had a good year,\u201d said George Arzt, a mainstay in city politics since his time as spokesman for Ed Koch, who also happened to work with de Blasio in the Clinton camp. \u201cI think he\u2019s the first mayor to come in with an agenda to change the city. I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d    And yet there have been missteps and challenges, with the police being the latest and possibly most explosive. The city\u2019s police unions have been in open revolt since two of their own were murdered in a squad car in December, in apparent retaliation for the death of Eric Garner at the hands of police. De Blasio is also gearing up to battle a particularly miffed group of Republicans who now (again) control one of the state\u2019s two legislative chambers.    And though de Blasio clearly has foes, a close look at some of the mayor\u2019s troubles suggests that the person most likely to derail Bill de Blasio may be Bill de Blasio himself.    ***    De Blasio blazed into office with an historic landslide victory and an unabashedly liberal agenda.    When he took over a year ago, de Blasio quickly went to work on his top item, an ambitious plan to provide 73,250 free pre-kindergarten slots by the upcoming 2015-2016 school year. The mayor promised phase one would be complete by Year One: 13,845 new seats, spread between public school and community-based organizations, by the start of the school year in September. This was no easy \u201cstroke of the pen achievement,\u201d notes David Birdsell, dean of the School of Public Affairs at City University of New York\u2019s Baruch College.    \u201cThere had been some skepticism about the mayor\u2019s ability, and the administration\u2019s ability, to follow through on something more complicated, that involved actually moving people, things, and budgets,\u201d Birdsell said. Universal pre-Kindergarten \u201cwas a great test of that capacity, and it was a successful one.\u201d    Not that de Blasio\u2019s path to universal pre-K was flawless. The mayor wanted Albany to authorize a tax increase on the city\u2019s highest income earners to pay the estimated $1.7 billion cost of the first five years of the program. The proposal initially fell flat in Albany, with both fellow Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislators\u2014in particular, upstate and suburban Senate Republicans\u2014balking at the idea of raising taxes in an election year. In the end, Cuomo presented a plan to essentially fund the city\u2019s needs through the state budget. It was a victory for de Blasio, but one he appeared unwilling to claim: De Blasio countered that anything other than a tax-funded plan was unacceptable. Some might call it biting the hand that feeds you when you\u2019re starving.    \u201cHe played that out to a fault,\u201d said Birdsell.    De Blasio\u2019s refusal to accept victory\u2014maybe not the victory he wanted, but certainly the victory he needed\u2014showed at best a political naivete (hard to imagine for as seasoned a political operative as de Blasio), or, at worst, an overestimation of his political might. At the time, the mayor was fond of talking about his mandate, of the 73 percent of city voters who\u2019d sided with him, of the rising progressive vision\u2014both locally and nationally\u2014of ending inequality through a new age of liberal governance. (Never mind that only 24 percent of eligible city voters showed up.)    Talk to the mayor\u2019s people and they shrug off the dustup between de Blasio and Cuomo. The mayor\u2019s inflexibility, they say, was the kind of hardball needed to get things done in a state capital renowned for its dysfunction.    Beyond universal pre-K, de Blasio shepherded legislation extending paid sick leave to some 500,000 New Yorkers, signed into law a provision creating municipal ID cards for residents, including undocumented immigrants. Through an executive order, he single-handedly increased the minimum wage for employees of companies that receive at least $1 million in city subsidies. After going years without contracts, more than 71 percent of the city\u2019s public sector workforce has signed new labor agreements, which the administration promises will remain budget friendly through mandated healthcare cost savings. There\u2019s the Vision Zero plan to bring pedestrian deaths down that included installation of city-wide speed cameras and the lowering of the speed limit. De Blasio can also take credit for assuaging the anger of many struggling New Yorkers by rebooting stalled reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.    ***    Even in moments of crisis, de Blasio\u2019s team says planning played a key role. According to Peter Ragone, a top de Blasio aide and one of the most trusted voices in City Hall right now, de Blasio\u2019s approach can be traced to the philosophy of legendary UCLA basketball Coach John Wooden: \u201cFailing to prepare is preparing to fail.\u201d De Blasio repeats these words, Ragone says, \u201cmany times a week.\u201d   What Works  By DEBRA BRUNO   \u201cYou plan as much as you can for the things you want to do, because then the things that happen to you\u2014because things happen to you here\u2014when those occur, you\u2019re better to prepared to deal with them, because all the other aspects of government are being run effectively,\u201d Ragone says during a New Year\u2019s Eve interview.    Leading up to the Ebola scare in the city, de Blasio told his aides to stop thinking as if it might happen and start thinking that it would happen.    \u201cWe moved the entire government for two months preparing for it,\u201d Ragone says, referring to the city\u2019s crafting of a plan of action for first responders, HAZMAT units and public hospitals in the event a case was reported.    When it finally came\u2014in the form of a New York physician recently returned from Africa\u2014de Blasio looked like the calm statesman in the crisis, while Cuomo and Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vacillated between various draconian measures, such as forced quarantines, before falling in behind de Blasio\u2019s practical solutions for containing what turned out to be a single case of the disease.

aV To understand Kentucky politics you have to understand this: When it comes to coal, there is no difference between Democrats and Republicans. There is no red Kentucky or blue Kentucky. There is only charcoal black. And Kentucky politics is a coal miner\u2019s daughter.    With roughly 61,000 jobs directly or indirectly linked to the industry and some $4 billion in annual revenue, the state\u2019s devotion to coal is all but carved in stone. One law in the state, for example, allows energy companies to cap renewable energy to one percent of production, saving the remaining 99 percent for coal.   Story Continued Below   \u201cThe coal folks want people to burn coal,\u201d says Wallace McMullen, the conservation chair for the Sierra Club\u2019s Kentucky chapter. \u201cIn Kentucky, the coal-state mentality has equally blinded them all\u201d\u2014Democrats as well as Republicans.    Which means when Louisville\u2019s civic leaders try to improve the city\u2019s environmental health, it\u2019s not just Republicans in Washington like incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell standing in the way, but Democrats in the state capital of Frankfort, too.    Just ask John Yarmuth, Louisville\u2019s congressman since 2006. Yarmuth is a vocal advocate for alternative energy, as opposed to someone like Alison Lundergan Grimes, who quite visibly advocated for coal without mentioning alternatives during her unsuccessful campaign to unseat McConnell.    Yarmuth, the only Kentucky congressman endorsed by the Sierra Club, won his re-election handily and outperformed Grimes in Louisville by 12,295 votes \u2014 and his Congressional district doesn\u2019t even include all of Jefferson County. Many of those Yarmuth-but-not-Grimes voters held the environment as their chief concern, and were upset with Grimes for trying to be more pro-coal than McConnell. When she said in her gun-themed TV ad that she \u201cdisagree[d] with Obama on coal and guns,\u201d that wasn\u2019t some political half-truth, as her critics and some of her supporters wanted to believe.    \u201cOf all my supporters, environmentalists were the most concerned with Alison,\u201d Yarmuth says. \u201cMore so than African-Americans, LGBT, labor or immigrant groups,\u201d because coal was one of the few policies Grimes took a stand on. And for environmentalists, it was on the wrong side.    \u201cI hardly saw the point in voting for someone that almost stubbornly refused to stand out as anything other than \u2018not Mitch,\u2019\u201d said Meghan Levins, a chef in Louisville\u2019s burgeoning farm-to-table scene. She voted for Yarmuth, but not Grimes. \u201cThe coal issue really is a sticking point with me because I think it\u2019s so ridiculous to imply that there is such a thing as \u2018clean coal.\u2019\u201d    Yarmuth hasn\u2019t been hurt politically by his pro-environmental positions. His views are in line with voters like Levins, who represents Louisville\u2019s political base and favor a sustainable energy policy at the risk of \u201ca speculative increase in price,\u201d as Yarmuth puts it.    \u201cPart of what we deal with in Kentucky is the coal culture, which is a larger political factor than the economics of coal,\u201d he adds. In Yarmuth\u2019s estimation, voters in the coal-mining regions see advocacy for alternative energy as \u201can attack on their way of life,\u201d which is \u201cmore impressionistic than dollars and cents.\u201d   What Works  By ERICA PETERSON   This emotional response to the culture of coal is what coal operators leverage for political might in election seasons. Democrats in Kentucky either support this message or remain too afraid of it to challenge it in statewide races. This is something that national activists have difficulty understanding about Kentucky politics: any elected Democrat outside of Louisville is as pro-coal as any climate change-denying Republican.  Grimes is a prime example. Grimes\u2019s defense of coal wasn\u2019t just some last-minute campaign stunt; her family\u2019s relationship with coal goes back decades. Her father, Jerry Lundergan, was the chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party under Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, who once proposed building a 41-story skyscraper in Lexington called the World Coal Center. Before that, Gov. Julian Carroll testified before Congress about how important strip mining was to Kentucky\u2019s economy, and Kentucky\u2019s current governor, Steve Beshear, sued the EPA in 2010 for blocking state-issued coal mining permits. All three governors are Democrats.

aV Maria Koetter squints into the sun and points toward the southeast, surveying Louisville from atop one of its tallest buildings.    \u201cLook at that!\u201d she says.   Story Continued Below   Sprawled before us are the elements that have shaped this city of 750,000. The Ohio River rolls muddy blue, straddled by bridges and dissected by barges that crawl through the watery thoroughfare that gave life to Louisville as a commercial center. Distant hills lush with fall foliage encircle the city, creating a basin that serves as Louisville\u2019s foundation. Traffic rumbles in the distance on several of the major interstates that cross the city, and two coal-fired power plants belch out smoke in the horizon.    Closer in, a more stark landscape, largely stripped of nature, dominated by the man-made: The city center is marked by mid- and high-rise buildings and wide streets originally built for streetcars, but now functioning as six-lane arteries clogged with cars. Parking lots\u2014dozens of privately-owned, half-empty parking lots\u2014scar the city center. The occasional tree seems to pop out of the pavement and struggles to breathe.    \u201cI think you could probably go to a tall building in many cities and see a boundary where you\u2019re going from the dense urban core to a more residential area,\u201d says Koetter, who is Louisville\u2019s first director of sustainability. What Koetter is describing are the physical conditions that give rise to a phenomenon known as an urban heat island, where a city\u2019s center experiences significantly hotter temperatures than its less-developed surroundings. Here\u2019s how it works: During the hottest times of year, dark or paved areas\u2014whether on roofs or on the ground\u2014soak up and store heat. These surfaces continue to release this heat throughout the day and night, preventing the area from cooling down after sunset. Patchy urban tree canopies struggle to clean the air and keep temperatures down. The urban heat islands don\u2019t cause air pollution, but make the effects of pollution worse.    Heat islands aren\u2019t limited to southern or subtropical cities or places like Miami or Phoenix, known to have scorching summers. Denver, Portland, Ore., Minneapolis and Seattle are among the top ten cities in the nation with the most intense urban heat islands, according to a study released earlier this year by Climate Central, a nonprofit news organizations that reports on climate matters.    Brian Stone Jr. knows this phenomenon well. Stone is one of the country\u2019s foremost experts in urban heat; he has made a career of literally taking the temperature of communities. \u201cCities essentially create their own climates,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the urban heat island effect is one way to measure that. There\u2019s a heat island effect, really, in every large city.\u201d    But in few places is it felt more than in Louisville, sometimes to deadly effect.    Video: How America's Fastest Warming City is Going Green. | Photo by Mark Peterson/Redux    Stone\u2019s research found that Louisville is warming at the fastest rate of any city in the nation, causing summer temperatures in the urban core to be up to 20 degrees higher than surrounding areas. And the gap continues to widen. On average, the disparity in temperatures between Louisville\u2019s city center and outer areas has been growing at a rate of 1.67 degrees each decade\u2014almost twice the rate of Phoenix, which is the second-fastest warming city.    For many Louisvillians, the effects are merely unpleasant or annoying. Residents crank up their air conditioners to battle the heat, raising their electricity bills. More coal is burned to keep up with peak demand, sending more pollution into the skies. As pollution and stagnant air bake in the sun, air quality worsens. The acres upon acres of paved surfaces in Louisville also exacerbate flooding issues and storm water runoff into the Ohio River. The storm water, warmed an extra 20 to 25 degrees by hot man-made surfaces, can cause significant disruptions of natural ecosystems.    But what has triggered Louisville\u2019s urgency to solve its urban heat island problem is that people\u2014especially the very young and very old and those with pre-existing health conditions\u2014are dying.    Heat consistently kills more people in the United States than any other form of extreme weather, including hurricanes, earthquakes and tornados, combined; nationally, about 658 people die every year because of exposure to excessive heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that doesn\u2019t take into account people who die of conditions like cardiovascular disease, which is exacerbated by the heat.    OPTICS: A Tree Grows in Louisville. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux    The problem is acute in Louisville. A 2012 study from the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that 39 people die every year in Louisville from heat-related causes. That means that a city with .2 percent of the U.S. population experiences roughly 6 percent of heat-related deaths every year. The problem is only likely to get worse. Unless Louisville\u2019s warming trend is reversed, the cumulative death toll could reach 18,000 by the end of this century\u2014a projection that far exceeds that for any other city.   What Works  By JAMES HIGDON   Louisville is taking this possibility seriously and, in the process, has been more aggressive and comprehensive than any other city in tackling the problem. Mayor Greg Fischer established a tree commission two years ago to reverse the city\u2019s dramatic loss of tree cover due to storms, disease and development. The city doled out $115,000 earlier this year for a tree assessment, which, in Fischer\u2019s words, will give Louisville a \u201cstreet and address level\u201d picture of the city\u2019s tree canopy. Since 2011, the city has planted more than 12,000 trees, some of it in conjunction with individuals, corporations and non-profits that have sprung up to help in the cause. It also secured private grants to fund a $135,000 study of the city\u2019s urban heat island. The analysis, which is scheduled to be done later this year, is the first of its kind in the country, and possibly the world, according to Stone, who is leading the project.

aV Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan said on Wednesday that although the chances of a government shutdown are \u201clow,\u201d he still has his eye on his office\u2019s shutdown countdown clock.    \u201cI believe [the chance] is still low, but \u2026 it is important that members of Congress know that this is the most important thing they can do in the next eight days,\u201d Donovan said during POLITICO Magazine\u2019s \u201cWhat Works Summit,\u201d which was moderated by POLITICO Editor Susan Glasser.   Story Continued Below   Donovan called the possibility of a shutdown \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d and said setting a budget is \u201cthe most basic job of government.\u201d    \u201cWe need to get this done, and I am hopeful that we\u2019ve heard from the leadership on both sides of the aisle that that\u2019s recognized that we need to keep moving, but we\u2019ve just heard that before,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cCongress needs to do its job and we need a funding bill for the rest of the year.\u201d    About sequestration, Donovan said it limits the federal government\u2019s ability to invest in infrastructure, education and housing.    \u201cThe sequestration and budget cuts that we\u2019ve been seeing are devastating for cities, and I\u2019ve made it very clear as budget director to say that we ought to end sequestration,\u201d Donovan said.    Donovan also announced on Wednesday a new set of grants for \u201cClimate Action Champions\u201d around the country.    \u201cThe federal government is in a unique position to help cities understand what\u2019s happening to the climate, how that\u2019s going to affect not just a whole city, but block by block,\u201d Donovan said.    The municipalities designated as \u201cClimate Action Champions\u201d are the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe, California; Boston; Broward County, Florida; Dubuque, Iowa; Knoxville, Tennessee; the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia; the Mid-America Regional Council of Kansas and Missouri; Minneapolis; Montpelier, Vermont; Oberlin, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; Salt Lake City; San Francisco; Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Michigan; Seattle; and The Sonoma County Regional Climate Protection Authority in California.    \u201cThese are communities that are leading already, but they\u2019ve been clear with us, saying, \u2018We need the federal government, and the federal government is relevant here,\u2019 and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to help these communities,\u201d Donovan said.    D.C.\u2019s Mayor-Elect Muriel Bowser said at the event that \u201cany grant funds that can help us use data to help improve is welcome.\u201d    \u201cWe know that we can do more in our lower income communities to improve energy efficiency and we want to make sure we do that,\u201d Bowser said.    The new round of grants will focus on identifying and recognizing local climate leaders and providing those areas with targeted federal support, according to OMB press aide Melanie Roussell Newman.    Shaun Donovan announces 'Climate Action Champions'    \u201cThe selected communities will benefit from facilitated peer-to-peer learning and mentorship and targeted support from a range of Federal programs,\u201d according to a statement. \u201cFurthermore, a coordinator will be provided to each Climate Action Champion to foster coordination and communication across the Federal agencies, national organizations, and foundations in support of the Champions.\u201d    Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker, who also spoke at the event and whose city is set to receive benefits from the grant, called addressing climate change \u201cincredibly important,\u201d and spoke of the grant as \u201canother example [of] this administration\u201d focusing federal dollars on helping specific communities.    The \u201cplace-based\u201d grants come after President Barack Obama ordered a 2009 review of federal programs and found that \u201cleveraging federal investments in an integrated way, on a regional scale, and in a particular place \u2026 [has] the most transformative impact\u201d in revitalizing cities, according to the White House website. The policy takes into account \u201cplace-specific triggers,\u201d existing systems and community growth to target specific cities, neighborhoods and regions where federal dollars will show the most impact.    \u201cThrough this place-based agenda, we can really be a different kind of partner to communities on this incredibly pressing issue of climate change,\u201d Donovan said.    Some of the cities set to receive the new grant already benefit from other place-based funding programs, such as the Sustainable Communities Initiative and Strong Cities, Strong Communities.    POLITICO Magazine\u2019s \u201cWhat Works Summit,\u201d sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and held at D.C.\u2019s Longview Gallery, took place before an audience of about 70, including mayors from around the country. The event was a culmination of a yearlong series of discussions focused on the future of cities and innovative ways that urban areas are tackling a range of issues.

aV I grew up in this city. Hated the police.\u201dTerrence Gordon pulls the unmarked Ford over to the curb and jerks the car into park. It\u2019s a late October afternoon, two days before Halloween, and the occasional pumpkin dots this inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood. He points to a modest two-story frame house\u2014his boyhood home in the \u201970s and \u201980s.    Gordon is 46 now, a deputy inspector with the Milwaukee Police Department, but he still remembers the strangers with badges who took pleasure in hazing black kids like him, who looked at people in this community as mere statistics, who didn\u2019t seem to care. He also remembers kids who never made it into adulthood because they got lost in the life of the streets. \u201cThree of my friends were killed in one summer\u20141988,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo were shot. One was strangled by her pimp. \u2026 So many kids grow up in neighborhoods with so many landmines. So much depends on where you happen to step.\u201d   Story Continued Below   That was when Milwaukee was Killwaukee, one of America\u2019s most dangerous cities as well as one of its poorest. When crack cocaine was just beginning to take hold and murders were about to hit an all-time high.    Gordon escaped, boosted by a mom who made sure her son stayed out of trouble, and eventually he realized that you can either live by the law or die flouting it. \u201cI knew things could change [within the police department] and I knew I could do more from the inside than standing on the outside and yelling with a sign,\u201d he says now.    His Milwaukee today is in fact a place that has evolved. Crime rates here\u2014as across the entire country\u2014have been falling for the past two decades, as new national crime statistics out this week from the Justice Department once again underscored, and the city is indeed is a safer place today. Violent crime is down by 11 percent since 2008, department records show; property crime has dipped by 30 percent.    But what makes Milwaukee stand out is not just that crime has fallen\u2014that\u2019s happened everywhere\u2014but that it has done so in a town where 28 percent of the population falls below the poverty level, far, far above the national average, and where conventional wisdom has it that the entrenched problems that go along with such long-lasting economic deprivation make it much harder to do anything about crime. The secret? A reforming police chief named Edward Flynn who\u2019s determined to make Milwaukee an unlikely textbook demonstration for just about every innovative policing idea out there: using Big Data to identify crime hot spots, throwing cops out of headquarters and back onto beats, deploying officers to the homes of recently released offenders to offer guidance on education and work possibilities.    Flynn is no mere quant in uniform. He talks with passion about \u201cnation-building at home,\u201d about the MPD as an \u201cagent of economic development,\u201d of his officers promoting \u201ccivic activity and democracy.\u201d    The stats, the technology, the cops back on the beat\u2014it \u201call ties together,\u201d says George Kelling, co-author of the famous \u201cBroken Windows\u201d theory of policing and a Milwaukee native who in 2007 helped persuade the city to hire Flynn. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a whole, coherent vision\u201d of what modern urban policing needs to be.    WATCH: The Streets of Milwaukee    ***    Ed Flynn didn\u2019t start off wanting to be a cop. He entered LaSalle University in 1966, after graduating high school in New Jersey, intent on becoming a history professor. But then he came across \u201cThe Challenge of Crime in a Free Society,\u201d the 1967 report from the Johnson administration\u2019s National Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, in the wake of the Watts riots. That \u201creally opened my eyes up to the critical importance of police in a democratic society, policing the negative consequences of poverty in our cities,\u201d Flynn says.    Years later, reading the 1982 \u201cBroken Windows\u201d study that Kelling wrote with the late political scientist James Q. Wilson, was another eye-opener. For Flynn the takeaway was that \u201cstabilizing neighborhoods means paying attention to the stuff that police think is a distraction from crime-fighting.\u201d    The \u201cBroken Windows\u201d idea\u2014take care of the little things and order will follow\u2014has been controversial. It came to national prominence in New York City during the mid-1990s under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The crackdown on squeegee men and turnstile jumpers was a precursor to a dramatic drop in crime, but there was then a backlash, with some critics claiming it exacerbates conflict between police and poor communities with its focus on seemingly minor problems.    Flynn disagrees.    OPTICS: Saving Killwaukee (Click to view gallery) | Mark Peterson/Redux    \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of imposing middle-class values on poor neighborhoods,\u201d he says. \u201cIt turns out that poor neighborhoods have the same damn values as the middle class: They want stability, order and peace and to not be afraid.\u201d    But much of this was still an abstraction for Flynn until the 1990s when he was appointed police chief in Chelsea, Mass. He won for his department some of the first community policing grants doled out by the Clinton administration, which had included funding for community policing programs in the 1994 crime bill.   What Works  By TOM HELD   \u201cI could see the power of investing our officers in neighborhoods with the purpose of building partnerships and developing the familiarity\u201d between the residents and the police. That idea isn\u2019t new, Flynn observes; it was among the principles espoused by Sir Robert Peel, the British statesman and two-time prime minister who reformed police work in the United Kingdom in the early 1800s. But would it work in a modern American city?  The Chelsea experience showed him that \u201cusing problem-solving tactics in partnership with communities could do two very important things: reduce community tensions and help us reduce crime.\u201d It also gave rise to his dictum that good policing can be an economic development tool. \u201cThat\u2019s what I saw happening in the poorest city in the commonwealth\u2014as our crime narrative got better, so did our economic prospects.\u201d     Erik Gunn is a freelance writer based in Milwaukee.

aV It was January 2013 when Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. issued a call to arms\u2014not for his own dwindling troops, but to law-abiding citizens.    \u201cWith officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option,\u201d the sheriff said in a public service announcement. \u201cYou can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed or you can fight back. But are you prepared? Consider taking a certified safety course in handling a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there. You have a duty to protect yourself and your family.   Story Continued Below   \u201cWe\u2019re partners now,\u201d he concluded. \u201cCan I count on you?\u201d    Clarke was incensed by what he saw as a spike in violent crime and by weak-kneed responses from his counterparts in the Milwaukee area. No secret that Clarke, a former veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department, was not a fan of MPD Chief Ed Flynn\u2014Clarke has been very publicly mulling a run for mayor, a job that would make him Flynn\u2019s boss. The sheriff\u2014whether on local conservative talk radio or on CNN\u2014seldom leaves any doubt about what he thinks.    Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and others rebuked him, calling his TV spot irresponsible. They accused the sheriff of undercutting confidence in law enforcement and promoting a vigilante mindset in a city already struggling with violent crime. Clarke\u2019s response: doubling down. Big time.    Two months after the PSA, in an interview posted on the conservative Project Veritas website, he instructed law-abiding citizens about what to do if they encountered a \u201cclown\u201d breaking into their house.    \u201cKnow who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger,\u201d Clarke directed. He went on to talk about calling 911 to \u201cget this dead guy out of my house. He\u2019s bleeding out and messing up my carpet.\u201d    What right-minded law-enforcement official urges citizens to take crime-fighting into their own hands?    This black Rush Limbaugh with a badge is who. Clarke is a very public doubter when it comes to all the newfangled, data-driven, community-policing experiments embraced by Flynn. Whether Clarke\u2019s approach is effective is tough to determine: He refuses to produce an annual report with data on his department, although the county board directed him to do so three years ago. \u201cAll they are, they\u2019re fluff pieces, anyway,\u201d Clarke scoffs. \u201cEverybody\u2019s annual report says we\u2019re saving the world.\u201d    But saving the world\u2014and getting his fair share of publicity in the process\u2014is exactly what Clarke seems intent on doing.    ***    Clarke\u2019s been the sheriff since 2002, when he was named to the post by Republican Gov. Scott McCallum, and he\u2019s won four elections since then. As sheriff, he has ultimate authority for law enforcement in the county, but in reality, his jurisdiction is limited\u2014the freeways, the courts, the airport and the jail.    Over his tenure, the sheriff\u2019s office closed a drug-investigation unit and a gun-reduction program and other investigation units. His number of sworn deputies has been cut from 647 in 2002 to 245 in 2014. Cops in the county\u2019s 19 municipal police departments do the heavy lifting, the kind of street-level policing Clarke favors and performed for two decades as a patrol officer, homicide detective and commander in the Milwaukee Police Department.    He ordered a deputy who criticized him to go out, by bus, as a one-man patrol in a crime-ridden neighborhood.    The bully pulpit is not just his favored weapon. It may be his only one, a tool he has used to outsize his stature from the start.   What Works  By ERIK GUNN   In press releases and on talk radio, the African-American sheriff has called black legislators race hustlers \u201cpromoting the cult of victimology.\u201d He ordered a deputy who criticized him to go out, by bus, as a one-man patrol in a crime-ridden neighborhood. He threatened to arrest the supervisor of the House of Corrections and warned that gun control would lead to a second American Revolution.    All the political theatrics have made him a celebrated figure on the right: He was named sheriff of the year by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in 2013, and featured at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum in 2014. After a combative appearance on CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan Show, gun rights groups touted a video of Clarke: It shows the sheriff in his favorite pose, on a horse, wearing a cowboy hat and dark glasses; then follows him to a shooting range where he fires his handgun like an action figure.    \u201cI saw 24 years of futility from this criminal justice system,\u201d Clarke told me. \u201cA cop\u2019s biggest complaint is that they can\u2019t get cases charged; we keep putting guys out on the street. Now, I get to talk about it. It angers me, because we\u2019re losing generations of kids to crime, violence, lives of poverty and unemployment.\u201d    In a four-hour interview in his bunker-like office, with Fox News rolling on a big-screen TV, Clarke often fell back into the jargon of a street cop, calling criminals goofs and clowns and using \u201cfrickin\u201d as a softer version of a familiar obscenity. Now 58, Clarke still looks ready to battle bad guys. He\u2019s a commanding figure: six feet, four inches tall, with a strong jaw line and authoritative posture, much like a military man, like his father, who served as a paratrooper in Korea and taught his son discipline. The cowboy look, he says, harkens back to his boyhood, when he sought to emulate his uncle, a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys.

aV OK, so there wasn\u2019t a sink in the bathroom. But the kitchen sink was only four steps away. And so what if the apartment\u2014all 192 square feet of it\u2014was half the size of a budget hotel room? The $822 monthly rent included all utilities plus free Wi-Fi and a double bed.    \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we need bigger spaces,\u201d says Alexa Case, gesturing at the mini-flat screen TV that she\u2019s mounted on the wall, her collection of black shoes and a pan scraped clean of something chocolate\u2014all within easy reach of her bed.

The 25-year-old hairdresser doesn\u2019t have a lot of stuff\u2014doesn\u2019t want a lot of stuff. She\u2019s just moved out from under her parents\u2019 roof to this, her very first apartment. She spent six weeks scouring Seattle and finally found a place in Capitol Hill\u2014the onetime nucleus of punk and grunge, today the crucible of the city\u2019s metamorphosis, home to funky shops, artisanal breweries and upscale eateries that serve up marrow bones and water buffalo burgers.    \u201cEven though it\u2019s tiny, it\u2019s easy for me to keep organized,\u201d she says, the edges of a tattoo peeking out from under her T-shirt. \u201cI got a sweet deal.\u201d    More than a quarter of all households in the United States today are made up of just one person, up from 17 percent in 1970. This growing demographic is part of an ongoing renaissance of American cities and contributed to a 2.3 million-person jump in the urban population between 2012 and 2013, according to the Census Bureau. Single-person households have also inspired a national movement toward smaller living spaces. And nowhere is this trend more in evidence than in Seattle.    The country\u2019s fastest growing city (population 640,500), Seattle is the pioneer of micro-housing\u2014tiny, one-room dwellings that are in turn hailed as an affordable, sustainable alternative to the high cost of city living, and disparaged as an inhuman experiment in downsizing. They are disruptors\u2014real estate\u2019s version of a high-tech innovator, literally altering the landscape of the city they occupy. But are they are a force for good or ill? Seattle is still figuring that out.   The pros, cons, and way of life in Seattle's micro-units.  \u000a  Some micro-unit buildings look like skinny, color-blocked townhouses, often towering over the squat cottages and bungalows that dot Seattle neighborhoods; others resemble sleek, ultra-modern low-rise apartment buildings. Inside, they\u2019re typically laid out dormitory style: groupings of eight private sleeping rooms, each with its own bath and kitchenette, that share a full-size common kitchen for anyone who cares to cook. Few do.    Seattle boasts the highest number of micro-dwellings in the country\u20143,000 at last count. It also permits the most audaciously minimal units, some as small as 90 square feet. That\u2019s about the size of two prison cells put together.    It\u2019s not for the claustrophobic, but it does come with perks\u2014including the chance for millennials and those with modest incomes to settle in vibrant urban neighborhoods. Their presence, in turn, injects new energy to the heart of the city while tamping down suburban sprawl. Micro-housing reflects a growing zeitgeist\u2014to stop accruing, go minimalist and reduce one\u2019s footprint. Indeed, the name of Seattle\u2019s leading micro-housing development company is called Footprint.    A variety of industries across the country have begun to mushroom around this new model of simpler living, marketing services and products to architects, builders and residents of micro-apartments.

In 2012, it introduced a competition for developers to design a micro-unit building on city-owned land in Manhattan. The competition drew 33 applications\u2014the largest response ever for a proposed housing project in New York, according to New York University\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. The winning proposal will result in 55 units, ranging between 250 and 370 square feet.    San Francisco, where the median home price just crossed $1 million, has  approved 375 micro-units, the smallest being 220 square feet. Boston has limited initial construction to 195 units, with a minimum size of 350 square feet\u2014practically a palace compared with Seattle\u2019s high-end cubicles.    \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any place that has even a tenth as many units as Seattle,\u201d says Alan Durning, author of Unlocking Home: Three Keys to Affordable Housing and founder of the Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based nonprofit that researches environmental policies in the Northwest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because most cities\u2019 rules don\u2019t make it easy.\u201d   \u000a                            OPTICS: Livin' Small in Seattle (Click to view gallery.)   Seattle proved an ideal pioneer of micro-housing for a confluence of reasons: a permissive city code; a burgeoning population of millennials; a real estate boom fueled by the incursion of Amazon and other tech giants; and, not least, a visionary developer who early on discerned the pieces of this puzzle and put them all together.   \u000a\u000a                                                What Works\u000a  \u000a                                            By Nicole Brodeur  The model\u2014which took off in 2009\u2014also happened to coincide with state and city goals to increase urban density and leave rural and agricultural lands untouched. In doing so, it triggered an unlikely coalition of developers and environmentalists, while turning some longtime progressives into wary NIMBYs, outraged that their residential neighborhoods are being transformed by what many perceive as the rebirth of seedy early 20th century boarding houses. Now, after five years of assuming a hands-off approach, the city is pushing back against micro-housing, putting the future of these tiny dwellings in limbo.

aV SEATTLE\u2014There\u2019s a scene in the pilot of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d when tech czar Gavin Belson is looking out his office window, watching his minions walk across campus.    \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Belson says to his hovering, fawning life coach. \u201cThey always travel in groups of five, these programmers. There\u2019s always a tall, skinny white guy; short skinny Asian guy; fat guy with a ponytail; some guy with crazy facial hair and then, an East Indian guy. It\u2019s like they trade guys until they all have the right group.\u201d   Story Continued Below   That scene plays out every day in Seattle\u2019s South Lake Union neighborhood, where Jeff Bezos\u2019 ever-growing army of Amazon employees have taken over several city blocks, turning this City by the Sound into a new kind of Company Town.    It\u2019s a moniker that Seattle has embraced before\u2014company town\u2014as far back as the Klondike Gold Rush, and in the last several decades as the home of Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. In the case of Amazon, though, that civic embrace hasn\u2019t been given as quickly, or as easily. The city simply can\u2019t get its arms all the way around it.    It was as if one day, Seattle woke up to find that 30,000 new neighbors had moved in, with all the attendant headaches you can imagine: traffic jams, housing shortages and soaring rents. There\u2019s a new, laissez-faire working culture of dressing down and dogs at your desk. Buses are so loaded with so-called \u201cAm-holes\u201d that they rush past stops. Even the dating scene is feeling the rising tide of well-paid, educated men in boyish jeans, sneakers and T-shirts who would rather talk code than meet cute.    Amazon has 15,000 employees in Seattle\u2014most of them engineers, managers and programmers\u2014out of a global workforce of 97,000 and it\u2019s building two new towers in Seattle for another 12,000 workers. The company\u2019s growth and imprint on the city is driven home every time the U.S. Census releases new findings and Seattle shudders at reaching a new milestone it didn\u2019t anticipate, or maybe even want. In the last year, Seattle has experienced the steepest rent hike among U.S. cities. Three out of five Seattle apartments now rent for more than $1,000. To meet demand, whole neighborhoods are seemingly under siege. New construction has bled beyond the tech epicenter of South Lake Union, and up the city\u2019s hills to hipster hamlets where families, non-tech workers and the gay and lesbian community have lived for years, and are now feeling squeezed and priced out.   What Works  By SARA SOLOVITCH  What Works  By MARK PETERSON  Politics  By SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL   Amazon\u2019s is not only a global workforce, pulling workers from all continents, but one of mostly men: Seventy-five percent of Amazon\u2019s workforce is male, to be exact. Their numbers\u2014and their arrival over the last two years\u2014seem to have affected the median income of men in the city. Recent census data showed that median earnings for Seattle men who work full-time increased by $7,000 between 2012 and 2013\u2014a 7 percent jump in just one year. That ranks as the highest pay raise for men in any major U.S. city, and puts men\u2019s median earnings in Seattle at $67,000. Those employed in tech had a median pay of $91,000 last year, and were 79 percent male.  Meanwhile, median earnings for women who work full-time in Seattle only went up one percent, census data shows, plateauing at $52,000. Women in Seattle, according to the data, make just 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. That\u2019s down from 86 cents in 2012. So much for progress.    That eight-cent drop represents the largest one-year widening of the gender pay gap among major U.S. cities, and tied Seattle with Tulsa, Okla., as the fifth-worst pay gap in the country in 2013. The best anyone could do at the City Council level was authorize an \u201caction plan\u201d to address the imbalance.    The one area where women would seem to have the upper hand thanks largely to Amazon is in dating. Based on 2010 census numbers crunched by tech writer Jeff Reifman, Seattle has 130 single men for every 100 single women. Reifman, in an article titled \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Male: Amazon\u2019s Growth Impacting Seattle Dating Scene,\u201d estimated that by the end of 2014, there will be 86,098 single males aged 25 to 44, but only 66,273 females in the same age range. \u201cIf you\u2019re a straight, single woman outside of Seattle,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthis might be a great time to move here. Seriously, please move here. Amazon\u2019s hiring.\u201d    But, to use a phrase coined by the women of Georgia Tech, \u201cThe odds are good, but the goods are odd.\u201d In a piece for the website Dame titled \u201cAmazon is Killing My Sex Life,\u201d Tricia Romano recounted her dates with \u201cbrogrammers\u201d\u2014men with fat wallets, cool shades and ripped abs but slim interest in anything beyond their jobs and themselves.    \u201cI spent a half hour or more listening to him talk about his job,\u201d Romano wrote in the piece, which ran last spring. \u201cSince I am not in the tech industry, I don\u2019t understand any of it.

aV Big towns are known for being Democratic strongholds\u2014in 2012, President Obama carriedall four of Texas\u2019 largest cities despite losing the state by almost 16 points. But, as a 2014 MIT and UCLA studyshows, there are a few urban holdouts where populations lean Republican and policies lean conservative. And there\u2019s something to be said for red cities. Take Mesa, Arizona, the most conservative in the United States, which is \u201cbuilding new infrastructure and even embracing trendy liberal ideas like 'new urbanism'\u2014all while managing to keep costs in line and municipal workforces small and cost-effective,\u201d writes Ethan Epstein. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on in a few of the others.    ***   Story Continued Below   Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  Population: 600,000  Conservative ranking: 2    While Oklahoma\u2019s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin refusedto expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act or even to accept the $54 million in federal funds offeredher state to implement it, Oklahoma City\u2019s Mayor Mick Cornett\u2014also a Republican\u2014decided to take advantage of the controversial law, accepting federal money to bolster old and initiate new public health projects in his city. In 2007, Men\u2019s Fitnessmagazine ranked Oklahoma City as one of the nation\u2019s fattest, and Cornett, inspired by his own 40-pound weight loss, stood in front of the elephant cages at the zoo and declared, \u2018This city is going on a diet.\u201d Over the next few years, with the new federal cash infusion and other city revenues, Cornett helped build bike lanes and walking paths around the city, constructed an Olympic rowing complex and launched a website called \u201cThis City is Going on a Diet\u201dto track OKC\u2019s overall weight loss and provide healthy exercise and dieting tips. More than 47,700 people (around 8 percent of the city\u2019s population) signed up for the site and, as of January 2012, had collectively lost more a million pounds. Thanks to these initiatives, along with Cornett\u2019s efforts to bring Oklahoma City its first NBA team, Newsweekranked Cornett one of the country\u2019s five most innovative mayorsin 2012. In the same year, Men\u2019s Fitnessmoved OKC, one million pounds lighter, to its list of fittest cities.    ***    Colorado Springs, Colorado  Population: 430,000  Conservative ranking: 4    In 2010, with the Great Recession eating into city tax revenue, the Colorado Springs government made headlines with drastic spending cuts, including turning off one-third of its traffic lights, selling the city police\u2019s helicopters and even removing trashcans from local parks to avoid paying garbage collectors. Then-Mayor Lionel Rivera, who in 2010 turned down $42 million in federal jobs assistance on principal, replaced certain city services by using volunteers. Citizens were asked to sponsor streetlights for $100 a year or empty trash from parks. The city government also urged private swimming programs to manage city swimming pools and churches to run local community centers.    But, as Monica Potts arguedin the American Prospect, Colorado Springs might be more dependent on government than citizens believe. The U.S. military employs one-fifth of Colorado Springs\u2019 working population and the city\u2019s successful aerospace industry receives a variety of government funds. \u201cWhile conservatives like to gripe that government jobs don't inspire innovation in their workers,\u201d Potts wrote, \u201cthey don't like to point out how many private-sector jobs are spurred by government spending.\u201d    ***    Aurora, Colorado  Population: 340,000  Conservative ranking: 10    Aurora\u2014a growing suburb just outside Denver\u2014is host to one of the 14 House races that POLITICO currently classifiesas toss-ups. Just four of those 16 feature Republican incumbents\u2014and one of them is Rep. Mike Coffman of Aurora. After the 2012 movie theater shooting in which a 24-year-old killed 12 people with a semi-automatic rifle and high-capacity magazines that had been banned by the federal government until 2004, Aurora became a national symbol for gun control activists. But Coffman did not support the Manchin-Toomey bill that would have expanded federally mandated background checks, a move that led to protestsoutside of his office. His opponent, Democrat Andrew Romanoff, backs the legislation.    Immigration has also become a major flashpoint in the race, due in part to a surge in the Hispanic population: Aurora was 28.7 percent Latino in 2010, compared with only 19.8 percent a decade earlier. Romanoff backs comprehensive immigration reform along the lines of the 2013 Senate bill, but Coffman would begin by securing the borders and would not offer a majority of undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. At a recent debate Coffman contrasted his stance on immigration with Romanoff\u2019s rather flippantly: \u201cThe difference is I lead, and you follow.\u201d    ***    Anchorage, Alaska  Population: 300,000  Conservative ranking: 11    Despite its relatively high per capita income ($34,565 in 2012 compared to the national average of $27,319), Alaska\u2019s most populous city has been plagued by high violent crime rates in recent years, which many blame on the city\u2019s methamphetamine problem. According to the FBI, Anchorage saw 837.7 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens in 2010, more than 10 percent higher than the national average for cities over 250,000 people, and the city\u2019s rate of forcible rapes is nearly three times what it is in other large metropolises.    It\u2019s no surprise, then, that violent crime has become an issue in the hotly contested 2014 Alaska Senate race. Incumbent Sen. Mark Begich (D) recently ran a television adaccusing his opponent, former Alaska Attorney General Dan Sullivan (R), of letting sex offenders off with light sentences, including one who went on to commit a particularly gruesome double murder and sexual assault. But the attack cuts both ways: Certain crime rates, including rape, increased during Begich\u2019s tenure as mayor of Anchorage from 2003 to 2009. Begich pulledthe ad amid accusations that the ad interfered in an ongoing trial.    ***    Fresno, California  Population: 500,000  Conservative ranking: 13    Truth be told, there aren\u2019t many conservative big cities left in the United States. Fresno, located approximately halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is one of the country\u2019s two neutral cities, neither conservative nor liberal, according to the MIT/UCLA study. It became a hotspot in the 2014 California gubernatorial race this summer when Neel Kashkari, the multimillionaire Republican candidate, posed as a homeless person and spent a week in the city looking for work and accepting donated food. The op-edKashkari wrote for the Wall Street Journalabout his experience criticized his opponent, California Gov. Jerry Brown, and his Democratic cohorts for allegedly \u201cwillfully ignor[ing]\u201d the millions of Californians living in poverty.    Fresno ranks among the most disadvantagedurban areas in California, suffering from pollution, health problems (with above-average rates of asthma and diabetes) and joblessness. The only problem for Kashkari: Fresno is governed by a Republican mayor, Ashley Swearengin, and has been GOP-led since long before the 2008 financial crisis. Swearengin refused to say that she\u2019s voting for Kashkari when askedin late August at the Sacramento Press Club. She chose instead to emphasize \u201chow well he was treated by everyone in the city\u201d when he was posing as a homeless man.

aV \u201cThe Republican Party is, more than ever before in its history, an anti-urban party,\u201d the New York Times op-ed page declared after the 2012 elections, a contest that saw the GOP trounced in city after blue-tinged city\u2014and not just at the top of the ballot. Last year, Politico\u2019s Alexander Burns dubbed urban Republicans \u201cperhaps the nation\u2019s most severely endangered political species,\u201d and noted that the largest America city to elect one of these rare creatures recently was Indianapolis, Indiana\u2014all the way down at 13th on the population charts. Cities have long been Democratic Party strongholds, but in recent years Democrats have run up the score to an unprecedented degree, posting lopsided results that almost make Bashar al-Assad\u2019s or Kim Jong Un\u2019s numbers look bad.    It\u2019s enough to make one wonder: In the year 2014, can a major American city be\u2014gasp\u2014conservative? If you believe the results of a recent study from a couple of academic researchers at MIT and UCLA, you\u2019d do well to look to the Southwest to find out. Mesa, Arizona, the researchers found, after analyzing more than a decade\u2019s worth of public opinion surveys, is the most conservative American city of more than 250,000 residents, more conservative than such famously right-wing bastions as Oklahoma City and Colorado Springs. \u201cOn an overall basis,\u201d says the boisterous Scott Smith, who was mayor of Mesa from 2008 until early this year, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s extremely conservative.\u201d   Story Continued Below   It might also be a glimpse of the GOP\u2019s coming urban revival.    Squint, and you can see that Mesa is just one of several places where Republicans are creating a new model of conservatism for the post-Tea Party era, through an appealing blend of fiscal pragmatism and no-nonsense competence. Across the country, Republican cities are building new infrastructure and even embracing trendy liberal ideas like \u201cnew urbanism\u201d\u2014all while managing to keep costs in line and municipal workforces small and cost-effective. As the great, Democratic-run cities across the country\u2014Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles\u2014face fiscal calamity, America\u2019s conservative cities are showing that there\u2019s another way.    ***    Most of Mesa, despite its growing population of more than 450,000 (making it more populous than Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Miami and Minneapolis) hardly feels like a city at all. Located some 20 miles east of Phoenix, Mesa sprawls in every direction; at nearly 140 square miles, it covers roughly twice the area of Washington, D.C.    A line of low-slung ranch houses fans out along a road in Mesa, Arizona. Because it experienced most of its growth in the 1940s and '50s, the city represents the typical postwar neighborhood of wide roads and single-family subdivision homes.| Mark Peterson/Redux    Essentially a Phoenix bedroom community (though some larger employers, notably Apple, have recently moved into Mesa itself), Mesa consists of endless miles of strip malls and subdivisions filled with squat ranch houses, all connected by six-lane roads where people regularly zip by at 60 miles an hour. There are also numerous mobile home communities, open only to those 55 and older\u2014retirees apparently enjoy living in a city where summer temperatures regularly top 107 degrees. It\u2019s hardly, in other words, an urbanist\u2019s paradise: Shortly after I arrived at my hotel south of downtown, I took a mile or so walk. I saw only two other pedestrians on my constitutional\u2014both, apparently, homeless.    Mesa\u2019s sprawling layout owes much to its history. The area began its modern existence as a Mormon settlement in the late 19th century, and it remained a small frontier community for much of its early years. The town\u2019s population only broke into five digits in the 1940s, when fighter pilots began training for World War II combat at Mesa\u2019s Falcon Field and the Williams Air Force Base\u2014and, equally crucial, when air conditioning became widely available. Because it only really began to grow quickly in the 1940s and \u201950s, Mesa followed the classic postwar development pattern most famously embodied by Levittown, New York: miles of modest, single family homes in subdivisions, wide boulevards meant for speedy driving and shopping centers boasting ample parking. In sum, the bulk of Mesa is quintessentially suburban. As former mayor Smith puts it, Mesa attracts those who think \u201cbeing boring is OK.\u201d    OPTICS: A Nowhere Trying to Become a Somewhere: Photos of Mesa, Arizona. | Mark Peterson/Redux    Mesa\u2019s religious roots continue to influence the city heavily today. Mormons, though they now constitute only 13 percent of its population (the Catholic population is twice as large, owing to the sizable Hispanic population, with the remaining balance mostly Evangelical Christian), hold three of seven City Council seats (down from four in the last term). Smith is a Mormon, and the incoming mayor is an LDS member, as well. The spectacular Mesa Arizona Temple dominates much of central Mesa, and one of the city\u2019s (admittedly few) iconic restaurants, The Landmark, is in a building that began life as a Mormon church. America\u2019s most famous Mormon has a Mesa connection as well\u2014Mitt Romney\u2019s cousin Bill Romney lives there. Smith says that the strong Mormon influence in town has attracted other religious people, too. \u201cMesa is a city of churches,\u201d he says, adding that the Mormonism has attracted spiritually inclined people of all faiths to settle there.    While Mesa has long pursued the lightly regulated development patterns that one would expect from the wellspring of Goldwater Republicanism, change is afoot. Over the past several years, the city has begun embracing development that\u2019s downright trendy, and implementing policies that will make it more like Portland, Oregon, than Orange County, California.

aV MEMPHIS \u2014On one side of South Lauderdale Ave. sits the Foote Homes, among the last of the old federal housing projects that once proliferated in South Memphis, a low-slung, dun-bricked complex marked by stuffed animal memorials to dead teenagers, a place where two grown women recently pummeled each other silly while neighbors stood by laughing, smartphone cameras rolling for YouTube posterity.    On the other side of Lauderdale, not 150 feet away, sits the shiny, borderline-surreal Cleaborn Pointe at Heritage Landing, a manicured subdivision of semi-attached townhouses with 10-foot ceilings and white-railed front porches that seem to have been airlifted by aliens from a planet called Suburbia.   Story Continued Below   But behind those reassuring facades persist many of the same underlying problems found at the housing project across the street: single-mother households, substandard schools, lousy off-the-books jobs, a near-universal dependence on government support. Cleaborn looks a world apart, but in fact many of its residents are drawn from other projects around Memphis that have been demolished over the years under a massive federally subsidized effort to replace the city\u2019s crumbling housing stock that poured as much as a quarter-billion dollars into Memphis over the past decade\u2014without conquering the city\u2019s endemic poverty.    \u201cI had my first baby when I was 14 years old. You know, that\u2019s kind of the whole story right there,\u201d says Tamica Gordon-Cole, 35, sitting in her gleaming new kitchen table at Cleaborn, speaking above the clamor of the small army of kids who live with her in the four-bedroom rental.    About one of every three families in this river city of 655,000, one of the perennially poorest in the country, lives beneath the poverty line, and thousands more teeter just above it. Figuring out how to pull people like Gordon-Cole out of the permanent underclass has been one of the most vexing challenges the country has faced in the past half century, and it remains unfinished despite the billions spent on the effort. Gordon-Cole\u2019s house is located exactly one mile south of the Lorraine Hotel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated as he embarked on a never-finished Poor People\u2019s Campaign that was supposed to transform the civil rights movement into a quest for economic equality. Forty-six years later, the marchers are gone, the movement is mostly dormant and the national poverty rate is basically the same as it was when King made his final speech here.    But these are different times, and a new kind of anti-poverty push, less a movement than a technocrat\u2019s dream, is quietly being tested here, a modest experiment that could help redefine a static national conversation about how to deal with intractable poverty of the sort that not only has overwhelmed the old projects like Foote Holmes, but also afflicts even the shiny new places like Cleaborn Pointe. Three years ago, Gordon-Cole was one of 600 people (most of them single mothers) selected for the Memphis Family Rewards Program, a widely watched trial that provides cash incentives to poor parents and their high school-age children for completing tasks that seem, at first glance, absurdly second nature for middle-class families. A student who compiles an acceptable school attendance record gets $40 a month, showing up for an annual dental or medical check-up means a $100 check, grades are monetized ($30 for an A, $20 for B, $10 for a C) and taking a college entrance exam like the ACT gets you a $50 check. Parents are also rewarded: Adults get a $150 monthly bonus, up to $1,800 a year, simply for working full-time .   \u000a                            OPTICS: Walking in Memphis (Click to view gallery.)   The rewards system, modeled on similar programs in Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia principally aimed at the rural poor, is one of the few genuinely novel anti-poverty experiments to sprout up in the innovation desert that is post-1996 welfare reform in America. Enthusiasm for the programs, known as \u201cconditional cash transfers\u201d (CCTs), remains high internationally, and has been enthusiastically embraced by the Davos set. In a 2009 report, the World Bank hailed the success of CCTs in Mexico as \u201cpowerful proof that well-designed public programs can have significant effects on critical social indicators.\u201d     But paying poor people to perform quotidian tasks is a much harder sell in the up-from-the-bootstraps culture of the United States, and the cash transfers have been ridiculed or, at the very least, greeted with skepticism everywhere they\u2019ve been tried in America. Even supporters admit they\u2019re a bit dubious, as when the caseworkers administering the program in Memphis pointedly asked me why they couldn\u2019t get a little extra cash for being responsible grown-ups. \u201cNo joke. I could use an extra $150 a month for showing up at work,\u201d one of them told me. \u201cDo you really think our clients are that much worse off than we are?\u201d    Even in liberal New York, billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2014a onetime engineering student who tends to view even the most complex social policy problems as design challenges\u2014was forced to pay millions of dollars of his own money to fund an experiment in cash transfers in 2007 because he knew the city council would balk at using tax dollars. In Memphis, Mayor A.C. Wharton, a Bloomberg ally, has engaged in what amounts to a four-year running battle with his city council to pony up relatively modest sums (less than $1 million a year) to offset the roughly $6 million being invested by Bloomberg\u2019s philanthropy and federal grants.    On the left, a stuffed animal memorial commemorates dead teenagers outside a home on South Lauderdale Ave. in Foote Homes. On the right, on the other side of the same street, the sun sets on the manicured lawns of Cleaborn Pointe in Heritage Landing in Memphis, Tennessee. | Mark Peterson/Redux    It\u2019s not yet clear how effective the Memphis program and its sister project in the South Bronx will prove, but proponents say that, barring a massive new federal jobs program for the poor modeled on the New Deal, it\u2019s such smaller, targeted efforts that offer the best hope for those most in need of a push from poverty to the middle class, even if the political optics of paying a kid to get a C are awful.    \u201cIt\u2019s really the boldest alternative out there, especially at a moment when there isn\u2019t a taste for transferring more money to poor people,\u201d says James Riccio, who is in charge of assessing the Memphis and New York rewards program for the Manhattan-based social policy research group MDRC.

It\u2019s accepted fact in the most conservative quarters that it\u2019s OK to pay somebody to sit on their porch and sip mint juleps and get a government check.

aV While some mayors are working to make sure their cities are not the next drop-off spot for the recent influx of undocumented children, mayors from Tampa and Los Angeles are arguing that welcoming immigration would have benefits for cities across the country.    \u201cWe\u2019ve already talked to HHS,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, said Tuesday at POLITICO Magazine\u2019s \u201cWhat Works LA\u201d event in Los Angeles. \u201cBefore you get partisan and before you tell me where you are on immigration, these are children \u2026 let\u2019s get them someplace safe and secure, let\u2019s get them legal representation which is what this country has always stood for.\u201d    Garcetti joined panelists Helene Schneider, the mayor of Santa Barbara, California, and Bob Buckhorn, the mayor of Tampa, Florida, to discuss urban development and the politics of inequality with POLITICO\u2019s Alex Burns.    Garcetti cited statistics that say 62 percent of Los Angeles residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, which he claims allows his city to have \u201ca competitive advantage in the world.\u201d    \u201cOur competitive strength will come from being able to integrate immigrants that aren\u2019t going anywhere, that need to be earning scholarships, paying more taxes, having drivers licenses; we can only gain from that,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cThe status quo as it is is broken and costs us a lot of money.\u201d    His opinions on the benefits of welcoming immigrants into urban communities was echoed by Buckhorn.    \u201cWe are far more competitive as a community when we look like the world,\u201d Buckhorn said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the mayor of some white-bread Southern city. As a community, when we\u2019re out there competing for business, global business, the fact that our city [was founded by immigrants] makes us a lot more competitive because we look like the world.\u201d        L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti urges compassion on border crisis.        Buckhorn commented on the multiple languages and ethnicity within the Florida city and added, \u201cI want my kids to grow up in a city where not only everyone\u2019s inherent value is recognized and honored, but that we recognize and honor that we live in a global community and we\u2019re not just competing against Charlotte, North Carolina, we\u2019re competing with Mumbai, we\u2019re competing with Bogota, Colombia, and it\u2019s our advantage to do that and to encourage immigration.\u201d    Buckhorn was asked about politics and whether Democrats should look to big-city mayors for the next vice presidential spot.    \u201cYes, and I think Mayor Garcetti would be a great choice,\u201d Buckhorn said.    Garcetti responded, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being vice president. Thank you for the acceleration, but I want to fix some things here first.\u201d       History Dept.  \u000a\u000a                        By Brian Murphy\u000a  Law And Order  \u000a\u000a                        By Kel McClanahan\u000a  Swamp Diary  \u000a\u000a                        By Jack Shafer\u000a  A reported series from Politico Magazine, featuring innovative ideas from cities across the United States at a time of unprecedented urban reinvention.

aV Remember 2008? Whatever it was like where you live, trust me, it was even headier in Philadelphia. The Phillies, the biggest losers not only in baseball but in professional sports, won the World Series. We danced in the streets that day\u2014past red, white and blue images of presidential candidate Barack Obama adorning barber shops and fixed-gear bikes around town. When he cinched the election the next month, we danced in the streets again.    Perhaps nothing inspired more hope in city residents around that time, though, than a wonkish, Wharton-educated, bespectacled 51-year-old named Michael Nutter. A year earlier, the reform Democrat had gone from underdog in the race to be Philadelphia\u2019s next mayor to clobbering a slate of usual suspects in the May primary, including a millionaire, the boss of the city\u2019s Democratic Party, a West Philly congressman and a powerful state representative.   Story Continued Below   Nutter did it by promising to be the exact opposite of then-Democratic Mayor John Street, whose office had been bugged by the FBI, which suspected that his administration was steering city contracts to campaign contributors. Street was never charged with a crime, but the people around him\u2014his city treasurer, his former law partner and several other allies\u2014dropped like flies when widespread pay-to-play came to light. The whole ordeal left the city feeling like it needed a shower.    Like Street, Nutter was a former city councilman; but unlike Street, he was seen as far and away the least tainted member on Council. During his 14-year tenure, Nutter had helped push through anti-pay-to-play legislation, campaign finance reform and the formal establishment of an ethics board\u2014no small tasks in a town that muckraker Lincoln Steffens, at the turn of the 20th century, famously called \u201ccorrupt and contented.\u201d    When Hannah Miller, a 30-year-old city resident, described her supercharged dreams about Nutter to a Philadelphia Magazine reporter a few months before his May 2007 primary win, she spoke for many: \u201cMichael is the person who will choose to do the right thing, no matter what the circumstances are.\u201d He also had smart ideas about how to fix schools, fight crime and create the jobs desperately needed in a city once known as the \u201cWorkshop of the World\u201d but that had, over the last few decades, shed hundreds of thousands of positions.    I swear, it didn\u2019t all sound so crazy back then.    By the time the general election rolled around, in November 2007, not even the GOP could contain that it, too, had high hopes for Nutter. Republican and Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce president Al Taubenberger was recruited to face off against Nutter, but he readily admitted, \u201cI\u2019m running to make Michael Nutter a better mayor.\u201d    When Nutter bested Taubenberger with 83 percent of the vote, the mayor-elect, surrounded by his supporters, took to the stage at his victory party and proclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a new day. It\u2019s a new day. It\u2019s a new day. It\u2019s a new day.\u201d    Six-and-a-half years later, I asked Zack Stalberg, outgoing president of the Philadelphia-based ethics watchdog group Committee of Seventy, if Nutter has indeed ushered in a new day. \u201cHe\u2019s run a cleaner government than Philadelphia has seen in a long time,\u201d Stalberg says. \u201cBut he\u2019s had a very difficult time getting anything done.\u201d    In his nearly seven years in office, Nutter has created a Chief Integrity Office to clean up City Hall, appointed a federal prosecutor who busted corrupt city workers to head it and placed her office right next-door to his. He\u2019s established Philly311, a call center where residents can obtain municipal services without having to be connected politically, which, in Philadelphia, was a revolutionary idea. He\u2019s released reams of data that have elucidated the inner workings of city government.    He has also made good on his promise to stem gun violence: Last year, the number of homicides in Philadelphia dropped to a 46-year low (though it\u2019s also worth noting that several cities around the country, such as Chicago and New York City, also saw historic drops).    But with only a year and a half left in his final term, Nutter has so far failed to achieve many of his established priorities, from aggressively cutting taxes to selling the city\u2019s debt-laden gas company to rescuing its resource-starved school system. No doubt, the fact that the economy was sucked into a black hole at the beginning of his first term hasn\u2019t helped matters. \u201cHe came in with a much broader agenda, but I think a lot of that agenda just became impossible,\u201d says Comcast Executive Vice President David L. Cohen, who was chief-of-staff to Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell during the 1990s. \u201cBy dint of circumstance, he ended up talking more about ethics and integrity than he would have had the rest of his agenda been viable.\u201d    Many of Nutter\u2019s defeats, however, have been attributed to his own personality traits, in particular his apparent distaste for schmoozing and deal-making.    It makes some wonder: Is it possible for Philadelphia government to be honest and effective? We\u2019ve had plenty of successful and corrupt politicians (two of our best policy brokers, former Pennsylvania State Senator Vince Fumo and Pennsylvania State Representative John Perzel, were sent to jail over corruption charges). But all too few Philly politicians have proven they\u2019ve got what it takes to be powerful and squeaky-clean. So far, Nutter is not one of them.

aV In the hardscrabble section of West Philadelphia called Mantua, the man who could help change the neighborhood comes face to face with a symbol of its drug-infested and crime-ridden past.    John Fry, a 54-year-old resident of the leafy and exclusive suburb of Bryn Mawr, steps out of his pickup truck onto the sun-scorched corner of 33rd and Mount Vernon streets and stands in his sober black suit at the foot of a three-story tall mural painted on the blank side of a row house. It is a portrait of local legend Herman Wrice.   Story Continued Below   Wrice was a big man with a bigger personality. Brought to Mantua as a child by his mother, he was a gang member as a youth but eventually quit, going on to found a social service program he called the Young Great Society and later leading Mantua Against Drugs, a group renowned for its fearless confrontations with neighborhood dealers. Wearing MAD\u2019s signature white hardhat, Wrice not only wielded a bullhorn to lead chants during anti-drug rallies, he was known to carry a sledgehammer to bust down the doors of drug houses. On the night before an anti-drug march in 2001, he died of a heart attack at the age of 61.    Fry is soft-spoken and physically unimposing, but he has a reputation for being strongly determined and quietly persuasive, and he possesses his own set of tools\u2014things like tax increment financing and discretionary budgeting power\u2014whose use might very well alter the fortunes of Mantua in ways that Wrice could never have imagined.    And Mantua\u2019s fortunes are in urgent need of alteration. High-tone name notwithstanding (the original Mantua was the home of the Roman poet Virgil), the area of trash-strewn empty lots and rundown brick houses has long been an unsolvable blot on the Philadelphia map, separated from the city\u2019s grand Museum of Art district by the Schuykill River and a swath of commuter railroad tracks. Long ago carved out of what had once been part of the estate of one of the country\u2019s first federal judges, Mantua by the mid-20th century had become a stable home for working-class homeowners when white flight and urban decay turned it into a center of black poverty. By 1970, the area was almost completely African American, and most of its residents made half as much money each year as the average Philadelphian. By the \u201880s and \u201890s, Mantua was besieged by drug dealers, gangs and the crime that accompanied them. \u201cYou could see the devastation,\u201d says one long-time resident. Those who could get out, did; over the last several decades, Mantua\u2019s population declined by 50 percent.    Enter John Fry, who, almost from the day he assumed the presidency of nearby Drexel University in 2010, has made it his mission, and the mission of the school\u2019s 26,000 students, to be what he called \u201cthe most civically engaged university in the nation.\u201d And that very much involves the audacious task of reinventing Mantua, whose sketchy row houses and abandoned storefronts lie just minutes from the university\u2019s compact urban campus.    None of this is charity, exactly. Gone are the days when urban schools walled themselves off as citadels of learning and allowed neighborhoods to decay around them. When Columbia kids stuck to a few blocks in Harlem and Yalies created another reality from the urban dystopia of New Haven. At the University of Pennsylvania, where Fry worked before Drexel, the Ivy League kids so feared crossing the campus\u2019 western border that they called the McDonald\u2019s there \u201cMcDeath\u201d; no more. \u201cThere is a greater appreciation that a university\u2019s fortunes reflect the place in which they are situated,\u201d says Bruce Katz, urban expert at the Brookings Institution. To pull in the kind of faculty and students Fry needed to accelerate Drexel\u2019s long transformation from a local technical school to a nationally ranked research powerhouse, he knew he had to do nothing less than transform its entire surroundings. He would need the skills not just of an ivory-tower academic but of a latter-day Robert Moses, imagining a new neighborhood amid the shards of the old.   \u000a                            OPTICS: Can a University Transform a City? (Click to view gallery.)  Looking to invent new job opportunities for his university\u2019s neighbors, Fry has announced ambitious development projects aimed at making Drexel\u2019s piece of the University City area of Philadelphia\u2014which also includes the University of Pennsylvania, several major hospitals and the country\u2019s oldest urban scientific research park\u2014into what is being branded an \u201cInnovation Neighborhood.\u201d Though that idea is still very much in the brochure stage, it has garnered national press for Fry and his vision to create a $2 billion center for high-tech entrepreneurial and educational partnerships just a short walk from an area better known for gangland shootings and drug deals.    Fry is well aware that it will require a long and difficult feat of engineering to build a figurative bridge between the shiny, high-tech \u201cInnovation Neighborhood\u201d of his imagining and the gritty corner in Mantua where Herman Wrice stares down from the painted brick wall with a look of protective menace over an area best known for gangland shootings and drug deals.   In the latest edition of POLITICO Magazine's "What Works" series: How John Fry is growing hope in West Philly. Filmed by Mark Peterson. Produced by Bridget Mulcahy. Edited by Michael Schwab.  \u000a  Wrice looks south toward Drexel, where the yearly undergraduate tuition of $43,135 is well more than twice the annual income in most of the homes around him. A few blocks away from the mural, Fry idled his truck recently in front of Mantua\u2019s neighborhood school, Morton McMichael, a chronic underperformer that was recently set to be closed, but was given a reprieve thanks in part to intervention from Drexel\u2019s school of education. Having run through four principals in three years, McMichael was a place where fewer than one in five 7th graders could read at grade level, and where discipline was so bad that teachers feared assaults not just from students, but from their parents as well.    Still, \u201cI like to think of this as, like, the Corner of Hope,\u201d the relentlessly sunny Fry tells me. \u201cRight here in Mantua. Because we have a school that could be turned around. We have a recreation center that is very well used and well loved. We have some new Philadelphia Housing Authority housing.\u201d     John Marchese is a New York-based journalist and author, most recently, of The Violin Maker: A Search for the Secrets of Craftsmanship, Sound and Stradivari.

aV Boston\u2019s City Hall is a 500,000-square-foot concrete monstrosity. Built in 1968, the structure is a prominent example of Brutalist architecture, and it screams, \u201clarge, impersonal institution.\u201d For decades, Bostonians have despised it. Now comes the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Urban Mechanics, a scrappy five-person team charged with making Boston better through clever, low-cost hacks. They\u2019re talking makeover. Not the gazillions-of-dollars, knock-the-building-down kind. Something a lot cheaper. But still: a makeover. Finally.    Inside City Hall, right on the fifth floor near the mayor\u2019s office itself, New Urban Mechanic Kris Carter, 33, gives me a tour of the proposals, which were marked up and arrayed along a wall. One of them, \u201cStairs of Fabulousness,\u201d would cost less than $5,000 and cover the steps of the building\u2019s concrete grand staircase in bright rainbow colors. I asked Carter if it would play xylophone notes when you stepped on it, as a staircase at the city\u2019s Museum of Science does. Nope. It wouldn\u2019t capture data about foot traffic either. But still, it would be fun, and cheap, and so the mechanics were giving it serious thought.   Story Continued Below   \u201cLocal government over the last few years has gotten used to the idea that the kinds of services we deliver are gray,\u201d says Nigel Jacob, 39, who along with Chris Osgood, 37, has led MONUM, as the office is known, since its 2010 inception. It\u2019s MONUM\u2019s job to make those services more vibrant. Some innovations aren\u2019t necessarily major breakthroughs in good government, like the whimsical project, undertaken in October, of lighting up a bridge in pretty, multicolored lights. But many others are practical revolutions in how local government can connect with its residents using technology, like the famous Boston pothole app, and another one to handle all manner of basic government service requests right on your iPhone.    As \u201cinnovation\u201d becomes all the rage in city government, New Urban Mechanics has created a unique brand of it. Bearing the imprint of its first patron, former Mayor Tom Menino, the office has relentlessly focused on delivering services to residents\u2014an approach that\u2019s as much cultural as it is technological. It\u2019s \u201cthe first smart city leadership group that feels like it was designed by a political scientist instead of a computer engineer,\u201d says Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and Quest for a New Utopia. The model has produced nifty apps, made Boston a national leader in the field and survived this year\u2019s transition to a new mayor, Marty Walsh. Now, MONUM is digging in for its oh-so-modest long-term goal: reinventing civic engagement for the 21st century.   This video installment of POLITICO Magazine What Works shows how citizen engagement through new technology is literally fixing the city of Boston, one pothole at a time. Filmed by Mark Peterson. Edited by Madeline Marshall.  \u000a   ***    If all politics is local, most government innovation is urban. And Boston has been a leader in urban innovation since at least 1721. In late April of that year, a British ship, the Seahorse, arrived from Barbados, and by early May, 10 members of its crew had come down with smallpox. It was the first smallpox epidemic in New England in 19 years, and within a few days, 1,000 of Boston\u2019s 11,000 inhabitants had fled. The official response in the Puritan stronghold was prayer.    Fortunately, 18th-century West Africans took a more pragmatic approach to smallpox than their New England contemporaries. Onesimus, a slave belonging to Cotton Mather, informed the prominent minister that he had intentionally contracted a mild smallpox infection in Africa and acquired lifelong immunity\u2014an inoculation procedure. Impressed, Mather recruited Zebdiel Boylston, a local physician and future great uncle of John Adams, to leverage Onesimus\u2019 expertise. Boylston prototyped the process\u2014which required rubbing smallpox pus into a small wound\u2014by trying it on his two young sons and a slave. It worked, and he and Mather undertook a full-on pilot program, inoculating 287 Bostonians. (The data-driven approach was quite an about-face for Mather, who had been deeply implicated in the Salem witch trials of the 1690s.)    MONUM leaders Nigel Jacob, left, and Chris Osgood in Boston's City Hall. | Mark Peterson/REDUX    Mather and Boylston were greeted with scorn. Most of Boston considered their innovation bad medicine and an affront to God. James Franklin attacked the pair with so much vitriol that local authorities briefly imprisoned him, leaving his brother and apprentice Benjamin in charge of his printing shop. Someone threw a bomb through Mather\u2019s window with a semi-literate note attached, reading, \u201cCotton Mather, you dog, dam you! I\u2019l inoculate you with this; with a pox to you.\u201d (The bomb failed to go off.) But it worked, and the pair meticulously gathered data to prove it: The mortality rate for inoculated Bostonians was 2 percent, compared with 15 percent who contracted the disease naturally. The innovation gained acceptance and spread. The British royal family even decided to undergo inoculation, in part based on the results of the Boston pilot. You might call it the first recorded instance of data-based civic hacking, a practice that wouldn\u2019t even have a name for another three centuries.    The city was once again at the forefront of urban innovation in 1799, when it created the first health department, under Paul Revere, which then carried out the first controlled experiment of a vaccine, also for smallpox. In the 19th century, as major American cities swelled, they fell into the grip of urban political machines, whose governments were marked by inefficiency, cronyism and corruption. Again, Boston was a leader in improving urban governance. In 1865, a group of prominent citizens formed the American Association for the Promotion of Social Science. It encouraged the development of free public libraries and worked to set up a national network of them. Frederick Law Olmstead, the landscape architect who designed New York\u2019s Central Park and Boston\u2019s Emerald Necklace, used the group as a platform to promote his then-novel idea that cities should create municipal parks. Over the course of that century, Boston became the first city in the United States to establish a police department, a municipal library and a subway.

aV Writing about Boston\u2019s adventures in mobile technology, Ben Schreckinger profiles its crowning achievement to date\u2014Citizens Connect, a cell phone app that empowers Bostonians to report municipal problems to city officials\u2014and get them fixed in record time. See a pothole? Graffiti? A broken streetlamp? Just use your smartphone to tag the location and submit a report. In many cases, it takes the city just a day to respond.    Citizens Connect has imitators in cities across the United States: In Philadelphia, it\u2019s Philly 311; in New Haven, it\u2019s SeeClickFix; Oakland\u2019s got Mobile Citizen. But this isn\u2019t the only type of app seeking to provide a public service. From addressing crime to turning us all into citizen scientists, smartphone apps are increasingly being designed not only to make urbanites\u2019 lives more convenient, but also to improve, inspire and empower entire communities. Here are just a few examples:   Story Continued Below   LiveSafe        Co-founded in 2012 by Shy Pahlevani and Virginia Tech-shooting survivor Kristina Anderson with the initial goal of promoting safety on college campuses, LiveSafe, lets its users report any kind of security concern to local police\u2014and provide photographic, video and audio evidence to corroborate. It\u2019s not just on college campuse It\u2019s especially useful in cases such as sexual assault, bullying or concerns about someone\u2019s mental health, when the reporter might wish to remain anonymous or be hesitant to call 911. The app also lets a user send emergency messages (tagged with a GPS location) to selected contacts\u2014or simply post safety tips. LiveSafe is now used at several colleges, such as Virginia Commonwealth University, University of New Hampshire and Washington College, and has expanded to cities. In March, the app raised $6.5 million in venture capital.    Visibility        Air Visibility Monitoring, or just \u201cVisibility,\u201d monitors local air pollution. Users snap a photo of the sky, which is tagged with relevant data (location, time and orientation). The app, developed by researchers at the University of Southern California in 2010, then runs an algorithm comparing the intensity of the image to a pre-established model of the sky\u2019s luminance\u2014all to tell the user just how many pollutants are in the air. With enough data, it can generate a regional pollution map. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not so easy to use: The photo must be properly cropped and taken in the right direction in clear skies (on cloudy days, the accuracy of the visibility data is compromised).    iCitizen        iCitizen, a startup founded by Duncan Dashiff and Rodney Massey in 2013, aims to alleviate voter apathy and increase civic engagement\u2014and not just around election time. The app provides users with information from several different media outlets about a range of political issues\u2014from women\u2019s rights to budget ceilings\u2014and publishes politicians\u2019 voting records and polling data. It\u2019s meant to be nonpartisan, serving as a fact-based database that exposes the public to points of view across the political spectrum. There\u2019s another app called Textizen that functions in the opposite way, providing city planners with public survey data; the app builds a \u201cconversation-based\u201d survey with users about issues involving planning, development and other areas of municipal government\u2014all in hopes of enabling citizens to influence decision-making in their own cities.    Cycle Atlanta        Developed in 2012 by a group of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Cycle Atlanta lets cyclists automatically track their routes and, once they\u2019ve reached their destination, manually upload feedback about road conditions and safety issues. In doing so, it\u2019s promoting more effective, less bureaucratic communicationbetween cyclists and the City of Atlanta. Ideally, these bikers will be able to voice their need for certain infrastructural changes, including the creation of new bike lanes and the construction of conveniently-located repair shops, without having to attend a public meeting. In the words of co-developer Christopher Le Dantec, who calls this new civic hacking movement \u201cdigital democracy,\u201d apps and data are the new bullhorn and soapbox.

aV Cobb Parkway winds past the base of Kennesaw Mountain, where 150 years ago 4,000 soldiers died in one of the first, and bloodiest, battles of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s Atlanta Campaign. The mountain looms over business parks and industrial sites and, at certain times of day, casts a literal shadow over the roaring lanes of traffic. Thickets of signs for gas stations and fast food places line the parkway, but for the most part the tall Georgia pines and lush undergrowth still dominate the drive.    When you reach White Circle, you can turn east to get to Hamilton Grove, a relatively new subdivision of three- and four-bedroom two-story homes with high-ceilinged great rooms and luxurious master baths that sell in the $300,000s. Or you can turn west on White Circle until you get to a steep driveway that passes a retaining wall on which elegant brass letters read \u201cThe Foothills at Kennesaw Mountain.\u201d That sign is for what was intended to be an upscale shopping center, constructed in 2006 of stacked-stone walls and neutrally tasteful taupe stucco. Stores never opened here, and this little strip mall, like dozens scattered throughout Atlanta\u2019s suburbs, remained vacant, a victim of enthusiastic speculation and abandoned ambitions.   Story Continued Below   In an apt metaphor for how the 2008 recession played out, the shopping center today does have a tenant, but it is not the upscale boutiques and restaurants envisioned by its developer; it\u2019s the offices of MUST Ministries, a full-service nonprofit catering to the surprising hidden crisis unfolding in Cobb County, which for decades has been synonymous with Atlanta\u2019s suburban affluence but now finds itself facing an epidemic of the very poverty its residents were determined to avoid when they moved out of the city. There\u2019s a food pantry, a free clinic, a thrift shop and classrooms where people who never thought they would ask for help are working on rsums, scouring electronic job boards and strategizing about how to avoid foreclosure. MUST was founded 43 years ago, initially to serve teens and college kids in Marietta, the Cobb County seat. From its origins as a coffee house aimed at urban youth, MUST mushroomed to offices in eight counties in the northern Atlanta suburbs. Demand for its services has never been higher.    \u201cPeople went to suburbia for the American dream, and it became a nightmare,\u201d says Rev. Dwight \u201cIke\u201d Reighard, MUST\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cPeople have such little margin in their lives, it\u2019s staggering.\u201d    To fill in those margins, MUST provides services more often seen, or at least imagined, in the inner city: a \u201cwork recovery\u201d shelter for the homeless and unemployed; veterans housing; rental assistance; job training; computer labs; health care. Last year its food pantry distributed $1.25 million in groceries. And over the summer MUST volunteers delivered 247,087 lunches to kids who usually rely on school to provide their one meal of the day. That's more than double what it was just four years ago.   \u000a                            OPTICS: Riding the No. 10 Bus in Atlanta. (Click to view gallery.)   ***    There are a number of reasons you might know Cobb County. It is the birthplace of Julia Roberts, the former home of Newt Gingrich and the once\u2014and possibly future\u2014political province of Bob Barr, the former congressman best remembered for leading the impeachment fight against President Bill Clinton. Cobb is known for its good schools, lovely houses, rolling hills, wide-open spaces near the Chattahoochee River, and broad and winding parkways and highways. It is the future home of the Atlanta Braves, the successful suburban suitor that lured the team from its home in the heart of downtown Atlanta. \u201cLow on taxes, big on business,\u201d trumpets the Cobb County government homepage.    As affluent young professionals and older empty nesters flock back into cities across the country in search of better lifestyles, the suburbs left behind are increasingly filled with the working poor and struggling middle class. | Mark Peterson/Redux    Long considered the epitome of red-state suburban comfort, a quintessentially middle-class kind of place where the median income is $65,000 and people pride themselves on owning their own homes, Cobb County now has other superlatives attached to its name. Between 2000 and 2010, the county\u2019s poverty rate doubled to 12 percent. Just last month, the Urban Institute reported that of all counties in the United States, Cobb is where low-income people have the least chance of finding affordable places to live.    This is not an indictment of Cobb County in particular. Rather, what\u2019s happening in Cobb is a microcosm of the dilemma facing suburbs nationwide: a rapid spike in the number of poor people in what once were the sprawling beacons of American prosperity. Think of it as the flip side of the national urban boom: The poverty rate across all U.S. suburbs doubled in the first decade of the millennium\u2014even as America\u2019s cities are transforming in the other direction, toward rising affluence and hipster reinvention. If the old story of poverty in America was crumbling inner cities and drug-addled housing projects, the new story is increasingly one of downscale strip malls and long bus rides in search of ever-scarcer jobs. We can\u2019t understand what\u2019s working in America\u2019s cities unless we also look at what\u2019s not working in the vast suburbs that surround them.    Cobb County has long been a symbol of red-state suburban comfort, but in recent years, it has also become a symbol of the nationwide spike in suburban poverty. Above, an affluent home and a multi-family complex in the Atlanta suburb. | Mark Peterson/Redux    And there\u2019s a lot about Atlanta\u2019s suburbs that isn\u2019t working. Suburban poverty exploded here between 2000 and 2011, rising by 159 percent. Now, 88 percent of the region\u2019s poor people live in suburbs. On its face, there is nothing remarkable about that statistic; after all, metro Atlanta is huge (8,300 square-miles, about the size of Massachusetts), and its population keeps rising (it\u2019s now almost 6 million, equivalent to the population of Missouri). But fewer than 10 percent of us live in the city of Atlanta itself. So it would stand to reason that most poor people are suburbanites; most metro Atlantans are suburbanites, period.    In fact, however, the shift is remarkable. In the 1950s and 1960s, as suburbs like Cobb County sprung up in the pine forests and red clay of the farmland that used to surround Atlanta, it was wealthier people who fled the city while the poor stayed behind. By the 1970s, the poverty rate was about evenly split between the city of Atlanta and its surrounding suburbs.But over the past half-century, the urban poverty rate has held steady as the city\u2019s population continued to grow, drawing millennials and empty nesters, while in the suburbs it has ticked ever upward.   This video installment of POLITICO Magazine What Works highlights a growing epidemic of suburban poverty in Atlanta, where notorious traffic has gridlock social mobility. Filmed by Mark Peterson. Produced by Michael Schwab. Narrated by Rebecca Burns.  \u000a   For suburban Atlanta, as in suburbia nationwide, this shift presents some vexing problems. Designed around a car-centric culture of single-family homes clustered in cul-de-sacs served by strip centers and shopping malls, and fueled by jobs reached by commuting to downtown or suburban office parks, suburbs like Cobb County have struggled to respond to denser populations, increased congestion and, as a result of the 2008 recession, a decline in the middle-class jobs that made it all possible. Suburban Atlanta voters, including in Cobb County, have consistently rejected mass transit that might relieve their car dependency. And county zoning ordinances have continued to favor single-family housing over denser development, exacerbating the problem for the poor who are clustered there in ever greater numbers.

aV In recent years, Atlanta has wrested away from Los Angeles the distinction of serving as the poster child for sprawl. According to critics of sprawl\u2014uniformly seen in some quarters as an unmitigated disaster, an evil to be expunged\u2014this means that Atlanta, like other fast-growing sprawling cities such as Houston, Dallas or Phoenix, suffers from an entire litany of problems: a drain on its economic vitality, a lack of mobility, social problems, environmental degradation, even obesity.    You would think from the commentary that Atlanta is flat on its back. In fact, of course, Atlanta, over the last half century, has obviously seen its population and its economy grow faster than most of the older, higher-density, more transit-oriented cities of the United States or Europe. It must be doing something right, perhaps including the way it has sprawled.   Story Continued Below   The most recent confirmation of Atlanta\u2019s status as an icon of American sprawl comes in a new report from Smart Growth America called \u201c Measuring Sprawl 2014.\u201d This group, which advocates for more compact development, has devised an index of sprawl based on an entire series of measures that includes things like residential and employment density, strength of downtown and activity centers and the accessibility of the street network. According to Smart Growth\u2019s 2014 index the New York metropolitan area is America\u2019s least, and the Atlanta metropolitan area the most, sprawling. This year\u2019s report has occasioned a great deal of analysis nationwide and considerable handwringing among citizens of Atlanta, who cringe at what they perceive as negative publicity. It has intensified calls to put into practice \u201csmart growth\u201d provisions that would slow growth at the edge, increase densities at the center, reduce spending on roads and boost public transit.    A closer look at these diagnoses and prescriptions, however, suggests some problems with the analysis. Let\u2019s take, for example, the issue that dominates most discussions of Atlanta and sprawl: traffic congestion. You would assume, from the rhetoric of smart-growth advocates, that traffic congestion increases as urban areas spread out. In fact, in general, and around the world, the exact reverse is true. As logic would suggest, traffic congestion tends to rise with increased density as long as a substantial percentage of the population drives and there is no public transit system capable of offsetting the increased density of people and trips. However, most trips in virtually all affluent urban areas worldwide are by private vehicle andpublic transportation, outside the very center of a few American cities, is a negligible factor in the overall transportation picture. The result, according to a wide range of data from organizations like the Texas Transportation Institute and INRIX, is that the greatest congestion and longest commuting times in this country, as elsewhere in the affluent world, tend to occur in the largest and densest urban areas like Paris or New York and the least congestion and shortest commuting times in lower-density areas like Phoenix or Kansas City.    It is true that Atlanta\u2019s congestion is much worse than its low density might indicate. The reasons for this are complex, but two important ones jump to the eye. The first is that because of its irregulartopography and complex historic land-ownership patterns, Atlanta\u2019s road system is choppy and disconnected. This would not be so problematic if the city had an adequate freeway system. However\u2014and despite Atlanta\u2019s reputation as a paradise for cars\u2014this system is much less developed than it should be for a city its size, and it funnels a large percentage of traffic right through the heart of the city instead of diverting more of it around the center. The other reason traffic is so bad in Atlanta is because the urban area has grown so quickly. Compared with the Chicago metropolitan area, for example, whose population has grown less than 6 percent per decade since 1970, the population of the Atlanta metropolitan area has quadrupled in the same time period. Infrastructure almost always lags in places that experience extremely fast population and economic growth. In other words, traffic congestion is, in part, an almost inevitable by-product of Atlanta\u2019s undeniable and enviable economic success.    In any case, the remedy for the problem of traffic congestion is not some massive transit-building program. Atlanta, in fact, already has more transit ridership per capita than most low-density cities in the United States, according to the Census Bureau. That transit is important in reaching a few key locations, notably downtown and the airport. Atlanta, like virtually every American city, would probably benefit from an expansion of the transit system, particularly to accommodate those who cannot, for one reason or another, drive. Even a major expansion, however, is unlikely to alter in any fundamental way the fact that most people except for those traveling to or from a few very dense nodes are going to do most of their travel by private automobile because in greater Atlanta, as in greater New York or greater Paris, the automobile is simply so much faster and more convenient everywhere except at the very center. A major expansion of the transit system wouldn\u2019t even benefit most people who can\u2019t drive because the jobs are already so scattered around the metropolitan area, and the poorest people can\u2019t afford the fares. The most promising way to mitigate Atlanta\u2019s traffic problems will be to expand road capacity at least at the rate of population growth and to take advantage of new technological advances in traffic management, telecommuting, driverless cars and shared vehicles that can be summoned on demand. These measures could dramatically expand the region\u2019s transportation capacity.

Story Continued Below   \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018Does it move you forward?\u2019 Or, \u2018Does it just keep you trapped in the past?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cChange is difficult. The goal is to make change your friend, not your foe.\u201d    Citing his own experience working with labor unions, Emanuel said he doesn\u2019t find himself at odds when trying to implement reforms.    \u201cChange is hard, but I do believe if you give people a sense of where you\u2019re going, and what you\u2019re trying to accomplish and how you can make them winners of that, that is a better option than the certainty of what you have today,\u201d Emanuel said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s replaced for the certainty of what you\u2019re going to get tomorrow.\u201d    Emanuel described how he spoke with trade unions while trying to handle tensions surrounding McCormick Place, Chicago\u2019s convention center, and the largest in North America.    \u201cI sat two unions down. I said, \u2018Work with me and we\u2019ll figure this out,\u2019\u201d he said.    \u201cIt was change. It took sitting down, working through the issues,\u201d Emanuel said, noting the growth that followed as a result. \u201cThe pledge I made was, \u2018There will be a win for you and a win for the city.\u2019\u201d    Appearing alongside Emanuel were Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto and Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Ind. The panel focused largely on education, and Emanuel announced he is launching the Summer of Learn and Summer of Earn on Wednesday, which aims to keep children in a learning environment during the summer and in summer jobs programs, such as working in community gardens.    He said there also will be a program at libraries called, Rahm\u2019s Readers, in which children read three books and earn a \u201cdiploma.\u201d    Peduto acknowledged that education institutions, such as Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh, helped in Pittburgh\u2019s push for technological advancements and growth in robotic industries.    Freeman-Wilson also cited the partnership with Indiana University as well as the University of Chicago, because of its proximity, in tackling challenges facing Gary.    When the conversation turned back to Washington \u2014 a city Emanuel knows all too well \u2014 all three mayors called for more spending on infrastructure, citing Washington gridlock as a hurdle.    \u201cWhat they do, they\u2019re helpful, they just need to do more of it,\u201d Emanuel said of Washington.    \u201cAll of us would agree on more money for infrastructure,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine Chicago without O\u2019Hare.\u201d   History Dept.  \u000a\u000a                        By Joshua Zeitz\u000a  History Dept.  \u000a\u000a                        By John A.

aV \u000aWhat Works  \u000a            By JESSICA MEYERS  April 09, 2014  \u000a                    Updated April 11, 2014  A city\u2019s tech marketability hinges on the embrace of its own history, a cluster of industry experts said Wednesday, rather than an attempt to mirror its neighbors.    \u201cCities compete far less with each other in the global space than is usually thought precisely because they are different,\u201d said Columbia University Sociology Professor Saskia Sassen during POLITICO Magazine\u2019s What Works: Chicago event. \u201cCities don\u2019t have to give it all away to get firms to locate.\u201d   Story Continued Below   Chicago presents a prime example of a city working to resurrect its image from manufacturing mecca to tech hub. \u201cThe truth is, today capital is everywhere,\u201d and not just Silicon Valley\u2019s Sand Hill Road, said Howard Tullman, CEO of 1871, a Chicago hub for digital start-ups.    Panelists pointed to the city\u2019s economic history, its close-knit neighborhoods and a willing administration as reasons for initial success \u2014 even if it has a way to go before earning the \u201cSilicon Lake\u201d title.    \u201cChicago is very unique in its clustering theme,\u201d said Maria Katris, CEO of Built In, a network of digital communities that seeks to promote entrepreneurs and innovators. \u201cIt\u2019s close knit physically and virtually.\u201d    The country\u2019s third largest city, Chicago ranks eighth in U.S. tech jobs. It counts Groupon, a popular coupon site, and GrubHub, an online food ordering company, among them. GrubHub made news on Wall Street this month when it shocked analysts with a strong initial public offering.    Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has keyed on tech in his economic development initiative. The city last year released its first technology plan, which attempts to promote job growth and make government more efficient.    But Chicago, like many other towns with tech ambitions, still struggles to match Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurial zest and its ingrained permission to \u201cbreak things.\u201d    Tech companies tend to gravitate toward areas with an educated workforce and financial incentives, something the Rust Belt has traditionally lacked. Such factors present obstacles as the administration seeks to create \u201cmanufacturing innovation hubs\u201d that transform former factories into tech start-ups.    These cities also deal with the underlining tension that technological ingenuity \u2014 think robots \u2014 may mean fewer jobs.    Some models, Katris warned, just won\u2019t work. \u201cYou need a government that is the microphone of the community,\u201d she said.    While the panel praised Chicago, America as a whole didn\u2019t get as high a grade.    \u201cThe U.S., in a way, neglects vast stretches of urban terrain,\u201d Sassensaid.

aV For weeks there were whispers. And then one night in November 2005, hundreds of parents, teachers, and students crammed into a boardroom at a drab administration building south of downtown. Janice Brown, the superintendent of the Kalamazoo schools, had an announcement to make, and it was even more surprising than the rumors that had been flying around town: Kalamazoo, small, struggling Kalamazoo, best known for its strange name and the industries it was no longer home to, was about to launch the most generous municipal college scholarship program in the country, an audacious experiment not only in education reform but in re-engineering a troubled town.    As Brown shared the news, there were gasps and screams. Some of those assembled began to sob. \u201cIt\u2019s been said that Kalamazoo is a very special community. Tonight, we have proof of that more than ever, ever before,\u201d she told the audience. Everyone gathered there that autumn evening nine years ago knew that the fortunes of their Southwest Michigan town were about to change forever\u2014that, at least, was the hope.   Story Continued Below   Kalamazoo\u2019s spirits\u2014much like its population\u2014had been in precipitous decline. From 1970 to 2007, the city\u2019s population shrank 20 percent to just over 70,000. The sad, slow leak of manufacturing jobs had caused a sad, slow leak of the middle class. Poverty was nearly twice the national average. Within some pockets of city, the problems were startling: in Northside, a predominantly black neighborhood, the poverty rate was 37 percent\u2014worse than even basket-case Detroit, two hours to the east.    As the city hollowed out, the neighborhoods near the charming downtown became zones of Rust Belt blight, and the once-proud Kalamazoo public schools suffered along with it; enrollment plummeted and money for the schools began to dry up under Michigan\u2019s enrollment-based funding formula. Kalamazoo\u2019s black students\u2014more than 40 percent of the school system\u2014performed so poorly on standardized tests that they were some of the lowest scorers in Michigan. And that was saying something given that Michigan\u2019s scores were pretty terrible according to practically every measurement.   Meet the Austells, a family with two sons enrolled in the Promise, a $50 million program providing college tuition to Kalamazoo students.  \u000a   Something had to change, and the plan that Brown announced that evening in 2005 figured to do just that. Quietly, a group of local philanthropists\u2014who insisted on remaining anonymous, though most instantly suspected a group of homegrown billionaires whose fortunes had come from the locally based Stryker medical-devices firm\u2014had come up with an idea to make a dramatic investment in the city\u2019s schools and students. Over the giddy din that filled the auditorium that night, Brown explained that the donors had vowed to pay for college for any student who attended the Kalamazoo schools from kindergarten on and then attended a public college in Michigan. Students who entered before freshman year in high school would get a portion of their college education paid for depending on the years they spent in the Kalamazoo school district. The program, which was to be called the Kalamazoo Promise, would pay for college regardless of grade point average and financial situation\u2014according to one estimate, it could be worth more than $100,000 per student for four years.    The idea was one part radical social engineering: How better to change the life trajectory of the city\u2019s struggling urban poor than to send them to college? As economists have long known, the biggest single predictor of financial success in modern America is a college degree: those with bachelor\u2019s degrees earn an average of $15,000 more each year than those who merely graduate high school; those with associate\u2019s degrees make an average of $7,000 more each year. Increasingly, those with no higher education are the ones left behind. But the Kalamazoo Promise wasn\u2019t just a big idea about the new economics of education; the hope wasn\u2019t just to send more kids to college \u2013 but to turn around an entire town.    Several years earlier, Brown had been asked by several of the city\u2019s wealthy residents to join a discussion they\u2019d been having about the troubling economic trends in Kalamazoo, and that conversation soon came around to the connection between education and the local economy. What would happen if the city had a very different labor pool, much more college educated or headed that way? As Brown explained it in 2005, it would surely give the whole city a boost. \u201cStudy after study indicates that an investment in education adds to the quality of our community,\u201d she said at the time. Families would arrive to take advantage of the program and thereby boost the tax base, educated students would return to town, luring employers offering new and better jobs.   What Works  By NORA CAPLAN-BRICKER   Sure enough, as soon as the Promise was announced, the city embraced it as the ultimate urban revival plan. City leaders vowed that companies would flock to Kalamazoo, eager to scoop up its talented workforce. They predicted healthier schools, new subdivisions, and soaring property values. \u201cWhen the Promise brings new families, we will have new homes for them!\u201d Kalamazoo\u2019s mayor, Hannah McKinney, declared. Unbridled optimism radiated from national broadcasts on Good Morning America and the Today Show and in newspapers near and far. \u201cIt\u2019s only too bad,\u201d editorialized the Detroit Free Press, \u201cthat the means cannot be found to replicate the Kalamazoo Promise\u201d in every community in the state. Soon, in fact, the idea would be embraced by dozens of cities around the country; the irresistible lure of a big education reform that promises big economic rewards has led towns from El Dorado, Arkansas, to New Haven, Connecticut, to create their own versions of the Promise, and everyone from President Obama to New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, an alum of Kalamazoo Central High, has been eager to embrace the program.

aV When the anonymous wealthy donors behind the Kalamazoo Promise made their pledge in 2005 to pay for the kids of Kalamazoo to go to college, the idea was shockingly novel. And very appealing: almost instantly other cities around the United States clamored for their own such programs. Eight similar scholarship plans were announced within a year of Kalamazoo\u2019s. Today, the tally of plans inspired by the experiment in Southwest Michigan has topped 30 nationwide.    The idea is so attractive for cities looking to both upgrade their education credentials \u2013 and enhance their appeal to families who might otherwise not live there \u2013 that it\u2019s given rise to several waves of copycats. The New Haven Promise started in 2010; now, it\u2019s inspired a program in nearby Hartford, Conn., with Providence, R.I., and Newark, N.J., now considering plans of their own. El Dorado, Ark., is the South\u2019s version of an idea incubator; it took up Kalamazoo\u2019s cause in 2007 and has since been spreading the word; director Sylvia Thompson, advised Arkadelphia, Ark., on the program it founded in 2010, and met with a group from Malvern, Ark., last fall. These days, she\u2019s also ushering along Shelby, N.C., and Tyler, Texas. \u201cKalamazoo was very helpful to us,\u201d Thompson told me. \u201cBy the same token, I get phone calls all the time.\u201d   Story Continued Below   Now, nearly a decade after the movement began, here\u2019s how some of the country\u2019s most prominent promise programs are tailoring and tinkering with their own versions of the idea.    ***    El Dorado Promise    The halls of the elementary schools in El Dorado are papered with posters that say \u201cPromise Bound!\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re working on the Promise.\u201d Stroll through, and you might hear a kindergarten teacher chant, \u201cThe El Dorado Promise says?\u201d and a roomful of five-year-olds calling back, \u201cI can go to college.\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the culture,\u201d said Thompson. She keeps an office in El Dorado\u2019s high school, where students call her \u201cthe Promise lady.\u201d The El Dorado Promise kicked off in 2007, and it\u2019s among Kalamazoo\u2019s most faithful copycats; the only major difference is El Doradans can take their Promise funding anywhere in the country, where Kalamazoo graduates must go to one of Michigan\u2019s public colleges. El Dorado is also considered one of the most successful Promises. Thompson said roughly 90 percent of the district\u2019s students end up qualifying for the scholarship. An ongoing study at the University of Arkansas has found that El Dorado students who were in third grade when the program was announced were outperforming peers in other school districts by 14 points in math and 12 points in literacy on the Arkansas Benchmark Exam four years later. El Dorado\u2019s high school drop-out rate, which was nearly double the state average at 8 percent in 2006, is now between 1 and 2 percent.    Former President Bill Clinton congratulates the 2012 graduating class of El Dorado High School. | AP Photo/The El Dorado News-Times, Michael Orrell    Like most Promise programs, El Dorado was sparked by an article about Kalamazoo: An account in the Wall Street Journal found its way to the deepest pockets in town, the Murphy Oil Corporation, which put up $50 million to start the program. \u201cThey wanted people to want to come to work for Murphy,\u201d Thompson told me, \u201cand a strong school system is one of the things people look for.\u201d One El Dorado school even changed the lyrics of an old religious hymnal from \u201cstanding on the promises of Christ my King\u201d to \u201cstanding on the promises that Murphy has given me.\u201d    ***    Say Yes Syracuse    In 2008, Say Yes to Education, a national non-profit focused on inner cities, decided to experiment with a citywide scholarship program in Syracuse, New York. The organization\u2014and others, like the New York City-based \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d Foundation\u2014had been working on smaller-scale projects for years to boost access to higher education. A few years after it decided to initiate the Syracuse plan, the group began trading stories with the folks in Kalamazoo.   What Works  By CASSIE WALKER BURKE   Unlike the Kalamazoo Promise, where scholarships are the defining component, Say Yes tackles an array of barriers that can keep low-income students from going to college: According to its president, Mary Anne Schmitt-Carey, the organization provides everything from tutoring to health clinics. \u201cMy experience is that a scholarship alone will not get the job done,\u201d she told me, noting that the Kalamazoo team\u2014which visited Syracuse to gather ideas\u2014had come to a similar conclusion.  When Schmitt-Carey in 2011 announced a second citywide program, in Buffalo, New York, she borrowed Kalamazoo\u2019s provision that a full college scholarship is awarded to only those students who arrive as kindergartners (a sliding scale determines the percentage of college funding students receive if they arrive between first and ninth grades, after which new students are ineligible for a scholarship). She had noticed that this detail made a big difference in the urban revival of Kalamazoo: It encouraged young families to put down roots in the city, rather than simply move there to cash in on the scholarship. In Syracuse, families were moving downtown when their children neared the tenth grade cutoff, but in Buffalo, the influx of families started when their children were much younger, which, she says, helps to rebuild neighborhoods.

aV The concrete funneled out of the mixer and into the 18-foot pit, slowly undulating across the reinforcing steel girders. Two hundred trucks would converge on the site, making more than 2,100 trips to and from eight different concrete plants. After nearly 19 hours, 21,200 cubic yards of concrete would fill the pit, making it the largest continuous concrete pour in history, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records.    The pour, completed three weeks ago, provided the foundation for the 73-story Wilshire Grand, a $1 billion hotel, retail and office project in downtown Los Angeles, scheduled to be the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it opens in 2017. And the Wilshire Grand is among a gaggle of projects, 97 in all according to Los Angeles Downtown News, put into development in the rapidly reinventing neighborhood just in the past five months. Overall, 5,000 market-rate housing units will come online in the next two years, joining a boom in office space, museums, restaurants and brand-name shopping. Downtown L.A., left for dead amid the open spaces of Southern California, is back.   Story Continued Below   The renaissance has taken many forms, including the culture clash between the new urban hipsters and the long-forgotten homeless we chronicle elsewhere in this series. Perhaps most consequential may well be the least tangible shift the downtown boom portends: Is it, at long last, changing the car culture of a city long defined by freeways and congestion?    Certainly, the combination of multiple new mass transit spokes and development around transit stations in recent years has brought the fantasy of movies like Spike Jonze\u2019s Her\u2014living comfortably in L.A. without a car\u2014closer to reality. But the utopia of Her, with its luxurious rail cars, ubiquitous skyscrapers and crisscrossing footbridges, depicts a smoothly connected urban landscape without explaining where the rest of the city went. In a city made up of people and not just trains and high-rises, city planners have a challenge: how to make sure the benefits of trendy \u201cNew Urbanist\u201d ideas reach everyone.    Right now, there\u2019s definitely a target for all this downtown development: young people clamoring for a lifestyle that doesn\u2019t involve driving 10 miles just to get a soda. \u201cPeople have been going to New York, Chicago and seeing these great urban cities,\u201d says Brigham Yen, a realtor, downtown evangelist and writer of the blog DTLA Rising. \u201cThey come back to Los Angeles in search of that same type of environment.\u201d   By Warren Olney   Impressive as downtown Los Angeles\u2019 renaissance has been, L.A. will never be a city defined by its central core. Sure, there are more than 50,000 people now living in what was once a deserted downtown. But that number\u2019s dwarfed by the 4 million spread out across the rest of our 503 square miles.         That old joke that L.A. is \u201c72 suburbs in search of a city?\u201d It\u2019s still true.    Politically, we\u2019re all over the map, too. Each of L.A.\u2019s 15 city council members oversees many distinct neighborhoods. The San Fernando Valley doesn\u2019t want or need what South L.A. does; the South Bay has entirely different priorities from Hollywood, Silver Lake or the Westside.    And yet politics, inevitably, played an important role in L.A.\u2019s reinvention, with council members whose districts cover parts downtown helping to create the boom there, beginning with two transformative events in 1999.    The first was the opening of the Staples Center, a 20,000-seat sports and concert arena, home to the NBA\u2019s Lakers and Clippers and the NFL\u2019s Kings. Staples was built for $375 million by the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), a developer well connected at City Hall. Councilman Joel Wachs, a popular opponent of any public subsidies to private projects, objected to AEG\u2019s demand for a tax break on parking fees to help finance construction. And AEG lost an important ally when Mayor Richard Riordan recused himself from negotiations to avoid an apparent conflict of interest because he owned the nearby Pantry Restaurant.    L.A.\u2019s Roman Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Roger Mahony\u2014then at the height of his power\u2014stepped into the negotiations. Mahony wanted to build a new cathedral toreplace the small, rundown St. Vibiana\u2019s in the heart of downtown.Concerns were raised about the preservation of the old cathedral and gentrification around the new one, but Mahony argued that improving downtown was a worthy goal. Hegot AEG to promise to hire and train local workers, and allowed that St. Vibiana\u2019s would get enough repairs to keep it standing, even as it ceased to bethe headquarters for the archdiocese. Mahony\u2019s clout, and full support from influential Council President John Ferraro, finally helped to overcome Wachs\u2019s objection.    The economic impact was almost immediate. After opening in 1999, the next year Staples hosted the Democratic National Convention and the Lakers\u2019 first national championship in 12 years. \u201cIt brought people to downtown who hadn\u2019t been here for years,\u201d says Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association of Los Angeles, a downtown business organization. Many other large-scale developments have followed, including Mahony\u2019s massive Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and Frank Gehry\u2019s Walt Disney Concert Hall. And when AEG proposed L.A. Live\u2014a $2.5 billion complex with three music venues, a 54-story hotel and a condo tower\u2014it sailed through the council, thanks to the success of Staples Center.    The second transformative event of 1999 was less dramatic but just as important. The freeways that emptied out downtown had become so congested that trips to and from the suburbs were exercises in gridlock and road rage. As a result, people who worked downtown actually began to think about living there. The Central City Association, which wanted downtown transformed, and historic preservationists, who wanted it saved, together pushed the adaptive reuse ordinance, which expedited the approval process for renovating old buildings. Developers began turning decaying commercial and office buildings into apartments and condos. It worked, and as demand increased, there was a boom in new residential construction too.    Does all this mean downtown will become the heartbeat of Los Angeles and give us a coherent political identity? That\u2019s impossible to imagine. Those 15 council members will still attend to diverse local interests, while downtown remains a boutique cityscape in the midst of our continuing suburban experiment. The essence of Los Angeles will always be sprawl.    Warren Olney is host and executive producer of \u201cWhich Way, L.A.?\u201d and \u201cTo The Point\u201d on Santa Monica, Calif.\u2019s  KCRW , one of the nation\u2019s leading NPR affiliates.    The gentrification of city centers in America is by now an old story. But despite L.A.\u2019s obsession with the cutting edge, downtown fell far behind the trend, like a past-his-prime actor reduced to straight-to-Netflix thrillers, perhaps because of that car culture that was once so cutting edge in its time. Downtown was once home to some of the greatest movie palaces of the last century, wedged among dozens of impressive Beaux Arts and Art Deco structures. But as suburbs exploded and the freeways took over (believe it or not, Who Framed Roger Rabbit tells this story best), the neighborhood languished. The last high-rise project in the historic core before the recent spate of development went up in 1961.    Boosters have predicted  downtown\u2019s comeback since the 1990s, but the return was gradual. Over time, the tolerance for more and more frontier subdivisions, stretching as far as 80 miles from the city, finally ran out. \u201cLos Angeles was and still is the poster child of sprawl gone wrong,\u201d says Brigham Yen. \u201cThe sprawl has hit the wall.\u201d    Rethinking the downsides of sprawl coincided with a 2008 ballot measure called Measure R, which dedicated a half-cent sales tax for mass transit projects for 30 years. City leaders, hounded by demands to contain the city\u2019s legendary traffic, envisioned a return to the way Angelenos got around before mass production of the automobile, when the city was laid out to facilitate streetcar lines. Three rail projects are currently under construction, including the first transit line to LAX Airport along Crenshaw Boulevard, and an expanded Expo Line that, upon completion, will go from downtown to the beach city of Santa Monica. These rail lines finally serve the biggest population centers in the city, ending decades when real public transit was simply not an option.    Now it\u2019s all the rage. In just 20 years, the Metro Rail system has built six transit lines that feed into downtown\u2014that\u2019s as many lines as serve downtown Chicago. DASH bus service connects from the rail stations to neighborhood locations. And the city just secured a $700 million grant from Washington to create a regional connector to bring train lines together for seamless transfers. But money alone cannot ensure success, notes Ethan Elkind, the author of Railtown, a history of Los Angeles\u2019s troubled transit past. \u201cDespite the multibillion-dollar investment, it took specific policies to make development happen,\u201d Elkind says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just build the line and assume people will come.\u201d    In 1999, for example, the city passed an \u201c adaptive reuse\u201d ordinance for downtown, which allowed non-residential buildings to be rezoned for condos and apartments. It also freed developers from onerous parking and zoning requirements that could have derailed projects from the beginning. Adaptive reuse has flourished downtown, with several commercial and industrial spaces refashioned into lofts, a signature Ace Hotelrecently opened in the former United Artists Building and even the iconic Library Tower considering a residential/hotel conversion.

aV Antonio Villaraigosa has been called L.A.\u2019s \u201cpop star mayor\u201d and faced criticism for spending more time schmoozing with Hollywood stars and Democratic Party leaders than governing the city. But there\u2019s no question Los Angeles underwent a transformation during Villaraigosa\u2019s two terms in office, which ended last year: In an effort to shift the car-crazy town toward more public transit, the city added new rail lines connecting downtown to sprawling suburbs. And downtown L.A. itself, long an office-centric ghost town, has also changed dramatically, becoming a vibrant urban neighborhood with a residential population more than twice its size 15 years ago.    How much credit should Villaraigosa get for that transformation? \u201cRather than say, \u2018I did it,\u2019 I prefer to talk about what we did in those eight years,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview. \u201cI was mayor during this time. You can make the deduction.\u201d Today, Villaraigosa, who splits his time between L.A. and New York, holds advising jobs at Herbalife and the PR firm Edelman, as well as a teaching gig at the University of Southern California. Here, he looks back at L.A.\u2019s evolution during his time as mayor and looks ahead to where the city is headed next\u2014even if cars, for now, are very much still in the picture.   Story Continued Below   ***    Downtown L.A. has come back to life in recent years. What was your contribution to that transformation was as mayor?    On transportation, I said we were going to build a Subway to the Sea [running from downtown to the westside]. \u2026 As if anybody has the wherewithal to just snap their figures and get a subway. But we went to the [state] legislature to get on the ballot a measure to raise a half-penny sales tax to generate $40 million over 30 years. I won\u2019t say I built it myself, but we added one [metro-extension] busway, four rail lines, and four more are under construction, for a total of eight rail lines. It was the most ambitious effort to build light rail and heavy rail in the United States of America at that time.    We went to Congress and promoted the idea that almost everybody ridiculed\u2014America Fast Forward\u2014at a time of high deficit and debt. The federal government didn\u2019t have the money and was unwilling. We had passed the half-penny sales tax [in L.A.], and I said we could expand a [federal] loan program that was underutilized and underfunded almost tenfold and provide low-cost loans and grants to cities, counties and states. \u2026 Finally, we convinced Congress and the [Obama] administration. And I was standing next to the president when he signed the service transportation bill, which allowed L.A. to accelerate its infrastructure program.   What Works  By ED LEIBOWITZ  What Works  By DAVID DAYEN  What Works  By MARK PETERSON   There was also an ordinance that was passed a couple years before I became mayor\u2014the adaptive reuse ordinance. That along with the public transportation allowed us to create density around transit centers. Downtown was one of them. Hollywood too. Downtown is the biggest\u2014that\u2019s where Union Station is. Mixed-use development is there and in Hollywood in no small part because that\u2019s where the transit is. You\u2019ll see it along Wilshire Boulevard too. We were very clear that we weren\u2019t just building up transportation; we were going to reimagine the city.  Can a city as big as L.A. really become less car-dependent?    Over time it can. It certainly won\u2019t in the next decade or so. But as we build this system out, as we promote development along transportation hubs and lines, I think we\u2019ll see people use the system more and more because they live along those lines\u2014much as people do in New York, Chicago, Boston and other big cities.    There\u2019s a fear now that downtown\u2019s gentrification is pushing out the homeless and the poor. Was that a concern for you?    That\u2019s why I really pushed inclusionary zoning [to support affordable housing]. There was a lot of opposition on the city council to it and from the business community. It did concern me. I did believe that we could build and rebuild in a way that was more inclusive, and yes, I was a big supporter of that. I didn\u2019t have the eight votes on the council. There was a lot of lobbying against it by developers, who frankly were afraid that the city would go too far. Our proposals were fairly moderate, but they opposed it.    We were the homeless capital of the United States. In L.A., we have to convince the county to do the services around our housing; it\u2019s called permanent support housing. We did, I think, 726 units in the 12 years before me. In the eight years of my administration, we did 2,500. We could have done even more, but the county resisted our efforts to put the housing throughout the city and not just in one area of the city. It was disproportionately downtown where they were willing to provide services, and we needed to put it throughout the region, throughout the city.    Some of your critics say that as mayor you didn\u2019t focus enough on politics.    Some critics say I spent too much time on politics. I don\u2019t put much stock in the critics.    What do you think downtown L.A. will look like in, say, five or 10 years?    I think you\u2019ll see more and more a 24-hour downtown, a vibrant center of the city. But over time, I think you\u2019ll see that in other areas as well. I think Hollywood certainly is one of them. We worked hard in our planning efforts to incentivize mixed-use development and incentivize development along transportation lines, and that is something that as we continue to build this system \u2026 that, along with the planning changes that were made, will continue to transform downtown and the entire city.    I\u2019ve always said that L.A. is the city of America\u2019s future. It is to the world London was in the 19th century and New York in the 20th because of the growth of the Pacific Rim countries. We\u2019re the portal to the emerging world.    Interview has been condensed and edited.     Margaret Slattery is associate editor of Politico Magazine.

aV Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013, wants to be remembered as the guy who brought mass transit to L.A., who smashed crime\u2014and finally gave the city a real downtown. He is all about his legacy.   A relentless self-promoter who is now an appointed professor at the University of Southern California, Villaraigosa will soon be lecturing students about the fine details of managing a world-famous metropolis and, after years of covering\u2014and tangling with\u2014his administration, I have no doubt his planned memoir about leading the nation\u2019s second-largest city will be a hoot.   Story Continued Below  But the twisting of Villaraigosa\u2019s past was well underway before he handed over the keys to Eric Garcetti, L.A.\u2019s 43-year-old \u201chipster mayor\u201d whose father, Gil Garcetti, infamously lost the 1995 O.J. Simpson murder trial as the Los Angeles County district attorney.   In the weeks leading up to Villaraigosa\u2019s departure in June 2013, political supporters constantly banged the drum that under the mayor\u2019s watch L.A. had become safer, that he improved public transportation infrastructure and that he pushed forward a successful \u201cgreen\u201d agenda. Some of which is loosely true.   How true? Although crime dropped across the country over the past eight years, and Villaraigosa and the LAPD made a nonsensical claim that L.A. was as safe today as it was in 1956, the mayor did expand the police department to a little more than 10,000 sworn officers and violent crimes such as homicides and rape declined around 40 percent during his two terms.   In 2008, Los Angeles County voters approved a half-cent sales hike for 30 years in the form of Measure R, which Villaraigosa had furiously campaigned for. The tens of billions raised through that increase will go toward much-needed transportation projects and improvements, such as new bus operations, better freeways and, more controversially, rail lines. Villaraigosa and his supporters often claim that the passage of Measure R was due to the mayor\u2019s political wizardry. But the initiative just barely got the green light from taxpayers and a large crush of young people showed up to the polls to vote for Barack Obama, not Villaraigosa, and helped to put Measure R over the top.   With the so-called greening of L.A., Villaraigosa pushed forward a \u201cclean trucks\u201d program at the Port of Los Angeles, which requires diesel trucks to meet tough environmental standards and has decreased air pollution at the nation\u2019s largest port. But Villaraigosa also signed off on Teamster-friendly rules that made it very difficult for independent truckers to work at the port. Those rules have been challenged in federal court. Villaraigosa also announced a plan for L.A. to stop using coal-fired power by 2025. It sounded great, but as with many of his grand plans, it\u2019s too early to say if that will actually happen.   Villaraigosa, who had strong connections to wealthy real estate developers, was particularly proud of changes in downtown L.A., although numerous homeless advocates believed he forgot them and their clients in the process\u2014a story Ed Leibowitz tells here.   Always given to hyperbole, the mayor said weeks before he left office at a park opening in downtown, \u201cNot since the late 1940s have you seen the resurgence of downtown, the activity downtown that you see today. More and more people are living here, working here, shopping here and they want open space just like everyone else.\u201d   From his view at the White House, President Barack Obama called Villaraigosa \u201cone of the finest leaders we have in this country.\u201d But that\u2019s not exactly how it looks to many Angelenos.    ***    Villaraigosa\u2019s actual legacy boils down to three things: deep disappointment, unrealized potential and brazen betrayal.   What Works  By MARK PETERSON  What Works  By MARGARET SLATTERY  What Works  By ED LEIBOWITZ   In 2005, Villaraigosa, a liberal Democrat who grew up poor in Los Angeles\u2019s hard-scrabbled Eastside, graduated from UCLA in L.A.\u2019s affluent Westside, and turned into a political powerhouse as the speaker of the California State Assembly, strode into office talking about a gleaming future for all Angelenos.  \u201cJoin me, Los Angeles,\u201d Villaraigosa famously said during his inauguration speech. \u201cDream with me, Los Angeles. And work with me to fulfill our dreams.\u201d   As the first Latino mayor in L.A.\u2019s modern history, Villaraigosa was warmly embraced by janitors, movie stars and influential politicians alike. At his inaugural ceremony, former Vice President Al Gore, California governor and action film hero Arnold Schwarzenegger and labor icon Dolores Huerta, among many other luminaries, were in attendance. Over the next eight years, however, Villaraigosa would go on to let down nearly everybody.   The first major disappointment and betrayal took place in 2007 when Villaraigosa admitted to having an extramarital affair with a local TV reporter, Mirthala Salinas. Villaraigosa took a lower profile for the rest of the year, separated from his wife of 20 years and heard occasional boos and catcalls at public events. More ugliness followed.   In 2008, as a staff writer for L.A. Weekly, the city\u2019s alternative newspaper, I examined Villaraigosa\u2019s schedule for a 10-week period on a hunch that he was out of town way too often to do any real work. That guess was correct, but unsettlingly so.   The fame-seeking mayor not only wasted an hour posing for a statue of himself for Madame Tussaud\u2019s Wax Museum, but 34 percent of his official workload was spent on traveling to such far-flung places as Israel, Hawaii and London and raising money for himself in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco.   Another 24 percent of his workload was spent on \u201cgap time,\u201d which largely consisted of the time it took to travel from one public relations event to another in his LAPD-chauffeured SUV. Ten percent of his workload involved attending staged press conferences, prepping for press conferences and taking media interviews. Only 11 percent of his time was utilized for handling important city business, such as meetings with department managers and his chief of staff.   For the article (\u201c The All-About-Me Mayor\u201d), former L.A. Daily News editor Ron Kaye, who has covered Los Angeles politics for decades and rails against City Hall corruption as a blogger today, told me, \u201cAfter three years, it\u2019s pretty clear how Antonio has used the office. For him, it\u2019s ceremonial, and he\u2019s the public face of City Hall, instead of being a guy who rolls up his sleeves and gets down to the nitty-gritty. He made the wrong choice. He made the choice to look after his own interests.\u201d     Patrick Range McDonald is an investigative journalist and former staff writer at L.A. Weekly. McDonald helped former L.A.

aV At the Pussy & Pooch boutique on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles, the array of bejeweled collars, canine aromatherapy candles and post-modern cat scratchers demonstrates just how good life has become for the privileged pets of the neighborhood. Pussy & Pooch even boasts a Pawbar, providing local Chihuahuas and English bulldogs with the kind of fine dining experience that their owners routinely enjoy at the cafes crowding the avenue. Among the standouts on the Pawbar menu is a plate of fresh raw meats drizzled with gourmet sauce, accompanied by Bowser beer and followed by a dish of Yoghund frozen yogurt. \u201cYou live a stylish and progressive lifestyle,\u201d the shop assures visitors to its website, \u201cand your pet companion should too!\u201d      It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the only dogs and cats in this rapidly reinventing stretch of downtown L.A. were the strays that darted across Main\u2014desperate and without shelter, like the men and women who stumbled on its sidewalks, or squeezed their way beneath accordian gates at night for the relative safety of the garbage-choked entrances to what had once been some of the most opulent office buildings west of the Mississippi.   Story Continued Below   This is Skid Row, or at least the far western border of it, and for several decades, the only signs of commercial life along this stretch of Main Street were dive bars, grimy convenience stores and gritty \u201csingle-room occupancy\u201d hotels, home to the poorest of the city\u2019s poor. Yet today the sidewalks bustle outside shops selling vegan cinnamon ice cream, $50 bottles of Rioja, artisanal cupcakes and those designer products for one\u2019s pooch. Hipsters with beards worthy of Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg emerge from lobbies of restored loft buildings where a two-bedroom apartment can go for as much as $3,000 a month. Longtime flophouse hotel residents on federal assistance vouchers now share floors with budget-minded travelers and aspiring artist types still some years away from a luxury loft upgrade. Skid Row, the homeless capital of the United States, is going upscale.    Amid the urban boom of the last decade across the United States, many downtown wastelands have undergone such transformations. The original Skid Row in Seattle\u2014named in the 1860s for the greasy road used by day laborers transporting logs from timber stands above the city and eventually shorthand for a zone of drunkenness and destitution in an otherwise thriving young metropolis\u2014has long since given way to a predictable mix of galleries, smart cafes and pricey lofts. So has the legendarily dissolute Bowery in New York City.    L.A.'s Skid Row was not the first of its kind but may well have become the worst, a 54-block island of despair west of the L.A. river, stretching north from 7th to 3rd streets and east from Main to Alameda, that has long had the distinction of hosting the largest concentration of homeless people in the country. For decades, it was an economic black hole in the middle of the city, where the helpless and hopeless washed up and would remain, very much out of sight and out of mind.    For decades, this was a wasteland, the homeless capital of the USA. Which makes it all the more striking that the march of gentrification, of yoga studios and big real-estate developments, is pushing into the greatest concentration of human misery to be found in all the United States.    Which makes it all the more striking that the march of gentrification, of yoga studios and big real-estate developments and more than 23,000 new residents in just the last seven years, is pushing into the vicinity of soup kitchens, of shelter beds, of sidewalk encampments\u2014of the greatest concentration of human misery to be found in all the United States. That march has brought the inevitable conflicts, as rents rise and worlds intersect, and undoubted benefits, as L.A.'s downtown has suddenly become \u201ca neighborhood as electrifying and gritty as New York in the \u201970s,\u201d as GQ called it in a recent travel article that trumpeted its \u201creoccupation\u201d and declared it well on its way to becoming \u201ca Great City in the heart of the City That Destroyed Cities.\u201d    But perhaps more surprising than this urban hipster upgrade has been another consequence of the vanishing buffer zone between Skid Row and the rest of L.A.: It seems, finally, to be forcing Angelenos to open their eyes to how the city treats its most vulnerable residents.    Down and Out in the City of Dreams: Portraits of L.A.'s Homeless (Click to view gallery)    ***    With its endless sprawl, L.A. for decades has been called \u201cthe city without a center.\u201d In fact, Los Angeles once did have a center\u2014and it was right where Pussy & Pooch now stands. In the late 1800s, cheap hotels began opening around Central Station to accommodate the thousands of day laborers, fruit pickers and fortune seekers taking the Southern Pacific Railroad to the end of the line. At the border of this transient district, Main Street arose as the city\u2019s hub of power and influence, where its real estate barons, citrus moguls and financiers built Beaux Arts office blocks of granite and marble and bronze with their names chiseled above the front doors. In top-floor executive offices and private clubs, they enjoyed a panoramic view of a city whose future they were shaping. The grandest monument of them all, just a few doors down from today\u2019s Pussy & Pooch, was the Pacific Electric Building, which served as the headquarters for the streetcar magnate Henry Huntington. In its basement was arguably the busiest commuter station in America, the terminus for 1,100 miles of Pacific Electric track leading from L.A.\u2019s mushrooming suburbs to the heart of a city on the move.    In 1914, a produce dealer-cum-self-promoting-preacher named Tom Liddecoat opened the Midnight Mission only a five-minute walk from all this prosperity, serving a 12 a.m. dinner to the crowds of poor and hungry men who had clustered in what he called \u201cHell\u2019s Half Acre.\u201d By the Great Depression, the area was well on its way to becoming a disaster zone in the center of town, a sketchy neighborhood whose fate was sealed after World War II with the waning of Huntington\u2019s Pacific Electric System. Once the last of L.A.\u2019s streetcar routes was scuttled in 1963, the conquest of the automobile was complete.    By the 1980s, the Gilded Age grand hotels were housing L.A.'s poorest. Above, the transformation of Hotel Rosslyn. | Getty; Mark Peterson/Redux    By the end of the 1980s, L.A.\u2019s banks, corporations and white-shoe law firms had all decamped to a thicket of modern office towers built on a bluff to the west, convenient to one of the busiest freeways in the world. In the ghost town of the old city center, the grand hotels that had once welcomed Charlie Chaplin and Woodrow Wilson were now housing the poorest of L.A.\u2019s poor, and an estimated 30 percent of the neighborhood was living on the streets, sleeping on sidewalks and alleys by the thousands and overwhelming the shelters, soup kitchens and vermin-infested rooming houses that had come to symbolize the neighborhood as much as its Gilded Age splendor ever had.

aV It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the moment Pittsburgh began its three-decade climb back from the dead, but Red Whittaker marks the comeback from the instant he heard the ominous clack of a door closing behind him when he entered a secured building near the melted heart of Three Mile Island back in 1983.    Whittaker\u2014then a ferociously ambitious former marine building a nascent robotics program at Pittsburgh\u2019s Carnegie Mellon University that would become the world\u2019s best\u2014was about to test out the ungainly, joy-stick-guided contraption he had designed with a $1.5 million grant to plumb the deadly terra incognita of the basement in Unit 2, the reactor that had partially melted down four years earlier, nearly setting off a nuclear disaster. He\u2019d built the device over six months with a group of 20-something grad students, dispatching their metal-and-wire erector set on wheels to the reactor building, which was filled with radioactive water and debris and bounded by concrete suffused with enough killer gamma radiation to fry any human.   Story Continued Below   Whittaker, whose mother had steeled his nerves as a kid by taking him up for hair-raising flights in a small plane, was plenty nervous, worried that somehow his team\u2019s invention would end up banging into the wrong thing and sparking a fresh nuclear crisis. Peering at the CCTV feed as the radio-controlled \u201cRemote Reconnaissance Vehicle\u201d slowly descended into the reactor building on a cable, he watched as his baby landed\u2014plop\u2014into the nuclear soup. \u201cThe thing I\u2019ll never forget is seeing how it made the water ripple. When I saw those ripples and we started creeping along, and everything was working, I knew we were in business,\u201d says Whittaker, whose current endeavor is no less ambitious if a lot more romantic: landing an unmanned rover on the moon and capturing the $40 million Google Lunar X Prize.    That same year, 1983, Pittsburgh\u2019s unemployment rate reached 17.1 percent and the city was losing more than 4,000 people a month. The steel industry that had built modern Pittsburgh, funded its museums and mansions, its football team and its aspiring middle class, was cratering, never to return. But the success of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Three Mile Island robotics team\u2014it produced a ground-breaking assessment of the extent of the radiation from sensor readings, photographic inspections and core samples taken from the concrete, none of which would have been possible with human hands alone\u2014would set into motion a spectacular, three-decade cycle of innovation, investment and expansion that put Whittaker and his protgs on the leading edge of their new field and created a cool cottage industry that has come to define a city\u2019s resurgence.    PHOTOS: From Steel City to Roboburgh: The reinvention of Pittsburgh. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux    \u201cRoboburgh,\u201d the boosterish moniker conferred on the city by the Wall Street Journal in 1999 and cited endlessly in Pittsburgh\u2019s marketing materials ever since, may have been premature back then, but it isn\u2019t now: Pittsburgh, after decades of trying to remake itself, today really does have a new economy, rooted in the city\u2019s rapidly growing robotic, artificial intelligence, health technology, advanced manufacturing and software industries. It\u2019s growing in population for the first time since the 1950s, and now features regularly in lists like \u201cthe Hottest Cities of the Future\u201d and \u201cBest Cities for Working Mothers.\u201d \u201cThe city is sort of in a sweet spot,\u201d says Sanjiv Singh, a Whittaker acolyte at Carnegie Mellon who is working on the first-of-its-kind pilotless medical evacuation helicopter for the Marines. \u201cIt has the critical mass of talent you need, it\u2019s still pretty affordable and it has corporate memory\u2014the people here still remember when the place was an industrial powerhouse.\u201d    The rise of the robots is the storyline the city itself embraces because it represents the reassertion of Pittsburgh\u2019s irrepressible identity, its industrial DNA.    Improbably for a blue-collar town that seemed headed for the scrap heap when its steel industry collapsed, Pittsburgh has developed into one of the country\u2019s most vibrant tech centers, a hotbed of innovation that can no longer be ignored by the industry\u2019s titans. Carnegie Mellon is Google\u2019s biggest rival in the race to build a driverless car, partnering with GM to build a robot Cadillac that has been humanlessly tooling around Route 19, just outside city limits. In 2011, Google opened a posh, 40,000-square-foot office in an old Nabisco factory in the city\u2019s East Liberty neighborhood, ramping up last year to 350 people, with more on the way. Bill Gates and other Silicon Valley moguls have invested millions of dollars in Aquion Energy, a start-up spun out of CMU that is developing next-generation batteries and producing them in nearby Westermoreland County, not China. Apple, RAND and Intel also have outposts in town and Disney, which has tapped the university\u2019s computer and robotics talent for years, is partnering with the school to improve cinematic graphics and to develop hominid robots that can gently hand objects to people by predicting the movement around them. All told, Pittsburgh\u2019s tech and education sectors now account for some 80 percent of the high-wage jobs in the city, and robots are just the most visible piece of this miraculous turnaround of a city on the brink.    Red Whittaker with his lunar landing device. | Mark Peterson/Redux    But is it a recipe for urban reinvention, proof that Silicon Valleys can flourish anywhere, as a million city managers the world over dream? Why did Pittsburgh make it when so many other industrial-era powerhouses have not\u2014why, in short, is it Roboburgh today and not Detroit?    For all the high-tech whiz-bang\u2014CMU\u2019s labs are an electronic menagerie with robots that slither like snakes, buzz overhead like hummingbirds and furrow into mines like hedgehogs\u2014Red Whittaker, and the people who have worked on the Pittsburgh comeback, will tell you there is no magical formula for post-industrial cities to claw back from the grave. It\u2019s inevitably an all-of-the-above enterprise that in this case included a major environmental clean-up, public-sector incentives to attract businesses, billions of dollars in federal funding and collaborative rule-bending to do things like turn abandoned brownfield sites into gleaming tech headquarters. But perhaps the most critical factor was recognizing that, beneath the collapse, stagnation and misery, the city\u2019s core assets remained largely intact, in the form of human capital housed in the city\u2019s cultural institutions, foundations, an overlooked industrial research sector and above all its great universities\u2014Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, Duquesne\u2014built and endowed by the 19th century robber barons who gave the city its first golden age.

aV On Jan. 10, his fourth day as Pittsburgh\u2019s new mayor, Bill Peduto told a left-leaning crowd that his very arrival heralded a new dawn. \u201cThere has become a chasm, a canyon, between the haves and the have-nots,\u201d he said. \u201cTuesday, Pittsburgh changed from an old boys\u2019 network city to a progressive city.\u201d    That may have been premature, and a bit self-congratulatory, but it was not too far off the mark. The city has changed, but in recovering from the steel bust and the crackup of the old order, the old boys\u2019 club that steered the city through the bad times has faded. Gone are the days when a small group of white men could sit in the Duquesne Club downtown and hash out the city\u2019s future; the industrial labor unions that for years dominated urban machine politics here have a less privileged seat at the table. Pittsburgh\u2019s political world today is much more multipolar, with new groups competing for the resources of a government that continues to struggle financially despite the region\u2019s overall economic turnaround.   Story Continued Below   The newer political players include most prominently the powerful \u201ceds and meds\u201d community\u2014the universities and hospitals that long ago surpassed manufacturing as the region\u2019s largest employers. Service unions have taken a place alongside the city\u2019s traditional labor establishment, while brainy high-tech entrepreneurs, foundation executives and neighborhood groups vying for development dollars all jostle for position as they press the new city administration to back their priorities.    As for party politics, Pittsburgh is still an overwhelmingly Democratic town. The city hasn\u2019t elected a Republican as mayor or even as a council member since before the Depression. Its Democratic Party still has an active structure of ward and committee officers. But the party\u2019s clout has waned over the last generation, as have the influences of the industrial unions, the Roman Catholic Church and other large organizations that once provided an unchallenged and seemingly unchanging civic structure.    The city\u2019s political shifts reflect the dramatic demographic changes of an old city getting younger\u2014and helped produce it. Peduto, an enthusiastic 49-year-old former councilman who tweets almost as much as Cory Booker, ran on appeals to \u201cthe new Pittsburgh.\u201d He embraced a trendy, bottom-up, community-based approach to development, in contrast to rule of power brokers that have characterized much of the city\u2019s history. At the same time, he has forged alliances with the city\u2019s large foundation community, whose resources are the heritage of the 19th-century fortunes of the industrialists who once made it the Steel City.    Peduto won an overwhelming general-election victory, with 84 percent of the vote, against Josh Wander, a Republican whose previous claim to fame came from starring in an episode of \u201cDoomsday Preppers.\u201d Wander\u2019s assessment of his chances were reflected in the fact that he spent much of the fall campaign working on a private security contract in Israel.    It was the Democratic primary that really mattered, and here, the city\u2019s changing demographics clearly helped Peduto\u2019s victory, but they didn\u2019t make it a sure thing. His predecessor, Luke Ravenstahl, elected at the ripe young age of 26, had seen his popularity erode during his seven years in office. But he retained the support of much of the city\u2019s business and development community and would have been a formidable contender if he hadn\u2019t rocked Pittsburgh\u2019s political world with a last-minute decision not to seek re-election. Peduto\u2019s chief rival in the sharply contested four-way primary was a more traditional Democrat, former state Auditor General Jack Wagner, who actually led in one poll before Peduto surged ahead to a double-digit victory.    The succession of Democratic landslides in the city contrasts with a strong Republican tide in the surrounding area. Pittsburgh was once the figurative capital of a reliably Democratic region. Increasingly, along with its surrounding county, Allegheny, it\u2019s becoming more and more a Democratic island in a Republican sea.    That trend began with Ronald Reagan\u2019s election in 1980. For the decades after that, those outlying counties, such as Westmoreland County, a mix of older industrial towns and newer, more affluent suburbs to Pittsburgh\u2019s east, continued to vote Democratic in local and congressional elections, but trended Republican in statewide and national contests. More recent results suggest they\u2019re not Reagan Democrats anymore\u2014they\u2019re Republicans.    The congressional seat that includes the city is held by Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle, who was first elected in 1994 to replace Republican Rick Santorum, who had gone on to serve in the Senate. Doyle\u2019s district inherited the city when it was combined with another heavily Democratic district in the round of redistricting following the 2000 Census. It\u2019s now the only Democratic-held congressional district west of the Susquehanna River, which bisects the state from its northern tier to the Maryland border. President Obama won the state easily twice, by 10 points in 2008 and by a still comfortable five points in 2012. But his margins were built mainly on his votes in the east. In both years, the 14th was the only western Pennsylvania district that went his way.    For decades, Pittsburgh\u2019s population was one of the oldest in the country. Chris Briem, a University of Pittsburgh economist and expert on the region\u2019s demographics, noted late last year, however, that new Census estimates show that for the first time in recent memory, the proportion of the city\u2019s population aged 65 or older was less than for the nation as a whole. Briem\u2019s statistics show that those older residents, born when heavy manufacturing was the heart of the city\u2019s economy, are on average less well educated than their peers across the country. Now, in an economy driven by educational and medical institutions, the younger cohorts of the city\u2019s workforce are among the most educated in the country. According to 2010 Census estimates, for the younger portion of its workforce, those aged 25-34, Pittsburgh was tied with Washington D.C., and ahead of Boston and New York, in the proportion of its workforce holding graduate professional degrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we\u2019ve evolved; we\u2019ve gone from one extreme to another, to one of the most highly educated work forces in the nation,\u201d Briem told me. \u201cI have to believe that has some impact on politics.\u201d     Jim O\u2019Toole is politics editor at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
