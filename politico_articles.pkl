aVWe carefully studied this contingency. \u201cPreventive war\u201d would result in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of casualties. Metropolitan Seoul\u2019s 26 million people are only 35 miles from the border, within easy range of the North\u2019s missiles and artillery. About 23,000 United States troops, plus their families, live between Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone; in total, at least 200,000 Americans reside in South Korea.\u000a\u000aJapan, and almost 40,000 United States military personnel there, would also be in the cross hairs. The risk to American territory cannot be discounted, nor the prospect of China being drawn into a direct conflict with the United States. Then there would be the devastating impact of war on the global economy.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

McMaster, said last week that if North Korea \u201chad nuclear weapons that can threaten the United States, it\u2019s intolerable from the president\u2019s perspective.\u201d Surely, we must take every reasonable step to reduce and eliminate this threat. And surely there may be circumstances in which war is necessary, including an imminent or actual attack on our nation or our allies.\u000a\u000aBut war is not necessary to achieve prevention, despite what some in the Trump administration seem to have concluded. History shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea \u2014 the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War.\u000a\u000aIt will require being pragmatic.\u000a\u000aFirst, though we can never legitimize North Korea as a nuclear power, we know it is highly unlikely to relinquish its sizable arsenal because Mr. Kim deems the weapons essential to his regime\u2019s survival. The North can now reportedly reach United States territory with its ICBMs. The challenge is to ensure that it would never try.\u000a\u000aBy most assessments, Mr. Kim is vicious and impetuous, but not irrational. Thus, while we quietly continue to refine our military options, we can rely on traditional deterrence by making crystal clear that any use of nuclear weapons against the United States or its allies would result in annihilation of North Korea. Defense Secretary James Mattis struck this tone on Wednesday. The same red line must apply to any proof that North Korea has transferred nuclear weapons to another state or nonstate actor.\u000a\u000aSecond, to avoid blundering into a costly war, the United States needs to immediately halt the reckless rhetoric. John Kelly, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, must assert control over the White House, including his boss, and curb the Trump surrogates whipping up Cuban missile crisis fears.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThird, we must enhance our antimissile systems and other defenses, and those of our allies, which need our reassurances more than ever.\u000a\u000aFourth, we must continue to raise the costs to North Korea of maintaining its nuclear programs. Ratcheting up sanctions, obtaining unfettered United Nations authority to interdict suspect cargo going in or out of the North, increasing Pyongyang\u2019s political isolation and seeding information into the North that can increase regime fragility are all important elements of a pressure campaign.\u000a\u000aFinally, we must begin a dialogue with China about additional efforts and contingencies on the peninsula, and revive diplomacy to test potential negotiated agreements that could verifiably limit or eliminate North Korea\u2019s arsenal.\u000a\u000aRational, steady American leadership can avoid a crisis and counter a growing North Korean threat. It\u2019s past time that the United States started exercising its power responsibly.

aVIn 2010, 26-year-old Mark Zuckerberg announced on The Oprah Winfrey Show that he was donating $100 million to Newark public schools. His partners, then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, outlined a broad five-year plan to change the future of education in the crime-ridden, poverty-stricken city, where nearly half of the public-school students drop out of high school. Describing a scene in her new book, The Prize, the longtime Washington Post reporter Dale Russakoff, who also volunteered as a tutor in the district, writes that when it was Zuckerberg's turn in the TV interview to speak, the Facebook co-founder wasn\u2019t able to finish his opening sentence. At his mention of the $100 million, Oprah interrupted and repeated the number for dramatic effect. The audience exploded. Oprah whooped. Booker, Christie, and audience members stood and applauded. According to Russakoff, Zuckerberg blushed in his seat.\u000a\u000aInspired by his wife (and then-girlfriend) Priscilla Chan\u2019s brief stints as a teacher, and based on his impression that teaching as a profession was undervalued, Zuckerberg wanted to make a contribution to education. While on the show, once the applause died down, he resumed his announcement, citing his desire to see Booker and Christie \u201cturn Newark into a symbol of educational excellence for the whole nation.\u201d The preemptive celebration was telling. There was a mission that had been vaguely articulated by two charismatic, ambitious politicians to improve the lives for what Russakoff calculates to be more than 38,000 of America\u2019s most disadvantaged children. There was a huge pile of money, with the promise of another $100 million in matching donations from corporate investors and philanthropists courted by Booker. To the television audience of typical Americans, the union of celebrity politicians, crusader rhetoric, and a $200 million gift sparked an attack of the warm fuzzies. Philanthropic foundations including that of Bill and Melinda Gates, Eli and Edythe Broad, and the Walton Family spend nearly $4 billion a year on supporting public K-12 education in America. Zuckerberg\u2019s generous gift was unique in the sense that he was investing in an effort that tasked politicians with tackling an entire district\u2019s shortcomings. Without taking an ideological stance in the contentious public debates about the direction of education in America, Russakoff shows readers how a dreamy-seeming union of idealists, money, and opportunity might breed confusion and conflict as readily as hope and renewal. She underscores the maddening complexities of reinvigorating and managing a struggling school system in a downtrodden urban area. Some education reformers characterize teachers\u2019 unions as a major impediment to progress, but The Prize dives into the whole stew of potential obstacles. As the Newark example demonstrates, when it comes to handling a $1 billion budget (particularly one enhanced by philanthropists\u2019 gifts), school and district administrators, for-profit education consultants, and politicians have much at stake besides improving test scores and vanquishing socioeconomic inequality. Parents and teachers alike may not harbor any love for a bloated school district\u2019s inefficient, ineffective status quo. Nonetheless, they may resist a message of change when they feel the messengers\u2019 tone and tactics are condescending, even \u201ccolonial,\u201d as one school board member puts it to Russakoff. For instance, the son of famous late poet and longtime Newark resident Amiri Baraka, Ras Baraka, an educator and Booker\u2019s eventual replacement as mayor, didn\u2019t like seniority protections for teachers either. However, he was even more turned off by what he called \u201cdictatorial bullying\u201d disguised as cooperation. In the notoriously tough Newark, inadequate social services may keep kids traumatized by crime, poverty, drugs, and abuse from embracing the identity of student, even if higher-quality teachers are recruited to take over the education of these children. Zuckerberg\u2019s generous gift tasked politicians with tackling an entire district\u2019s shortcomings. Impeccably researched and originally serialized in The New Yorker, The Prize makes some sense of this Great American Disaster. It shows how well-intentioned reform-minded outsiders may wade clumsily into a school system\u2019s entrenched webs of traditions, allegiances, cultural habits, and underlying conditions. Like an army trying to maintain control over occupied territory\u2014while simultaneously playing Whack-a-Mole with the problems that pop up\u2014they may make more of a mess than the one they mop up.\u000a\u000aRussakoff pulls readers in with richly drawn real-world characters. The Cory Booker she portrays is a \u201cpolitician of the future.\u201d (The Democrat has since taken office as a U.S. Senator.) He shines on the Sundance Channel documentary show Brick City and made headlines rescuing a neighbor from a burning building\u2014an act he immediately shared on Twitter. On an episode of her show after the Oprah announcement, Ellen DeGeneres hands him a Superman costume and calls him \u201cYour Excellency.\u201d He\u2019s spent so much time networking on social media, visiting other cities, and appearing on TV shows that the writer Amiri Baraka, according to Russakoff, dubbed him \u201cThe Virtual One.\u201d Booker may have charmed the don of Earth\u2019s most traversed virtual world, but Russakoff\u2019s reporting remains balanced. She gained intimate access to many of the powerful individuals involved in the Newark initiative and factored in their perspectives along with the stories of teachers, principals, parents, and students. The politicians had monumental hopes. Facing poor outcomes, complacency, and bureaucratic clutter, Booker, who didn\u2019t attend Newark\u2019s public schools, promised that the city would witness \u201ctransformative,\u201d not \u201cincremental,\u201d reform. He also pledged that this work would be \u201cthe people\u2019s project.\u201d Instead of starting with the input of teachers, parents, and students, they hired Cami Anderson, a white woman who had the reputation of \u2018not playing well in the sandbox with others.\u201d Christie appointed as his education commissioner Christopher Cerf, the founder of the consulting firm Global Education Advisors and the former self-styled \u201cchief of transformation\u201d who helped spearhead former New York City schools Chancellor Joel Klein\u2019s redesign of the district. \u201cChange has casualties,\u201d Cerf said to a group of community and business leaders. The key, he told school investors on another occasion, was that, \u201cyou have to override political infrastructure.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the Christie administration, overriding the infrastructure involved hiring waves of for-profit education consultants shortly after the Oprah announcement\u2014including a $3 million contract for Cerf\u2019s old firm. Russakoff reported that a total of $21 million of the $200 million donation ended up going to \u201ctechnocrats\u201d who commuted from Manhattan with high salaries amounting to as much as $1,000 a day. These consultants were skilled at marketing reform efforts, developing systems for evaluating teachers, designing data systems, and reorganizing bureaucratic hierarchies. They didn\u2019t know the community or interact with students in person, but, according to Russakoff\u2019s account, were fluent in education-reform jargon. In a poor, predominantly black and Latino district, their whiteness, high salaries, and talk of \u201cmoving the needle\u201d created tension not only with the on-the-ground employees they were tasked with motivating but also the school board and the union. Booker promised that the city would witness \u201ctransformative,\u201d not \u201cincremental,\u201d reform. There were other casualties. Money was funneled toward agonizing union negotiations as part of efforts to amend the teachers\u2019 contract\u2014including $30 million in back pay as a compromise in exchange for a merit-based pay system\u2014and positions which didn\u2019t entail direct, meaningful contact with students, like teacher coaches and curriculum-design experts. These hires, according to Russakoff, detracted funding that could\u2019ve been otherwise spent on early-childhood education classrooms, G.E.D. and continuing-education programs, and additional teachers, which could have reduced class sizes.\u000a\u000aAmid the grant-led reform initiative, the ambitious Booker and Christie moved on to campaigns for higher office in 2013 and 2015, respectively. (Christie also seriously considered running for president in 2012.) Newark\u2019s public-school enrollment dropped as children transferred to charter schools, which as of the book\u2019s completion, reportedly served 40 percent of the city\u2019s children. These shifts took a toll on schools\u2019 budget. The drop in the traditional public-school population led to school closures and a purge of more recent hires. Christie, Booker, and Cerf advocated for the expansion of charter schools, but, despite Anderson\u2019s warnings, apparently failed to consider the effect this might have on the district\u2019s remaining students, many of whom had to attend new schools and cope with larger classes and fewer resources. Ultimately, Russakoff shows how dramatically overhauling a school system in the name of education might disrupt a community and hurt students. Russakoff\u2019s observations offer searing, though indirect, commentary on the outcomes of the $200 million project. The book is rife with spectacular examples of reformers defining their success exclusively on their own terms. Anderson, for example, tied her own pay bonuses to education gains finalized close to the end of the year. Russakoff memorably analogizes that move to tailoring an answer key to a test-taker\u2019s responses; Anderson never missed a bonus, perhaps because she could decide on the goals once she knew the results. Still, Russakoff gives Anderson her due. Student registration, for example, unfolded with unprecedented smoothness; she freed principals from having to attend to rote paperwork so they could coach teachers in the classrooms; she recognized that trimming fat in the district would eliminate jobs integral to a stable community.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Russakoff also notes how, at a 2013 event celebrating her first two years in office, Anderson gave a speech to charter-school advocates, consultants, and civic leaders in a room plastered with posters inaccurately hailing her accomplishments. It wasn\u2019t a public event, barring potentially frustrated Newark parents from crashing the party. In a follow-up questionnaire, she asked attendees for feedback about the posters, but the choices for each response excluded options that would allow negative feedback; the choices ranged from neutral to intensely positive. \u201cTwo hundred million dollars and almost five years later, there was at least as much rancor as reform.\u201d Plant metaphors help illustrate the rhetoric of American education reform. Dead schools require greener thumbs. The husks of once-formidable teachers and principals are yanked from stubborn perches. New visions refresh tired soil. Students rise like fresh stalks. Booker spoke early on in the initiative of breaking an \u201ciceberg of immovable ... failing schools\u201d and letting them \u201cmelt into many different school models.\u201d He said that they would \u201cflower, just like cherry blossoms.\u201d What actually happened fell short of the imagined transformation. Newark was a hard place to get a good public education, and it still is. Some, but hardly all, of the charter schools are performing well, but test scores elsewhere are uneven. Since 2011, 60 percent of principals across the district departed their positions. And while graduation rates have somewhat improved, the general consensus seems to be that that status quo persists. The district\u2019s future is tenuous amid budget cuts and layoffs. \u201cTwo hundred million dollars and almost five years later,\u201d writes Russakoff, \u201cthere was at least as much rancor as reform.\u201d

aVFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the recent attack threats on Guam are less about the U.S. territory and more about what a large American city like New York or Chicago is worth to the country. Gingrich: We're not ready for an attack from North Korea\u000a\u000aFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Thursday the U.S. is not ready for an attack by North Korea despite President Donald Trump's strong warning to the reclusive regime that further threats will be met with "fire and fury."\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re prepared to really close down the economy decisively \u2014 basically the equivalent of a blockade \u2014 you might be able to have some impact,\u201d Gingrich said about possible ways to halt further development of nuclear weaponry in North Korea. \u201cBut remember, if you do that right now and they decide to react out of desperation with nuclear weapons, we\u2019re not prepared today for a North Korean attack scale they could launch.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aGingrich, a close ally of Trump, said the recent attack threats on Guam are less about the U.S. territory and more about what a large American city like New York or Chicago is worth to the country. And while his viewpoints contradict Trump\u2019s recent rhetoric, Gingrich said a large challenge is whether to take the North Koreans seriously and how to move forward with negotiations actions.\u000a\u000aHe further added that the U.S. only has a 50/50 success rate with its anti-ballistic missile system.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan we destroy them fast enough they don\u2019t get single missile off?

aVPresident Donald Trump has seen his approval ratings steadily decline even among Republican voters | Justin Merriman/Getty Images Trump hits new polling low as base shrinks The president\u2019s base of support has diminished, not increased, in the 7 months he\u2019s been in office.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump says his base of support is \u201cbigger and stronger than ever before.\u201d But his claim is contradicted by a steady stream of recent polling showing that the share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance is shrinking, along with the share of Americans most enthusiastic about his presidency.\u000a\u000aHowever you measure the president\u2019s base, it has diminished, not increased, in the seven months he\u2019s been in office. It\u2019s a slide he\u2019ll need to reverse to avoid dragging down the GOP in the midterms \u2014 and to have a more credible shot at reelection.\u000a\u000aA new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows Trump\u2019s approval rating slipping to the lowest point of his young presidency. While he\u2019s confounded the polls before, it\u2019s the trendline that should be most worrisome to the White House.\u000a\u000aOnly 40 percent of registered voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows, down from a high-water mark of 52 percent in March. And the percentage who approve strongly \u2014 one way to measure the size of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters \u2014 is also at a new low: just 18 percent.\u000a\u000aTrump isn\u2019t bringing converts into his base, either, the poll shows.\u000a\u000aThat fits with other surveys conducted over the past few weeks, all of which show Trump at or near the low-water marks for each pollster. And there is evidence Trump\u2019s backslide has eroded some of his electoral base: The president has lost ground with Republicans and the independent voters who propelled him to victory.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s approval rating among self-identified Trump voters is at 81 percent, down from 86 percent last week. And among Republican voters in the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, the president is at 76 percent, down slightly from 79 percent last week.\u000a\u000aA closer look at those Trump voters who approve of the president\u2019s job performance shows that the Trump base isn\u2019t \u201ceven closer together,\u201d as the president said on Twitter this week. Among Trump voters who approve of his job performance, they are equally divided between those who approve strongly, and those who approve only somewhat.\u000a\u000aOverall, just 41 percent of voters who say they supported Trump last year strongly approve of the job he is doing, equal to the 41 percent who approve only somewhat. Ten percent of Trump voters disapprove of his job performance somewhat, while 7 percent strongly disapprove.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnabated by the turbulence of the last six months, there remains a core base of ardent Trump supporters,\u201d said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. \u201cHowever, that base has unquestionably declined since the president took office. In late January, 56 percent of Trump voters strongly approved of the president, and just 1 percent disapproved. Today, 41 percent strongly approve, and 17 percent disapprove.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump isn\u2019t bringing converts into his base, either, the poll shows. Among voters who say they backed Hillary Clinton last year, more than 3 in 4, 78 percent, strongly disapprove of Trump. Only 8 percent of Clinton voters even somewhat approve of Trump.\u000a\u000aThe new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted Aug. 3-6, surveying 1,992 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\u000a\u000aThe ongoing contraction of Trump\u2019s base has accelerated over the past month. Those trends show Trump\u2019s approval rating has fallen because certain segments of Republicans and independents have soured on him.\u000a\u000aIn a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll a month ago, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating (46 percent) and strongly approve rating (24 percent) were about 6 points higher than in the current survey. But over the past month, Trump has lost 7 points in strong approval among Republicans and 6 points among independents, compared to just 1 point among Democrats. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong approve\u201d number has dropped 8 points among voters who said they supported him in the 2016 election, from 49 percent to 41 percent.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not only the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that shows Trump fading during his first summer in office. Separate surveys from CNN (38 percent approval), CBS News (36 percent), Gallup (37 percent), Quinnipiac University (33 percent), Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP (32 percent) and Rasmussen Reports (41 percent) show Trump\u2019s approval ratings either at or within a few percentage points of his low-water marks.\u000a\u000aAnd in each of them, there are warning signs about the size \u2014 and enthusiasm \u2014 of Trump\u2019s base. In the CNN poll \u2014 which was conducted by SSRS, the network\u2019s new polling partner \u2014 the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump contracted to 24 percent, compared to 30 percent and 33 percent in CNN/ORC polls in early March and early February, respectively. In the Quinnipiac poll, Trump\u2019s strong approval number contracted from 28 percent in late June to 23 percent now.\u000a\u000aThe Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP poll notes that Trump has lost significant ground with core groups over the past month. Trump\u2019s approval rating is down 12 percentage points since July among Republicans, even as it was relatively unchanged from already-low records among Democrats and Republicans. Trump\u2019s decline in the Midwest (minus-7 points) is larger than the overall 5-point drop in his approval, as was his 7-point dip among white men.\u000a\u000aIn the CBS News poll, there are signs it could be difficult for Trump to recover, even as he touts continued economic growth in his first six months in office.

aVThe European Union is in good shape, and that\u2019s in part down to Jean-Claude Juncker, according to \u2026 Jean-Claude Juncker.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission president, one of the few people left in the Commission this week before he heads off on a summer break, told POLITICO that despite a challenging year, the bloc is in the mood to tackle any problems that come its way \u2014 including Brexit and Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is really nothing to complain about,\u201d he said in his office on the 13th floor of the Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters. With recent figures showing economic growth and falling unemployment, and with the budget deficits of member countries decreasing, \u201cthere is something better to report than a year ago\u201d and that\u2019s \u201cnot dependent on my mood, but on facts.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow big a share of the credit does the Commission get for that? It should be sizable, Juncker said, but in reality it\u2019s \u201crelatively small,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201ctoo old, too experienced\u201d to be bothered by national capitals claiming the credit and Brussels getting the blame.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a pattern likely to be seen in the Brexit talks, and Juncker said he had every reason to believe that would be the case.\u000a\u000aBrexit won\u2019t be just an annoyance, he said, more of a headache. \u201cPeople will become more and more conscious of the density of problems on a daily basis, without always being able to provide a coherent answer to these problems.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are better organized than the Trump administration \u2026 if there are any internal difficulties, those difficulties are fixed in a direct conversation instead of by firing people\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000aBut Juncker showed little support for the idea that the Brexit process could be reversed as the talks become fractious.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s \u201cworking hypothesis\u201d is that Brexit will happen, eventually. \u201cI don\u2019t go as far as the Maltese prime minister [Joseph Muscat] who has not ruled out that it will not come to Brexit,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cMy working hypothesis is that it will come to Brexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking in German late on Tuesday afternoon, Juncker repeated what has become a mantra for EU leaders: that Brexit talks are in good hands with Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator. That means Juncker only spends \u201cas much time as it needs\u201d on Brexit, without specifying a time, he said; his chief of staff Martin Selmayr in May said the Commission boss wouldn\u2019t devote more than half an hour a week dealing with Brexit. Instead, Juncker said, he\u2019s focused on \u201cthe EU\u2019s positive agenda\u201d such as \u201ceconomic growth and investments, migration and security, the development of a common defense policy, and strengthening our trade relationships with Japan, Canada and Latin America.\u201d\u000a\u000aJuncker vs. Trump\u000a\u000aThe Commission president didn\u2019t hold back when it came to Donald Trump, saying that he had already \u201cexplained\u201d to the U.S. president that he \u201cshould stop wishing for others to imitate the British\u201d by leaving the bloc.\u000a\u000aHe also mocked Trump for the disorganized way in which he oversees the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d Juncker said when asked about recent events in Washington, culminating in the firing of Anthony Scaramucci as comms director after just 10 days in the role.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are better organized than the Trump administration. That is because if there are any internal difficulties, those difficulties are fixed in a direct conversation instead of by firing people,\u201d Juncker said, noting that he had no reason to fire anyone.\u000a\u000aIf the EU was falling to pieces, as Trump has claimed, \u201cthe western Balkans would lose the European perspective,\u201d Juncker said in the interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of the western Balkans joining the EU soon,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cBut if you take away the European perspective, then we will again experience what we experienced in the 1990s. In this respect, the stability of the composition of the European Union is a prerequisite for the Balkans not being at war again. I hope [Trump] understood that.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that Trump hadn\u2019t of late repeated his call for other EU members to leave the bloc.\u000a\u000aJuncker said his track record since coming into office in 2014 helped him cope with the arrival of Trump and the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the Commission had not ensured that Greece was not expelled from the eurozone in 2015, the balance would be less good,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cAt the time, I fought hard for the stability of the Eurogroup, in particular for Greece [against the wishes of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble]. If I hadn\u2019t done that, the eurozone would have decayed.\u201d\u000a\u000aDifficult neighbors\u000a\u000aJuncker did acknowledge that Europe faces problems, including with Poland and Hungary, which have refused to accept refugees under the EU\u2019s relocation scheme and come under criticism from Brussels for allegedly undermining the rule of law. He took a tougher line with Warsaw \u2014 which will be \u201cmore lonely after Brexit\u201d \u2014 than Budapest.\u000a\u000aAsked about the difference between dealing with the Polish leadership and Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Juncker said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a caring relationship with Orbán. We talk regularly, I see him regularly \u2014 even if it\u2019s not always made public \u2014 because I think I do not want to lose Hungary.\u201d He didn\u2019t make the same pledge about Poland, or even mention it.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of noisy neighbors, Juncker said enlargement talks with Turkey should not be halted, on paper at least. That goes against the line taken by the European Parliament and by the government of Austria, both of which have called for an end to the stalled talks in the wake of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown on opponents.\u000a\u000a\u201cTurkey is our neighbor, we can\u2019t simply let it slip into oblivion,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cI am not in favor of ending the accession talks with Turkey, which is a demand from the European Parliament.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause there is the European Union, war doesn\u2019t need to happen\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the fact is that Turkey is moving away from its self-imposed obligation to become a member of the European Union almost every minute. It\u2019s not the European Union that joins Turkey, but it\u2019s Turkey joining the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aSummer reading list\u000a\u000aJuncker heads off on vacation soon, to Austria. He\u2019ll be taking books by Turkish Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk (\u201cdifficult to read\u201d) and a crime thriller \u201cthat talks about Trump, Clinton, Bush. And because I know these guys and don\u2019t see them described accurately, I\u2019ll write the author a letter.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso on the summer reading list will be \u201c1913: The year before the storm,\u201d by German writer Florian Illies, which Juncker has read before and recommended \u201cto the young people here at the Commission.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a book \u201cdescribing the situation in 1913 in a mood of peacefulness all over Europe. Then the war broke out. I can\u2019t get rid of the thought that it can happen again. But because there is the European Union, it doesn\u2019t need to happen.\u201d

aVWithin hours of Niki Tsongas\u2019 surprise announcement, the rare opening in the Massachusetts congressional delegation attracted several other prominent Democrats. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Tsongas retirement sparks flurry of interest\u000a\u000aMassachusetts Rep. Niki Tsongas\u2019 retirement announcement Wednesday sparked a flurry of interest in her Merrimack Valley-based seat.\u000a\u000aAmong those eyeing a run: Ellen Meehan, the ex-wife of former Democratic Rep. Marty Meehan \u2014 who represented the district before Tsongas \u2014 and a former campaign chair for Tsongas.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will certainly be a highly contested race as it has been in the past,\u201d Meehan told POLITICO. \u201cI\u2019m going to give it very serious consideration.\u201d\u000a\u000aTsongas called Meehan this morning to inform her of her decision not to seek reelection and held another call with donors this afternoon to inform them, which Meehan also participated in.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of Tsongas\u2019 surprise announcement, the rare opening in the Massachusetts congressional delegation attracted several other prominent Democrats. State Sen. Barbara L\u2019Italien and former state Sen. Barry Finegold, who finished fourth behind Tsongas in the 2007 Democratic special primary election, both said in statements that they are also considering running for the seat.\u000a\u000aTwo additional Democratic names from the 2007 special primary election are also surfacing. State Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who came in third place, told POLITICO he is \u201ctaking a look\u201d at running. Another potential candidate is state Sen. Eileen Donoghue, who finished a close second to Tsongas.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The state party is weighing its chances in the district, which only gave Sen. Elizabeth Warren a narrow win in 2012 and was carried by Gov. Charlie Baker in 2014 and Republican Senate candidate Gabriel Gomez in 2013.\u000a\u000aMassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela described the Massachusetts 3rd \u2014 which includes blue-collar Fitchburg, along with reliably Democratic working-class mill towns of Lawrence and Lowell \u2014 as one of the more competitive of the state\u2019s congressional districts for Republicans.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll Massachusetts congressional districts are more blue than red, and there have been relatively few Republicans in the recent decades in Mass congressional delegations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as districts go, it\u2019s one of the more potentially competitive.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong the Republicans looking at the seat is Rick Green, founder of the influential, conservative-leaning nonprofit Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance and owner of a Pepperell-based business.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be putting some thought into it,\u201d said Paul Craney, executive director of MFA. \u201c[He] is clearly the frontrunner.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen briefly considered challenging Warren in next year\u2019s Senate election.\u000a\u000aThe open seat contest could be buffeted by political crosswinds next year. Aside from the Senate and gubernatorial races at the top of the ticket, a potential 2018 ballot question that would reduce the state sales tax could prove especially popular for residents living in a district that stretches along the border of sales tax-free New Hampshire. And strong early organization around another ballot question that would increase taxes on annual income earners over $1 million could draw strong turnout among progressives.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny competitive district is an uphill climb [for Republicans in Massachusetts] and this cycle seems like nationally it\u2019s going to be a good environment for Dems,\u201d Koczela said. \u201cThat makes it more difficult for Republican pickup, but it appears to be the best opportunity Republicans have in the state.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVLONDON \u2014 Non-British employees who opt to leave the two EU agencies relocating from London because of Brexit are set to miss out on financial settlements worth potentially tens of thousands of pounds.\u000a\u000aStaff from the 27 countries remaining in the EU who do not wish to move from London with their agency will be forced to resign, meaning that they miss out on the severance payments. British workers, on the other hand, will have their contracts terminated, meaning they can receive the payments, which are intended to cover a period of unemployment.\u000a\u000aThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and European Banking Authority (EBA), with their 890 and 184 staff respectively, will leave their current homes in London\u2019s Canary Wharf in March 2019. The end of July was the deadline for cities across the EU to submit bids to the European Commission to host the prestigious agencies. The final decision on a new location will be taken in November.\u000a\u000aThe staff have no say in where they end up, so many are biding their time and will only make a decision about whether to relocate with their agency once they know which European city will be its new host.\u000a\u000aAccording to documents seen by POLITICO, the agency warned that 75 percent of employees could quit.\u000a\u000aUnder current rules, U.K. employees of the agencies would have their contracts terminated because EU staff must be a national of a member country unless the agency employing them makes a specific exception. Meanwhile, employees from the countries remaining in the EU who do not wish to relocate will have to resign, meaning that they forfeit generous benefits.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe staff representatives will follow closely all the consequences of Brexit for staff \u2026 and we will endeavor to mitigate the negative consequences,\u201d said Félix Géradon, deputy secretary-general of Union Syndicale Bruxelles, the largest EU staff union.\u000a\u000aAccording to the 2017 EBA expenditure report, 134 of the agency\u2019s staff are temporary, 33 are on full-time contracts and 17 are seconded national experts. Just 12 of the staff are U.K. citizens according to the EBA annual report. The EMA\u2019s annual report says in 2016 they had 587 temporary staff, and 143 contract staff. It employs around 60 U.K. nationals.\u000a\u000aAt stake are severance benefits for staff whose contracts are terminated. These benefits cover up to three years after leaving the agency during which a former employee is out of work. (They lose the benefit if they find another job.) In the first year, the benefits are worth 60 percent of their basic salary, falling to 45 percent in the second year and 30 percent in the third year.\u000a\u000aMost EBA staff are on the EU\u2019s so-called AD7 pay grade, meaning they earn a basic salary of \u20ac5,568.11 per month, so a terminated employee can claim over \u20ac90,000 in possible unemployment benefits over the three years if they do not find another job.\u000a\u000aBudapest precedent\u000a\u000aThere is a precedent for an agency relocation \u2014 in 2013, the EU decided to move its EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) from Bramshill, west of London, to a new base in Budapest. CEPOL\u2019s director Ferenc Banfi at the time said all staff were expected to take up duties at the new location, and that \u201cnon-compliance with this instruction would be considered as resignation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe decision prompted a series of legal challenges from staff. One of these cases was dismissed by the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, others are still pending and two were settled out of court.\u000a\u000aAccording to a spokeswoman for the EMA, staff measures as a result of Brexit will be shaped by the employment regulations, as well as consultation with the European Commission, and \u201cpast experience of other agencies relocating within the EU will also be taken into account.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said measures would be finalized once the decision on a future seat is taken. According to documents seen by POLITICO, the agency warned that 75 percent of employees could quit.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the final decision on how to treat U.K. employees is still the \u201csubject of ongoing discussions at the level of the European Commission,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe EBA declined to comment.\u000a\u000aAt the moment, agencies have very limited room for maneuver as \u201cit is impossible for the agencies to grant even one euro more\u201d than regulations dictate, union representative Géradon said. So although a private sector solution might be to provide financial benefits either to incentivize staff to move, or to cushion the blow for those who resign, that isn\u2019t possible for the EBA and EMA.\u000a\u000aThe union has proposed that staffers who do not wish to relocate could have their contracts terminated instead of having to resign. Although it would be cheaper to force employees to resign without benefits, it could be seen as the agencies neglecting their \u201cduty of care\u201d to employees given the exceptional circumstances, Géradon said. \u201c[Brexit] is, of course, different from the reassignment of a few colleagues,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are anxious, but they know that nobody knows anything\u201d \u2014 Félix Géradon, deputy secretary-general of Union Syndicale Bruxelles\u000a\u000aGéradon said he expects that come November, when it becomes clear where the agencies are moving to, staff members will start to decide whether they will follow. For now, though, there is still huge uncertainty.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are anxious,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they know that nobody knows anything, so they don\u2019t ask too specific questions because nobody can answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarmen Paun contributed reporting.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Are you an EBA or EMA staff member? If so POLITICO would like to talk to you about how the move is affecting you. EBA employees please email Cat Contiguglia (ccontiguglia@politico.eu). EMA employees please email Helen Collis (hcollis@politico.eu). We will treat your email as strictly confidential.\u000a\u000aCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the previous home of the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training. It was located in Bramshill, west of London.

aVMark Zuckerberg has no plans to run for president, the Facebook founder and CEO told BuzzFeed News Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in response to a question asking if he had any plans to run for president. \u201cI'm focused on building our community at Facebook and working on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,\u201d referring to the limited-liability corporation he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, founded in 2015 to advance human potential and promote equality through major bets in education and science research. Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether he\u2019d explicitly ruled out a run.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg\u2019s response comes after weeks of speculation from the tech press and beyond, set off by a series of events that indicated a run might be in the cards, including a pledge to visit the approximately 30 US states he hadn\u2019t yet been to. \u201cWill Mark Zuckerberg Be Our Next President?\u201d Vanity Fair asked in January.\u000a\u000aThe clues were there. Zuckerberg, who had previously been described as an atheist, said over the holidays that he believes religion is important. He\u2019s touring the US asking \u201cfolks\u201d about how they live. He hired a former White House photographer to take his Facebook pics. He included a clause about potentially serving for office into Facebook\u2019s stock restructuring deal, and he hired a former presidential campaign manager to help his quasi-charitable works. But as Zuckerberg indicated Tuesday, he\u2019s more interested in wielding influence from Menlo Park than Washington, DC. A source close to Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed News the 32-year-old CEO has privately denied it as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no truth to the idea that Mark is running for office and I\u2019ve heard it directly from him,\u201d the source told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: For Mark, Facebook is global community that already plays this huge part in the lives of billions of people around the world and plays an incredibly important role in shaping the base on the issues that matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aZuckerberg is preparing for a political battle, the source was careful to emphasize, but as a private citizen focused on the goals he has already outlined through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. \u201cThere is absolutely a possibility that Mark may choose to play a stronger role in the political system and political debates,\u201d the source said. Zuckerberg has been \u201cvery transparent\u201d in his advocacy for \u201cgreater equality and optimizing research that find cures for disease and solves the fundamental problems of our time, but I really don\u2019t see him stepping away from Facebook.\u201d

aVWho could blame the people who felt abandoned and ignored by the major parties for reaching in despair for a candidate who offered oversimplified answers to infinitely complex questions and managed to entertain them in the process? With hindsight, it is clear that we all but ensured the rise of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aI will let the liberals answer for their own sins in this regard. (There are many.) But we conservatives mocked Barack Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure. It was we conservatives who, upon Obama\u2019s election, stated that our No. 1 priority was not advancing a conservative policy agenda but making Obama a one-term president\u2014the corollary to this binary thinking being that his failure would be our success and the fortunes of the citizenry would presumably be sorted out in the meantime. It was we conservatives who were largely silent when the most egregious and sustained attacks on Obama\u2019s legitimacy were leveled by marginal figures who would later be embraced and legitimized by far too many of us. It was we conservatives who rightly and robustly asserted our constitutional prerogatives as a co-equal branch of government when a Democrat was in the White House but who, despite solemn vows to do the same in the event of a Trump presidency, have maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued. To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical faculties. And tremendous powers of denial.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been sympathetic to this impulse to denial, as one doesn\u2019t ever want to believe that the government of the United States has been made dysfunctional at the highest levels, especially by the actions of one\u2019s own party. Michael Gerson, a con­servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, \u201cThe conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,\u201d and conservative institutions \u201cwith the blessings of a president \u2026 have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor a conservative, that\u2019s an awfully bitter pill to swallow. So as I layered in my defense mechanisms, I even found myself saying things like, \u201cIf I took the time to respond to every presiden­tial tweet, there would be little time for anything else.\u201d Given the volume and velocity of tweets from both the Trump campaign and then the White House, this was certainly true. But it was also a monumental dodge. It would be like Noah saying, \u201cIf I spent all my time obsessing about the coming flood, there would be little time for anything else.\u201d At a certain point, if one is being honest, the flood becomes the thing that is most worthy of attention. At a certain point, it might be time to build an ark.\u000a\u000aUnder our Constitution, there simply are not that many people who are in a position to do something about an executive branch in chaos. As the first branch of government (Article I), the Congress was designed expressly to assert itself at just such moments. It is what we talk about when we talk about \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d Too often, we observe the unfolding drama along with the rest of the country, passively, all but saying, \u201cSomeone should do something!\u201d without seeming to realize that that someone is us. And so, that unnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch is an abdication, and those in positions of leadership bear particular responsibility.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

We do not have to go very far back to identify these exemplars\u2014the Bob Doles and Howard Bakers and Richard Lugars of the Senate. Vigorous partisans, yes, but even more important, principled constitutional conservatives whose primary interest was in governing and making America truly great.\u000a\u000aBut then the period of collapse and dysfunction set in, amplified by the internet and our growing sense of alienation from each other, and we lost our way and began to rationalize away our principles in the process. But where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals\u2014even as we put at risk our institutions and our values\u2014then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn\u2019t be Pyrrhic ones. If this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it. If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?\u000a\u000aIf this was our Faustian bargain, then it was not worth it. If ultimately our principles were so malleable as to no longer be principles, then what was the point of political victories in the first place?\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the strange specter of an American president\u2019s seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians created such a cognitive dissonance among my generation of conservatives\u2014who had come of age under existential threat from the Soviet Union\u2014that it was almost impossible to believe. Even as our own government was documenting a con­certed attack against our democratic processes by an enemy foreign power, our own White House was rejecting the authority of its own intelligence agencies, disclaiming their findings as a Democratic ruse and a hoax. Conduct that would have had conservatives up in arms had it been exhibited by our political opponents now had us dumbstruck.\u000a\u000aIt was then that I was compelled back to Senator Goldwater\u2019s book, to a chapter entitled \u201cThe Soviet Menace.\u201d Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, this part of Goldwater\u2019s critique had seemed particularly anachronistic. The lesson here is that nothing is gone forever, especially when it comes to the devouring ambition of despotic men. As Goldwater wrote in that chapter:\u000a\u000aOur forebears knew that \u201ckeeping a Republic\u201d meant, above all, keeping it safe from foreign transgressors; they knew that a people cannot live and work freely, and develop national institutions conducive to freedom, except in peace and with independence.\u000a\u000aSo, where should Republicans go from here? First, we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to speak out if the president \u201cplays to the base\u201d in ways that damage the Republican Party\u2019s ability to grow and speak to a larger audience. Second, Republicans need to take the long view when it comes to issues like free trade: Populist and protectionist policies might play well in the short term, but they handicap the country in the long term. Third, Republicans need to stand up for institutions and prerogatives, like the Senate filibuster, that have served us well for more than two centuries.\u000a\u000aWe have taken our \u201cinstitutions conducive to freedom,\u201d as Goldwater put it, for granted as we have engaged in one of the more reckless periods of politics in our history. In 2017, we seem to have lost our appreciation for just how hard won and vulnerable those institutions are.\u000a\u000aJeff Flake is a Republican senator from Arizona.

aVThe party has lost confidence in her as a unifying leader and a party spokesperson. Dems turn on Wasserman Schultz\u000a\u000aDemocratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is in a behind-the-scenes struggle with the White House, congressional Democrats and Washington insiders who have lost confidence in her as both a unifying leader and reliable party spokesperson at a time when they need her most.\u000a\u000aLong-simmering doubts about her have reached a peak after two recent public flubs: criticizing the White House\u2019s handling of the border crisis and comparing the tea party to wife beaters.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe perception of critics is that Wasserman Schultz spends more energy tending to her own political ambitions than helping Democrats win. This includes using meetings with DNC donors to solicit contributions for her own PAC and campaign committee, traveling to uncompetitive districts to court House colleagues for her potential leadership bid and having DNC-paid staff focus on her personal political agenda.\u000a\u000aShe\u2019s become a liability to the DNC, and even to her own prospects, critics say.\u000a\u000a( WATCH: Debbie Wasserman Schultz's greatest hits)\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess the best way to describe it is, it\u2019s not that she\u2019s losing a duel anywhere, it\u2019s that she seems to keep shooting herself in the foot before she even gets the gun out of the holster,\u201d said John Morgan, a major donor in Wasserman Schultz\u2019s home state of Florida.\u000a\u000aThe stakes are high. Wasserman Schultz is a high-profile national figure who helped raise millions of dollars and served as a Democratic messenger to female voters during a presidential election in which Obama needed to exploit the gender gap to win, but November\u2019s already difficult midterms are looming.\u000a\u000aOne example that sources point to as particularly troubling: Wasserman Schultz repeatedly trying to get the DNC to cover the costs of her wardrobe.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Wasserman Schultz attempted to get the DNC to pay for her clothing at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, multiple sources say, but was blocked by staff in the committee\u2019s Capitol Hill headquarters and at President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign headquarters in Chicago.\u000a\u000aShe asked again around Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2013, pushing so hard that Obama senior adviser \u2014 and one-time Wasserman Schultz booster \u2014 Valerie Jarrett had to call her directly to get her to stop. (Jarrett said she does not recall that conversation.) One more time, according to independent sources with direct knowledge of the conversations, she tried again, asking for the DNC to buy clothing for the 2013 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\u000a\u000a( Also on POLITICO: DNC chief rips Christie on Bridgegate)\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz denies that she ever tried to get the DNC to pick up her clothing tab. \u201cI think that would be a totally inappropriate use of DNC funds,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI never asked someone to do that for me, I would hope that no one would seek that on my behalf, and I\u2019m not aware that anyone did.\u201d\u000a\u000aTracie Pough, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s chief of staff at the DNC and her congressional office, was also involved in making inquiries about buying the clothing, according to sources. Pough denies making, directing or being aware of any inquiries.\u000a\u000aBut sources with knowledge of the discussions say Wasserman Schultz\u2019s efforts couldn\u2019t have been clearer. \u201cShe felt firmly that it should happen,\u201d said a then-DNC staffer of the clothing request. \u201cEven after it was explained that it couldn\u2019t, she remained indignant.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis story is based on interviews with three dozen current and former DNC staffers, committee officers, elected officials, state party leaders and top Democratic operatives in Washington and across the country.\u000a\u000a( Also on POLITICO: DNC chief walks back Walker 'words')\u000a\u000aMany expect a nascent Clinton campaign will engineer her ouster. Hurt feelings go back to spring 2008, when while serving as a co-chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, Wasserman Schultz secretly reached out to the Obama campaign to pledge her support once the primary was over, sources say.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Obama team was so serious about replacing her after 2012 that they found a replacement candidate to back before deciding against it, according to people familiar with those discussions.\u000a\u000aObama and Wasserman Schultz have rarely even talked since 2011. They don\u2019t meet about strategy or messaging. They don\u2019t talk much on the phone.\u000a\u000aInstead, the DNC chairwoman stakes out the president of the United States at the end of photo lines at events and fundraisers.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou need another picture, Debbie?\u201d Obama tends to say, according to people who\u2019ve been there for the encounters.\u000a\u000a( Also on POLITICO: DWS: Walker gives 'back of his hand')\u000a\u000aChairing the DNC should be a political steppingstone \u2014 Ed Rendell, Terry McAuliffe and Tim Kaine all went on to bigger things, and even Howard Dean used the post to rehabilitate himself from the man who yelped his way out of a presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aAnd without a doubt, the Florida congresswoman has had plenty of successes. She has overseen the integration of key elements of the Obama campaigns, including its voter file and data programs. After being left with $25 million in bills from the Obama campaign, the DNC enters the fall with the debt cleared and over $7 million on hand. She\u2019s started new efforts to build relationships with labor and small business leaders and prioritized the DNC\u2019s outreach to female voters.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy tenure here is not about me,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said in an interview with POLITICO at DNC headquarters. \u201cI like to help build this party. That\u2019s what I love and that\u2019s what I focused on.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe rejects the idea she is over-extended.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have always taken on a lot. It\u2019s what I love to do. I don\u2019t do anything halfway,\u201d she said, dismissing any worries that she\u2019s overextended. \u201cIn some cases, it\u2019s sniping; in other cases people are worried about me. I have a lot of Jewish mothers out there that I think very kindly say, \u2018My god, she\u2019s doing so much.\u2019 It\u2019s OK.\u201d\u000a\u000a( QUIZ: How well do you know Debbie Wasserman Schultz?)\u000a\u000aSPLIT WITH OBAMA\u000a\u000aThe White House is staring at two years of life under a GOP-controlled House and Senate. The DNC chair, however, isn\u2019t involved in the strategy talks with the president.\u000a\u000aThey don\u2019t want her there.\u000a\u000aFor even the occasional Obama briefing by the heads of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, she is not invited. That includes a key session on July 31, the last day the House was in town before the August recess, when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), DCCC Chair Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) and DCCC executive director Kelly Ward sat on the couches in the Oval Office running through the political landscape for the president.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz described her relationship with the president as speaking to him on an \u201cas-needed basis, whenever I have a need to talk to them or give them a sense of what\u2019s going on, but also, as it happens, as we connect on the trail.\u201d She declined to provide details of how often, where or when.\u000a\u000aWhen Kaine was DNC chairman during the president\u2019s first year in office, he had a monthly lunch with Obama on the calendar (although not all of the lunches actually occurred as planned). Wasserman Schultz demurred when asked if it would be fair to characterize her as speaking \u201cregularly\u201d with the president.\u000a\u000a( Also on POLITICO: Wasserman Schultz and Pelosi split)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe best way to describe it is: as often as we need,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAccording to multiple people familiar with the president, Obama\u2019s opinion of Wasserman Schultz was sealed back in 2011. Shortly after becoming chairwoman, she pushed hard for a meeting with the president that she kicked off by complaining that she had been blocked from hiring the daughter of a donor \u2014 who\u2019d been on staff in her congressional office \u2014 as a junior staffer to be the DNC\u2019s Jewish community liaison.\u000a\u000aObama summed up his reaction to staff afterward: \u201cReally?\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked about the relationship between the president and Wasserman Schultz, the White House issued a statement praising the chairwoman and DNC staff.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s foremost political goal is helping Democrats do well in the midterms \u2014 and Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is doing a great job in that effort,\u201d said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \u201cThe president is grateful for all of the hard work being done by the entire team at the DNC. He fully recognizes the value of their work, and that\u2019s why he has worked so hard to support them.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast summer, Wasserman Schultz and the White House clashed again.\u000a\u000a( Also on POLITICO: DWS, O'Malley agree on border kids)\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz resisted Obama circle favorites Marlon Marshall and Buffy Wicks replacing Patrick Gaspard as executive director. When Jarrett found out that Wasserman Schultz had had her daughter sit in on the interview with Wicks at the end of July 2013, she called to register her dismay, describing Wasserman Schultz\u2019s behavior, according to people familiar with the conversation, as \u201ccompletely unprofessional and rude.\u201d\u000a\u000aShortly thereafter, the DNC chairwoman spoke at length to POLITICO about how she planned to leverage the donors she\u2019d met as DNC chairwoman into fundraising to build chits for her own political future. Jarrett was infuriated and called Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000aJarrett had always been a defender, she reminded Wasserman Schultz, according to people familiar with the call, but now she delivered a clear message: She was disappointed by the narrative in the story the chairwoman herself had fed, and cautioned her to remember that Obama is head of the party.\u000a\u000aObama\u2019s team came very close to replacing Wasserman Schultz after the 2012 race.\u000a\u000a( Driving the Day: Democrats distancing from Obama?)\u000a\u000aAt the Charlotte convention, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s DNC staffers assembled a collection of perks \u2014 entry to her skybox, access to the chairwoman\u2019s lounge \u2014 for House members and candidates she was hoping to attract for her leadership run and DNC voting members she would need to retain her DNC post should Obama replace her. She also had her DNC staff explore and plot how she could remain chairwoman if Obama lost the race.\u000a\u000aA DNC official said Wasserman Schultz denies she ever made or directed staff to make such inquiries in the event the president was going to lose, but sources say White House and Obama campaign staff were furious.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe was trying to figure out what the protocol was,\u201d said a DNC staffer at the time. \u201cWhat was the exact length of her term, what would it take to run.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow @politico\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPhilippe Léglise-Costa will be on the front line in negotiating the EU's long-term budget | Bertrand Langlois/AFP via Getty Images France to name Philippe Léglise-Costa as new EU ambassador The veteran civil servant will be on the front lines of advancing Macron\u2019s agenda on the world stage.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s next ambassador to the European Union will be Philippe Léglise-Costa, a high-ranking civil servant deeply versed in EU affairs, officials involved in his nomination told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aLéglise-Costa, who currently runs the European Affairs Directorate out of the prime minister\u2019s office, will take over from veteran diplomat Pierre Sellal when he heads into retirement sometime in October, the officials said.\u000a\u000aBeing France\u2019s permanent representative to the EU will thrust Léglise-Costa \u2014 who was EU adviser to President François Hollande when Emmanuel Macron was deputy chief of staff \u2014 into the heart of European affairs at a decisive moment for the Union.\u000a\u000aBrexit negotiations will be a major area of focus at least for the first two years of his mandate, whether or not they reach a conclusion.\u000a\u000aLéglise-Costa will be on the front line in negotiating the EU\u2019s long-term budget, known as the multiannual financial framework, a lengthy and complex process that involves jockeying between member states.\u000a\u000aAlso high on Léglise-Costa\u2019s agenda will be seeing through European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s investment agenda, while preparing for European Parliament elections in 2019 that are seen as a litmus test for Euroskepticism across the bloc.\u000a\u000aBut his overarching duty will be to advance France\u2019s agenda on the European stage, with a mandate from President Macron to press for deeper integration in areas ranging from security to defense and border control.\u000a\u000aMacron campaigned on an ambitious promise of fixing imbalances in the eurozone by establishing a standalone budget, a finance minister and possibly even a parliament for the common currency area.\u000a\u000aFor now, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been open to Macron\u2019s ideas but reserved, as she stopped short of embracing any plans to pool funds or risks ahead of Germany\u2019s parliamentary election in September.\u000a\u000aBut a French diplomat told POLITICO that the likelihood of Merkel being reelected opens up a four-year period of stability in Europe\u2019s two biggest countries which would set the conditions for major advances. If Britain leaves the EU, then France and Germany will carry even greater weight, and the eurozone, along with its Nordic neighbors, will be in a strong position to press forward with deeper integration.\u000a\u000aCrucial trio\u000a\u000aA graduate of the elite Polytechnique University, the Toulouse native is taking over as permanent representative after a string of high-level posts including deputy permanent representative to the EU and European affairs sherpa to the president until 2017.\u000a\u000aAt the permanent representation, Léglise-Costa will be in constant contact with Macron\u2019s inner circle, notably his diplomatic adviser, Philippe Etienne, and his EU and G20 adviser, Clément Beaune.\u000a\u000aLéglise-Costa and Etienne have a decades-long working relationship, and he and Beaune were in close contact when the latter was advising Macron on EU affairs at the finance ministry.\u000a\u000aIn close coordination with Macron, the three men will be in charge of fine-tuning French day-to-day policy on the European stage, with Etienne taking a special interest in Germany and Beaune well-versed in trade and anti-dumping issues.\u000a\u000aThe new ambassador is known for his mastery of EU affairs and mechanics. He will have to prove during his first few months that he can embrace the role\u2019s more political and outward-facing aspects, at which his predecessor Sellal excelled.\u000a\u000aAt the European Affairs Directorate of the prime minister\u2019s office, Léglise-Costa is likely to be succeeded by Alexis Dutertre, who was deputy permanent representative before returning to France this year.\u000a\u000aThe nominations, three months into Macron\u2019s presidency, are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. They come amid intensive maneuvering for coveted diplomatic jobs across the French network.\u000a\u000aAmbassador to the United States Gérard Araud is expected to remain in his post, while China envoy Maurice Gourdault-Montagne took over as secretary-general of the foreign ministry.\u000a\u000aAnne-Marie Descôtes took over from Etienne as French ambassador to Berlin.

aVDUBLIN \u2014 Ireland has loudly proclaimed its unity with rest of the EU since Britain voted to leave the bloc, but a clash over the Irish low-tax regime could shatter the cohesion.\u000a\u000aIn Irish business circles, Brexit has triggered a brainstorm on how best to use it as an opportunity to push back on the EU\u2019s crackdown on Irish tax policy.\u000a\u000aTheir nuclear option: \u201cIrexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt doesn\u2019t trip off the tongue like the British version, but the theory goes that any EU encroachment on the low corporate tax rates that have underwritten Ireland\u2019s economic transformation in recent decades could undermine its unmatched enthusiasm for the EU and amplify what are, for now, a tiny minority of voices calling for an Irish exit from the European Union.\u000a\u000aFor the government in Dublin, Brexit already poses huge problems, such as the reemergence of a border with Northern Ireland that could destabilize the Good Friday peace accord, and the threat to Irish business sectors that are heavily reliant on trade with the U.K.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the election of the staunchly Europhile Emmanuel Macron as French president have combined to reestablish France and Germany as twin engines for the bloc. The Franco-German duo are keen to rewrite the economic rules of the eurozone, possibly targeting one of Ireland\u2019s touchiest subjects: its bargain-basement corporate taxes.\u000a\u000aWithout openly invoking the threat of an Irish exit, the business community spies an opportunity to shove the EU in the opposite direction. Business lobbying group IBEC is urging Dublin and the European Commission to relax spending rules to allow investment on infrastructure and for exemptions from EU state aid rules to support Irish businesses hit by Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur taxation policy has been the same now for more than 40 years. We will not be changing it. It\u2019s straightforward\u201d \u2014 Dara Murphy, an EPP vice president\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is going to be very hard fought,\u201d said Fergal O\u2019Brien, IBEC\u2019s director of policy and public affairs. \u201cThere\u2019s real money at stake.\u201d\u000a\u000aDublin is currently fighting a European Commission ruling that its tax treatment of U.S. tech giant Apple was generous to the point of illegal state aid. The decision prompted the center-right Fine Gael-led government to strike a rare Euroskeptic note: It accused the Commission of interfering with Irish sovereignty.\u000a\u000aSome observers, however, saw the decision as an indication that the EU\u2019s patience with Ireland on tax may have run out.\u000a\u000aWithin weeks of the Apple decision, the Commission reanimated an old tax reform plan: a move to adopt the so-called common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). Defeated by the U.K. and Ireland in its last iteration in 2011, the reform package aims to prevent tax avoidance and allow company profits to be taxed according to where the revenue is earned.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the emergence of Macron, whose electoral program accused Apple and Ireland of \u201cdistorting competition\u201d in Europe, has bolstered French confidence in pushing for a different fiscal vision for the EU now that the U.K. is leaving.\u000a\u000aHis new finance and economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, says France aims to agree on a common tax policy with Germany in 2018 to form the basis of \u201charmonization\u201d of tax rates across the eurozone within five years. Ireland\u2019s finance ministry declined to comment on the plans.\u000a\u000aNo backdoor changes\u000a\u000aThe EU does not currently have the power to control national tax rates, and any change to this would require a unanimous vote by all members. The CCCTB plan is seen as a plot to change this through the backdoor \u2014 and Dublin is adamant that it will not pass.\u000a\u000aIBEC\u2019s O\u2019Brien says the CCCTB plan could threaten half of Ireland\u2019s corporate tax base.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, he argues, \u201cif we see a U.K. outside the EU without EU state aid constraints, that\u2019s going to be a big challenge for Ireland. You could see very sharp direct competition.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think there will be a further move toward a German-French axis [in the EU], and that is something that we are very uncomfortable with\u201d \u2014 Retired diplomat Ray Bassett\u000a\u000aThe main political parties are unanimous in their defense of the corporate tax policy as a non-negotiable mainstay of Ireland\u2019s economic transformation since the 1950s. According to this view, lower taxes are required to make up for the insurmountable weaknesses of Ireland\u2019s peripheral position geographically and its tiny domestic market.\u000a\u000aEven during the bailout years in the wake of the global financial crisis, when the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and Commission oversaw Irish finances, Dublin managed to cling on to its 12.5 percent rate.\u000a\u000aToday, as a sign of commitment to its low tax policy, the Irish government is completely opposed to accepting the \u20ac13 billion in back taxes, plus interest, that European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager ordered Apple to pay Ireland last August.\u000a\u000aIreland has appealed against the ruling in lockstep with Apple in the General Court of the European Union, with the Irish public\u2019s backing: A poll by the Irish Times and Ipsos Mori at the time found a majority of the austerity-weary population supported the government\u2019s decision to appeal.\u000a\u000aThey knew exactly what they would be giving up. The amount Vestager said Apple owed Ireland was nearly as much as Ireland\u2019s entire health budget for 2017, which was \u20ac14.6 billion.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur taxation policy has been the same now for more than 40 years. We will not be changing it. It\u2019s straightforward,\u201d said Dara Murphy, a European People\u2019s Party vice president and former Irish European affairs minister. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter for Ireland.\u201d\u000a\u000aTough sell\u000a\u000aDespite all the sound and the fury, Irexit remains a tough sell for now.\u000a\u000aUnlike the U.K., Ireland doesn\u2019t have a wealthy past to look back to prior to the EU, having transformed from one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries into one of its richest during its time in the bloc.\u000a\u000aLeaving would mean abandoning the euro and facing the repayment of Ireland\u2019s outsize debt in its new, presumably devalued, currency. It would face a return to the heavy trade dependence on the U.K. that characterized its economy up to the 1970s.\u000a\u000aAnd irrespective of tax rates, multinationals like Facebook and Google would presumably not retain their European headquarters in a nation of 4.6 million that was no longer part of the single market.\u000a\u000aThe most recent Eurobarometer poll, published this month, rated Ireland the most positive country in the EU, with 77 percent of Irish people surveyed expressing optimism about the future of the bloc, and overwhelming majorities in favor of the euro, single market and immigration from the EU. It showed no evidence that Irish support for EU membership has been affected by the U.K. decision to leave the bloc.\u000a\u000aRay Bassett, a retired diplomat who has become a high-profile critic of the Irish government\u2019s approach to Brexit, is one of the lone voices advocating that the implications of Brexit are such that Ireland should consider matching it.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe European Union is changing and without the British as allies I think there will be a further move toward a German-French axis, and that is something that we are very uncomfortable with,\u201d Bassett told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aHis polemic on Irexit for right-wing U.K. think tank Policy Exchange was received with such enthusiasm by Brexiteers that it prompted a series of rebuttals in the Irish media, with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar saying the EU \u201cis a common European home that we helped to build and we\u2019re going to stay where we belong, at the heart of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aBe less prescriptive\u000a\u000aIrexit\u2019s only champions in parliament are a handful of radical-left politicians for whom it\u2019s not a priority issue. The most Euro-critical large party, Sinn Féin, supports Ireland\u2019s EU membership and is campaigning for special status for Northern Ireland to allow it to stay in the bloc.\u000a\u000aAll told, it would be a leap to conclude that opposition to the European Commission\u2019s corporation tax proposals could give rise to an Irish desire to end EU membership itself.\u000a\u000aCommission representatives, for their part, refused to get dragged into the debate. Instead, the EU\u2019s executive arm pointed to an impact assessment that it conducted as part of the CCCTB proposal.\u000a\u000aThe assessment included an analysis on how CCCTB would change the tax receipts of each EU country. For Ireland, that analysis showed a drop of -0.14 percent in its corporate tax receipts and a largely budget-neutral effect as a whole.\u000a\u000aNo doubt, Ireland lost a key ally on shaping the EU\u2019s corporate tax policy when the U.K. voted to leave.\u000a\u000aBut Conor O\u2019Brien, a senior tax partner at KPMG, is among those arguing that Brexit has actually given Ireland additional arguments with which to defend its corporate tax rate.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne is, given Ireland is under more economic pressure now as a result of its biggest trading partner leaving the EU, the low corporation tax is important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other is, perhaps the EU should be a little bit less prescriptive with countries because the EU imposing its will is perhaps why Britain left.\u201d\u000a\u000aBjarke Smith-Meyer contributed reporting.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Imagesv Trump\u2019s \u2018fire and fury\u2019 threat to North Korea sparks new fears of war Trump\u2019s comments drew a counterthreat from North Korea, which said it is \u2018carefully examining\u2019 a preemptive strike on Guam.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s warning Tuesday that North Korea \u201cwill be met with fire and fury\u201d if it continues its saber rattling sparked new fears that the standoff over the regime\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs could devolve into a shooting war.\u000a\u000aThe seemingly off-the-cuff broadside also reignited concerns raised during the presidential campaign that Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric, including his previous calls to build up the American nuclear arsenal, could be dangerously destabilizing.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe greatest North Korean threat we face is not from a nuclear-tipped missile hitting the U.S. mainland but from Washington stumbling into an inadvertent nuclear war on the Korean peninsula,\u201d Siegfried Hecker, a former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory and a nuclear expert who has visited North Korea seven times since 2004, said in an email.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s statements exacerbate\u201d such concerns, Hecker said.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s remarks drew an almost immediate response from North Korea, which issued a statement saying it was \u201ccarefully examining\u201d a plan to launch a preemptive strike on the U.S. territory of Guam, which lies about 2,000 miles away.\u000a\u000aTrump made the comments from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is staying as the White House undergoes renovations for much of this month.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d he told reporters, referring to the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \u201cHe has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire and fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s warning followed a report by the Washington Post, citing a confidential assessment, that North Korea has successfully created a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles.\u000a\u000aThe United Nations Security Council on Saturday unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea estimated at more than $1 billion as punishment for the nation\u2019s outlawed nuclear and missile programs.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has vowed in response to continue strengthening its nuclear arsenal and threatened \u201cthousands-fold\u201d revenge against the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe communist government pledged to \u201cmake the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crimes it commits against the state and people of this country,\u201d warning it will \u201cteach the U.S. a severe lesson.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s threat on Tuesday came after a reporter at Bedminster asked about North Korea after the president delivered a statement on the opioid crisis. The White House declined to explain Trump\u2019s choice of words. Counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters later Tuesday at the nearby Bridgewater Marriott Hotel that the president\u2019s remarks were \u201cvery strong and obvious,\u201d declining to elaborate further.\u000a\u000aSeveral White House officials privately downplayed the statement, saying in some ways \u201cit\u2019s the way Trump talks,\u201d in the words of one.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s pissed off in private and he\u2019s pissed off in public,\u201d this person said.\u000a\u000aThe statement was not vetted through State Department channels, one official said, but Trump has asked an increasing number of questions about North Korea, this official said.\u000a\u000aA Pentagon spokesman, Colonel Robert Manning, said he was \u201cnot aware of any change in policy\u201d and directed all questions to the White House. The State Department also declined to comment.\u000a\u000aBut Trump\u2019s use of the type of melodramatic rhetoric often employed by the reclusive North Korean leader and his government propaganda arms struck some experts as risky.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I think the risk is, is that the tit-for-tat rhetoric will escalate, and a small incident could explode and build into a larger conflict,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, director of nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. \u201cThat increases the chance of war or even a nuclear exchange in the region.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the warning could escalate already high tensions and elicit a bellicose response from North Korea, including possibly another intercontinental ballistic missile test.\u000a\u000aOthers who have been responsible for North Korea policy expressed similar concerns about the president\u2019s approach \u2014 and the risk of miscalculation on the North Koreans\u2019 part.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey might think he means we would strike first. That could escalate out of control,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, who was senior National Security Council official in the Obama administration. \u201cPublicly he should say very little other than we will protect and defend ourselves and our allies. In just that calm a way. Privately we should tell North Korea directly that their weapons are unusable and any attack in us or our allies will bring about the end of the North Korean state. Their only option is to not use these weapons and return to negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe anxiety over the president\u2019s unexpected pronouncement was shared by conservatives.\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments sound as if they were penned by Pyongyang,\u201d said Bruce Klingner, a researcher at the hawkish Hertiage Foundation specializing in Northeast Asia. \u201cHis statement is unhelpful and will affirm growing perceptions that the U.S. is considering a preventative military attack against North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe new warning to North Korea also drew criticism from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill and renewed calls to find a way to negotiate with North Korea despite its insistence it will not accept as a precondition for talks that it halt its nuclear and missile programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cIsolating the North Koreans has not halted their pursuit of nuclear weapons. And President Trump is not helping the situation with his bombastic comments,\u201d said Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the intelligence committee, adding that she believes diplomacy is \u201cthe only sound path forward.\u201d\u000a\u000aSenator John McCain (R-Ariz.) told a Phoenix-area radio station, KTAR, that Trump\u2019s comments could bring the United States and North Korea closer to confrontation.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou got to be sure that you can do what you say you\u2019re going to. In other words, the old walk softly but carry a big stick, Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s saying,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI think this is very, very, very serious.\u201d\u000a\u000aNolan McCaskill and Josh Dawsey contributed reporting.

aVThe egg pollution scandal has prompted new investigations into chicken meat | Sascha Schuermann/Getty Images Euro-Press Review As egg contamination scandal deepens, Dutch investigate chicken meat French MPs are unusually busy, German politicians call for tighter controls on VW, and Brits worry about slipping border security standards, in today\u2019s European press.\u000a\u000aFrance\u000a\u000aAccording to Le Monde, French President Emmanuel Macron is preparing for an intensive political period when parliament reconvenes after summer, in particular on social and budgetary policies. In Macron\u2019s first 100 days in office, parliament has voted on three laws and pushed through several reforms \u2014 an unprecedented track record in French politics. But, Le Monde writes, Macron wants his MPs to be more upfront with the media about progress made. \u201cYou should be proud of the record that you have to defend,\u201d Macron said.\u000a\u000aLe Figaro had a front page story on the hurdles faced by Brits trying to obtain dual nationality to make sure they can stay in the EU after Brexit. As it turns out, applying for a second citizenship is not that easy \u2014 and in fact not legally possible in nine out of 28 member states.\u000a\u000aGermany\u000a\u000aThe German state of Lower Saxony will elect a new parliament on October 15, three weeks after the federal election in Germany, Die Welt and FAZ reported. The government crisis started when a Green MP decided to switch parties and join the conservative CDU, causing the government to lose its narrow majority. In the meantime, state premier Stephan Weil has come under intense scrutiny for his dealings with Volkswagen. The CDU has called for tighter controls on the carmaker, including regulation of supervisory board seats, German papers reported. And the Free Democrats (FDP), also vying for a chance to lead the regional government in October, said Lower Saxony should give up its stakes in Volkswagen, according to a Zeit report.\u000a\u000aFAZ also wrote that Porsche is investigating whether diesel engines in a new car type could be replaced, possibly drawing on lessons taken from the ongoing diesel emissions scandal.\u000a\u000aThe Netherlands\u000a\u000aThe egg pollution scandal has prompted new investigations into chicken meat, AD reported. Food authority NVWA is investigating whether the chemical fipronil can also be found in other products after it learned that the cleaning company using the prohibited insecticide also worked for a number of meat companies. The poultry industry claims there are no traces of fipronil to be found in meat.\u000a\u000aFD wrote about the French coastal town of Calais, where people are bracing themselves for a new migration crisis. Ten months after the notorious refugee camp, the so-called \u201cJungle,\u201d was cleared, new ones are on the brink of being built. Some 1,000 migrants from Africa, Afghanistan and Iraq are sleeping rough in and around the city.\u000a\u000aUK\u000a\u000aThe Guardian led with a report on a U.S. government appeal to officials to use the term \u201cweather extremes\u201d instead of \u201cclimate change.\u201d The department of agriculture\u2019s natural resources conservation service sent a list of terms that should be avoided by administration staff members, according to the report. \u201cClimate change\u201d is in the \u201cavoid\u201d category. Instead of \u201cclimate change adaption,\u201d staff have been told to use \u201cresilience to weather extremes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Times reported that members of government are worried over Home Office plans to scrap landing cards for millions of visitors from outside Europe arriving at airports and ports in the U.K. \u2014 a move aimed at speeding up passport controls.

aVThe definition of trust (or perhaps madness) in the EU? Letting a Brit have the keys to the headquarters of the European Commission while (almost) everyone else is on vacation.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what happened last week when Julian King \u2014 who, barring a massive Brexit change of heart, will be the last ever European commissioner from the U.K. \u2014 was on duty while his colleagues topped up their tans and caught up on summer reading. His boss, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, wasn\u2019t on holiday for all of that time \u2014 he left late last week, perhaps having given King the first shift to keep an eye on him.\u000a\u000aThe Brit, who is in charge of the security union portfolio, had some work to do. He signed off on some \u20ac9 million in new money for the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency and on a new method of financing the European Youth Orchestra, among other things.\u000a\u000aBut most importantly, he was in the office.\u000a\u000aJuncker made it clear he wants the Commission to be open for business throughout the summer in a note sent to all staff, according to people who received the memo.\u000a\u000aHe set up a summer rota of duty commissioners who must be at work. King got the first week-long shift, with Malta\u2019s Karmenu Vella taking over at the weekend, followed by Romania\u2019s Corina Cre\u0163u and then Cyprus\u2019 Christos Stylianides who\u2019ll be in charge from August 19 to 27, according to a Commission spokesperson, after which Juncker will be back.\u000a\u000aThe president gave an interview to POLITICO in a rather empty Berlaymont HQ last week, before heading to Austria on holiday.\u000a\u000aHis message then was that the Commission is ready to act \u201cwithin days\u201d if anything happens.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s become a new mantra, used when discussing retaliation against U.S. sanctions on Russia, the legality of Venezuela\u2019s recent election or Poland wielding the ax both against protected trees and the rule of law.\u000a\u000aThe summer rota is part of Juncker\u2019s ambition of leading a \u201cpolitical Commission\u201d and a way of showing other EU institutions, national capitals and even the citizens of Europe, that politics can\u2019t always wait until September.\u000a\u000aParliament\u2019s long pause\u000a\u000aThe European Parliament hasn\u2019t taken the same approach, with President Antonio Tajani sending a letter to Juncker and other EU leaders telling them not to bother getting in touch.\u000a\u000aTajani told \u201cDear Jean-Claude\u201d that the Parliament was taking its summer break and no work should be sent over before early September.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would be grateful if you could suspend, from the date of reception of this letter, the transmission of any notification or request to the budgetary authority [that\u2019s the Parliament],\u201d Tajani wrote in a letter dated July 13 \u2014 although he is keeping himself busy and did pop up last Tuesday, sending angry letters about Venezuela, which POLITICO obtained, to the Council and Commission.\u000a\u000aAccording to EU diplomats, efforts to coordinate the bloc\u2019s position on Venezuela were already underway by Tuesday, and the message was delivered Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe home-alone commissioner isn\u2019t completely on their own. At 9:45 a.m. every weekday, a skeleton staff meets in the Berlaymont, according to participants. Among them are officials from the Cabinets of both the president and that week\u2019s duty commissioner, as well as from the secretariat-general and the spokespersons\u2019 service.\u000a\u000aAt 10:30 a.m. all last week, a smaller group of people more or less directly reporting to Juncker met with the president to discuss the important matters of the day. They were given Juncker\u2019s cell phone number for while he\u2019s away.\u000a\u000aThe College of Commissioners reconvenes at the end of August for a retreat, which could easily be turned into a \u201cfully-fledged\u201d meeting should the need arise, a senior Commission official said.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s midday press briefing also carries on throughout the summer, although it\u2019s been downgraded to a much smaller room.\u000a\u000aTo calm Italy\u2019s fears on migration, Juncker has set up a special telephone hotline and email address that alerts three senior Commission officials, \u201cto ensure a constant chain of communication between Italy and the European Commission,\u201d Juncker wrote to Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in July.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s midday press briefing also carries on throughout the summer, although it\u2019s been downgraded to a much smaller room.\u000a\u000aOf course, some people can\u2019t completely disconnect even when they are supposed to be on holiday. Commissioner V\u011bra Jourová, who oversees consumer protection, has been tweeting away to make sure EU citizens are aware of what the Commission does for them.\u000a\u000a\u201cSummer is coming, and the EU is always on your side,\u201d she said in a video, whether it\u2019s about a late flight (you\u2019ve got rights), a lost passport or diplomatic incident (\u201cyou have the right to consular protection\u201d) or suntan lotion (\u201csafe\u201d if sold on EU soil).\u000a\u000aThe Czech commissioner spoke in English, perhaps to make sure the Brits realize what they\u2019re leaving behind.

aVRepublicans will go to any length to divert attention away from the disaster that is Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aAnd they think they have found their perfect foil in Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz over her handling of an information technology aide whom she kept on the payroll for months after he was banned from the House IT network.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz has committed no crime. None. Nip. Nada.\u000a\u000aBut Republicans are trying to turn this into something bigger than Watergate. They are doing this because there are three Democrats they really can\u2019t stand \u2014 Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000aAnd they are doing it to take attention away from how Trump is lying and messing up the country.\u000a\u000aSo you have Tim Canova, who is challenging Wasserman Schultz in next year\u2019s Democratic primary, saying \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d don\u2019t trust Wasserman Schultz to give straight answers.\u000a\u000aMillions? I assume Canova has talked to them all before making a statement like that.\u000a\u000aYou have U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Ponte Vedra Beach, terming the events \u201cextremely odd\u201d on Fox News, which will go with any conspiracy theory that involves Democrats.\u000a\u000aEven Sarah Palin, the lightweight who is an expert on nothing, weighed in on Twitter, calling the situation \u201cJust unbelievable.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgain, Wasserman Schultz committed no crime. She said she didn\u2019t fire Imran Awan until July 25 \u2014 after he was arrested, and after all others he worked for in the House had fired him \u2014 because he may have been put under scrutiny because of his Muslim faith.\u000a\u000aRepublicans will try hard to to turn this into Watergate. Or maybe they\u2019ll hold countless hearings, like when they went after Hillary Clinton because of Benghazi.\u000a\u000aThe ACLU has said Wasserman Schultz appeared to have acted appropriately.\u000a\u000aBut Ronna Romney McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, couldn\u2019t stop criticizing Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to get to the bottom of this,\u201d she said, \u201cand Debbie Wasserman Schultz has obstructed at every level on something that affects potentially our national security.\u201d\u000a\u000aBetter she should worry about obstruction coming from the White House.\u000a\u000aBut hey, why do that, when you can grill Debbie Wasserman Schultz?\u000a\u000aGary Stein can be reached at gstein@sunsentinel.com.

aVFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Scaramucci: Vulgar rant was mostly \u2018humorous and joking\u2019 Trump\u2019s short-lived communications chief was fired after an astonishing interview.\u000a\u000aFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said Tuesday that his vulgar and expletive-laden remarks about his Trump administration colleagues were intended as \u201chumorous and joking\u201d comments between friends, not as an on-the-record conversation with a reporter.\u000a\u000aIn a bombshell interview with the New Yorker published last week, Scaramucci used an expletive in referring to then-White House chief of staff a \u201cparanoid schizophrenic.\u201d In that same interview, Scaramucci accused White House chief strategist Steve Bannon of acting in his own self-interest, describing Bannon\u2019s actions with a crude sexual metaphor.\u000a\u000aScaramucci, who was removed from his position as communications director on Monday after less than two weeks on the job, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that he believed his conversation with New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza would stay between them.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Lizzas and Scaramuccis have been friends for over 50 years. My dad knew his dad from construction, and we were building a personal relationship,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cMost of what I said was humorous and joking. Legally, it may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And he knew that.\u201d\u000a\u000aLizza disputed Scaramucci\u2019s assertion that the two men are friends, although he conceded that their fathers may have known one another. And Lizza\u2019s publication, in a statement first reported by Axios, noted that Scaramucci had requested during the conversation that certain portions be put off the record and that the magazine respected those requests, a seeming indication that the communications director understood the nature of his conversation with Lizza.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve only known Anthony in his capacity as a Trump surrogate and then White House communications director. We are not and have never been \u2018old family friends,\u2019 though I think our fathers knew each other, so maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s talking about. (The Long Island Italian world in that generation is relatively small.),\u201d Lizza wrote in an emailed comment to The Huffington Post. \u201cBut again, that would not be a reason to suppress an explosive on-the-record interview.\u201d\u000a\u000aScaramucci said his conversation on Monday with newly-installed White House chief of staff John Kelly in which Kelly asked for his resignation was \u201cvery polite.\u201d He said he also spoke by telephone later that day with President Donald Trump as well as the president\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump, and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president told me he knows I have his back, but he has to try to tighten the ship,\u201d Scaramucci said.

aVThe low-budget ad, with only three hits on cable for $305, was a typical hit piece for Americans for Safe Access, an under-funded special interest group looking to push its agenda on the cheap. \u201cCongresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks it\u2019s okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison,\u201d a narrator intoned as unflattering pictures of the Democratic National Committee chairwoman flashed on screen.\u000a\u000aBut it was what happened next that caused a political feud that has roiled the early waters for Florida\u2019s 2016 US Senate race: Wasserman Schultz decided to blast back, issuing a press statement complaining that a medical marijuana initiative then on Florida\u2019s ballot could lead to \u201cabuse, fraud and accidents.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThat initiative wasn\u2019t even the focus of the ad. But Wasserman Schultz\u2019s criticism stung one of Florida\u2019s leading Democratic fundraisers, John Morgan, who was bankrolling the ballot initiative. Just two years earlier, Morgan had raised more than $100,000 for her. But from that point forward, Morgan has been a furious critic, sparking a feud that has shadowed her consideration of a possible Senate run, confounded Florida Democrats, and raised questions about the political acumen of one of the party\u2019s top leaders.\u000a\u000aMorgan, a sharp-tongued Orlando trial lawyer who relishes fights in and out of the courtroom, immediately struck back and called his one-time ally \u201cdespised.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond. And the medical-marijuana initiative was narrowly defeated in November.\u000a\u000aBut now, Morgan is readying his amendment for the 2016. And if Wasserman Schultz runs for statewide office at the same time, he\u2019s determined to defeat her in a primary, likely against fellow U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy.\u000a\u000aParty loyalists remain somewhat surprised by Wasserman Schultz\u2019s opposition to a medical marijuana initiative that\u2019s widely popular among Democrats, but they\u2019re more struck by her apparent political tone-deafness in allowing a feud to develop with a renowned attacker like Morgan, especially since he once supported her.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was a quasi-parlor game over the summer: what the hell is she doing?\u201d said Kartik Krishnaiyer, a member of the Democratic Party in Broward County, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s home base. \u201cAll of it went away, but then last week, it all came back.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe renewed sniping came to a head Thursday when Morgan and Ben Pollara, the political director for Morgan\u2019s People United for Medical Marijuana group, said Wasserman Schultz\u2019s office offered him a deal: stop criticizing her and, in return, she\u2019d support his new constitutional amendment. Morgan produced an email chain indicating such an offer was made.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz\u2019s office declined to comment to POLITICO about the alleged deal but, after the story went viral, she told her hometown paper, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, that there was no quid pro quo and it was all a misunderstanding.\u000a\u000aThe congresswoman\u2019s office says she views Morgan\u2019s latest amendment more favorably because he changed it to close loopholes.\u000a\u000aAnd she\u2019s extending an olive branch.\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn Morgan has been supportive of many Florida Democrats throughout the years, and hosted a fundraiser for me in 2012 that raised $112,000,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cWhile I am always truly appreciative to have support from people like John, I make policy decisions based on my principles and the issues before me, and nothing else. As I have for 22 years as a state and federal legislator, when an issue evolves, I let people on both sides of it know that my door is always open. That will never change.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Morgan, who once brought together friends and clients for a fundraiser for her at his house, said he still mistrusts her.\u000a\u000aHe said he still has \u201cno idea\u201d why she opposed his amendment in 2014 or why she decided to go public with that opposition. The initiative garnered 57.6 percent of the vote \u2013 but failed because it fell short of the 60 percent voter-approval threshold needed for passage of a Florida constitutional amendment. Democrats and independents favored the proposal by supermajorities, but Republicans opposed it by a supermajority, dooming its passage. Poor voter turnout in liberal-heavy South Florida helped lead to its defeat.\u000a\u000a\u201cI just don\u2019t know why she did it,\u201d Morgan said by email. \u201cShe does nothing for nothing. She stands for nothing. Except DWS.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Wasserman Schultz opposed the amendment, she laid out her reasons in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times, explaining that she was for \u201cevidenced-based medical-marijuana treatment.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVSalomon Melgen's fraud case and the lead-up to his expected sentencing were being closely watched to see whether he would try to cut a deal with prosecutors. | Kena Betancur/Getty Images Sentencing postponed for Menendez co-defendant Prosecution and defense agree to put off Florida eye doctor's fraud sentence until after looming New Jersey corruption trial.\u000a\u000aProsecutors and defense lawyers have agreed to postpone the health care fraud sentencing of a Florida eye doctor who could be facing decades in prison and is also set for a separate trial next month in a corruption case with Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.).\u000a\u000aAttorneys for wealthy ophthalmologist and campaign donor Salomon Melgen confirmed in a court filing Thursday an agreement to put off the fraud sentencing until after the corruption trial. Melgen was convicted in April of improperly billing the federal government for more than $100 million in medical insurance payments.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMelgen's fraud case and the lead-up to his expected sentencing were being closely watched to see whether he would try to cut a deal with prosecutors, which could affect the separate, high-stakes corruption case. That case centers on allegations Menendez used his office to help Melgen, a longtime friend, in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and political donations.\u000a\u000aThere were no public indications Thursday that Melgen was seeking a deal. Sources close to the case told POLITICO the delay was due to scheduling concerns and the need for the defense to prepare for the looming corruption trial in Newark.\u000a\u000aJury selection in that case, where Melgen and Menendez are co-defendants, is set to begin Aug. 22. Opening arguments are scheduled for Sept. 6.\u000a\u000aIn a terse court filing Thursday afternoon, Melgen\u2019s attorneys suggested that the sentencing hearing originally scheduled to take place starting at 9 a.m. Friday in federal court in West Palm Beach was likely to be protracted. They said it would be better to hold it after the Newark corruption trial is complete.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe parties in this matter have conferred and agree that the sentencing in this matter is likely to take more than one day,\u201d Melgen\u2019s attorneys Kirk Ogrosky, Murad Hussain and Matthew Menchel wrote. \u201cGiven the pending trial in the District of New Jersey and the schedules of counsel, Dr. Melgen requests that the sentencing be continued until after the trial in the District of New Jersey is concluded. After consultation with the prosecution, all parties agree that a continuance is merited.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra agreed to the delay but did not immediately set a date for a new sentencing hearing.\u000a\u000aAn attorney for Melgen declined to comment on the development. A lawyer for Menendez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Miami said the sentencing in the health care fraud case would likely take place in October or later, but declined to comment further.\u000a\u000aThe last-minute change to the timing came as it was revealed this week that Melgen could face a sentence of 30 years or more in the health care fraud case, if a judge goes along with sentencing guidelines calculated by a probation officer.\u000a\u000aIn recent days, there have been no public signs of cooperation between Melgen and prosecutors. In fact, lawyers for both sides continued to battling aggressively over Melgen's sentence and over his effort to try to pay his massive legal bills by tapping personal funds pledged as bail.\u000a\u000aMelgen was free on bail before and during his two-month trial, but the bail was revoked and he was taken into custody April 28, when the jury returned the dozens of guilty verdicts.\u000a\u000aWhenever the sentencing takes place, Marra can issue a lighter sentence than called for by the guidelines, but he is required to calculate the recommended sentence and to explain his reasons for a lower sentence.\u000a\u000aA defense sentencing filing submitted to the judge on Tuesday seemed to treat a 30-year sentence as an unwelcome, but not impossible, outcome.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny lengthy sentence will result in Dr. Melgen\u2019s designation to prisons housing extremely violent inmates,\u201d defense lawyers wrote.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is an unnecessary burden on the taxpayers to house a sixty-three-year-old physician in even a low-security prison, much less a medium- or high-security prison. Moreover, the burden on Dr. Melgen, given his age, his background, his health, and his overall vulnerability, would be unbearable,\u201d the defense argued.\u000a\u000aOne prominent sentencing expert said a 30-year sentence was highly unlikely, given Melgen\u2019s age and other factors.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily rare, unless a judge genuinely thinks this person is the worst of the worst,\u201d said Ohio State University law professor Doug Berman. \u201cI think there is not only a disinclination to follow the guidelines when they run in this aggravated way, but a disinclination to ensure that [defendants] die in prison\u2026That really becomes an interesting actuarial judgment.\u201d\u000a\u000aBerman said he believed a sentence in the \u201cballpark of ten to 20 years\u201d was most likely.\u000a\u000aMelgen was accused and convicted in the Florida case of performing tests, procedures and drug injections on the eyes of patients who did not need them. In some cases, he was accused of billing Medicare for tests on eyes that were irretrievably blinded.\u000a\u000aProsecutors contend the total loss cause by Melgen's fraud was between $65 million and $150 million. That calculation torques the suggested sentence up far beyond a more pedestrian case.\u000a\u000a"That can lead to a range that is essentially a life sentence, no matter how mitigating everything else around the case might be," Berman said.\u000a\u000aMenendez\u2019s attorneys have portrayed the Florida and New Jersey cases as unrelated. However, some of the charges in the corruption case accuse Menendez of intervening with top Health and Human Services Department officials to get them to back down in a multi-million dollar dispute between Melgen and Medicare over his billing for eye injections.\u000a\u000aMenendez is also accused of weighing in to try to preserve a port security contract that a Melgen firm held in the Dominican Republican and urging State Department officials to grant U.S. visas to three of Melgen\u2019s girlfriends. Prosecutors contend all the actions were taken by the New Jersey Democrat in exchange for political donations and personal gifts from Melgen, including trips on Melgen\u2019s plane and stays at luxury hotels.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBERLIN \u2014 To understand Angela Merkel\u2019s campaign strategy, look no further than the posters her party is about to splash all over Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cEnjoy the summer now, and make the right choice in the fall,\u201d one of them tells voters, depicting a dreamy young woman in a meadow.\u000a\u000aAfter the conservative chancellor returns from her three-week vacation on Friday, her main goal is to ensure the final stretch of the campaign up to the September 24 election remains low-key. Or, as one official from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) put it: \u201cIf everything stays the way it is right now, any move is a move too many.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith just over six weeks to go until Germany votes for a new parliament, Merkel\u2019s conservatives are comfortably polling over 40 percent. Her main rival, former European Parliament President Martin Schulz, has little to show for the three weeks he spent on the campaign trail while Merkel was enjoying a hike in the Italian Alps. Despite rushing from retirement homes to factories, Schulz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) continue to poll below 25 percent, more than 15 percentage points behind Merkel.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe race for No. 1 is over,\u201d Christian Lindner, party chief of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), a potential coalition partner for the conservatives, said last weekend, echoing widespread opinion among commentators and pollsters.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermans want to be left in peace. It\u2019s finally summer, they\u2019re slowly coming back from holidays, everyone has a job, there are barely any refugees visible anymore\u201d \u2014 Conservative official\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s strategy, which has helped the long-time chancellor get reelected twice already, is to avoid confrontation, safe in the knowledge that her supporters will cast their votes for her conservatives whether she campaigns or not, unlike other parties\u2019 voters who need to be mobilized.\u000a\u000aThe CDU believes their relatively prosperous electorate responds better to specific promises like creating full employment by 2025 or cutting income taxes than to Schulz\u2019s attempts to provoke heated campaign debates.\u000a\u000aMerkel's laid-back campaign goes horizontal: "enjoy the summer vote the right way in the autumn" pic.twitter.com/1uQ9rQztH4 \u2014 Stefan Wagstyl (@stefanwagstyl) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000a\u201cGermans want to be left in peace,\u201d a conservative official said. \u201cIt\u2019s finally summer, they\u2019re slowly coming back from holidays, everyone has a job, there are barely any refugees visible anymore. They don\u2019t want to debate things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe refugee factor\u000a\u000aThere is not much that could go wrong, conservative party officials say \u2014 with only a few exceptions.\u000a\u000aOn top of that list: migration.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, an unexpected influx of asylum seekers arriving in Europe via the Greek islands threw Merkel into the worst crisis since she took office in 2005. Since then, the number of arrivals in Greece has dropped significantly, but more asylum seekers have begun to arrive via the central Mediterranean route from Libya in Italy.\u000a\u000aLast month, Schulz sounded the alarm that a new refugee crisis could be looming. It was widely understood as an attempt to draw Merkel out of her shell, reminding voters of her handling of the 2015 refugee crisis, when she decided to temporarily open the country\u2019s borders for migrants stranded in Hungary.\u000a\u000aHowever, Schulz\u2019s tactic backfired when the media focused more on a flawed number he quoted than the argument he was trying to make, and Merkel was able to ignore the entire episode.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, well aware that a new increase of asylum seekers making their way to Germany could pose a threat to her campaign, Merkel\u2019s team is eager to send out the message that the chancellor is watching closely what\u2019s happening in Italy.\u000a\u000aOne of Merkel\u2019s first appointments when she\u2019s back from her holiday on Friday is lunch with the chiefs of the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration to discuss the situation, followed by a joint press conference.\u000a\u000aOn the campaign trail\u000a\u000aOne day later, on Saturday, Merkel will kick off a six-week series of campaign appearances across Germany.\u000a\u000aCDU officials say the chancellor wants to be seen on the campaign trail to send out the signal that despite her lead in polls, she is not taking an election victory for granted \u2014 but at the same time, she will avoid confrontation wherever possible.\u000a\u000aNext Wednesday, for example, Merkel is giving an online interview to four German YouTube celebrities, her office announced.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, when another YouTube blogger interviewed Merkel, it was the chancellor who essentially ended up running the conversation while dodging critical questions. This time, it also seems unlikely that the four young interviewees \u2014 among them a beauty expert and a tech blogger \u2014 will succeed in bringing the experienced chancellor out of her shell.\u000a\u000aSo far, there seem to be mainly two occasions that could turn out to become difficult for her, officials believe.\u000a\u000aOne of them is a televised \u201ctown hall meeting\u201d later in August, during which the chancellor has to react directly to questions from the audience.\u000a\u000aThe other one is a major debate in early September when Merkel will face Schulz head-to-head on live TV.\u000a\u000aThe real challenge\u000a\u000aHowever, the most interesting fight, according to one CDU official in the Bundestag, won\u2019t happen until after the election, when Germany\u2019s political parties \u2014 after having pulled each other apart for weeks \u2014 will sit down for coalition talks to try to form a governing majority.\u000a\u000aSuch sentiments suggest the CDU considers it virtually impossible for Merkel to be unseated by Schulz. With more than six weeks left until the vote, history suggests this could be premature.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn all those years \u2026 has there ever been anyone who made Angela Merkel dance the tango?\u201d \u2014 CDU official laughing at Martin Schulz\u2019s chance of turning things around\u000a\u000aBack in 2005, at around this point in the campaign, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was also lagging around 15 percentage points behind Merkel, who was opposition leader at the time.\u000a\u000aDuring the last weeks ahead of the vote, however, he managed to catch up. On election day, Merkel only won by a wafer-thin margin.\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether Schulz has a better chance of sparking a real debate and catching up in the polls now that Merkel is back from her vacation, as it takes two to tango, the CDU official burst out into laughter.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn all those years \u2026 has there ever been anyone who made Angela Merkel dance the tango?\u201d

aVPARIS \u2014 Here\u2019s a message from the City of Light: Don\u2019t believe the hype about Frankfurt sweeping up all of Brexit\u2019s finance jobs.\u000a\u000aWith 20 banks already signed up to move staff to Frankfurt, the city is widely considered way ahead of Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin and other cities vying to attract the finance sector that will be leaving London due to Brexit.\u000a\u000aLobbyists for the glass-and-steel German city point to the presence of the German and European central banks, an English-speaking regulator and almost a dozen new high-rise buildings as big draws for finance firms seeking a foothold on the Continent.\u000a\u000aWhile the case looks strong, Paris boosters argue that it has also got plenty of holes. Most banks that have promised to move to Frankfurt, they point out, only talk of establishing legal headquarters there, which can be accomplished with minimum staff. That\u2019s not the same as shifting an entire trading room.\u000a\u000aMajor post-Brexit decisions on moving operations are still to come, with estimates of how many jobs will be affected ranging from 30,000 to 230,000 depending on the outcome of negotiations between the U.K. and EU. When banks do shift greater resources, particularly for their trading operations, Paris advocates argue they will pay attention to surrounding financial conditions \u2014 and balk at concerns about the German banking sector.\u000a\u000aThen there is the relative size and prestige of Paris versus Frankfurt. The former has a population of 10 million and the economy of a global metropolis on par with London and New York, while the latter is an up-and-coming seat for central banks with a population of 730,000.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re getting a rather distorted image of Frankfurt as the hands-down winner of this race for Brexit jobs\u201d \u2014 Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace\u000a\u000aGermany may have more attractive tax and labor conditions, but France\u2019s new president, Emmanuel Macron, is charging ahead with plans to make France competitive. He plans to scrap the highest bracket of payroll tax for banks and other firms that don\u2019t pay VAT and to cancel a planned extension of tax on share trading. Macron has also pledged to make sure bonuses are not taken into account when labor courts decide on unfair dismissal compensation.\u000a\u000aThe rub: Don\u2019t count Paris out.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re getting a rather distorted image of Frankfurt as the hands-down winner of this race for Brexit jobs,\u201d said Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Paris Europlace, an organization that promotes the city as a financial center.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut when we start talking about relocating entire trading teams, about big-time staffing decisions, Paris is still very much a contender \u2026 We\u2019re convinced that in the short to medium term, Paris\u2019 advantages will start to shine through in a compelling way, especially compared to Frankfurt,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFrankfurt\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel\u000a\u000aFrankfurt\u2019s strengths on paper have allowed the German city to pull ahead of its French rival in winning commitments to move there from big banks. Its official bid to host the European Banking Authority \u2014 the EU\u2019s banking regulator \u2014 submitted Monday placed great emphasis on the city\u2019s dominance in financial market supervision as well as its growing clientele of banks.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to customer business, Frankfurt is where the clients are,\u201d Michael Horn, a spokesperson for the Hessian minister for European and federal affairs, said in July.\u000a\u000aU.S. bank Citigroup, Britain\u2019s Standard Chartered and Japan\u2019s Nomura are among those that have decided to make Frankfurt their legal base.\u000a\u000aBut Bresson says the devil is in the word \u201clegal.\u201d Many such decisions, he said, may boil down to opening a beachhead office with a handful of staffers in order to have a presence on the Continent, not a bona fide trading hub.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere your legal entity is based is not where your people are based,\u201d JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in July at a conference in Paris. \u201cThe people could be in Paris, in the Netherlands, or Madrid or anywhere in the EU. We haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong banks committed to Frankfurt, Citibank is relocating an estimated 200 staff. By contrast, HSBC said in January it would move 1,000 trading staff to Paris. Added to commitments to repatriate staff from a slew of French banks including Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, Paris appears only slightly behind Frankfurt on Brexit job moves already announced: The former has clocked 2,500 to the latter\u2019s 2,800, according to calculations by Paris Europlace.\u000a\u000aAnother 30 financial institutions, including large Asian and U.S. banks, are in talks with French regulators about moving to Paris, according to Europlace.\u000a\u000aOverall, the Bruegel think tank estimates some 30,000 jobs could move to the Continent from the City of London if Brexit becomes a reality, while others put the figure much higher. That means that the process is only beginning. When big decisions come, banks will look at a range of factors, notably the health of a country\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aHere, France has the upper hand, Bresson said. \u201cCommerzbank is in a delicate situation, Deutsche Bank has difficulties internationally, and then there are the Landesbanks, which also have issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows there are difficulties within the system, which could create problems down the line for interbank lending for financial firms.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrench banks, four of which are in the European top 10 for size, are not a persistent worry for regulators. Intensive trading activities mean there is deep expertise among regulators. And contrary to some claims from rivals, they are briefing potential clients in English.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe big difference between Paris and Frankfurt in regulation is that Paris has greater expertise in terms of market activity than the German authority,\u201d Bresson said.\u000a\u000aFrance changing\u000a\u000aFor now, Germany has a lower corporate tax rate than France (29.7 percent versus 33.3 percent). But the French rate is set to fall to 28 percent by 2020. On July 7, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe rolled out a series of other measures aimed at Brexiting banks, including scrapping the top bracket of payroll tax for financial sectors workers.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly Paris and its La Défense neighborhood can propose a viable alternative to companies installed in London\u201d \u2014 Marie Celie Guillaume, chief of Defacto\u000a\u000aRigid labor rules have long been a concern for foreign banks considering doing business in France, an issue HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, underscored in July. Planned reforms were \u201cvery positive\u201d but banks wanted to see whether Macron would be able to carry out his agenda and whether he will be able to defend it during a second term, Gulliver said.\u000a\u000aYet Macron is charging ahead with changes to the labor code, with a series of executive decrees due to be published no later than the end of September, according to Philippe. The president, a former Rothschild banker himself, is bent on making France a winner from Brexit and is throwing his weight behind efforts to draw bankers to Paris.\u000a\u000aOne of the main draws of Paris is that it is a more attractive place to live, with a culinary and cultural scene to rival London\u2019s and satisfy large-walleted finance employees. The city also has plenty of space to welcome an influx of bankers, with seven new skyscrapers due to be built in the La Défense Business district by 2021, amounting to 375,000 square meters of new office space.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnly Paris and its La Défense neighborhood can propose a viable alternative to companies installed in London, either in terms of economic environment or lifestyle for the workers,\u201d said Marie Celie Guillaume, chief of Defacto, the company that promotes La Défense.

aVRichard Nixon\u2019s telephone calls came regularly during the 1968 campaign. And H.R. Haldeman took meticulous notes, jotting down the instructions he received from the candidate.\u000a\u000aSometimes Nixon needed to blow off steam: demanding that a reporter from The Washington Post or The New York Times be banned from his campaign airplane for writing an offending story. (\u201cTimes and Post off,\u201d Haldeman recorded. \u201cTimes forever.\u201d) One such call came at midnight, from Nixon\u2019s co-op apartment on Fifth Avenue: Haldeman dutifully noted that the stirring score to the World War II documentary Victory at Sea, which Nixon so enjoyed, was playing on a phonograph in the background.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOther calls were steeped in intrigue. In one series of scribbles, Haldeman reported Henry Kissinger\u2019s willingness to inform on his U.S. diplomatic colleagues, and keep Nixon updated on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s furious, eleventh-hour efforts to end the Vietnam War.\u000a\u000aHaldeman, 42, was Nixon\u2019s campaign chief of staff, a devoted political adjutant since the 1950s. In late October 1968, the two men connected on what came to be known as \u201cthe Chennault Affair.\u201d Nixon gave Haldeman his orders: Find ways to sabotage Johnson\u2019s plans to stage productive peace talks, so that a frustrated American electorate would turn to the Republicans as their only hope to end the war.\u000a\u000aThe gambit worked, and the Chennault Affair, named for Anna Chennault, the Republican doyenne and fundraiser who became Nixon\u2019s back channel to the South Vietnamese government, lingered as a diplomatic and political whodunit for decades afterward.\u000a\u000aJohnson and his aides suspected this treachery at the time, for the Americans were eavesdropping on their South Vietnamese allies\u2014(\u201cHold on,\u201d Anna was heard telling the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington. \u201cWe are gonna win\u201d)\u2014but hesitated to expose it because they had no proof Nixon had personally directed, or countenanced, her actions. Historians scoured archives for evidence that Chennault was following the future president\u2019s instructions, without much luck. Nixon steadfastly denied involvement up until his death, while his lawyers fended off efforts to obtain records from the 1968 campaign.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t until after 2007, when the Nixon Presidential Library finally opened Haldeman\u2019s notes to the public, that I stumbled upon a smoking gun in the course of conducting research for my biography of Nixon: four pages of notes his brush-cut aide had scrawled late on an October evening in 1968. \u201c!Keep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\u201d Haldeman wrote, as Nixon barked orders into the phone. They were out to \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d Johnson\u2019s election eve initiative, Nixon said. And it worked.\u000a\u000aThe following account of the Chennault Affair is the most up-to-date and revealing exposure of Nixon\u2019s intrigue\u2014the product of hours of archival research, open records requests and a little luck. Documenting this cynical maneuver is important for history\u2019s sake, but the fact that it took nearly 50 years for Nixon\u2019s secret to emerge also offers vital lessons for today. It shows how hard it is to find definitive proof of collaboration with a foreign power when officials are determined to hide the truth. It illustrates why a president might hesitate to call out such malfeasance by a candidate from the opposing political party. And it demonstrates the lengths an ambitious politician will go in the pursuit of power\u2014even at the expense of his own country\u2019s interests.\u000a\u000aAs investigators rush to understand just what President Donald Trump knew about Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in the 2016 election and when he knew it, the Chennault Affair\u2014and how Nixon got away with it\u2014is as relevant than ever.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aNixon was especially anxious on the night October 22, 1968. He had entered the fall campaign with a formidable lead over Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but the polls were narrowing as working-class Democrats returned to their party and Johnson\u2019s efforts to make peace made news. Nixon believed he would prevail, unless a major event reset the political topography. He knew that Johnson knew that too.\u000a\u000aAs did the Soviet Union. Kremlin leaders had never much liked the red-baiting, anti-communist Nixon. To keep him from the Oval Office, and help Humphrey become president, they were meddling in the U.S. presidential campaign\u2014pressing their clients in North Vietnam to agree to a ceasefire and hold constructive talks to end the war.\u000a\u000aAccording to Haldeman\u2019s notes, Kissinger alerted the Nixon campaign in late September, and again in early October, that something was up. Johnson was willing to halt the U.S. bombing of the North, and with the Soviets applying pressure on Hanoi to meet certain American conditions, the odds were never better for an early settlement of the conflict, which had already claimed 30,000 American lives and torn America apart.\u000a\u000aNixon had no influence in Moscow, or Hanoi. But he was not completely vulnerable to events. He had that pipeline to Saigon, where South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and his associates feared that LBJ was selling them out. If Thieu would drag his feet, and stall the proposed peace talks, Nixon could portray Johnson\u2019s failed peace initiative as a desperate political trick. But to do so, Nixon had to get word to Thieu, and tell him to stand firm.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s main conduit was Chennault, the Chinese-American widow of Claire Chennault, the American aviator who led squadrons of \u201cFlying Tigers\u201d into battle on behalf of China against the Japanese invaders during World War II. She had many friends in the palaces of South Vietnam, nationalist China and the other pro-Western countries on the Asian rim.\u000a\u000aNixon also told Haldeman to have Rose Mary Woods, the candidate\u2019s devoted secretary, contact another member of the pro-nationalist \u201cChina Lobby\u201d\u2014businessman Louis Kung\u2014and have him pressure Thieu as well. She was to get Kung \u201cgoing on the SVN\u2014tell him hold firm,\u201d Nixon ordered Haldeman.\u000a\u000aAnna Chennault (left) sits with Republican presidential candidate John Connally just before Connally addressed the National Republican Heritage Groups Council in Washington, D.C. in 1979. | AP Photos\u000a\u000aThe Nixon campaign\u2019s sabotage of Johnson\u2019s peace process was successful. Nine days later, Thieu\u2019s decision to boycott the talks headlined The New York Times and other U.S. newspapers, reminding American voters of their long-harbored mistrust of the wheeler-dealer LBJ and his \u201ccredibility gap\u201d on Vietnam. Humphrey\u2019s momentum faded.\u000a\u000aLBJ was furious. His national security adviser, Walt Rostow, urged him to unmask Nixon\u2019s treachery. Humphrey\u2019s aides told their boss to expose the episode and disgrace their Republican foes. But Johnson and Humphrey balked. They didn\u2019t have proof that Nixon had personally directed her actions.\u000a\u000aAnd so Nixon won the 1968 election, and led America further into carnage in Southeast Asia. In the years that followed, many elements of the Chennault Affair came to light, but Nixon stuck by his denials that he participated in the scheme. The lack of evidence of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement gave pause to historians, and offered his loyalists a platform from which to defend him. But no longer. Haldeman\u2019s notes are the long-sought evidence that Nixon personally intervened to scuttle Johnson\u2019s efforts to end the war. It\u2019s now possible to reconstruct the events of October and November 1968 with the inescapable conclusion that Nixon\u2019s behavior was devious, tragic and, given the lives at stake, arguably more reprehensible than his activities in the Watergate scandal.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aHow did Haldeman\u2019s notes escape public scrutiny for almost 50 years? When Nixon took office in January 1969, Haldeman was rewarded for his decades of service with the job of White House chief of staff. He built a centralized organization that, in many aspects, remains the preferred model today. No detail\u2014the grocery lists for the president\u2019s vacation home in Key Biscayne, Florida; the wages of the gardeners at the Western White House in San Clemente, California; the supply of toilet paper at Camp David\u2014was beyond his purview. Throughout the Nixon presidency, he spent hours in the Oval Office, recording the president\u2019s instructions on matters great and small.\u000a\u000aIn the spring of 1972, nearing the end of Nixon\u2019s first term, Haldeman ordered a general reorganization of the White House filing system. His aides selected the most sensitive documents from the White House Central Files and placed them in a group that was called the White House Special Files. The Special Files were like a greatest hits collection of Nixon administration secrets.\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon resigned in 1974, aides to his successor, Gerald Ford, alerted the president, Congress and Watergate prosecutors that truckloads of Nixon\u2019s papers were being shipped to San Clemente. Ford put a stop to the process (infuriating the exiled ex-president) and Congress enacted special legislation that, effectively, seized the documents and the famous White House tapes.\u000a\u000aAll previous chief executives had retained control of their papers\u2014and then chose to bequeath them to heirs, sell them or store them in a presidential library. Nixon had sound grounds to contest the government\u2019s seizure of his tapes and papers\u2014especially those of a personal, or purely political nature. He went to court, and his legal team scored victory after victory. After one favorable decision, aide Monica Crowley later reported, the elated former president sat down at the piano and banged out \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again.\u201d\u000a\u000aNixon fretted, with good cause, about his legacy. By the time of his death, in 1994, he had succeeded in keeping all but a few reels of the White House tapes, and tens of thousands of sensitive documents, from historians and biographers. The tapes began to trickle out in 1996, though some 700 of the 3,600 hours of conversations are still being processed today. Most of the touchy Special Files were opened to researchers in 1987, with the exception of two segments of records categorized as \u201creturned\u201d to Nixon or \u201ccontested\u201d by the former president as containing personal or political material.\u000a\u000aStoring, preserving and processing tapes and papers costs a great deal of money, however, which has led the various private presidential foundations to reach arrangements with the National Archives to reduce costs. The result is that today\u2019s presidential libraries are chimeras, with donor-funded, hagiographic museum halls for the public to wander and climate-controlled vaults of records, administered by federal archivists, for researchers. And so, after all those years of legal battles, the privately funded Richard Nixon Foundation ultimately surrendered the \u201creturned\u201d and \u201ccontested\u201d Special Files to the government. They were opened to scholars beginning in 2007. They include Bob Haldeman\u2019s political files\u2014where I found his notes from the 1968 campaign.\u000a\u000aConsidering their provenance, the twin collections have drawn surprisingly little attention. Sifting through the files is laborious, for there is much trivia\u2014like memos from Nixon staffers to have secretaries pick up their dry cleaning \u2013 but they also contain gems like Nixon\u2019s appointment books, political strategy memos and the Haldeman files, in which he stored his notes from his boss\u2019 stunning comeback in 1968, and the 1962 California gubernatorial race\u2014the one that ended with Nixon\u2019s famous \u201clast press conference,\u201d in which he told reporters \u201cyou don\u2019t have Nixon to kick around anymore.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 1962 folders contain notes from a strategy meeting in which Nixon, Haldeman and other top advisers discuss the need to have rival candidates \u201ctailed and tapped.\u201d Long before Watergate, Nixon was fascinated with such sneakery\u2014in yet another file at the Nixon library I found a page of reminders he had written to himself during his first campaign for Congress, against Democratic incumbent Jerry Voorhis, in 1946. \u201cSet up \u2026 spies in V. camp,\u201d he had scribbled.\u000a\u000aHaldeman is known as Nixon\u2019s alter ego; as the highest-ranked White House aide to go to prison for his Watergate era crimes; for participating in the \u201csmoking gun\u201d conversation that incriminated Nixon, and for the meticulous \u201cHaldeman diaries,\u201d published as a best-selling book in 1994. Until the Nixon White House taping system was installed in early 1971, Haldeman\u2019s notes and diary entries formed the best, most candid record of its internal reckonings. His notes from the 1968 campaign are equally essential.\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d threatened to unravel at the Republican National Convention in Miami, with the South\u2019s delegates yearning to switch to the more conservative Ronald Reagan, Haldeman recorded how Nixon dispatched his campaign manager, John Mitchell, to reassure Peter O\u2019Donnell, the Texas state Republican chairman, with a message to \u201ccool off the Southerners.\u201d They should know, Nixon said, that in choosing a running mate he would not \u201cram someone down your throat.\u201d They should also know that Nixon \u201cwill bring peace\u201d on civil rights and \u201clay off pro-Negro crap\u201d\u2014 the most explicit promise that I found from a candidate who preferred to cloak his position on segregation in euphemistic talk about pushy liberal bureaucrats and the folly of court-ordered busing.\u000a\u000aHaldeman also noted Nixon\u2019s musings about how best to deal with the third-party candidacy of Alabama Governor George Wallace. \u201cRN has emotional access to lower middle class white \u2013 not fair [to call them] racist \u2013 but concerned re crime & violence, law & order,\u201d Haldeman noted. The Roman Catholic minorities \u2013 \u201cIrish, Ital, Pole, Mex\u201d \u2013 were \u201cafraid of Negroes,\u201d and should be targeted after the convention. \u201cNeed stronger N position on this operationally \u2013 must do something,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cMust dry up Wallace vote.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are early hints of Watergate, too\u2014with Nixon telling Haldeman to leak word to a friendly journalist that Humphrey and his campaign manager, Lawrence O\u2019Brien, had potentially embarrassing ties to the eccentric defense contractor, billionaire Howard Hughes. \u201cHave learned\u2014unimpeachable source,\u201d Nixon told Haldeman. \u201cHH son has been on H Hughes payroll & O\u2019Brien is financed by H Hughes.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 1960, John Kennedy\u2019s campaign had effectively exploited news of a Hughes loan to the Nixon family, raising questions of influence-peddling that hounded Nixon for years. His White House files show that his obsession with the O\u2019Brien-Hughes relationship never waned. In 1972, O\u2019Brien\u2019s office at the Democratic National Committee would become a target of the Watergate burglars.\u000a\u000aNice morsels. But the true, groundbreaking notes concern the Chennault Affair.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIt is useful to review just how much Nixon feared the disclosure of the Chennault Affair in the fall of 1968. He lied, right from the start, to Johnson\u2014who was trying to keep Nixon, Humphrey and Thieu on board the peace train. \u201cI would never do anything to encourage \u2026 Saigon not to come to the table,\u201d Nixon told LBJ in a conversation captured on the Johnson White House taping system.\u000a\u000aThe denials continued through the years. To his friend and biographer, Jonathan Aitken, Nixon dismissed \u201cthe Chennault canard\u201d and insisted he had not participated in any such plot. In his memoir, RN, Nixon never mentioned Chennault. To David Frost, in their celebrated 1977 televised interviews, Nixon was categorical. \u201cI did nothing to undercut them,\u201d he said of the peace talks. \u201cAs far as Madame Chennault or any number of other people. \u2026 I did not authorize them and I had no knowledge of any contact with the South Vietnamese at that point, urging them not to. \u2026 Because I couldn\u2019t have done that in conscience.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former president had good cause to prevaricate. Nixon\u2019s actions to sabotage the peace talks were, \u201chighly inappropriate, if true\u201d as Kissinger later put it, and in seeming violation of the law that prohibits private citizens from trying to \u201cdefeat the measures of the United States\u201d or otherwise meddle in its diplomacy. As the U.S. code reads:\u000a\u000aAny citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\u000a\u000aThough rarely employed over the years, the Logan Act was enacted by the founders to address just such a situation. It is named for George Logan, who conducted private negotiations with the French government during the administration of President John Adams. Logan, a member of the political opposition, used the notoriety to win election to the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000aBy the time Election Day had come and gone, there were far too many interests aware of Chennault\u2019s actions\u2014the White House, the FBI, the South Vietnamese, the Nixon and Humphrey campaigns\u2014to keep a lid on the scandal.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson (right) and Henry A. Kissinger meet at the White House in December 1968, the same week President-elect Richard Nixon announced Kissinger's appointment as his assistant for national security affairs. | AP Photo\u000a\u000aJournalists Drew Pearson, Tom Ottenad, Theodore White, Jules Witcover and Seymour Hersh advanced the story, bit by bit, over the years. So did book-writing Johnson administration officials like Clark Clifford and William Bundy and University of Virginia scholar Ken Hughes, in a 2014 book, Chasing Shadows. Anna Chennault wrote a memoir, divulging some details, as did Bui Diem, the South Vietnamese ambassador to the United States at the time.\u000a\u000aThe biggest break came when trustees at the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library decided to ignore Rostow\u2019s instructions and make public the tapes and files that LBJ had wanted sealed. The 1994 opening of the so-called X-envelope, which included reports of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Chennault, and the 2008 release of the Johnson tapes from the 1968 election season caused a sensation. More recently, the Nixon presidential library, fulfilling open records requests that I and other scholars had made, released an oral history and two long written reports by Nixon White House aide Tom Huston, who had been tasked by Haldeman to collect evidence on the episode for potential use against Johnson.\u000a\u000aIn a February 25, 1970 memo, attached to an 11-page report, Huston warned Haldeman: \u201cThe evidence in the case does not dispel the notion that we were somehow involved in the Chennault Affair and while release of this information would be most embarrassing to President Johnson, it would not be helpful to us either.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat remained, as I started work on a biography of Nixon in 2011, was that one, final and elusive\u2014and most important\u2014piece to the puzzle: evidence of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement. The \u201creturned\u201d White House Special Files provide that proof.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aThe puzzle begins with Anna, the China-born hostess, Nixon campaign fundraiser and grandee of the China lobby. Some called her the Little Flower, others, the Dragon Lady. She lived in a suite at the Watergate apartment building, and was escorted about town by the crafty Thomas \u201cTommy the Cork\u201d Corcoran, who had served in Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s brain trust. As a member of the conservative China lobby, which promoted the interests of the nationalist Chinese against the mainland communists, Chennault was a fixture in Republican circles, and had an official role, organizing women, in the Nixon campaign.\u000a\u000aThough they differed on the details, Chennault and Bui Diem agree that sometime in early or mid-1968, they met secretly with Nixon and Mitchell in New York, and Nixon made it clear to the South Vietnamese ambassador that Chennault could speak on the candidate\u2019s behalf.\u000a\u000aHaldeman\u2019s files show how, in the weeks leading up to the November election, Chennault was in constant contact with the Nixon campaign. One campaign adviser alone\u2014Nixon\u2019s and Mitchell\u2019s law partner Thomas Evans\u2014recorded eight contacts with Chennault from September 30 to October 31, including a luncheon meeting on October 25. In that same period, the FBI tracked her phone calls and visits to the South Vietnamese Embassy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe longer the situation continues, the more we are favored,\u201d Ambassador Diem reported to Saigon. \u201cI am still in contact with the Nixon entourage.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Nixon campaign, meanwhile, had moles at work inside the Johnson administration and its diplomatic ranks. Mitchell had informed the campaign that Kissinger was \u201cfully available,\u201d Haldeman noted, but because of the \u201cdelicate\u201d position he was in as a foreign policy adviser to Johnson and New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, didn\u2019t want the news made public. A week later, former CIA Director John McCone and Kissinger (just back from a visit with American peace negotiators in Paris) each alerted Nixon to a potential breakthrough. Kissinger told Mitchell there was \u201ca better than even\u201d chance Johnson would halt the aerial bombardment of North Vietnam by the middle of October. The Harvard professor was leveraging his knowledge for access to Nixon. \u201cK\u2019s really concerned about moves J[ohnson] will take & expects some before election,\u201d Haldeman noted.\u000a\u000aNixon well remembered the 1966 midterm campaign, when Johnson had flown to Manila on the eve of the election for a conference with Asian leaders and announced a new peace plan to sway voters. Now, Nixon feared, Johnson was at it again. Americans\u2019 frustration with the conduct of the war was one of the Republican campaign\u2019s chief assets: News of peace could sap the electorate\u2019s yearning for change. Nixon had agreed to support Johnson\u2019s negotiating strategy, which posed various conditions that North Vietnam needed to meet. Now, he suspected, Johnson was double-crossing him, and selling the country out.\u000a\u000a\u201cRN thnks attempt by LBJ to get pause before election,\u201d Haldeman wrote. \u201cIs attempt to build up idea war is at end.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his notes from October 19, Haldeman gives his first account of the Nixon campaign\u2019s backdoor contacts with the South Vietnamese. Mitchell had conveyed word to Nixon that Thieu was feeling \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from LBJ and that the South Vietnamese wanted the Republicans to take Saigon\u2019s side and determine what the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d would be for their cooperation. \u201cThey propose to hold out long as poss,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aThree days later, Nixon\u2019s longtime friend and adviser, Bryce Harlow, reported from a source in the Johnson White House that a bombing halt was imminent, and would be announced with news of promising peace talks, as part of a plot to boost Humphrey\u2019s chances. Harlow\u2019s report, and signs of Humphrey\u2019s rapidly improving position in the polls, prompted Nixon\u2019s late-night call to Haldeman. His notes end any questions about Nixon\u2019s personal involvement in the scuttling of the peace talks.\u000a\u000a\u201c! Keep Anna Chennault working on SVN,\u201d Haldeman wrote. Further down, anticipating the political boost to Humphrey, Haldeman reported Nixon asking: \u201cAny other way to monkey wrench it? Anything RN can do\u201d as well as Nixon\u2019s order that Woods call her old friend Kung from the China lobby and get him \u201cgoing on the SVN.\u201d Nixon himself reached out to Chiang Kai-shek, the president of nationalist China, informing him that Kung would be conveying an important, personal message from him.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s mind was racing. He ordered Haldeman to contact Charles \u201cBebe\u201d Rebozo, the candidate\u2019s good friend, and tell him that Nixon was \u201cmad as hell.\u201d Rebozo was to call Senator George Smathers, the Democrat from Florida, and \u201chave Smathers threaten J[ohnson]\u201d that \u201cN is going to blast him \u2026 in major speech on VN\u201d should the president use a bombing halt to help Humphrey. And, finally, Nixon told Haldeman to have his vice-presidential candidate, Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland, confront CIA Director Richard Helms about the peace talks. Helms\u2019 hopes of keeping his position in a Nixon administration depended on his cooperation, Agnew was to say. \u201cTell him we want the truth\u2014or he hasn\u2019t got the job,\u201d Nixon said.\u000a\u000aAnother message came in from Saigon on October 31, the day Johnson, in a nationally televised address, announced the bombing halt. Johnson had summoned the U.S. commander in Vietnam, General Creighton Abrams, back to Washington and obtained the general\u2019s personal support for the plan. Chennault conveyed a different report. \u201cD. Lady says Abrams screamed like stuck pig,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aThroughout, Nixon and his aides viewed Johnson\u2019s actions as a crude ploy by the president to help Humphrey. \u201cThey\u2019re selling out SVN\u2014leave new admin to hdle make a communist Asia,\u201d Nixon told Haldeman. They didn\u2019t have access to, or put faith in, the information the Soviets were supplying the White House.\u000a\u000aBut the records from the Johnson presidential library demonstrate that LBJ and his advisers believed they had a viable opportunity to bring an end to the war.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy colleagues and I think\u2014and we have grounds to do so\u2014that complete cessation by the United States of bombing and other acts of war \u2026 could contribute to a breakthrough,\u201d the Soviet premier, Alexei Kosygin, had written Johnson.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Russians are obviously trying very hard to pull this off\u2014and in a hurry,\u201d Rostow told the president on October 22.\u000a\u000aAnd after midnight, on October 28, after leaving a dinner meeting at the White House with Johnson, and conducting a final late-night session with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Rostow composed a heartfelt letter to the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere were four people in that room at dinner tonight, aside from yourself, who have lived Vietnam, with all its pain, since January 1961: [Secretary of State Dean] Rusk, [General Maxwell] Taylor, [General Earle] Wheeler and myself. All of us know that, with all its uncertainties, we have the best deal we now can get\u2014vastly better than any we thought we could get since 1961,\u201d Rostow wrote. \u201cIf we go ahead we know it may be tough. But with military and political determination we believe we can make it stick ... None of us would know how to justify delay.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Johnson resolved to take the risk. It was with considerable irritation that he discovered (via banker Alexander Sachs, who lunched with Rostow\u2019s brother Eugene and passed on the latest scuttlebutt from Wall Street insiders) that the Nixon campaign was in league with Saigon and out to wreck the peace plan. Johnson ordered government surveillance of Chennault, the South Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, and Thieu\u2019s offices in Saigon, and his irritation turned to anger.\u000a\u000aOn October 30, the president muttered darkly about Chennault\u2019s activities with Senator Richard Russell, the Democrat from Georgia. The next day, Johnson announced the bombing halt. That night, he was beside himself, raging about Nixon\u2019s actions in a telephone call to Senator Edward Dirksen of Illinois, the Republican leader in the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable. \u2026 We could stop the killing out there,\u201d Johnson insisted. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got this \u2026 new formula put in there\u2014namely, wait on Nixon. And they\u2019re killing four or five hundred every day waiting on Nixon.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe FBI surveillance traced the Little Flower\u2019s activities. \u201cAnna Chennault contacted Vietnam Ambassador Bui Diem,\u201d one report noted, \u201cand advised him that she had received a message from her boss \u2026 which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was \u2026 \u2018Hold on. We are gonna win. \u2026 Please tell your boss to hold on.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aWith such transcripts in hand, Johnson blamed Nixon for strangling a chance for peace. He lashed out at Dirksen.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m reading their hand, Everett,\u201d Johnson told his old friend. \u201cThis is treason.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI know,\u201d Dirksen said mournfully.\u000a\u000aDirksen reported the conversation to Harlow, who relayed the gist of it to Haldeman. \u201cLBJ called Dirksen\u2014says he knows Repubs through D. Lady are keeping SVN in present position if this proves true\u2014and persists\u2014he will go to nation & blast Reps & RN. Dirksen very concerned,\u201d Haldeman wrote.\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s advice to Haldeman was to rally congressional Republicans against the Democrats and \u201ckick them hard \u2026 [saying] this is a political gimmick\u201d that could \u201crisk Am lives w/o any return.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe election was now only a day away. On Monday, November 4, Johnson held a conference call with Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Defense Secretary Clifford to decide if they should make Nixon\u2019s treachery public. But Johnson did not have Haldeman\u2019s notes\u2014or other \u201cabsolute proof,\u201d as Clifford put it, of Nixon\u2019s direct involvement. And Nixon had denied it all in his November 3 phone call with the president.\u000a\u000aRostow had urged Johnson to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d and \u201cdestroy\u201d Nixon if the undermining did not stop. But exposing the Republican campaign\u2019s perfidy, on the eve of the November 5 election, meant revealing the Johnson administration\u2019s surveillance of both a wartime ally and the domestic political opposition. The resulting scandal would taint the next presidency and might cause a fatal break with South Vietnam, and neither Johnson nor Humphrey was willing to pay that price. Even Rostow admitted there was then \u201cno hard evidence that Mr. Nixon himself is involved.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson faced a situation like that which confronted President Barack Obama in the summer and fall of 2016, as U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that the Russians had hacked and published Democratic Party emails with the intent of helping Republican Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aWithout proof of Trump\u2019s knowledge or collusion, Obama appears to have made the same decision that Johnson reached in 1968. Releasing such stunning allegations in an election season, without collaboration, would itself be unseemly.\u000a\u000aNixon had taken a great risk, and won. The news of the bombing halt had erased his lead, but his ability to raise doubts about Johnson in the final days allowed him to pull through. He won, in the three-way race, with 43.2 percent of the popular vote. Humphrey received 42.7 percent, and Wallace 13.5 percent.\u000a\u000aNow Nixon was the president-elect, sharing responsibility with the Johnson administration for the outcome of the war. Prodded by Johnson, he changed his tune.\u000a\u000aIn a bracing phone call, Johnson told Nixon that \u201cfolks close to you \u2026 Mrs. Chennault\u201d were telling Thieu to drag his feet. He reminded Nixon of the cost of such intrigue. The delay was \u201ckilling Americans every day,\u201d Johnson told his successor.\u000a\u000aJust as alarming, for Nixon, was the warning from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, reflected in Haldeman\u2019s notes, that LBJ had the bureau tapping phones.\u000a\u000aSo Nixon changed course. He instructed a new go-between, veteran American diplomat Robert Murphy, to inform the South Vietnamese that they should cooperate with Johnson. They must not look, Murphy was to tell Saigon, that they were blocking peace at Nixon\u2019s behest.\u000a\u000aNixon (left) walks with his assistant, H.R. Haldeman, to the White House for a Cabinet meeting in December 1969. | AP Photo\u000a\u000aChennault grew bitter as, in the weeks between the election and Nixon\u2019s inauguration, word of her role leaked to the press, and the men in the incoming administration distanced themselves.\u000a\u000aIn December, 1968 she wrote a long letter to Nixon, asking the president-elect to make her his special adviser on Asian affairs, and gave it to Evans to deliver by hand. A few weeks later, Woods, Nixon\u2019s personal secretary, wrote the transition personnel director, Peter Flanigan, saying that hiring Chennault \u201cwould be a disaster,\u201d and that \u201cthe sooner we can keep her as far away as possible from the administration the better.\u201d\u000a\u000aChennault did not get the job. Several months passed and Nixon adviser Harlow reported her discontent in a private note to Haldeman. \u201cSeems she is being cut up by press etc. for her alleged activities during the campaign involving South Vietnam. Certain aspects of this you and I know; she asserts that everything she did was with the full knowledge of John Mitchell\u201d and other Nixon aides, Harlow wrote. \u201cShe feels forsaken \u2026 as she is subjected to severe criticism for activities which she insists were undertaken at the direct request of the Nixon campaign group.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 1973, Chennault\u2019s friend Tommy Corcoran visited Nixon in the Oval Office. In the conversation, captured on the White House tapes, Corcoran solicited a favor for her, reminding the president how she \u201ckept her mouth shut\u201d on Nixon\u2019s behalf when the press dug into the Chennault Affair. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d Nixon said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aWhat was the cost of Nixon\u2019s scheming?\u000a\u000aLooking back in May 1973, as the Watergate scandal exploded in the press, Rostow concluded that the success of the Chennault Affair gave Nixon and his aides a taste for illegal conniving and a false sense of confidence, which led them to their destruction in the Watergate affair.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe election of 1968 proved to be close and there was some reason for those involved on the Republican side to believe their enterprise with the South Vietnamese and Thieu\u2019s recalcitrance may have sufficiently blunted the impact on U.S. politics of the total bombing halt and agreement to negotiate to constitute the margin of victory,\u201d Rostow wrote, in a private memo to his files.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey got away with it,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs the same men faced the election of 1972 there was nothing in their previous experience with an operation of doubtful propriety (or, even, legality) to warn them off; and there were memories of how close an election could get and the possible utility of pressing to the limit\u2014or beyond.\u201d\u000a\u000aNixon\u2019s meddling was not the singular element that cost the United States the opportunity to end the war in the fall of 1968, saving tens of thousands of American and Vietnamese lives and four years of excruciating political division at home. The stubbornness displayed by both North and South Vietnam that fall, and in future negotiations, and history\u2019s analysis of the internal political machinations and external pressures at play in Saigon and Hanoi preclude such an easy verdict.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny judgment must be tentative,\u201d wrote the Democratic national security expert William Bundy in his book A Tangled Web, an examination of Nixon\u2019s foreign policy that includes a dissection of the Chennault Affair. \u201cThere is no way to prove beyond doubt that the [Nixon-Chennault] operation was decisive in Saigon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cImmediate and serious peace negotiations might have produced useful concessions. Yet \u2026 complete negotiations would have taken months, and Hanoi might have reverted to a very hard line,\u201d Bundy wrote. \u201cMy conclusion is that probably no great chance was lost.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet Bundy wrote with hindsight. What can also be said is that Nixon\u2019s signals bolstered Thieu\u2019s inclination to drag his feet. In the end, the Chennault episode shut a window that, with the help of the Soviet Union, Johnson and his aides thought they had opened. A moment of genuine hope, and a chance\u2014however slight\u2014to settle this ugly war was stolen.\u000a\u000aBundy raised another troubling issue, with relevance today, as we debate Trump\u2019s potential beholdedness to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Having conspired with Nixon to scuttle Johnson\u2019s peace process, Thieu was in the position to blackmail the new American president. Thieu emerged from the Chennault Affair \u201cconvinced that Nixon owed him a great political debt\u201d and \u201cattached great weight to it throughout\u201d the Nixon years, Bundy concluded. It was \u201cthe most important legacy of the whole episode.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Nixon and Kissinger reached their own peace accord with Hanoi in 1972, Thieu employed much the same stalling tactics he used in 1968 to try and get a better deal. To clinch Thieu\u2019s agreement, Nixon ordered Air Force B-52s to attack North Vietnam in what came to be known as \u201cthe Christmas bombing,\u201d and secretly promised Thieu that the United States would come to Saigon\u2019s aid, with \u201cfull force,\u201d if Hanoi violated the accord. Nixon had obtained no public or congressional support for such a vow, and when the time came to do so, in the spring of 1973, he failed to deliver.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, Saigon fell. By then, Nixon had resigned from office, the last casualty, as he told David Frost, of the war he had prolonged.\u000a\u000aThieu fled his country ahead of the advancing North Vietnamese armies and died in exile in 2001.\u000a\u000aChennault lived on, for many years, at the Watergate. She kept her bruised feelings to herself until the publication of her 1980 memoir, which she entitled: The Education Of Anna.\u000a\u000aJohn A. Farrell is the author of Richard Nixon: The Life.

aVIn North Korea, missiles and nuclear bombs are more than a means of national defense \u2014 they are, for broad segments of the public, objects of near-religious devotion.\u000a\u000aIn Pyongyang, the country\u2019s capital, missiles feature constantly in newspapers and on television. They emerge from flower pots in floral exhibitions; loom large in public mosaics; and adorn propaganda posters in factories, farms and schools. They\u2019re often depicted in mid-flight, framed by bold militaristic slogans.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is gradually developing the capability to fit a nuclear device on an intercontinental ballistic missile, a technology that could one day enable it to launch a nuclear strike on the U.S., and any other nation that might threaten the survival of the Kim family dynasty.\u000a\u000aYet a close reading of the country\u2019s propaganda suggests that its goals may be more ambitious \u2014 and more aggressive in nature \u2014 than foreign observers often assume.\u000a\u000aOne longtime analyst of the secretive country\u2019s murky ideology says it\u2019s become clear that North Korea\u2019s rulers have come to consider nuclear capability not just a means of defense, but the only way of achieving their most important goal: to rid South Korea of U.S. troops, and reunite the Korean peninsula on their own terms.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is a radical nationalist state and it\u2019s committed to anything that anybody in North Korea\u2019s position would be \u2014 which is the reunification of the [Korean] race, and the reunification of the homeland,\u201d said B.R. Myers, a professor at Dongseo University in South Korea who has spent years studying North Korean propaganda and ideology.\u000a\u000aTensions on the Korean peninsula are at their highest point in years. North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006, and could soon conduct its sixth. Its missile tests have become routine, including another attempted launch Friday. The U.S., in response to North Korean tests and threats, has diverted an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean peninsula. North Korea, meanwhile, has responded with a massive artillery exercise and warnings of imminent nuclear war.\u000a\u000aWhy is this happening? The North\u2019s strategic calculus hasn\u2019t changed in decades, Myers said. In 1994, President Clinton contemplated a preemptive strike on the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program \u2014 yet he balked in the face of the potential fallout: North Korea has a devastating array of artillery aimed at Seoul, which sits 35 miles south of the countries\u2019 heavily militarized border, and if a conflict were to erupt, hundreds of thousands of South Koreans could be killed within an hour.\u000a\u000aNow, Kim Jong Un, the country\u2019s current leader, has accelerated efforts to enable a strike not just on Seoul, but on the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe only logical answer is that it\u2019s pursuing something greater than mere security \u2014 and there\u2019s only one logical conclusion as to what that is. \u2014 B.R. Myers, professor at Dongseo University in South Korea\u000a\u000a\u201cWhy is it doing the one thing that could cause the U.S. to strike North Korea, even at the risk of South Korean fatalities?\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe only logical answer is that it\u2019s pursuing something greater than mere security \u2014 and there\u2019s only one logical conclusion as to what that is.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has been demanding the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea since the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in 1953. In December 1955, Kim Il Sung, the country\u2019s founder-president and Kim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather, said in a speech that "peaceful unification" was the ideal option, and could come about when "we grow stronger" and the "forces of peace, democracy and socialism become more powerful.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf that fails, \u201cthe problem of reunification might also be solved by war,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aPyongyang is probably confident that it can drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington, Myers said. South Korea will elect a new president on May 9, and both front-runners advocate a relatively lenient North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is unlikely to get its wish, at least any time soon. The U.S. has shown no sign of withdrawing its military commitment to South Korea, and South Korea is, economically, light years ahead of its northern neighbor.\u000a\u000aBut \u201cwe need to distinguish the feasibility of the strategy from the likelihood that North Korea is pursuing it,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t going to become an Islamic caliphate, but that doesn\u2019t stop the Islamists from pursuing that as a goal. And the North Koreans are pursuing something more feasible than what Islamic State is.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn North Korea, militant propaganda is ubiquitous and shrill. Often, images of missiles are paired with slogans denouncing \u201cU.S. imperialists\u201d and calling for reunification. \u201cStart a war against us, we strike the American bastards first!\u201d says one poster, showing missiles destroying the Capitol building in Washington.\u000a\u000aOne mosaic on Pyongyang\u2019s metro depicts Kim Il Sung as the sun, watching over a gleeful scene of reunification under the North Korean flag; another shows the North Korean proletariat, led by Kim, advancing against a backdrop of tanks, planes, and most prominently, flying missiles.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want Trump to withdraw the troops of U.S. Army from South Korea,\u201d said Rim Daesong, 28, a North Korean official, as he stepped onto a train. \u201cThe U.S. government has to change its policies, in order that our country can reunify independently.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn February, North Korea\u2019s state news agency KCNA called a successful ballistic missile test \u201ca pride of Kim Il Sung's nation [that] has instilled vitality into the glorious Kim Jong Un's era,\u201d adding that \u201cgetting firmer is the fellow countrymen's conviction in the final victory of the cause of national reunification.\u201d\u000a\u000aFyodor Tertitskiy, an expert on North Korean ideology at Seoul National University, said that North Korean propagandists often cast the country\u2019s missile program \u201cas a defensive measure,\u201d in line with rockets that it has used to put satellites into orbit.\u000a\u000aYet North Korean media often represent nuclear weapons as a direct blessing from the Kim family, Tertitskiy said, as a symbol of its \u201cinfinite wisdom\u201d in building \u201cthe glory of the nation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey really downplay this in the English-language propaganda,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when you look at the Korean original, it\u2019s very, very intense.\u201d\u000a\u000aDaniel Pinkston, an international relations expert at Troy University in Seoul, said the North Korean government has also framed missiles and rockets as historic scientific achievements. \u201cThe propaganda value is that the regime can take credit for managing these projects that are very visible,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen people look at it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Our scientists did that!\u2019 It\u2019s a kind of pride. The leadership recognize that. They feel it. They know it.\u201d

aVTrump escalates attacks on McConnell The president hints that he may call on McConnell to step down if he can't deliver legislative wins.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump declined to express confidence in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday and left open the possibility of calling on him to step down if he fails to get health care, tax reform and infrastructure legislation through the Senate.\u000a\u000aAsked by reporters outside his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, whether McConnell should step down from his leadership post, the president was noncommittal.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"I'll tell you what, if he doesn't get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn't get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question," Trump said.\u000a\u000aAsked to clarify, he added: "That means ask me that question. Let's hope he gets it done."\u000a\u000aDuring the question-and-answer session with reporters, Trump specially expressed frustration with Republicans' stalled effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a"I just want them to get repeal and replace done," he said a few minutes earlier.\u000a\u000a"They should have had this last one done," Trump added. "They lost by one vote. For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace and frankly it shouldn't have happened. That I can tell you."\u000a\u000aThe president piled on during a second session of remarks to reporters, praising his transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, in contrast with McConnell \u2014 her husband.\u000a\u000a\u201cElaine is doing a very good job. We\u2019re very proud of Elaine as secretary of transportation, as you know. She\u2019s doing a very good job. I\u2019m very disappointed in Mitch," Trump said. "If he gets these bills passed, I\u2019ll be very happy with him and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it."\u000a\u000aTrump's comments to reporters Thursday escalated his ongoing, public argument with McConnell over the Senate's handling of Republican efforts to pass a health care overhaul. The spat started when McConnell criticized the president at a Kentucky town hall meeting on Monday, complaining that Trump had "excessive expectations" about how quickly Congress could pass his agenda.\u000a\u000aTrump responded with a Twitter campaign against McConnell, which he restarted on Thursday morning, tweeting that the Kentucky Republican \u201ccouldn\u2019t get it done\u201d on repealing and replacing Obamacare.\u000a\u000a\u201cCan you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!\u201d Trump wrote.\u000a\u000aLater Thursday afternoon, Trump again jabbed at the majority leader, calling on him to push the Senate not just on repeal-and-replace but also on a pair of other White House legislative priorities.\u000a\u000a"Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it!" the president wrote.\u000a\u000aSenate Republicans have struggled to find consensus on what exactly their replacement for Obamacare should look like and upset some members by moving forward with the legislation outside of the traditional committee process. Ultimately, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona voted against a so-called skinny repeal, sinking GOP efforts at least for the time being.\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of the failed vote, McConnell said \u201cit is time to move on\u201d from health care and on to other legislative priorities, a stance that has earned him criticism not just from the president but from some in his own party.\u000a\u000aAt the event in Kentucky earlier this week, McConnell said he found the notion that Congress had accomplished nothing thus far under Trump \u201cextremely irritating\u201d and said the president had \u201cexcessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process\u201d because he is new to politics. Wednesday, Trump shot back at McConnell.\u000a\u000a\u201cSenator Mitch McConnell said I had \u2018excessive expectations,\u2019 but I don't think so,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cAfter 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump's comments to reporters on the question of McConnell stepping down prompted the rebuke of at least one Republican senator, Utah's Orrin Hatch, on Thursday afternoon.\u000a\u000aMcConnell "has been the best leader we\u2019ve had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges. I fully support him," Hatch said in a statement posted to Twitter.\u000a\u000aBrian McGuire, McConnell's former chief of staff, said on MSNBC later Thursday morning that the Twitter spat is a blip in an otherwise "very good working relationship" between the Senate leader and the president. But he acknowledged that the tweeting might not be helping Trump.\u000a\u000a"I think the president is free to say what he wants, obviously, but I do think the larger question is whether it's in his best interest," McGuire said. "And I think in this case, it's better that they work together, publicly and privately. And I think both of their goals are the same and they should just focus on those."\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe race is on to host Europe\u2019s prestigious medicines regulator \u2014 though some countries in the bidding process haven\u2019t ventured far past the starting line.\u000a\u000aEven before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, hopeful future hosts of the European Medicines Agency began their jockeying, just in case. Within months of the surprise vote, almost every EU country declared its intention to be the new home for one of the biggest Brexit prizes once it leaves Canary Wharf in London.\u000a\u000aFast forward to the European Council deadline for formal bids and not every country seems so serious. Some have never visited the agency to learn what its 890 staff need. Some have kept their efforts under wraps. Others have backed out completely. Some never joined the race: the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), Slovenia and Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy bid only for the similarly situated European Banking Authority (EBA).\u000a\u000aMany, however, have rolled out new building proposals and boosted domestic medicines agencies to support the EMA, a vital component of its highly technical work evaluating new drugs. More than 20 percent of that effort is carried out now by the British. Western EU countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark organized events in Brussels to present their bids. By contrast, most Eastern European countries have kept quiet, saving their lobbying power for later in the process.\u000a\u000aMeeting the workers\u000a\u000aAn obvious first step for any country wishing to host, house, educate and provide for hundreds of EMA staff and their families would be a trip to the agency. Employees have no say where they will end up, but meeting the EMA\u2019s executive is an opportunity to find out what it needs to run and make the shift seamless.\u000a\u000aFive of the 23 initial bidders hadn\u2019t visited as of press time, the EMA said.\u000a\u000aOf those that have, Hungary knocked first. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade delegation, minus the health minister, visited in October.\u000a\u000aThe country of 10 million leans heavily on the argument that EU agencies should be better spread across the Union. But Hungary already hosts two EU agencies in Budapest. And the European Council has downgraded the geographical spread as a selection criterion, giving more weight to measures that would permit a smooth transition.\u000a\u000aSome countries have proposed tailored moving services, such as language courses and family support.\u000a\u000aThe Czech Republic visited in December and decided not to bid after getting a look at the operation\u2019s size and scale. \u201cThe Czech Republic can offer better conditions and more suitable capacities for the relocation of the European Banking Authority,\u201d said Ale\u0161 Chmela\u0159, Czech state secretary for European affairs. (The far smaller EBA has 159 staff.) The Czechs have instead lent support for neighboring Slovakia\u2019s EMA bid.\u000a\u000aSome countries have visited more than once, including Austria (three times), Denmark and France, both twice. Health ministers from Spain, France, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Sweden have all visited. Other countries sent delegations on their behalf. Virtually all the visitors left leaflets and information for staff on what life would be like in their new city.\u000a\u000aAt the time of writing, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Germany and Poland hadn\u2019t visited. Germany \u201chas not provided the EMA any material directly\u201d on its bid, health ministry spokesperson Doris Berve-Schucht said.\u000a\u000aFinland said it will visit after submitting a bid. Finland is quietly confident it will stand out from the crowd: It has a \u201cvery precise plan\u201d that includes exact details on how the transition will happen, the candidacy spokesperson said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a very Finnish way of doing it,\u201d the spokesperson added, noting proximity to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki as key to the city\u2019s appeal.\u000a\u000aPoland met Polish nationals working for the EMA at its embassy in London in June, said Marcin Rynkowski, director of the department for international cooperation at the Polish health ministry, who is in charge of the EMA bid. Rynkowski said they plan to set a meeting with EMA boss Guido Rasi in London once they\u2019ve formally applied.\u000a\u000aThe criteria for the new location, adopted by EU leaders in June, factors in flight connectivity from other EU capitals to the new location. That puts places like Cyprus, on the southeastern periphery of the EU, at a disadvantage compared to centrally located, better-connected EU countries. Cyprus didn\u2019t make an official bid announcement after initially expressing interest in becoming the EMA host.\u000a\u000aPrime real estate\u000a\u000aMany bidding countries have proposed tailor-made offices for the agency. Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia have offered large, custom developments. Most plan to start construction by year\u2019s end and finish by March 2019 \u2014 an ambitious timeline.\u000a\u000aThe Dutch bid includes a transitional building option, in case construction isn\u2019t complete when Brexit talks finish, said Kajsa Ollongren, deputy mayor of Amsterdam.\u000a\u000aMalta, while offering \u201cseveral buildings in prime locations\u201d for an immediate transition, would also build customized premises with room for expansion, said Anis Cassar, press officer at the Maltese Permanent Representation to the EU.\u000a\u000aFrance, however, is confident there will be no transition interruptions. Health Minister Agnès Buzyn\u2019s spokesperson said its bid will \u201cguarantee\u201d the EMA will be up and running in its new Lille home by March 30, 2019.\u000a\u000aBuzyn has also visited the EMA twice \u2014 once in June, again in July \u2014 to find out staff needs, especially for the design of its proposed \u201cBiotope\u201d building, conceived specifically for the EMA with health and wellbeing at the core of the design.\u000a\u000aSome cities have buildings ready and waiting. Barcelona has proposed the Torre Glòries skyscraper, formerly known as Torre Agbar, and frequently compared with London\u2019s \u201cGherkin\u201d building.\u000a\u000aItaly has touted the 32-story Pirelli Tower in northeast Milan. While iconic and available, the tower was completed in 1958 and may seem like a step back in time for EMA staffers accustomed to their very new, state-of-the-art home in London.\u000a\u000aAustria has eight available buildings in Vienna, said Philipp Tillich, Austrian health attaché in Brussels. Seven are in the city center.\u000a\u000aGreece, which just officially announced its candidacy July 21, has caught up: It has an official website and has suggested the former building of a Greek tobacco company as the new EMA home.\u000a\u000aGermany and Portugal are hedging their bets; they\u2019ve offered a selection of existing and proposed new developments. It\u2019s unclear who would make the final call on a new office.\u000a\u000aStaff benefits\u000a\u000aSome countries have proposed tailored moving services, such as language courses and family support.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe day after the EU chooses Amsterdam, the Dutch government will open a relocation office to cater to each EMA employee individually,\u201d said Wouter Bos, a former Dutch deputy prime minister and the country\u2019s ambassador for the EMA bid. Portugal is offering a similar service, \u201ca one-stop-shop with liaison officers to help with the staff move.\u201d France would offer a \u201ctailored accompanying pack for staff and their families,\u201d ministry spokespeople said.\u000a\u000aGermany, Ireland, Finland and Denmark have kept these details quiet, saying all will be revealed in their final bids.\u000a\u000aLost expertise\u000a\u000aOne challenge will be compensating for work done by expert staff at the U.K.\u2019s medicines agency. The agency led or co-led 208 human or veterinary drug committees or workshops in 2016. These committees recommend which drugs should be licensed in the EU. Only Germany (195), the Netherlands (168), Sweden (157) and Austria (150) came anywhere close to that volume last year. Croatia participated in one leadership role, Slovakia and Greece in three each and the Czech Republic in 11.\u000a\u000aFor a big EU country, France\u2019s leadership in these committees is relatively low, at 98 in 2016. Of those only 22 were in the major human drug safety committees.\u000a\u000aTo compensate for the loss of British expertise, a handful of countries have already pledged to pick up the slack.\u000a\u000aAustria said it is hiring new people for its medicines agency to take up more workload for the EMA. Similarly, Spain said it has set aside \u20ac3 million to recruit 40 more staff and invest in training at the national agency to take on some of the U.K.\u2019s work.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile the Netherlands, which already rates high in work volume for its size, took a more philanthropic approach, dedicating \u20ac8 million to train staffers of other EU national drug agencies to take some EMA workload from the U.K. It\u2019s investing an additional \u20ac2 million to strengthen its own medicines agency.\u000a\u000aThe lobbying\u000a\u000aThe Council of the EU will decide who gets the EMA in November. It involves a complex multi-stage voting process of up to three rounds. With the added layer of the EBA vote, it will be hard to sew up sooner.\u000a\u000aThat hasn\u2019t prevented rumors from swirling about attempts to do just that. In June, weeks before EU leaders decided on six criteria for evaluating the bids, France\u2019s pitch was thought to be part of a bargaining deal with Germany in which Frankfurt would win the EBA and Lille the EMA.\u000a\u000aAnother tale said the French were involved in a more complex deal. Supposedly, France would support Frankfurt for the EBA and an Eastern European country for the EMA in return for an existing French agency, the European Securities and Markets Authority, being strengthened.\u000a\u000aThe Council strongly denied any pre-voting deals took place, but the rumors only serve to show who is already taking diplomatic lobbying seriously.\u000a\u000aOne diplomat in Brussels said Germany is not lobbying hard for the EMA, since its eyes are set on the EBA. Germany is bidding for both agencies just to have leverage to win the EBA, according to the diplomat. Hungary and Poland also are bidding for both agencies but won\u2019t say which they prefer.\u000a\u000aThe Eastern Europeans, part of the last three waves of EU expansion, lobbied hard behind closed doors with national ministers and ambassadors for an upper hand over countries that already have an EU agency and to keep the European Commission from having a decisive role in assessing countries\u2019 bids. Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Croatia were successful in closed-door lobbying but have disclosed little publicly about their bids.\u000a\u000aSo little that there are very few public details about Budapest\u2019s candidacy despite the looming deadline. The Bulgarian government has made no official announcement, though a few diplomats in Brussels said they were in the game, too.\u000a\u000aThe Council strongly denied any pre-voting deals took place, but the rumors only serve to show who is already taking diplomatic lobbying seriously.\u000a\u000aPortugal hasn\u2019t had time to lobby. Two-and-a-half weeks before the application deadline, it announced it\u2019s offering Porto instead of Lisbon to house the EMA. Despite the country claiming Lisbon was the preferred option for EMA staff (Spain also made this claim about Barcelona.), it swapped cities, but denied this was because of an outcry from officials in Porto.\u000a\u000a\u201cPlacing an agency as important as EMA in a city like Porto would have a strategic impact not only for Portugal but for Europe,\u201d Health Minister Adalberto Campos Fernandes told POLITICO, arguing that a spread of EU institutions and benefits across different cities, and not only capitals, would benefit their development.\u000a\u000aDenmark is making every effort to win over lawmakers and the EMA. It has hosted meetings with virtually all other EU countries about its candidacy, attended at times by Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, spokesperson Katrine Kirch Kirkegaard said. Denmark has also visited the EMA twice, in November and June. In return, the Danish health minister hosted EMA boss Guido Rasi in February this year, and Denmark\u2019s drugs regulator hosted the EMA\u2019s relocation team in April.\u000a\u000aThe lobbying is only expected to intensify ahead of the final decision in November.\u000a\u000aArnau Busquets Guàrdia contributed to this article.

aVThe closure of many Northern European poultry farms is a blow to the industry after last year's avian flu crisis | Robin van Lonkhuijsen/AFP via Getty Images Are Europe\u2019s eggs safe to eat? The toxic chemical fipronil may end up on breakfast platters.\u000a\u000aAuthorities across Northern Europe shut hundreds of poultry farms this week and stopped the sale of millions of eggs as safety inspectors warned that many batches contained a toxic insecticide: fipronil.\u000a\u000aSupermarkets took precautionary measures by withdrawing some cartons, and Aldi in Germany even stopped selling eggs outright. The chemical is completely banned for use on farm animals: Researchers link fipronil to a range of human health problems and point to a particular danger for children.\u000a\u000aChristian Meyer, agriculture minister from Germany\u2019s farm powerhouse of Lower Saxony, warned that the crisis had not reached its peak and told NDR radio that the federal government was downplaying the risks to children.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe German federal minister is denying the health threats and speaks of an average German consumption,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIf a child only eats as many eggs as Germans eat on average per month, then that would not be dangerous. But if the child eats \u2026 one egg a day, then there\u2019s already a breach of the acute threat level for children regarding that poison \u2014 so you see I believe we have to state clearly that there is a possible threat to children\u2019s health.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe full scale of the problem is still unclear as results of Belgian and German tests are expected in the coming days. It also remains to be seen whether the scandal is limited to eggs, or whether fipronil will transpire to be a risk in cakes and pasta too, as well as chicken itself.\u000a\u000aIn Belgium and the Netherlands, criminal investigations are under way. Investigators suspect a small company in Flanders called Poultry Vision concocted an illegal fipronil detergent to treat mite-infested chickens, unintentionally sparking an international food safety scandal.\u000a\u000aThe scandal comes as yet another hammer blow to Europe\u2019s poultry sector, which was hit by a devastating bout of avian influenza last year that meant many farmers lost the ability to sell their eggs as free-range.\u000a\u000aThis is what we know so far about the potential risks from the egg crisis:\u000a\u000aHow did this all start?\u000a\u000aOn July 22, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it placed seven poultry companies under investigation after finding fipronil in a batch of eggs. It said at the time that there was \u201cno immediate danger to public health.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe issue exploded into a major scandal this week. The NVWA closed 180 farms \u2014 which together produce some 40 million eggs a week \u2014 and said it had found one farm producing such high levels of fipronil that they posed an \u201cacute danger to public health.\u201d The Netherlands warned on Thursday that eggs from 59 producers should not be served to children.\u000a\u000aHow do Belgium and Germany evaluate the risk?\u000a\u000aBelgian health authorities are investigating their own poultry sector and blocked sales from a number of suspect farms. Kathy Brison, spokesperson for the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, said early tests suggested the levels of fipronil in Belgian eggs were much lower than those in the Netherlands. Full results, however, are still pending.\u000a\u000aGermany is far less sanguine. German officials said they are frustrated by the lack of information they received from Belgium and the Netherlands but are testing imports from both countries. Full Belgian results are still pending, but illegal levels of fipronil were detected in German and Dutch eggs.\u000a\u000aContrary to the Belgian position that there was no danger, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) said the highest level measured in Belgian eggs had a fipronil count of 1.2mg/kg. It cautioned that above 0.72mg/kg, there could be health risks for children.\u000a\u000aWilhelm Deitermann, spokesperson for North-Rhine-Westphalia\u2019s agriculture and consumer protection ministry, said Belgian authorities were \u201cnot giving us any information whatsoever\u201d on which farms had been tested or on test results. He doubted the Belgians were \u201cup to the job.\u201d\u000a\u000aLower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said it was likely that more than 10 million eggs containing fipronil were sold in Germany.\u000a\u000aWho\u2019s to blame?\u000a\u000aA senior Belgian food safety official told POLITICO that a Belgian company called Poultry Vision near Antwerp was the prime suspect. It allegedly supplied a Dutch coop-cleaning business with its own signature delousing detergent. The official said the company started using fipronil from January.\u000a\u000aAuthorities in the Netherlands also said they were investigating another Dutch company. De Volkskrant, a Dutch newspaper, named the cleaning business using the fipronil product as ChickFriend.\u000a\u000aPoultry Vision did not respond to requests for comment. However, a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity told POLITICO that he thought use of the insecticide was a simple error of judgment. \u201cI think they just did tests to see if it [the fipronil] worked and it did and then carefully tested if the animals would be harmed when spraying,\u201d the person said.\u000a\u000aChickFriend could not be reached for comment.\u000a\u000aDutch authorities are under fire at home for taking so long to react after they were originally tipped off about the problem on June 19. Paula de Jonge, an NVWA spokesperson, said it was in the process of finding out the background: \u201cNVWA is currently working on a timeline to place all events in chronological order. We want to establish exactly how we were informed by the Belgians.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow dangerous is fipronil?\u000a\u000aFipronil is highly toxic to bees, mice, rabbits and some birds. It acts on the central nervous system, but the effects are reversible in adults, according to BfR. NVWA says that exposure to fipronil can cause \u201cnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and epileptic seizures,\u201d but adds that, in general, these symptoms disappear. It can affect the thyroid and liver.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no evidence that the fipronil from Belgium has harmed anyone.\u000a\u000aWhat about chicken meat?\u000a\u000aThe poultry industry generally separates so-called meat birds from laying hens. These egg hens are still often slaughtered for their meat but butchering differences lower the risk of eating them.\u000a\u000aThe NVWA says that laying hens tend to be used for processed chicken meat, while fillets, for example, come from specially fattened birds. \u201cBy processing in small pieces, exposure to fipronil is likely to be very limited,\u201d the agency said.\u000a\u000aChristian Meyer, Lower Saxony\u2019s health minister, said German laboratories were testing meat. Germany\u2019s BfR had data from Belgian meat but the fipronil levels were low.\u000a\u000aWhat are retailers doing?\u000a\u000aPrivate businesses aren\u2019t waiting and pulling eggs from their shelves. German supermarket Aldi on Thursday withdrew all of its eggs, citing fipronil fears, while Lidl said it would only sell eggs they could prove were unaffected. Penny and REWE stopped selling any eggs of Dutch origin.\u000a\u000aDutch retailer Albert Heijn also removed 14 different types of eggs from its shelves.\u000a\u000aWould I be alright if I bought organic eggs?\u000a\u000aNot necessarily. The detergent illegally boosted with fipronil was originally authorized for organic farming as it was fortified only with additives such as eucalyptus and menthol. Fipronil has been found in organic eggs.\u000a\u000aCan I still eat cakes and noodles?\u000a\u000aThere are growing fears that fipronil eggs may have lingered in the food chain for months, and ended up in processed products that rely heavily on eggs. Lower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said that his state authorities would begin testing these kinds of foods. Dutch authorities are already doing so.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot rule out that poisoned eggs have also landed in cakes or pasta,\u201d Lower Saxony\u2019s Meyer said in an interview with local media.\u000a\u000aCynthia Kroet and Simon Marks contributed reporting.

aVBUDAPEST \u2014 For a fledging political movement with its headquarters in a basement, Hungary\u2019s Momentum has already achieved a degree of success by halting an Olympic bid. The next target is Viktor Orbán.\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian prime minister\u2019s grip on power remains firm ahead of an election set for April 2018. Among voters who say they\u2019ve made up their mind already, his Fidesz party regularly tops 50 percent in the polls, around 30 points clear of the far-right Jobbik and even further ahead of the Socialist Party.\u000a\u000aBut the much smaller Momentum thinks it has identified a weakness in the Hungarian leadership: its love of sport. \u201cHungary spends more on professional sport than on higher education,\u201d said Momentum\u2019s leader, 28-year-old András Fekete-Gy\u0151r.\u000a\u000aMomentum made news in early 2017 when it attempted to force a referendum on Budapest\u2019s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. It collected around 266,000 signatures, more than double the number required to trigger a city-wide vote on the plan, by arguing that Hungary wasn\u2019t rich enough to afford the games.\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s response was swift. Orbán pulled the bid, not wanting to risk a repeat of 2014 when a planned tax on internet use led to mass street protests and ended with the only major U-turn of his premiership.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur task is no less than this: building an entrepreneurial, cohesive and modern nation in the Europe of the 21st century\u201d \u2014 Momentum leader András Fekete-Gy\u0151r\u000a\u000aEven now, Orbán acts as though Momentum\u2019s campaign never happened, telling party colleagues in July: \u201cThere is not a big world event that Budapest could not host.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat was a boast with some justification from sports fan Orbán: last month\u2019s World Aquatics Championships was held in Hungary.\u000a\u000aLong-term thinking\u000a\u000aThe question now is whether Momentum has any momentum.\u000a\u000aIn local media interviews in the aftermath of the anti-Olympics campaign, Fekete-Gy\u0151r said anything was possible in 2018. He had a more low-key message when speaking to POLITICO in late July, saying \u201cthis party was built for the long term.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said the real goal of Momentum\u2019s 1,100 members \u2014 all of them subject to background checks by an \u201cHR officer\u201d \u2014 is not winning a few seats in the 2018 election, but a bigger transformation of Hungary into a \u201cmodern, digital country \u2026 in the eurozone, at the core of Europe.\u201d\u000a\u000aFekete-Gy\u0151r said he was happy to take his time and accept only the truly committed to the cause. He\u2019s targeting the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian expats in Western Europe, and hoping his compatriots can be persuaded to back a non-traditional party. Momentum believes 80 percent of Hungarians living abroad would return home given the right conditions, without saying how it got to that figure.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to POLITICO in the party\u2019s Budapest headquarters \u2014 a dingy basement \u2014 surrounded by flagons of cheap wine, second-hand furniture and a foosball table, it\u2019s hard to imagine Fekete-Gy\u0151r as the leader of the resistance against a leader as powerful as Orbán.\u000a\u000aYet Orbán himself was an upstart who became one of the Fidesz party\u2019s founders in 1988, at the age of 25. Two years later Fidesz entered parliament with around 5 percent of seats. But by 1998, Orbán was prime minister at the age of 35.\u000a\u000aThere are striking similarities between Fekete-Gy\u0151r and Orbán.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are patriots,\u201d said Fekete-Gy\u0151r, who is also sharp, multilingual and photogenic. Both trained as lawyers but quickly turned to politics. And like Orbán in his early days in politics, Fekete-Gy\u0151r has teamed up with liberals while not fully subscribing to their ideals.\u000a\u000aFekete-Gy\u0151r seems to have other influences. He was clearly trying to show off his inner Emmanuel Macron in his most significant speech, delivered May 1 at a rally in Budapest.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe time has come for those from Kazincbarcika, from Budapest, and from London, the right- and the left-leaning, the Christian and the atheist, the poor and the rich, the young and the old, to recognize our shared national fate, because we have a task. Let\u2019s set aside our animosities, because we\u2019re all patriots, because we\u2019re all valuable constituents of Hungarian nationality, and our task is no less than this: building an entrepreneurial, cohesive and modern nation in the Europe of the 21st century,\u201d Fekete-Gy\u0151r said.\u000a\u000aAside from tone, the main difference between Orbán and Fekete-Gy\u0151r is around 48 percent of support at the polls: Momentum typically polls at 1 to 2 percent nationally and is more popular in the capital than elsewhere in the country. A July poll by the Republikon Institute showed that in Budapest, Momentum enjoys the support of 5 percent of residents, putting it in fifth place.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not much but the Hungarian authorities clearly see Momentum as a threat, with anti-Momentum articles appearing regularly in the government-controlled press.\u000a\u000a\u2018Banal clichés\u2019\u000a\u000aCritics say that Momentum is politically naive. Eva S. Balogh, a prolific blogger who opposes Orbán\u2019s government, said that aside from the anti-Olympics campaign, Momentum offers only \u201cbanal clichés\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t got a clue about politics.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also alienated fellow opponents of the Orbán government by rejecting potential alliances with Hungary\u2019s liberal and left-wing opposition parties.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen András Fekete-Gy\u0151r says to the [Swiss newspaper] Neue Zürcher Zeitung that he supports \u2018both gay marriage and border control\u2019 [the border fence erected by Orbán to keep refugees out], he positions his party within the complex status quo \u2014 but with a \u2018new,\u2019 streamlined \u2018hipster patriot\u2019 foundation,\u201d left-wing philosopher and commentator Gáspár Miklós Tamás wrote in a recent critique of the party.\u000a\u000aIstván Heged\u0171s, a former Fidesz MP who left the party in frustration at its populist turn, was more optimistic. He said Momentum is \u201ca very promising pro-European party\u201d but reckoned an electoral breakthrough next year was unlikely given the group\u2019s refusal to cooperate with other parties.\u000a\u000a\u201cMomentum might consider 2022 to be the right timing for grasping power \u2014 unfortunately, the country might not have so much time to preserve the rest of democracy and the rule of law under a radicalizing illiberal, populist Orbán regime,\u201d Heged\u0171s said.\u000a\u000aSport or social services?\u000a\u000aMomentum\u2019s membership contains a large number of young professionals and students, and its focus on problems affecting young, mobile millennials makes it difficult to appeal to other Hungarians, especially older voters in rural areas.\u000a\u000aExpats who don\u2019t live in a country that borders Hungary must go to an embassy to vote \u2014 which drastically reduces turnout.\u000a\u000aBut in one area, its messaging had more of an everyman appeal. Instead of focusing on the government\u2019s treatment of the George Soros-funded Central European University or foreign-funded NGOs \u2014 issues far removed from the daily life of most Hungarians \u2014 Momentum used the Olympic bid as a way to talk about corruption and economic challenges.\u000a\u000aNow it must convince Hungarians to vote for it.\u000a\u000aMany of the party\u2019s core supporters live outside Hungary: and it\u2019s much harder to vote abroad. Expats who don\u2019t live in a country that borders Hungary must go to an embassy to vote \u2014 which drastically reduces turnout. Only about 5,000 out of over 200,000 Hungarians living in the U.K. during the 2014 election registered to vote at the London embassy, for example.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s easier to vote as a dual citizen who has never lived in Hungary than as a Hungarian living abroad,\u201d said Tamas Csillag, the head of the London branch of Momentum.\u000a\u000aMomentum\u2019s solution? A car-pooling app they are creating for the 2018 election.\u000a\u000aLili Bayer contributed reporting.

aVNearly a year on from the referendum that began the U.K. on its journey to the EU exit door, the formal negotiations on the terms of Britain\u2019s departure are due to start Monday morning.\u000a\u000aThe talks will begin \u2014 as the EU27 have demanded \u2014 with discussions about citizens\u2019 rights, the Irish border and the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations (the so-called Brexit bill). But once sufficient progress has been made on those issues they will move into complex territory covering everything from trade and security to planes and fishing.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to the negotiators who will be on either side of the table.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s Brexit negotiating team\u000a\u000aDavid Davis\u000a\u000aPosition: Secretary of state for exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: A true Brexit believer\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Standing down and flighting his own by-election in 2008 in protest at erosion of civil liberties\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 9/10\u000a\u000aThe odds-on favorite to become Conservative leader in 2005, Davis was pipped to the post by a young upstart named David Cameron. By 2016, he had gotten used to his place on the backbenches \u2014 a Tory freethinker and Brexiteer, though not of the head-banging variety. But in a textbook example of how that old wheel can turn, Cameron\u2019s post-referendum demise paved the way for Davis to return to government in the pivotal Brexit secretary role. Underestimated in Brussels but highly-rated by Theresa May, Davis, at 68-years-old, may view Brexit as his last great task in government (though he\u2019s now rumored to fancy a tilt at the top job again). Having argued for it for so long, he has a burning desire to get it right.\u000a\u000aOliver Robbins\u000a\u000aPosition: Prime Minister\u2019s EU adviser, Permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Whitehall wunderkind turned Brexit supremo\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Kicked out of a parliamentary committee hearing for presenting \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d evidence\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aTheresa May\u2019s Brexit sherpa, Robbins has been the U.K.\u2019s central figure behind closed doors ever since he was appointed by David Cameron as personal adviser on the EU in the days immediately after the June 2016 referendum.

Despite his tall and imposing frame, colleagues describe him as a likeable chap, and he has been well-received by his counterparts in Brussels, with whom he has had regular contact in the run-up to negotiations. Having held senior office in the governments of Blair, Brown, Cameron and May, he is the ultimate Brexit \u201cgrown-up.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhilip Rycroft\u000a\u000aPosition: Second permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU)\u000a\u000aReal position: Keeping the United Kingdom together through Brexit\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making transition from working with Europhile Nick Clegg, to delivering Brexit\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 6/10\u000a\u000aOlly Robbins\u2019 right-hand man, responsible for managing the department\u2019s overall policy and legislative program with Robbins expected to spend much of his time in detailed negotiations.

The heavily-whiskered Barrow proved a much more manageable lead at the U.K.\u2019s permanent representation, keeping a low profile that will have suited Downing Street just fine, after Rogers\u2019 valedictory diatribe about \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d caused red faces in London.

However, he is not rated in Brussels, drawing unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, and is not seen as having much influence in No. 10.\u000a\u000aAlex Ellis\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aReal position: International man of mystery\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Debuting at the Foreign Office as part of the team that supported political transition in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aThe effervescent Ellis is a popular man at DExEU, where he is one of two director generals, said to take enjoyment in slipping Brexit soundbites into everyday conversation (\u201cAs a demonstration of our new deep and special partnership \u2026 would you like a cup of tea?\u201d).

He is officially a top EU civil servant \u2014 a director general in the European Commission \u2014 but Barnier is at heart a politician, meaning it will be very hard for the British team to put one over on him. The center-right pro-Europe Gaullist was elected as a MP in the 1970s. He held several top ministerial positions in France and was twice France\u2019s European commissioner: for regional policy and a decade later for the internal market and financial services. He knows Brussels and the main capitals intimately and has a reputation as a tough negotiator with a clear vision of where his powers and limits are. Some argue that Barnier is more powerful than many commissioners, but he operates within tight guidelines set by the European Council and approved by member countries and so has little room to maneuver.\u000a\u000aSabine Weyand\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: European deputy chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Staying on top of the details\u000a\u000aCareer highlight\u005clowlight: Deputy director general in the Commission\u2019s directorate general for trade.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aWeyand\u2019s experience as deputy at the Commission\u2019s powerful trade policy department will be invaluable in the later stages of the negotiations \u2014 plus her skills nicely complement Barnier\u2019s. In her trade role, Weyand is used to long and complex negotiations so she won\u2019t be fazed by anything the U.K. throws at her. In the official organigram of Barnier\u2019s Brexit taskforce, Weyand has direct oversight of the top staffers in charge of detailed aspects of the talks, from aviation to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill, meaning she will have to be across vast swathes of the detail. The word in Brussels is that Weyand\u2019s real job is to act as an envoy to Martin Selmayr, the Commission president\u2019s chief of staff, so that he can keep an eye on proceedings. Plus her German nationality keeps Barnier\u2019s team from being too French-dominated at the top.\u000a\u000aMartin Selmayr\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of cabinet of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission\u000a\u000aReal position: Feared as the hugely powerful \u201cmonster in the Berlaymont\u201d\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: One of the few top Commission officials who makes headlines with his tweets\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aThe German former lawyer has run the daily operation of the European Commission since October 2014. Selmayr is powerful and he knows it, although he professes not to be. \u201cMy power is nonexistent. It derives only from what the president instructs me,\u201d he said. In reality, in policy areas from migration to the Greek crisis and of course Brexit, Selmayr has been a key actor establishing the Commission\u2019s position. Selmayr will be at the Brexit table representing the Commission \u2014 but even when he\u2019s not he will be there in spirit through Barnier\u2019s deputy, Sabine Weyand.\u000a\u000aDidier Seeuws\u000a\u000aNationality: Belgian\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of the European Council\u2019s Article 50 task force\u000a\u000aReal position: Coordinator in chief\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: He was the spokesman of the former Belgian prime minister and now Brexit coordinator in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aSeeuws, a Belgian diplomat, was appointed just days after the Brexit vote to head the Council\u2019s Article 50 task force in the Council \u2014 ahead of Barnier himself. The Council\u2019s swift move was seen by some Commission top officials as a power-grab. But politically savvy Seeuws was not appointed to compete with Barnier but to do his part in the Council, shuttling between national capitals in order to iron out differences in the talks. Seeuws is not seen as a controversial figure and the diplomat, who worked in the Belgian foreign ministry and the Belgian permanent representation to the EU, is credited with unlocking a deal on the European patent system, an issue that had resisted compromise for 30 years. He is a keen cyclist.\u000a\u000aStéphanie Riso\u000a\u000aNationality: French\u000a\u000aFormal position: Director for strategy, coordination and communication\u000a\u000aReal position: To prevent the U.K. dividing the EU27 side on the Brexit bill\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Former head of unit for the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aRiso was one of the first appointments Barnier made to his team, sending a clear message \u2014 there will be no free-riding and the U.K. must pay what it owes.

aVThe Wall Street Journal and its publisher Rupert Murdoch appear to be using President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser H.R. McMaster as their latest weapon in their continuing battle against Trump\u2019s America-first agenda and movement that enabled Trump to shock the world on election night.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump won the White House, Democrats, the Deep State, and the legacy media have often worked together to delegitimize Trump, which is something Trump has every reason to be angry about. But the Journal, by mimicking Joe Scarborough and attempting to marginalize Trump\u2019s nationalist advisers, is subtly trying to take over Trump\u2019s presidency for the GOP establishment that Trump resoundingly defeated over and over and over again.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aIn its latest editorial on Wednesday, the paper of choice for Republican globalists hopes that there is more \u201cclean-up duty to be done\u201d for new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. The paper targets White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon for opposing McMaster\u2019s \u201cfavoring more troops\u201d in Afghanistan and McMaster\u2019s insistence on not getting out of the Iran Deal.\u000a\u000aThe Journal laments that the \u201cpolicy brawls\u201d in a White House in which it often seems like Bannon is the lone America-first nationalist in a cage match with a team of globalists who have never understood Trump\u2019s agenda cause \u201cdysfunction.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo the Journal, it is a problem that Bannon, whom former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus described as someone who worked 24 hours a day for Trump\u2019s nationalist agenda, is a street fighter for the working-class Americans who elected Trump and whom the Journal views as mere commodities.\u000a\u000aIn March, the Journal, as Breitbart News noted, criticized Bannon\u2019s \u201csignature issues of economic nationalism and border security\u201d as unacceptable positions that were responsible for \u201cpolarization\u201d even though those issues united working-class Democrats and Republicans in the Rust Belt to deliver Trump his election-night win. The Journal has always been right in this sense\u2014the greatest divide between Wall Street and Main Street has been on issues like amnesty for illegal immigrants that put internationalist-first globalists against America-first nationalists. And in 2016, the Journal was consistently on the wrong side of this divide.\u000a\u000aWhen former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was resoundingly criticized for his \u201cact of love\u201d remarks about illegal immigrants during the 2016 election cycle, it was the Wall Street Journal that rushed in with a flurry of pro-Jeb! articles, with one editorial suggesting that Tea Partiers and America-first nationalists were racists. Desperately hoping Bush could win the nomination without abandoning his support for open borders, the Journal egged on Bush to not waver from his pro-amnesty views, saying at one point that Bush\u2019s stance on illegal immigration was not an \u201cinsuperable barrier to the nomination.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon so often has to throw haymakers for Trump\u2019s voters because nearly all of Trump\u2019s top advisers in the White House are Democrats or GOP globalists.\u000a\u000aDemocrat Jared Kushner, whose personal taxpayer-funded spokesperson reportedly donated to Hillary Clinton as late as October of 2016, already committed political malpractice by foolishly convincing Trump that Democrats would greet FBI director James Comey\u2019s firing like many in the Republican establishment were convinced that Iraqis would greet American troops with \u201csweets\u201d and \u201cflowers.\u201d\u000a\u000aDemocrat and Hillary Clinton donor Gary Cohn has been trying to push Trump to adopt more globalist policies that Wall Street and Davos elites favor.\u000a\u000aInternationalist H.R. McMaster, who may be allergic to saying \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d seems to have spent more energy in the first months of his job purging Trump\u2019s loyalists from national security posts and trying his best to convince Trump that radical Islamic terrorism, to use the words of Trump\u2019s adviser Dr. Sebastian Gorka, is just the \u201cflu\u201d as opposed to a \u201ccancer\u201d that needs to be annihilated.\u000a\u000aThen there is McMaster\u2019s globalist deputy Dina Powell, the Scarborough ally who the Journal knows will get even more influence if Bannon, as Scarborough begged Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly to do, is sidelined.\u000a\u000aTrump essentially put a stake in the heart of Bushism in 2016, but Powell is the one in Trump\u2019s White House who carries whatever flickering flame is left of Bushism\u2014the disastrous combination of neoconservatism abroad and corporate cronyism at home that made the nation hate Republicans.\u000a\u000aBut as Vogue noted in a glowing profile, Powell \u201calso is good friends with [former President Barack] Obama\u2019s former senior advisor, Valerie Jarrett,\u201d who persuaded Murdoch to go even more all-in on comprehensive amnesty legislation while Obama was in the White House. The day after Murdoch reportedly requested to sit next Jarrett at a dinner in 2014, he penned an op-ed in his Wall Street Journal in which Murdoch declared that amnesty for illegal immigrants and an unlimited number of high-tech visas for Silicon Valley just \u201ccan\u2019t wait.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press reported this week that the dispute between McMaster\u2019s more interventionist approach in Afghanistan and Bannon\u2019s non-nation building strategy represents a greater tension between the Republican establishment that McMaster represents and Trump\u2019s movement of \u201cAmerica-first\u201d voters, whose views Bannon best embodies in Trump\u2019s White House.\u000a\u000aMurdoch\u2013as Joshua Green reported in his book Devil\u2019s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump and the Storming of the Presidency\u2013seems to have always held those working-class nationalists in contempt.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s daughter Ivanka reportedly wanted to break the news that her dad was going to enter the presidential race to Murdoch at a lunch. But Murdoch had so much disdain for Trump\u2019s pro-nationalist platform and was so dismissive of Trump\u2019s potential candidacy and chances of winning that he royally dissed Trump and his daughter right to their faces:\u000a\u000aSoon after the three of them were seated and the waiter brought their soup, Ivanka spoke up: \u201cMy father has something to tell you.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Murdoch said.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s going to run for president.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s not running for president,\u201d Murdoch replied without looking up from his soup.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, he is!\u201d she insisted.\u000a\u000aMurdoch changed the subject.\u000a\u000aTrump nursed the slight for months. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even look up from his soup!\u201d he\u2019d complain.\u000a\u000aThe Journal is trying to get the best of both worlds by attempting yet again to marginalize Bannon. They want Trump to turn into globalist George H.W. Bush and move away from the pro-nationalist and America-first agenda that won Trump his historic election. Murdoch\u2019s establishment Republican paper is trying to convince Trump to chase the mythical and overhyped \u201cNo Labels\u201d voters (there may be more dead armadillos than these \u201cNo Labels\u201d middle-of-the-road voters).\u000a\u000aSo long as Trump adopts the Journal\u2019s globalist agenda, the paper of record for the GOP permanent political class seems like it would be perfectly fine if Trump is booted out of office in 2020 and branded as one of history\u2019s biggest losers. That would actually be a win-win for the Journal and a lose-lose for Trump and his historic movement.

Most of them made salaries ordinarily only chiefs of staff earn, but they were rarely seen or heard from in Hill IT circles.\u000a\u000aThe crew is now the target of a U.S. Capitol Police criminal information security probe with assistance from other law enforcement agencies as needed. Politico reported the \u201cHouse staffers are accused of stealing equipment from members\u2019 offices without their knowledge and committing serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbbas lived in the basement of a house that Hina owned as a rental property, according to Cristal Perpignan, who occupied the top floors of the house. Abbas administered the email accounts and computers of eight members of Congress, according to official payroll records. House IT administrators can read all emails sent and received by members for whom they work.\u000a\u000aDo You Think Congressional Democrats Will Get Better At Vetting? Yes No Login with your social identity to vote Thanks for participating in this survey, in order to vote you must register with your email address.\u000a\u000aSign out.\u000a\u000a\u201cRao did appear to be home most days,\u201d Perpignan said, and she claimed that Imran told her Abbas had lost his job at McDonald\u2019s. Imran appeared to use Abbas as a cutout in more ways than one because he instructed her to make rental checks payable to Abbas instead of the landlord, she said.\u000a\u000aFor years, Abbas was the only IT worker for Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and the only D.C.-based one for Ted Deutch of Florida, according to payroll records. If Abbas did not actually perform IT work for Congress, it raises the question of whether someone else with no staff relationship, such as Imran, was performing sensitive administrator-level IT work when required.\u000a\u000aTo get administrator-level access to a congressional office\u2019s accounts, a form must be submitted that requires the member\u2019s signature, House IT workers told TheDCNF. People who are not on staff are not permitted to do work for the office, according to House rules.\u000a\u000aSpokesmen for Cleaver and Deutch refused to say whether Abbas was ever seen in their offices, how Abbas came to appear on their payrolls or who on their staffs had IT administrator-level access to computer files.\u000a\u000aCleaver put five out of the six members of the Awan circle \u2014 all but Jamal \u2014 on his payroll at various times. It\u2019s an unusual number of tech workers, and an arrangement that should have made the existence of nepotism obvious to the member or his chief of staff. For the last two years, Abbas was the sole person with access to Cleaver\u2019s computers.\u000a\u000aDeutch, meanwhile, had Natalia \u2014 who is from Ukraine, while the others are Pakistani \u2014 as his IT person in 2011. Soon he had Natalia, Imran and Abbas all listed as working for him. Then, for the last two years, there was only Abbas, meaning if Abbas was a no-show employee, it should have been obvious. Deutch also has a full-time IT worker based out of his district office, which most members do not have.\u000a\u000aWith allegedly no-show employees connected to Imran being added to numerous offices, someone had to do the work. Imran enlisted an old high school friend, Haseeb Rana, for this purpose. Haseeb did not respond to TheDCNF\u2019s multiple requests for comment.\u000a\u000aHis father, Tanwir Rana, said Haseeb is a skilled IT professional and \u201cthey made him do all the work \u2026 After three months, he wanted to leave. We were having a very charged relationship with Imran. [Haseeb] was not satisfied with their behavior.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayroll records show that Haseeb began working for the House in 2013 and quit by the end of 2014.\u000a\u000aTanwir described Imran as having hired Haseeb even though the men are not part of a company and are hired as individual W-2 employees by congressional offices. Members or their chiefs of staff generally make hiring decisions.\u000a\u000aTheDCNF interviewed multiple people who know Imran personally and say he boasted that he had outsized influence over numerous Democratic lawmakers.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz has refused to fire Imran despite House authorities banning him from accessing official computers. She also threatened the Capitol Police with \u201cconsequences\u201d if they didn\u2019t return a computer Imran used that was later seized as evidence in the investigation.\u000a\u000aAccording to payroll records, two newly-elected Democrats, Reps. Charlie Crist of Florida and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, put Abbas on their payrolls when they took office in January \u2014 the time when IT workers would have been setting up the freshmen\u2019s office IT systems and email accounts.\u000a\u000aSpokesmen for Crist and Rosen declined to say who recommended Abbas, despite the availability of many reputable companies and individuals competing for members\u2019 business. They also would not say who set up their offices\u2019 email accounts.\u000a\u000aFormer Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, who left the House after losing a Senate race, also had Abbas on his payroll. Like Wasserman Schultz, Deutch and Crist, Murphy is from Florida.\u000a\u000aA House central IT employee who requested anonymity told TheDCNF that \u201cthey were ghost employees \u2026 When a new Congress would come in, they would have the members of the offices they were servicing vouch for them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA congressional IT employee who has taken over some of the Awans\u2019 offices said employees there \u201cweren\u2019t used to seeing their technicians.\u201d\u000a\u000aBefore the criminal probe was revealed, the employee told members Imran was \u201cputting members at risk, so I used that to try to get several members to switch over,\u201d he said. He added that he couldn\u2019t understand why no one seemed to care.\u000a\u000aPolitico described Wasserman Schultz and Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York as having a \u201cfriendly personal relationship\u201d with the Imran and his wife.\u000a\u000aPreviously, a second Democratic House IT worker told TheDCNF \u201cthere\u2019s probably a core of 8-10 members that know whats going on,\u201d including Wasserman Schultz and Meeks. \u201cSeveral members should be kicked off the Hill.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFollow Luke on Twitter.

aVNOVI PAZAR, Serbia \u2014 It avoided wars all around as Yugoslavia was ripped apart. But they left their scars nonetheless.\u000a\u000aSand\u017eak, a Muslim-majority region, now straddles two independent countries, Serbia and Montenegro, and borders two more, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. Most of Sand\u017eak lies inside Serbia but people in Novi Pazar, the chaotic unofficial capital, complain they get little in the way of jobs, investment or respect from Belgrade.\u000a\u000aNovi Pazar is sometimes decried by Serbs as a hotbed of radical Islam and the area has long been known as a key stop on the smuggling routes that crisscross the Balkans. Young Bosniaks \u2014 the Muslim ethnic group that predominates here \u2014 talk of feeling isolated and disparaged by Serbian society.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere has been no conflict in this area, but if you have any mention of Novi Pazar on the news, it\u2019s negative. Sand\u017eak is the black sheep of Serbia,\u201d said D\u017eenan Hajrovi\u0107, 31, a graphic designer and co-founder of Heroj (\u201cHeroes\u201d), a fashionable coffee shop and social enterprise not far from Novi Pazar\u2019s Ottoman old town.\u000a\u000aSand\u017eak has yearned, at various times in its history, to have more control over its own affairs. In October 1991, as Yugoslavia began to fracture, just shy of 99 percent of voters supported political autonomy in an unofficial referendum. Serbian authorities declared the vote unconstitutional.\u000a\u000aLater, as neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina descended into war, Sand\u017eak\u2019s political demands became less vociferous, in part due to fears of a crackdown from Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s hardline nationalist regime in Belgrade.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have a hijab and when I go into another city in Serbia they look at me like I\u2019m from Mars\u201d \u2014 Nusreta Hudovi\u0107, a 25-year-old journalist\u000a\u000a\u201cAny independence attempts in Sand\u017eak would have probably been quickly quashed in blood in Serbia, where Bosniak communities were completely surrounded by Serb-populated communities and most communication with Bosnia was severed,\u201d said Sre\u0107ko Latal, a political analyst based in Sarajevo.\u000a\u000aMore than 25 years later, \u201cAutonomy for Sand\u017eak\u201d is still being spray-painted on the crumbling communist-era apartment blocks near the center of Novi Pazar.\u000a\u000aBut rather than wait for constitutional change, Hajrovi\u0107 and his colleagues are working to shift perceptions of their hometown. They have painted colorful murals and shot videos of those they see as Novi Pazar\u2019s heroes. There\u2019s an elderly man who cleans the streets for free because the local government does not.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of problems here. The system isn\u2019t working. There is a lot of corruption. We are fighting to build a network of heroes because we really need them,\u201d said architect Tarik Brun\u010devi\u0107, 27, who returned to Novi Pazar after living in Germany and Sarajevo.\u000a\u000aNew borders\u000a\u000aBuilt in the 15th century, Novi Pazar was a bustling trading post on the Ottoman route into the Balkans. In the communist Yugoslavia ruled by Josip Broz Tito, the \u201cnew bazaar\u201d was renowned for the quality of its counterfeit Levis.\u000a\u000aThe rag trade remains but now Novi Pazar is hemmed in by national borders, with rutted roads as bad as any in the Balkans. Illegal dump fires line the route from Bosnia-Herzegovina, spewing rubbish and acrid black smoke. Signs still point to \u201cTitograd,\u201d as the Montenegrin capital Podgorica was once known.\u000a\u000a\u201cSand\u017eak used to be in the center of trade routes. With the fall of Yugoslavia we became a border area between Kosovo, Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia,\u201d said Novi Pazar\u2019s mayor, Nihat Bi\u0161evac.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, over 4,000 people signed a petition calling for Sand\u017eak to be declared a cross-border region similar to others in the European Union. That would allow Sand\u017eak to bid for EU funds as a single region.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need regionalization to create natural economic regions,\u201d said Bi\u0161evac.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the beginning of the war in Syria, they did manage to attract some young people but more recently we have not heard of more people going to fight\u201d \u2014 Nihat Bi\u0161evac, Novi Pazar\u2019s mayor\u000a\u000aThat case has been weakened by a dizzying level of political infighting within the Bosniak community. There are two Islamic associations, three main political parties, and around a dozen smaller outfits.\u000a\u000aThe most significant local powerbroker is Muamer Zukorli\u0107, a controversial imam turned politician whose empire includes an international university, an Islamic center built largely without planning permission, kindergartens and a slew of other businesses. Zukorli\u0107 \u2014 whose support Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 now relies upon in parliament \u2014 is \u201cinvolved in everything,\u201d said Bi\u0161evac.\u000a\u000aWhether Zukorlic\u2019s newly acquired power in Belgrade will bring much-needed investment in Sand\u017eak remains to be seen. Many accuse the Serbian government of intentionally running the region down, in an effort to encourage its mainly Muslim population to leave.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe people here want to be part of Serbia, they want to be citizens of Serbia but the Bosniak majority want to have a feeling that they are being recognized as citizens of Serbia and that their rights are being respected,\u201d said a veteran representative of the international community based in Novi Pazar.\u000a\u000aSome grievances seem relatively minor. Sand\u017eak is not a standalone district within Serbia; instead it is administered from a small nearby city with a majority Serb population.\u000a\u000aOthers hint at darker prejudices.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have a hijab and when I go into another city in Serbia they look at me like I\u2019m from Mars,\u201d said Nusreta Hudovi\u0107, a 25-year-old journalist who recently returned to Novi Pazar after five years in Turkey and is among the co-founders of Heroj.\u000a\u000aMulticultural history\u000a\u000aBosniaks, Serbs and many other ethnic groups have lived in Sand\u017eak for centuries. But this long multicultural history has not been without problems.\u000a\u000aSand\u017eak has become more visibly devout in recent years. Men with long beards and knee-length trousers drink Turkish tea. After the muezzin calls for Friday prayers, David Bowie cover versions play in an almost empty Heroj café.\u000a\u000aThere have been reports of radicalization, too. A 2011 attack on the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo was carried out by a native of Novi Pazar, Mevlid Ja\u0161arevi\u0107. A few dozen Bosniaks from Sand\u017eak have gone to Syria to fight, although some say numbers have fallen.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the beginning of the war in Syria, they did manage to attract some young people but more recently we have not heard of more people going to fight,\u201d said Mayor Bi\u0161evac. \u201cBut it did happen at the beginning. If you have unemployment it is easier to manipulate young people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2019s inter-ethnic violence did not spread across the border in the 1990s, many Sand\u017eak Bosniaks went to fight in that war. Tens of thousands of refugees went in the opposite direction. Nowadays many people here look more to Sarajevo and Istanbul than Belgrade.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince the war, many people in Sand\u017eak identify far more with Bosnia than Serbia,\u201d said Latal.\u000a\u000aCalls for Sand\u017eak to run its own affairs have not fizzled out completely, either. This month, the Bosniak National Council in Serbia will hold a commemoration to mark the centenary of the Sjenica Declaration, which called for the secession of Sand\u017eak from Serbia and Montenegro and was signed in the south Serbian town of Sjenica.\u000a\u000aNowadays Sjenica is a sleepy and verdant station on the migrant route through the Balkans. A dozen or so male refugees sit on the steps of a local hotel, avoiding the midday sun before attempting yet another border crossing through the wild forests. Syrian refugees\u2019 clothes dry on the railings outside the nearby center for asylum seekers.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a lot of refugees here. We like them,\u201d said Hrmak Cemal, who runs a small store selling fresh cheese and smoked meats in Sjenica. \u201cWe try to give them jobs if we can. We cannot leave these people without help. It is a sin if someone comes looking for food and you don\u2019t give it to them.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMilo\u0161evi\u0107 wanted to separate us but he didn\u2019t manage it. They tried to inspire those divisions here but it didn\u2019t work\u201d \u2014 Shopkeeper Hrmak Cemal\u000a\u000aCemal, a soft-faced 63-year-old with a warm smile, studied textiles at university in the 1970s before working in the local garment industry. He lost his job after the war. The change he wants to see now is economic, not constitutional.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt used to be really busy. We used to make good money, during Tito\u2019s time. That\u2019s all gone. We have no jobs here now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAll the factories are closed now, except one. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 closed down all the factories here.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite Sand\u017eak\u2019s perilous economic situation, and anger at Belgrade, Cemal said most Muslims are happy to live in Serbia, and alongside Serb neighbors.\u000a\u000a\u201cMilo\u0161evi\u0107 wanted to separate us but he didn\u2019t manage it. They tried to inspire those divisions here but it didn\u2019t work. Even now we don\u2019t look at each other that way. We live together.\u201d

aVTwo Republican House Intelligence Committee staffers traveled to London earlier this summer to track down the former British intelligence operative who compiled a controversial dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, according to three people familiar with the matter.\u000a\u000aThe previously unreported trip underscores the importance of the 35-page dossier Christopher Steele wrote last year to congressional probes into possible collusion between Moscow and the 2016 Trump campaign.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIt also has inflamed simmering tensions between House and Senate investigators as they pursue simultaneous probes into the Trump-Russia connection. House Intelligence Committee Republicans did not tell Democrats on the panel, the Senate Intelligence Committee nor special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office that the investigators were pursuing Steele.\u000a\u000aThe House staffers left their contact information at two addresses associated with Steele, a former agent for Britain\u2019s MI6 foreign intelligence service. One of those locations was Steele\u2019s lawyer\u2019s office, where the former spy was meeting with his counsel when the House investigators showed up.\u000a\u000aSenate officials\u2014whom NBC News has reported were negotiating their own interview with Steele\u2014fear the aggressive move could spook Steele and derail his potential cooperation with their own probe.\u000a\u000aOne Senate official also expressed frustration that any details about congressional investigations were coming out in the press.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery time something comes out ... we take three steps back,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe London trip has also angered Democrats in both chambers of Congress, who were not consulted by their colleagues before the investigators knocked on Steele\u2019s door. Democrats fear House investigators are more interested in discrediting the dossier than trying to substantiate its allegations.\u000a\u000aSome Republicans, meanwhile, distrust their Democratic colleagues\u2014suspecting them of maintaining a back channel to Steele to discuss the allegations in the dossier, something the Republicans say would be inappropriate.\u000a\u000aSteele was contracted during the 2016 campaign by Fusion GPS, a U.S.-based opposition research firm. Republicans have accused Fusion GPS of fostering links to Russia, and say Fusion lobbied on behalf of Kremlin interests without properly registering as a foreign agent, a claim which Fusion denies.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat is clear is that the president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump's ties to Russia,\u201d Tracy Schmaler, a representative for Fusion GPS, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aU.S. intelligence officials acquired the dossier last year and briefed President Obama, then-president-elect Trump and congressional leaders about its contents. BuzzFeed News, which had obtained the document, published it soon after.\u000a\u000aCongressional investigators are trying to determine who funded the dossier, the veracity of its salacious allegations and how the document made its way into the hands of the media last summer.\u000a\u000aThe 53-year-old Steele has said almost nothing publicly since he went into hiding after the dossier was made public, enraging Trump officials and many Republicans who denounced it as a compilation of false statements and innuendo.\u000a\u000aSteele\u2019s lawyer has been in contact with the House Intelligence Committee since the staffers\u2019 visit, a congressional source said. That source also said it was a coincidence that Steele was meeting with his lawyer when the staffers visited, and that the investigators followed instructions from Washington not to speak to Steele himself.\u000a\u000aTensions between the two intelligence panels have been palpable since each respective inquiry got off the ground early this year.\u000a\u000aThough both panels are probing the same issues, examining the same documents and interviewing the same witnesses, there has been little effort to coordinate the two investigations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re doing their path, we\u2019re doing ours,\u201d the congressional official said of the House and Senate inquiries.\u000a\u000aThe Senate has made a public, concerted attempt to position itself as the more serious, bipartisan investigation, helped along by the House\u2019s own internal partisan bickering.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not asking the House to play any role in our investigation. We don\u2019t plan to play any role in their investigation,\u201d Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina told reporters in late March.\u000a\u000aThe House Intelligence Committee investigation fell into turmoil in April after the committee's chairman, Devin Nunes, was forced to recuse himself from the investigation after his close links to the Trump White House prompted questions of conflicts of interest.\u000a\u000aAdding to the tensions is a third investigation by the Justice Department-appointed special counsel, Robert Mueller, which covers much of the same ground.\u000a\u000aThe Senate panel is \u201ctaking pains\u201d not to conflict with Mueller\u2019s investigation, according to one of several officials who spoke to POLITICO and who confirmed that assessment.\u000a\u000aThe House panel, meanwhile, is checking in with Mueller when it pursues witnesses, but is not concerned with staying out of Mueller\u2019s lane.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not putting the brakes on our investigation just because Mueller wants something,\u201d the congressional official said.\u000a\u000aAfter months of document review and interviews with working-level intelligence community personnel, the Senate and House panels have moved on to high-profile interviews with former Obama administration officials and Trump officials, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. All of those interviews have been conducted behind closed doors.\u000a\u000aThe Senate committee is also interested in pursuing talks with Glenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal investigative reporter who co-founded Fusion GPS.\u000a\u000aThe dossier emerged in media circles in the summer of last year. Sen. John McCain passed the document to the FBI in late 2016, according to a statement from his office in January.\u000a\u000aInvestigators have been investigating the roots of the dossier\u2019s funding, the document\u2019s origin, and how it made its way into the hands of media and government officials.\u000a\u000aOther likely witnesses on both the House and Senate side after Congress returns from its August recess include Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort and his longtime political adviser, Roger Stone.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVMen work in the shipyard Fincantieri of Riva Trigoso on January 4, 2017 in Sestri Levante, northern Italy | Marco Bertorello/AFP via Getty Images Italy, France set September deadline in shipyard dispute Rome \u2018deeply regrets\u2019 French decision to nationalize shipbuilder rather than let Italian company take control.\u000a\u000aItaly and France agreed Tuesday to try to resolve their dispute over French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s nationalization of a French shipyard when the two countries\u2019 leaders meet next month.\u000a\u000aUnder Macron\u2019s predecessor, François Hollande, Paris agreed that Italian company Fincantieri would buy a two-thirds holding in the STX yard in Saint-Nazaire for \u20ac79.5 million. But Macron\u2019s government chose to nationalize the shipyard for what it said was a temporary period and offered a 50-50 deal, which the Italians rejected.\u000a\u000aFrench Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire traveled to Rome Tuesday to try to mend fences with the Italian government. But the best the two sides could do was to kick the issue down the road to a summit between Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on September 27.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was decided that there will be time from now until September 27 \u2026 to evaluate the chance to overcome these differences,\u201d Italian Treasury Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said after meeting Le Maire.\u000a\u000aIn a joint statement, Italy expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d at the French decision. The two sides also voiced \u201ctheir wish of facilitating the creation of a more efficient and competitive European shipbuilding industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the period leading up to the summit, the two countries said, France \u201ccommits not to open the capital of STX France to any third party and to consider Fincantieri as its preferred option for the future of the company.\u201d\u000a\u000aItaly has long complained that the EU\u2019s free movement of capital rules have worked to the benefit of France and the detriment of Italy. In the last few years, big French companies have acquired control or significant stakes in several of their Italian competitors, whereas the opposite \u2014 so Rome claims, denouncing French \u201cprotectionism\u201d \u2014 hasn\u2019t been the case.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s move to nationalize the shipyard came just a few days after he had also angered Italy by trying to broker a peace deal between warring factions in Libya, a former Italian colony in which Rome has continued to play a leading diplomatic role.

But David Damron, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz, later said that Awan was fired on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAwan pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to one count of bank fraud during his arraignment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\u000a\u000aAwan is accused of attempting to defraud the Congressional Federal Credit Union by obtaining a $165,000 home equity loan for a rental property, which is against the credit union\u2019s policies since it is not the owner\u2019s primary residence. Those funds were then included as part of a wire transfer to two individuals in Faisalabad, Pakistan.\u000a\u000aAwan was arrested Monday evening at Dulles International Airport in Virginia before boarding a flight to Lahore, Pakistan.

Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who voted in favor of the GOP plan to repeal parts of Obamacare last month, suggested Tuesday that Sen.

Julie Tarallo, McCain's communications director, also criticized Johnson's comments.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is bizarre and deeply unfortunate that Senator Johnson would question the judgment of a colleague and friend," Tarallo said in a statement. "Senator McCain has been very open and clear about the reasons for his vote.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohnson issued a statement after the uproar saying that he was "disappointed I didn't more eloquently express my sympathy for what Sen.

aVLots Of Seniors Are Overweight, But Few Use Free Counseling For It\u000a\u000aEnlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR\u000a\u000aAnne Roberson walks a quarter-mile down the road each day to her mailbox in the farming town of Exeter, deep in California's Central Valley. Her daily walk and housekeeping chores are her only exercise, and her weight has remained stubbornly over 200 pounds for some time now. Roberson is 68 years old, and she says it gets harder to lose weight as you get older: "You get to a certain point in your life and you say, 'What's the use?' "\u000a\u000aFor older adults, being mildly overweight causes little harm, physicians say. But too much weight is especially hazardous for an aging body. Obesity increases inflammation, exacerbates bone and muscle loss and significantly raises the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\u000a\u000aTo help the nation's 13 million obese seniors, the Affordable Care Act included a new Medicare benefit offering face-to-face weight loss counseling in primary care doctors' offices. It is free for patients, with no copay. But while Medicare now pays doctors to counsel their obese patients, only 50,000 people participated in 2013, the latest year for which data is available.\u000a\u000a"We think it's the perfect storm of several factors," says Dr. Scott Kahan, an obesity medicine specialist at George Washington University. Kahan says obese patients and doctors aren't aware of the benefit, and doctors who want to intervene are often reluctant to do so.\u000a\u000a"It used to be thought that older patients don't respond to treatment for obesity as well as younger patients," Kahan says. "People assume that they couldn't exercise as much or for whatever reason they couldn't stick to diets as well. But we've disproven that."\u000a\u000aIndeed, one study found 2 out of 3 older patients lost 5 percent or more of their initial weight and kept it off for two years.\u000a\u000aWeight loss specialists say the reason why few seniors are taking advantage of the new benefit is the federal government's decision to limit counseling to primary care offices.\u000a\u000a"The problem with using only primary care providers," says Bonnie Modugno, a registered dietician in Santa Monica, Calif., "is that they completely ruled out direct reimbursement for the population of providers who are uniquely qualified and experienced working with weight management. I think that was a big mistake."\u000a\u000aModugno says she is sympathetic to the government's concerns about widespread fraud \u2014 that just about everyone in the weight loss and fitness world wanted to be able to bill Medicare for obesity counseling. But she says doctors should be allowed to refer their patients to registered dieticians like her. "Unless we change the nature of how this occurs, how the counseling occurs, I don't see it being available to people in a meaningful way," says Modugno.\u000a\u000aThe benefit also can't be used by endocrinologists, who might be managing a person's diabetes, or by cardiologists, who monitor patients with heart disease. Both conditions can be caused or made worse by excess weight.\u000a\u000aAs for Anne Roberson, she says the extra weight she has long carried around on her petite frame has begun taking a toll on her joints, her sleep and her mood. On a recent morning, Roberson listened politely to Dr. Mylene Middleton Rucker, her longtime physician, during her first Medicare weight loss counseling session. Rucker suggested she eat more vegetables and less meat and encouraged her to join a local exercise class.\u000a\u000aRucker, who is obese herself, says she doesn't expect her older patients to lose a lot of weight. "I think you'll see weight loss of 10 to 20 pounds, but whether you're going to see people lose 50 to 100 pounds as they're older, I doubt it," says Rucker.\u000a\u000aStill, even with small amounts of weight loss, Rucker expects to see a decrease in the complications of chronic medical diseases, including diabetes-related leg amputations.\u000a\u000aRoberson has tried to lose weight before, but it was hard. "You hit a couple of rough weeks and you kinda slough off." This time, Roberson says firmly, she will have to come back and answer to Rucker. That accountability, Rucker says will help her lose weight.

They will always be a part of the team & dear friends," Haley wrote.\u000a\u000aTwo people with contacts inside the U.S. Mission to the United Nations also confirmed the men quit, though it was not clear exactly when their resignations will take effect.\u000a\u000aGroves had joined Haley's office from the Heritage Foundation. He was known to be deeply skeptical of international institutions and multilateral agreements.\u000a\u000aOne of the people with contacts in the mission said that despite his conservative bona fides, Groves never really broke into Haley's inner circle, which includes aides who have followed her to New York from her tenure as South Carolina's governor.\u000a\u000aWachtel joined Haley's office from Fox News, where he served as a journalist covering the United Nations.\u000a\u000aThe State Department declined to comment, pointing instead to Haley's tweet. The news of the pair of departures was first reported Wednesday on Twitter by the journalist Laura Rozen.\u000a\u000aHaley is considered one of the more successful Cabinet members in the administration of President Donald Trump. She also is viewed as one of the Republican Party's brightest lights, with a potential White House run in her future.\u000a\u000aHer stint at the United Nations, where she has not always marched lock-step with Trump, gives her credibility on the foreign policy front. Just a few days ago, she successfully oversaw the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed new sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe bad blood between Donald Trump and Jeff Flake dates back to the 2016 presidential race, when Flake was frequently critical of the president. | Getty White House squeezes Jeff Flake The Arizona senator's potential GOP primary foes have been in talks with the president and top administration officials.\u000a\u000aThe White House has met with at least three actual or prospective primary challengers to Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake in recent weeks, a reflection of Donald Trump\u2019s strained relations with the senator and the latest sign of the president\u2019s willingness to play hardball with lawmakers who cross him \u2014 even Republican incumbents.\u000a\u000aFlake, a longtime Trump critic who refused to endorse the president during the 2016 campaign, is one of a handful of undecided Republican votes on the Obamacare repeal effort. He\u2019s also one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection in 2018.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSince taking office, Trump has spoken with Arizona state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, a top official on his 2016 campaign, on at least two occasions, according to two sources familiar with the talks. More recently, since June, White House officials have also had discussions with former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who has announced her bid, and former Arizona GOP Chairman Robert Graham, who like DeWit is exploring a campaign.\u000a\u000aAt a Republican National Committee meeting outside of San Diego in May, David Bossie, Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager and the president of the influential conservative outside group Citizens United, told Graham that either he or DeWit would likely get substantial backing from conservatives should either enter the contest, according to three people familiar with the conversation.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe [Flake] should get back on the Trump team. A lot of people believe in Trump\u2019s policies," said former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a prominent immigration hard-liner who backed Trump, noting that the president remained popular in Arizona. \u201cThere\u2019s a silent majority that\u2019s still there, and still in this state, so watch out.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aGraham, who has begun reviewing polling and purchasing campaign website addresses, was present at a meeting this spring of top GOP donors in Arizona that was also attended by Chris Bannon, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s younger brother and a University of Arizona official. At the top of the agenda, according to three people familiar with the event, was a prospective Graham primary against Flake. During the meeting, which was also attended by Arizona Cardinals executive Michael Bidwill, several donors expressed mounting frustration with the incumbent.\u000a\u000aThose familiar with the gathering stressed that Chris Bannon, who is widely viewed as a conduit to his powerful brother, was more of a listener than active participant and did not articulate his feelings about a Flake challenge.\u000a\u000aChris Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aThe bad blood between Trump and Flake dates back to the 2016 presidential race, when Flake was frequently critical of the president. In the waning days of the campaign, Trump became so angry with the Arizona senator that he proposed bankrolling a 2018 primary campaign against him. Backstage before a rally in the state, the president vented that he wanted to find a challenger to run against Flake and that he\u2019d spend $10 million out of his own pocket to defeat him.\u000a\u000aTrump is keeping close tabs on Flake\u2019s fortunes back home. During a meeting with a small group of state Republican Party chairs in the Oval Office on Tuesday, he asked Arizona GOP Chairman Jonathan Lines for an update on the race. Lines responded by telling the president that the state party did not get involved in primaries, according to three people familiar with the exchange.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe mutual dislike runs deep,\u201d said Constantin Querard, a Republican strategist who oversaw Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 campaign in the state. \u201cThat both complicates [Flake\u2019s] path to re-election by putting him at odds with much of the Arizona GOP, and it makes it very likely that if he gets a primary challenger that the Trump team likes, that challenger will be funded and supported in a way that makes beating Flake the most likely outcome.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House spokespersons did not return requests for on-the-record comment about the president's relationship with Flake.\u000a\u000aA Flake spokesman, Joshua Daniels, declined to comment on the senator\u2019s conversations with the administration but noted that he had \u201cvoted with President Trump over 95 percent of the time this year\u201d and had aggressively backed several White House priorities, including the successful push to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.\u000a\u000aWhite House officials deny they are actively recruiting a challenger or that any decision has been made to target Flake. Within the highest levels of the administration, there is hesitancy to antagonize the senator, whose support is needed as the president struggles to push his ambitious agenda through Congress. There is also some skepticism that Flake, who has spent over 15 years in elected office and hails from a prominent Arizona political family, can be defeated in a primary.\u000a\u000aAn administration-backed primary challenge to Flake would also further inflame tensions with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who over the last several weeks has had several run-ins with the White House over political planning. McConnell, who is fiercely protective of GOP incumbents and has vowed to protect those facing primaries, recently became enraged when a Trump-sanctioned outside group launched an advertising blitz targeting Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who was also critical of the president during the 2016 campaign, over his refusal to back the Obamacare repeal plan.\u000a\u000aEven so, there has been ongoing talk at the White House about how a prospective race would play out. Among the questions raised, according to two people who have discussed the matter with the administration directly, surrounds the candidacy of Ward, a brash conservative who was crushed by Republican Sen. John McCain in a 2016 primary. A well-known figure in the state, she could siphon support from DeWit or Graham, both of whom are regarded as more viable candidates.\u000a\u000aThe deliberations underscore the administration\u2019s disdain for Flake. Months before the election, the senator said he wouldn\u2019t endorse Trump, urged other Republicans to do the same, and declared that he wouldn\u2019t be attending the GOP convention because he had to mow his lawn .\u000a\u000aAfter the October emergence of the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Trump was heard bragging about sexually assaulting women, Flake called on him to withdraw from the race and said he might write in independent candidate Evan McMullin, a leader of the 2016 Never Trump movement. More recently, Flake said the president lacked an \u201c acceptable rationale \u201d for firing FBI Director James Comey \u2014 a tweak that angered the president\u2019s team.\u000a\u000aIn a state filled with conservative voters who flocked to Trump\u2019s anti-immigration views and promise to build a wall on the southern border, Flake\u2019s attacks stood out. Trump won Arizona\u2019s GOP primary by more than 20 percentage points before carrying the state in the general election.\u000a\u000aAmong the president\u2019s most vocal supporters, the feeling of betrayal is particularly intense.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s the president, so we should stick by him, especially on the Republican side,\u201d said Arpaio, noting that Flake was one of a small group of senators who had vocally opposed Trump.\u000a\u000aYet the complaints about Flake extend to other perceived apostasies, including his 2016 push to pass a bipartisan gun control bill, his openness to negotiate with former President Barack Obama over a nuclear pact with Iran, and his push to lift the U.S. embargo on travel to Cuba. While his supporters praise him as an independent-minded lawmaker who charts his own path, Flake\u2019s detractors deride him as a grandstander \u2014 one all too willing to poke his party in the eye.\u000a\u000aMany of those in the state who provided Trump with financial backing in 2016 have begun talking up the possibility of finding a primary challenger, with DeWit and Graham among those most frequently mentioned. Others hold out hope that GOP Rep. Martha McSally, a rising star, or former Gov. Jan Brewer, a vigorous Trump backer, will enter the race.\u000a\u000aDon Shooter, a state legislator and an outspoken backer of the president, predicted that a Flake challenger would immediately be able to raise between $10 million and $15 million from donors eager to see the incumbent unseated. \u201cThey\u2019re motivated to take Jeff Flake out,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAmong those Flake has rankled: Paradise Valley philanthropist Don Tapia, one of the most sought-after Republican donors in the state, who donated over $100,000 to pro-Trump causes in 2016 and also helped to bankroll his inauguration . Tapia was a benefactor of Flake\u2019s 2012 Senate run but, according to multiple Arizona Republicans, has recently spoken of backing someone else in next year\u2019s primary. (Tapia did not respond to a request for comment.)\u000a\u000a"He ran into a big storm coming out against Trump,\u201d Ed Robson, an Arizona real estate developer and major GOP donor who contributed to a pro-Trump super PAC, said of the senator. \u201cThis being a big Trump area, he probably made a mistake doing that."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVCars are stuck in a traffic jam near Munich, Germany | Joerg Koch/AFP via Getty Images Politicians, carmakers fail to put brakes on German diesel debate Carmakers\u2019 plan to cut pollution through software updates alone triggers widespread criticism.\u000a\u000aBERLIN \u2014 The plan was to put the brakes on the great diesel debate. It didn\u2019t work out.\u000a\u000aAcross Germany as well as in Brussels and Vienna, criticism has rained down on a deal announced by three of the country\u2019s powerful auto giants to pay for software updates to cut pollution in more than 5 million diesel cars \u2014 but not to undertake more effective, and much more expensive, changes to hardware.\u000a\u000aThe deal was sealed at a \u201cdiesel summit\u201d between politicians and CEOs of the car companies on Wednesday that Germany\u2019s two main political camps \u2014 which both enjoy close relationships with the car industry \u2014 hoped would take the issue off the agenda ahead of September\u2019s parliamentary election.\u000a\u000aBut the strength of criticism from environmental groups, media commentators and others has forced both conservatives and Social Democrats to issue tough-sounding warnings to the auto giants.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m giving the program that\u2019s been agreed a maximum of three months,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the conservative state premier of Bavaria, where the auto sector employs almost 200,000 people at companies including BMW and Audi, told DPA news agency on Friday.\u000a\u000aHe echoed widespread skepticism over whether the measures announced by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW go far enough and warned that if the carmakers fail to come up with substantial results, bans of diesel cars in inner cities could follow.\u000a\u000aAustrian Transport Minister Jörg Leichtfried issued invitations Friday for his own national diesel summit to try and coax the local branches of Germany\u2019s auto giants to follow up with an offer for his country\u2019s motorists that goes farther than what he called the \u201cmeager\u201d deal reached in Berlin.\u000a\u000aEven one of the big car companies poured cold water on the deal. Ford said it does not believe the software tweak \u201cwill have any material impact on air quality.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe European Commission said it is watching closely to make sure the software fixes offered will cut emissions and that consumers don\u2019t end up footing the bill.\u000a\u000aBrussels-based NGO Transport & Environment said \u201cburning through billions to make old diesel cars less dirty is not the answer.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cInstead, carmakers should be required to fund more cost-effective, sustainable mobility and clean-air initiatives that can bring down pollution levels quickly,\u201d said Greg Archer, the group\u2019s director for clean vehicles.\u000a\u000aDieselgate damage\u000a\u000aMore than 15 million cars in Germany, a third of all passenger vehicles, run on diesel, and brands such as Volkswagen, BMW and Audi are big exporters with production plants and subsidiaries across Europe.\u000a\u000aFor years, the country\u2019s powerful car lobby promoted diesel as clean technology \u2014 until the Dieselgate scandal two years ago revealed systemic cheating in emission tests by VW, throwing the industry into a crisis.\u000a\u000aWednesday\u2019s deal was widely understood as a triumph for the car industry, allowing the car companies to walk away from the issue while picking up the lowest possible bill.\u000a\u000aSocial Democrat (SPD) leader Martin Schulz, seeking to oust Chancellor Angela Merkel in next month\u2019s election but trailing badly in the polls, was quick to stress in an interview with magazine Der Spiegel Thursday morning that there was a need for further action, calling the summit \u201cobviously just a first step.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said it was \u201ctime to make [the carmakers\u2019] concessions watertight,\u201d and that the \u201cchumminess\u201d between senior politicians and the car industry must stop.\u000a\u000aOn Friday morning, the SPD\u2019s deputy economy minister, Matthias Machnig, added it remains to be seen whether \u201cother technical solutions\u201d \u2014 in other words, hardware changes \u2014 were still necessary on top of the software updates and incentives from the car companies to trade in diesel cars on the road for a decade or more.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are talking about what value \u2018Made in Germany\u2019 \u2014 a sign of quality around the world \u2014 has,\u201d Machnig told public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.\u000a\u000aThe scandal might nudge the industry and policymakers toward Brussels, with the European Commission keeping up calls for a Europe-wide position on the future of diesel.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s Green Party is trying to capitalize on the issue to boost its faltering election campaign. Earlier this week, it presented a plan for an emissions-free car sector and it is increasingly pushing for the introduction of class action lawsuits so consumers can band together to press claims against the auto industry.\u000a\u000aVolkswagen is already facing consumer action over its emissions cheating, but defended the summit deal as a \u201cdecisive contribution\u201d that will also include millions of euros invested in a fund to cut pollution in urban areas.\u000a\u000aUnlike other politicians, German conservative Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt, who hosted Wednesday\u2019s summit in Berlin, has been notably silent.\u000a\u000aAhead of the meeting, Dobrindt, from the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, had already signaled he would be satisfied with an industry-friendly solution such as the software updates that ended up being announced on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe scandal might nudge the industry and policymakers toward Brussels, with the European Commission keeping up calls for a Europe-wide position on the future of diesel.\u000a\u000aCommissioner for the Internal Market El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska wants countries to communicate on the issue through an obscure working group overseen by her department, according to a letter she sent to EU ministers that sought to encourage politicians and carmakers to follow her lead by raising the specter of diesel bans in city centers.\u000a\u000a\u201cDespite the fact that I am convinced that we should rapidly move towards zero emissions vehicles across Europe, certainly it is not in the interest of political leaders and industry to face a rapid collapse of the European market for diesel vehicles caused by local bans,\u201d Bie\u0144kowska said in the letter, seen by POLITICO.

aVPresident Donald Trump says his base of support is \u201cbigger and stronger than ever before.\u201d But his claim is contradicted by a steady stream of recent polling showing that the share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance is shrinking, along with the share of Americans most enthusiastic about his presidency.\u000a\u000aHowever you measure the president\u2019s base, it has diminished, not increased, in the seven months he\u2019s been in office. It\u2019s a slide he\u2019ll need to reverse to avoid dragging down the GOP in the midterms \u2014 and to have a more credible shot at reelection.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aA new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows Trump\u2019s approval rating slipping to the lowest point of his young presidency. While he\u2019s confounded the polls before, it\u2019s the trendline that should be most worrisome to the White House.\u000a\u000aOnly 40 percent of registered voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows, down from a high-water mark of 52 percent in March. And the percentage who approve strongly \u2014 one way to measure the size of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters \u2014 is also at a new low: just 18 percent.\u000a\u000aThat fits with other surveys conducted over the past few weeks, all of which show Trump at or near the low-water marks for each pollster. And there is evidence Trump\u2019s backslide has eroded some of his electoral base: The president has lost ground with Republicans and the independent voters that propelled him to victory.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s approval rating among self-identified Trump voters is at 81 percent, down from 86 percent last week. And among Republican voters in the new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, the president is at 76 percent, down slightly from 79 percent last week.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aA closer look at those Trump voters who approve of the president\u2019s job performance shows that the Trump base isn\u2019t \u201ceven closer together,\u201d as the president said on Twitter this week. Among Trump voters who approve of his job performance, they are equally divided between those who approve strongly, and those who approve only somewhat.\u000a\u000aOverall, just 41 percent of voters who say they supported Trump last year strongly approve of the job he is doing, equal to the 41 percent who approve only somewhat. Ten percent of Trump voters disapprove of his job performance somewhat, while 7 percent strongly disapprove.\u000a\u000a"Unabated by the turbulence of the last six months, there remains a core base of ardent Trump supporters," said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. "However, that base has unquestionably declined since the president took office. In late January, 56 percent of Trump voters strongly approved of the president, and just 1 percent disapproved. Today, 41 percent strongly approve, and 17 percent disapprove."\u000a\u000aTrump isn\u2019t bringing converts into his base, either, the poll shows. Among voters who say they backed Hillary Clinton last year, more than 3 in 4, 78 percent, strongly disapprove of Trump. Only 8 percent of Clinton voters even somewhat approve of Trump.\u000a\u000aThe new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted Aug. 3-6, surveying 1,992 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\u000a\u000aThe ongoing contraction of Trump\u2019s base has accelerated over the past month. Those trends show Trump\u2019s approval rating has fallen because certain segments of Republicans and independents have soured on him.\u000a\u000aIn a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll a month ago, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating (46 percent) and strongly approve rating (24 percent) were about 6 points higher than in the current survey. But over the past month, Trump has lost 7 points in strong approval among Republicans and 6 points among independents, compared to just 1 point among Democrats. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong approve\u201d number has dropped 8 points among voters who said they supported him in the 2016 election, from 49 percent to 41 percent.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not only the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that shows Trump fading during his first summer in office. Separate surveys from CNN (38 percent approval), CBS News (36 percent), Gallup (37 percent), Quinnipiac University (33 percent), Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP (32 percent) and Rasmussen Reports (41 percent) show Trump\u2019s approval ratings either at or within a few percentage points of his low-water marks.\u000a\u000aAnd in each of them, there are warning signs about the size \u2014 and enthusiasm \u2014 of Trump\u2019s base. In the CNN poll \u2014 which was conducted by SSRS, the network\u2019s new polling partner \u2014 the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump contracted to 24 percent, compared to 30 percent and 33 percent in CNN/ORC polls in early March and early February, respectively. In the Quinnipiac poll, Trump\u2019s strong approval number contracted from 28 percent in late June to 23 percent now.\u000a\u000aThe Investor's Business Daily/TIPP poll notes that Trump has lost significant ground with core groups over the past month. Trump\u2019s approval rating is down 12 percentage points since July among Republicans, even as it was relatively unchanged from already-low records among Democrats and Republicans. Trump\u2019s decline in the Midwest (minus-7 points) is larger than the overall 5-point drop in his approval, as was his 7-point dip among white men.\u000a\u000aIn the CBS News poll, there are signs it could be difficult for Trump to recover, even as he touts continued economic growth in his first six months in office. Asked to choose which is more important in evaluating Trump \u2014 \u201cthe culture and values that you believe in\u201d or \u201cyour economic and financial well-being\u201d \u2014 48 percent say culture and values, while only 37 percent say their economic and financial well-being is more important.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s response to these surveys so far suggests he doesn\u2019t believe them \u2014 and he\u2019s sought to discredit the results among the public.\u000a\u000a\u201cAfter 200 days, rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..not even close!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon, adding in a second sentence, \u201cDon't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls!\u201d\u000a\u000aEarlier in the week \u2014 also on Twitter \u2014 Trump cited recent campaign rallies \u201cin [Pennsylvania], Iowa, Ohio \u2026 and West Virginia\u201d as evidence that his supporters were still with him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs ... Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWill never change!\u201d\u000a\u000aBut inside Trump\u2019s own White House, there does seem to be some acknowledgment of the president\u2019s falling poll numbers, even if the chief executive insists that they are \u201cfake.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHis approval rating among Republicans and conservative[s] and Trump voters is down slightly,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a former Republican pollster currently serving as counselor to the president, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cIt needs to go up.\u201d\u000a\u000aMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\u000a\u000aMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents \u2014 Toplines: http://politi.co/2vBT18w | Crosstabs: http://politi.co/2vN6Sct\u000a\u000aAuthors:

Legal fight breaks out over deposition of Trump dossier author Christopher Steele\u000a\u000aLawyers for the British author of an unverified intelligence dossier at the center of the Trump-Russia controversy are fighting an effort to force him into a deposition in connection with a libel suit stemming from BuzzFeed's publication of the salacious document.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday afternoon, attorneys for former British MI6 intelligence officer Christopher Steele asked a federal judge in Miami not to grant the request, but Steele's lawyers' motion was filed a couple of hours after U.S. District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro issued a formal request for Steele's testimony.\u000a\u000aUngaro's request was signed by the judge and sealed by the court clerk, but it was unclear if it was formally delivered to the British court to which it was addressed or whether it could be called back and canceled.\u000a\u000aThe demand for Steele's testimony was issued at the request of lawyers for Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian internet entrepreneur who was mentioned in the dossier and contends he was libeled by its claims about his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Gubarev sued BuzzFeed and its editor-in-chief, Ben Smith, in a Florida court over BuzzFeed's publication of the document. Gubarev also sued Steele in a British court.\u000a\u000aIn the motion filed Thursday, Steele's lawyers argue that the effort to force him to give a deposition in England amounts to an "end-run" around the British legal process.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

"Plaintiffs thus are seeking to employ this Court in an end-run around their limitations in their parallel U.K. action."\u000a\u000aSteele's lawyers, from Atlanta-based law firm Alston & Bird, asked Ungaro for a two-week delay in order to present more detailed arguments about why Steele's deposition should not be taken.\u000a\u000aEikhoff and an attorney for Gubarev did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A BuzzFeed spokesman declined to comment.\u000a\u000aEven if Steele did appear at a deposition, it's far from clear any useful testimony would be forthcoming. Ungaro's request notes that witnesses in U.S. legal proceedings have Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Given special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing criminal investigation, Steele might well assert his right to remain silent. But his doing so could have an impact in the civil lawsuits.\u000a\u000aU.S. House and Senate investigators are also eager to talk to Steele. POLITICO reported last week that earlier this summer two House Intelligence Committee staffers traveled to London in an effort to make contact with the spy-turned-private investigator, but were apparently unsuccessful. Senate investigators had been trying to broker a deal to get Steele's testimony and were reportedly angered by the House foray.\u000a\u000aJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.

aVThe skyline of Washington, D.C. | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Russian spy plane buzzes Washington, DC It also veered into Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, often at low altitudes.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 A Russian military spy plane cruised the skies over Washington on Wednesday, with plans for New York City and New Jersey \u2014 in a perfectly legal bit of aerial reconnaissance that nonetheless appeared to be an attempt to troll President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aA 1992 agreement known as the Treaty on Open Skies allows each country to conduct surveillance flights over the other\u2019s territory, something the U.S. and Russia have done a combined 165 times over the past 15 years, according to the State Department.\u000a\u000aBut Russia\u2019s choice of targets this go-round have a decidedly Trumpian flavor, taking the spy plane past Trump\u2019s current hometown of Washington on Wednesday. Its plans in coming days are expected to take it near New York \u2014 the home of Trump Tower \u2014 and not far from the part of New Jersey where the president is vacationing at his golf club in Bedminster, according to a source familiar with the arrangements.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know of any military facilities there,\u201d remarked a Pentagon official, who confirmed the mission.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the plane also flew at low altitude over Dayton, Ohio, near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, before vanishing from a live flight-tracking website. The plane may have landed there, possibly to refuel.\u000a\u000aThe Russian air force\u2019s Tupolev Tu-154M \u2014 similar to a medium-sized airliner \u2014 appeared to have left Moscow early Wednesday and flown through Reykjavík, Iceland, before entering U.S. airspace around Virginia\u2019s Chincoteague Island. The plane then made several passes around the D.C. metro area for about an hour at lunchtime.\u000a\u000aIt also veered into Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, often at low altitudes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe missions happen on a semi-routine basis,\u201d said the Pentagon official, explaining that the Russians gave the required notice of at least 72 hours and that the mission has American personnel on board as observers.\u000a\u000aThe official could not publicly discuss the flight plans or the duration of the mission, though they commonly last at least several days.\u000a\u000aThe Russian air force flight appears to be the 10th so far this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey usually come in and they list out what locations they want to fly over,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe put together the flight plan and with a few exceptions \u2014 safety-wise or weather-wise \u2014 they are allowed to fly over pretty much the entire territory.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is very controlled and very proscribed,\u201d he added, including \u201cwhen they are allowed to take sensor readings.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe flight came at a tense time in U.S.-Russian relations, and on a day when jitters were especially high because of nuclear brinkmanship between Trump and North Korean leaders.\u000a\u000aBut the Russian spy flight was, in fact, fairly routine, flown under the auspices of the Treaty on Open Skies, signed by the United States, Canada, Russia and dozens of other countries. The arrangement is intended to help promote openness among nations and their militaries.

That, frankly, for 60 years, is what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 and as a result, we\u2019ve been able to avoid war.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real problem is that ... the failure of the foreign policy dealing with North Korea \u2014 it really does represent a direct threat to the United States. So this really is a moment in time where we have got to take steps, militarily, diplomatically, to do everything possible to bring North Korea to the negotiating table,\u2019\u2019 he said. America must have a dialogue with them, or to make clear to them that failure to engage in dialogue \u201cis to put them on a path towards the loss of the regime,'' he said.\u000a\u000aBut Panetta said he\u2019s concerned with reports of how the president makes major decisions, and is approaching major foreign policy issues.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve heard of briefings being presented to the president \u2014 and because he has this limited attention span, he kind of immediately goes to the political argument as opposed to the substance,\u2019\u2019 the former CIA director said. In Afghanistan, for instance, reports are that "the military is recommending a strategy that should be done; but the president and (adviser Steve) Bannon don\u2019t think that strategy really gives them what they want in order to deal with the political side of the ledger. So he\u2019s basically sent the military packing \u2014 to try and come back with something different.\u201d\u000a\u000aPanetta, who has one of the deepest public service résumés in Washington \u2014 he's a former House member from California who went on to manage the White House Office of Management and Budget, and served as White House chief of staff, head of the CIA and secretary of defense \u2014 says that Trump's methods represent a stark shift from past practice on crisis management.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor 25 years, trying to live with danger zones that are out there in the world, you always felt there were rational minds that understood that at some point you\u2019ll find a way to deal with it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat chemistry has changed. So it makes it very unpredictable.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmong other observations from Panetta:\u000a\u000a\u2014 On Trump's unorthodox approach to foreign policy issues: \u201cThis is a bizarre world, OK? I\u2019m used to \u2014 you go through a national security consult, you have deputies\u2019 meetings; you have principals meeting, you talk about substance of the issue, the crisis, the options, you try to develop consensus. You present it to the president; the president asks questions and makes a decision. That\u2019s usually the process. It was true for Clinton, it was true for Bush, it was true for Obama. [Today] this is not the way it works. And it makes it very unpredictable as to what happens.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014 On Trump\u2019s White House team: \u201cI\u2019ve thought that Trump\u2019s national security team is probably the best thing he\u2019s done, in appointing people like [Secretary of Defense James] Mattis and [national security advisor H.R.] McMaster, now [General John] Kelly as chief of staff and [Secretary of State Rex] Tillerson \u2014 even though he\u2019s struggling, his head seems to be at least in the right place.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014 On North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un: \u201cHe\u2019s totally bizarre and uncertain. When I was CIA director the one area I thought we did not have really great intelligence was in the inner circles of North Korea. It was tough to get really good information. Normally, you get pretty good intelligence about what a leader was doing. We never could get that. So you don\u2019t know. The only guy this guy seems to like is [Dennis] Rodman.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVNever mind keeping the peace. America\u2019s new ambassador to NATO once had to pretend to keep the peas.\u000a\u000aKay Bailey Hutchison, the former United States senator from Texas who is Donald Trump\u2019s new envoy to the military alliance, once delivered two tons of peas to American soldiers in Bosnia. Or perhaps more accurately, the peas delivered her.\u000a\u000aHutchison, 74, a Republican with long experience in military affairs and defense spending, described the episode during her farewell speech to the Senate in December 2012.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of the most powerful moments that will stay with me forever were spent with members of our military,\u201d Hutchison told her soon-to-be ex-colleagues. \u201cVisiting them where they are in harm\u2019s way across the world is one of the most moving of all experiences. I will never forget the first time in the early \u201990s flying into Sarajevo in an undercover C-130 that was disguised as a Red Cross delivery of peas \u2014 2,000 pounds of peas, which we actually had on the C-130.\u201d\u000a\u000aHutchison, who is expected to take up her post at NATO headquarters in Brussels later this month, visited U.S. troops all over the world, including soldiers on active duty in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo. And in nearly 20 years as a senator, she served on virtually every committee tied to the military, including the armed services committee and the veterans affairs committee. She also served as chair of the board of visitors of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is very smart, hard-working. She has got a lot of charisma. She can be very forceful and strong\u201d \u2014 Retired General Wesley Clark\u000a\u000aHer respect for the alliance and for troops, as well as her broad knowledge of military affairs, is likely to be a source of comfort for NATO allies still unsettled by Trump\u2019s initial criticism of the alliance and wavering on its collective defense clause. At the same time, her appointment may serve as a loud trumpet blast, as allies realize that the woman now responsible for pushing them to raise defense expenditure is a tenacious Texan and battle-hardened veteran of some of Washington\u2019s most bitter spending fights.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think she\u2019s perfect,\u201d said retired General Wesley Clark, a former supreme allied commander at NATO and Democratic candidate for president in 2004.\u000a\u000aClark, who accompanied Hutchison on one of her trips to the Balkans, said she held traditional Republican views on military policy and would undoubtedly press allies to do their part.\u000a\u000a\u201cLike every senator \u2014 and everyone especially from that party \u2014 they have wanted to make sure that defense resources were wisely spent and that our European allies were doing their fair share in carrying the burden,\u201d Clark told POLITICO in a telephone interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is very smart, hard-working,\u201d he added. \u201cShe has got a lot of charisma. She can be very forceful and strong.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the Senate, Hutchison was known as a legislator who could reach across the aisle, and she became particularly close to the other female senators, most of whom were Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein of California. In 2003, Hutchison and Feinstein created a commission to review overseas U.S. military bases and evaluate a Pentagon plan to make sweeping changes to military installations and forces.\u000a\u000aThe commission\u2019s final report in 2005 expressed skepticism about the Pentagon\u2019s plan to sharply reduce the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe and stressed the importance of NATO while also noting the potential weakness of the EU.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe rejection of the draft European Union Constitution by French and Dutch voters in June highlighted the continued political weakness of the Union and thus the importance of NATO to our relationships with Europe,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cEuropean stability and the U.S.-Europe alliance have been an essential part of world order and our own security for more than 60 years following centuries of political turmoil and wars, the last two of which embroiled the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aLarge-scale cuts were made anyway, but in recent years the U.S. has started to increase its military presence in response to Russia\u2019s military assertiveness in Ukraine, including the invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014. That has included a program called the European Reassurance Initiative, which has allocated billions in new financing for U.S. military operations on the Continent.\u000a\u000aHutchison, at her confirmation hearing, said she shared senators\u2019 concerns about Russian aggression, and backed the alliance\u2019s position that Moscow must implement the peace accord known as Minsk 2 that was brokered by France and Germany in February 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs NATO has said, there\u2019s not going to be business as usual with Russia, as long as they violate the agreement they made in Minsk,\u201d Hutchison said.\u000a\u000aEverybody loves Kay\u000a\u000aWhile a number of confirmation hearings for Trump nominees have been contentious as Democrats challenged the credentials of the president\u2019s picks, the session with Hutchison was nothing short of a love-in.\u000a\u000aTim Kaine, the Virginia Democrat who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, was among those to cheer Hutchison\u2019s selection, and noted that his oldest son had been deployed as part of the European Reassurance Initiative.\u000a\u000a\u201cI look forward to being an effective partner for our policies; for our military; for our allies, who are also making sacrifices for our mutual defense\u201d \u2014 Kay Bailey Hutchison\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly, I was very, very worried, in the early days of this administration, to hear the president basically suggest that Russia wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, but also to say that NATO was obsolete, when the entire 1,200 members of my son\u2019s battalion were deployed there, in harm\u2019s way, doing work that I thought was important,\u201d Kaine said.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour nomination sends a signal that the NATO relationship is an important one,\u201d Kaine continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think the administration would\u2019ve asked somebody of your qualification if they didn\u2019t mean to send the signal that, whatever the earlier statements or thoughts about NATO, there\u2019s now a commitment.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt one point, Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the foreign relations committee, who was presiding over the hearing, made clear there was no doubt Hutchison would be confirmed and that she and her teenage son, Houston, and daughter, Bailey, would soon be in Brussels.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do hope to get you to NATO by the time school enrollment starts,\u201d Corker said.\u000a\u000aIn her remarks at the hearing, Hutchison stressed her commitment to the military and the importance of the alliance, and her own support for the collective defense clause known as Article 5.\u000a\u000a\u201cI look forward to being an effective partner for our policies; for our military; for our allies, who are also making sacrifices for our mutual defense,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aRecounting the history of NATO\u2019s founding, she said: \u201cIt was determined that an alliance between Europe and North America sends a message of solidarity that would deter aggression and help avoid a third world war.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut she said the alliance had evolved to become a bulwark against unconventional enemies as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes NATO exist to protect allies against any threat of aggression? Yes, that was NATO\u2019s original mission. It remains relevant today,\u201d Hutchison said. \u201cBut NATO has also evolved into much more, because today\u2019s security environment now encompasses a much broader array of challenges, including asymmetric warfare, terrorism by ISIS, al-Qaeda and other extremist elements.\u201d\u000a\u000aHutchison also nodded at Trump\u2019s push for increased military spending by allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cDoes every country in the alliance meet its agreed commitment?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo. Improvements are in order.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Trump has called for a stronger effort from allies,\u201d she added, \u201cAllies need to meet this commitment.\u201d\u000a\u000aTime to pay up\u000a\u000aDavid Davis, a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. army who served as Hutchison\u2019s chief of staff in the Senate, said her views on NATO were long-held.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was not a conflict in which NATO forces or NATO countries were involved in during the entire time that she was in Congress that she didn\u2019t go visit and lead congressional delegations,\u201d said Davis, who is now chief of staff to Representative Kevin Brady of Texas.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe power to wage war is an enormous one and the weight of its responsibility should rest heavy on our shoulders\u201d \u2014 Kay Bailey Hutchison\u000a\u000a\u201cLong before Trump, she was that person who said our allies have to pay their fair share,\u201d Davis said. \u201cOne of the things that I think was always her focus, was NATO has to be a military alliance. It\u2019s not a social club, not a political club. As countries come into NATO, they have to contribute, and they have to contribute in a military way.\u201d\u000a\u000aLawrence Di Rita, a naval academy graduate who preceded Davis as Hutchison\u2019s chief of staff and went on to become a top adviser to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, said Hutchison\u2019s interest in military affairs stemmed from the large number of bases and personnel in Texas \u2014 where her family\u2019s roots run deep. Hutchison\u2019s great-great grandfather signed the Texas declaration of independence from Mexico in 1836.\u000a\u000aDi Rita said that in the Trump administration Hutchsion would fit in well with Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, seasoned commanders who are well-regarded at NATO.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are realists, problem-solving people; people with a world view,\u201d Di Rita said.\u000a\u000aAssociates said Hutchison rarely falls short of her goals. One notable exception was a failed bid for governor of Texas in 2010 when she challenged Rick Perry, who is now also serving in the Trump administration, as energy secretary. Perry painted her as insufficiently conservative and criticized her for being pro-choice on abortion, though she supported the right of states to impose restrictions on the procedure, which is legal in the U.S.\u000a\u000aAfter that failed gubernatorial campaign, Hutchison remained in the Senate until the end of her term in 2012. While some U.S. lawmakers have struggled to make the shift to diplomacy, Hutchison\u2019s experience in the Senate may come in handy: NATO\u2019s main decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, typically operates on the basis of unanimous consent like the Senate.\u000a\u000aSince her retirement from Congress, she has worked at a Texas law firm, Bracewell, based in Dallas. In her farewell speech, along with retelling the story of the peas mission to Bosnia, Hutchison reflected on her view of military service.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have always been one that has such great respect and gratitude for our men and women in uniform,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put their lives on the line and pledge to give their all for our freedom. The power to wage war is an enormous one and the weight of its responsibility should rest heavy on our shoulders.\u201d

The organization \u2014 whose mission statement, according to its website, is \u201cadvancing human potential and promoting equality\u201d \u2014 is endowed with the couple\u2019s Facebook fortune.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aZuckerberg and Chan have vowed to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares, worth an estimated $45 billion, to charity. Bringing on Benenson is the latest sign that they\u2019re pushing their philanthropic work more heavily into the political and policy world.\u000a\u000aIn January, the couple hired David Plouffe, campaign manager for Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run, as president of policy and advocacy. Plouffe had previously worked at Uber. Ken Mehlman, who ran President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign, also sits on the board.\u000a\u000aAnd earlier this year, the couple also brought on Amy Dudley, a former communications adviser to Virginia Democratic Sen.

A spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said: \u201cAs a philanthropic organization focused on a number of substantive issues including science, education, housing, and criminal justice reform, any research efforts we undertake is to support that work.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven though he has said he has no interest in running for office, Zuckerberg\u2019s name \u2014 along with just about every other billionaire or elected official with half the name recognition of a second-tier Donald Trump adviser \u2014 has been floated as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg, 33, stirred the speculation in June when he posted pictures of his road trip through Iowa, the first state to caucus in the primaries, as part of the tech entrepreneur\u2019s yearlong project to visit every U.S. state. He has also toured a Ford assembly plant outside Detroit, a key city in the critical Rust Belt state that Clinton lost to Trump; and Dayton, Ohio, the state long considered an election bellwether.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of you have asked if this challenge means I'm running for public office,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page last May. \u201cI'm not.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven before his is-he-or-isn\u2019t-he road trip, Zuckerberg had shown an interest in politics and social issues. In 2010, he announced during an appearance on \u201cOprah\u201d that he was donating $100 million to help fix the Newark City public school system in New Jersey. The influx of Facebook cash, however, didn\u2019t generate the desired results, and the gift became a nationally recognized failure of good intentions.\u000a\u000aBut the hiring of Benenson is sure to fuel speculation that Zuckerberg is getting more serious about how he plays in the political and policy worlds.\u000a\u000aSpeculation, however, may be the beginning and the end of the Zuckerberg for President story.\u000a\u000aThe Benenson Strategy Group does work for many nonprofit groups, including AARP, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation.\u000a\u000aOn July 27, for instance, Gaga tweeted a link to a research study on youth mental wellness that she commissioned from Benenson\u2019s company.

She then responded to being asked what she was working on by writing: \u201cA few things on the agenda but getting tough on people impersonating others is definitely up there.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe home secretary has recently led a push to beef up the U.K.\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure, including a call to companies to give the government access to encrypted conversations on WhatsApp.\u000a\u000aReborn has also duped U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman and a White House official working on cybersecurity.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of people ask if I am doing it from my mum\u2019s basement,\u201d the prankster told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s the image of a hacker: a cellar surrounded by big servers whirring away with death metal music in the background.

aVThe rupture between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell originated where so many of the president\u2019s dramas do: with something he saw on TV.\u000a\u000aTrump watched clips of McConnell criticizing him on the news and wasn\u2019t happy. In a terse but loud conversation Wednesday, the president made clear he wasn\u2019t to blame for the Obamacare failure and was displeased with the criticism he\u2019s gotten for it. McConnell didn\u2019t give any ground, said people briefed on the phone call, and there are no immediate plans to speak again.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBy Thursday afternoon, after several angry tweets, Trump left open the possibility of asking McConnell to resign, saying his opinion would hinge on the majority leader\u2019s ability to get a laundry list of things done\u2014Obamacare repeal, tax cuts, infrastructure. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Mitch,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIf he gets these bills passed, I\u2019ll be very happy with him and I\u2019ll be the first to admit it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe phone call, first reported by the New York Times, and Bedminster comments mirror what Trump has said in private, according to four White House officials and Trump friends: that he is preparing to distance himself from Republicans in Congress if they aren\u2019t successful in passing legislation and will not take the blame for them if they can\u2019t.\u000a\u000aIncreasingly, these people say, the president is prepared to cast himself as an outsider \u2013 and Congress as an \u201cinsider\u201d Washington institution. He has reminded advisers his poll numbers are higher than Congress and that he ran against Washington \u2013 and wants bills to sign \u2013 and will blast his own party if he doesn\u2019t get them. Trump believes that his supporters will largely blame Congress instead of him, two people who have spoken to him said.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!\u201d Trump posted online Thursday morning.\u000a\u000aA McConnell spokeswoman declined to respond to Trump\u2019s criticisms and said their work would continue. \u201cThe Leader has repeatedly spoken about the path forward on repealing and replacing Obamacare \u2013 on the Senate floor, at media availabilities and in Kentucky,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, the spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, McConnell\u2019s aides and advisers have been amazed at the president\u2019s unwillingness to sell the health care bill publicly, his lack of policy knowledge, his seemingly unending appetite for chaos and his inability to control warring factions of aides, who complicate delicate negotiations by saying different things to different people.\u000a\u000aThe two men have talked from time to time on the phone, but the conversations have often been quick, and Trump often disregards McConnell\u2019s advice. McConnell has told people after meeting with Trump in the White House that it is difficult to keep the president on topic and that he wanders around verbally in a way that McConnell \u2013 a man who does not see the purpose in unnecessary words \u2013 doesn\u2019t understand.\u000a\u000aWhether the public airing of grievances develops into a long-simmering feud that affects policy remains unclear, particularly ahead of a busy September where officials face a possible government shutdown.\u000a\u000aSome White House aides said there has been abundant work going on behind the scenes to prepare for a robust September agenda, and people who know McConnell well say he likes to keep his head down \u2013 and probably shrugged off the tweets.\u000a\u000aThe two men have largely had a positive relationship for the past two years, carefully avoiding criticism of one another even as Trump has picked fights with beauty pageant queens, TV show hosts, and Republicans of his own party, including with Sen. John McCain.\u000a\u000a\u201cI expect that once Republicans return to Washington this will be long forgotten. McConnell and Trump have shared legislative goals and my expectation is they will focus on those as soon as Congress is back in session,\u201d said Brian McGuire, a former McConnell chief of staff.\u000a\u000aYet Trump and his aides don\u2019t see themselves as traditional party leaders. Trump is still sore about the unwillingness of many Republicans to embrace his candidacy last year. He talks occasionally about people who bucked him during the campaign last year and feels loyal only to people who are loyal and helpful to him.\u000a\u000aOnly one senator, Jeff Sessions, endorsed him \u2013 and was made attorney general. But he\u2019s since been rewarded with a series of public criticisms from the president, who taunted Sessions for being \u201cbeleaguered\u201d after he recused himself from the Russia probe that is touching the president\u2019s family and advisers.\u000a\u000aThe president has been willing to threaten other Republicans, a tactic that angers McConnell, according to people who have spoken to him. Trump complains privately that Republicans don\u2019t defend him enough, even as Republican leaders complain that all they seemingly do is defend him.\u000a\u000aMcConnell\u2014who as Majority Leader often attends two fundraisers a day\u2014says that protecting his members, even if they make mistakes, is of utmost importance, because he wants to keep his Republican majority. He has grown frustrated when Trump and his team haven\u2019t sought to appoint Democrats from the Senate in key jobs \u2013 so Republicans could be elected in their stead.\u000a\u000aTrump has said repeatedly in private conversations that he doesn\u2019t understand why Congress is so slow and feels he has done \u201cmore than enough\u201d to help, one senior administration official said. McConnell has urged the public and the White House to give Congress more time and has noted that it often takes several tries to get success.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Trump has a point,\u201d said David McIntosh, who leads Club for Growth, a grassroots Republican group. \u201cThe Senate Republicans built their majority on repealing Obamacare. They can\u2019t just shrug it off and say, \u2018We\u2019ll move on, the Senate is a tough place to get things done.\u2019 Something has to change, whether it\u2019s personnel or something else, to get the job done.\u201d\u000a\u000aSenior administration officials say Republican members were frustrated at McConnell\u2019s process on health care and didn\u2019t feel consulted, complaining to the White House. Some\u2014including Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin\u2014have been public in their criticism, with Johnson calling a McConnell move a \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople feel like McConnell let us down here,\u201d one senior administration official said.\u000a\u000aSeveral people who know McConnell say Trump is also to blame for the health care bill failing, particularly with his ham-handed tactics on Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. That he didn\u2019t travel the country for the bill \u2013 or made comments privately that damaged it or showed a lack of knowledge. Almost every time there would be a day of progress on the bill, there would be another White House distraction.\u000a\u000aMcConnell also doesn\u2019t understand Trump\u2019s tweets, particularly when they\u2019re directed at him. Aides have to show McConnell what Trump said, because he doesn\u2019t scroll through a smart phone to find them. \u201cIt\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know he could just call and say the same thing,\u201d one McConnell adviser said. \u201cHe wants the process and drama stories.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcConnell has incredible control over much of Trump\u2019s agenda, whether his appointments quickly move through the Senate and whether keynote items of his agenda get passed. Several people close to McConnell noted that he has widespread support in his caucus and received an endorsement from Sen. Orrin Hatch, an influential Utah Republican who heads up the committee responsible for tax reform. Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, also publicly supported McConnell Thursday.\u000a\u000aAnother adviser to McConnell said: \u201cThere may come a time that requires members to put a lot on the line to try and protect him. The stuff that he is doing currently will lead to a situation when he is all alone when it matters most.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump often ratchets conflicts one way \u2013 up. So when given a chance to defend McConnell Thursday, he instead continued to criticize.\u000a\u000aElana Schor contributed to this report.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVIf it wasn't official before, North Korea is now the biggest foreign policy crisis the Trump administration is facing. \u201cNorth Korea had best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\u201d President Donald Trump said during a briefing on opioid addiction Tuesday at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. The Pyongyang regime responded with another threat of its own, saying its military \u201cis examining the operational plan\u201d for a missile strike around the U.S. territory of Guam. As the Pyongyang regime continues to defy international sanctions and presses on with its missile testing, the problem of war and peace on the peninsula becomes increasingly urgent. Should the United States risk war with North Korea that may ultimately lead to a bigger war and chaos in the region? Should it pursue a peace that keeps a dictatorial regime intact to fight another day? Washington\u2019s policy analysts, pundits and North Korea watchers have gone around this circle over the past 15 years. Yesterday's escalation jolted us out of the sense that it might go on indefinitely, unresolved.\u000a\u000aWhat does the North really want? And how can Trump face down such a seemingly irrational leader? Much of today\u2019s commentariat on North Korea can be divided into three main camps: Regime Changers, who want to take out Kim; Grand Bargainers, who want a peace treaty in exchange for denuclearization; and China Pushers, who want China to take on the main role in pressuring North Korea toward a deal. But all three positions ignore something important: A long view of its history encompassing Koreans\u2019 place in the world and how the regime in the North sees it. This past may provide a better window to understanding our current predicament with North Korea than the contemporary moment, and if Trump or his advisers aren't considering Korea's long view, he's going to join the long list of leaders who have gotten the nation dangerously wrong.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe modern shorthand for North Korea is the "hermit kingdom," but that's not a quirk of the Kim family: It was during the year 1637 when Korea cut itself off from the world and seclusion became the cardinal principle of its foreign policy. That date marks the end of the Manchu invasions from China, the last of a series of calamitous foreign wars on the peninsula. In 1254, for example, the Mongols slaughtered 200,000 Korean men, women and children as they embarked upon their scorched-earth policy to make Korea their tributary state. An even worse catastrophe arrived from Japan in the late 16th century, when nearly 2 million Koreans, a staggering 20 percent of the population, perished in the effort to stop Japan from subjugating the Korean peninsula. The Koreans were able to beat back the Japanese, but just a few decades later, they were forced to submit to China's Qing Dynasty, which imposed its own diplomatic system on the Korean nation. In exchange for Qing\u2019s military protection, the Korean king submitted to the governing principle of \u201cServing the Great,\u201d whereby, as a tributary state, he relinquished control over his country\u2019s foreign policy. The system proved to be remarkably stable: Peace reigned on the Korean peninsula for the next two and a half centuries.\u000a\u000aBut the old Confucian world order began to crumble at the end of 19th century under the pressure of Japanese gunboats and Russian expansion. Korea\u2019s big neighbors sought to neutralize the threat posed by other great powers by securing for themselves predominance on the peninsula. Korea's response was to begin the dangerous game of playing the great powers off against one another. The game only intensified the mutual distrust and belligerence among the three powers surrounding Korea: China, Japan and Russia. The fear was that Korea might, at any moment, undermine the position of one power by aligning itself with another. Two major wars ensued, the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Japan\u2019s \u201cfinal solution\u201d of the Korean problem\u2014the elimination of the country's independence by placing the peninsula firmly under Japanese rule\u2014was sanctioned with the approval of a new rising power: President Theodore Roosevelt, of the United States of America.\u000a\u000aModern Korea is the product of the last great power clash on the peninsula: the Korean War. After World War II, Soviet and American leaders agreed to divide the peninsula at the 38th parallel in the hope that the two great powers could come to some agreement on the peninsula and so ensure a workable peace. This did not happen, and another war ensued. But after 1953, the uneasy truce held. So Korea has endured three main \u201cgoverning principles\u201d imposed by outside powers to ensure the stability of the peninsula: the \u201cServing the Great\u201d principle under the Qing, the outright annexation of Korea by Japan, and the division of the peninsula by the Americans and the Soviets. Although none of these governing principles was deemed satisfactory from the Korean point of view, in each case, they had no choice but to accept them.\u000a\u000aThe division system, linked to the Cold War, turned out to be remarkably stable, with one key problem: It worked out far better for the South than for the North. South Koreans prospered under a system that guaranteed their nation\u2019s security and U.S. military presence as a protective shield against the three great Asian powers and against the aggressive intentions of North Korea. This is one reason why President Jimmy Carter\u2019s plan to withdrawal US troops from the peninsula in 1977 was staunchly opposed by everyone, including the Soviet Union and China. Beijing, paranoid about the Soviet threat, saw the removal of American forces as tempting the Soviets to reassert their long-standing interests on the peninsula. The Soviets wanted continued American presence in South Korea to restrain Kim Il Sung from starting another war.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, however, did not fare well under the division system, for a variety of political and economic reasons. The system that has ensured a workable peace for the rest of Asia and brought prosperity for South Korea has long been viewed by the North Koreans as the main impediment to realizing their nation\u2019s destiny: the unification of the peninsula. Hence, North Korea\u2019s never-ending revolutionary commitment to achieving the nation\u2019s \u201cfinal victory\u201d: a war for fatherland unification and and the end of the \u201cpeace terms\u201d imposed by the division.\u000a\u000aIt sounds strange, but to see it this way is to realize that the disruption of peace has been North Korea\u2019s main strategic goal since 1950, when it invaded South Korea. Beginning in the mid-1960s, Kim Il Sung initiated a series of provocative actions against South Korea and the United States in a last-ditch effort to foment a South Korean revolution, force a withdrawal of American troops and achieve reunification under his control. Kim Jong Un\u2019s recent test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles are therefore merely a dramatic extension of an ongoing strategy to wreak havoc on a system that North Korea has railed against for decades.\u000a\u000aNot all experts on North Korea see unification as the Kim regime's primary goal, but it is one that the North Koreans themselves have consistently given as their principal objective. What the regime wants, and has always wanted, is a peace treaty with the United States\u2014a grand bargain that would lead to the eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula, and that could be seen as a real step toward that objective. \u201cIf the United States troops pull out of South Korea and a democratic figure with national conscience comes into power,\u201d Kim Il Sung declared during a speech in 1970, \u201cwe will firmly guarantee a durable peace in Korea and successfully solve the question of Korea\u2019s reunification among us Koreans.\u201d The rhetoric of Kim Jong Un regime has been no different, announcing the missile test on July 28 with a pledge to \u201cachieve the final victory.\u201d The "final victory" in North Korean propaganda means the same thing today that it meant when Kim Il Sung used it in the late 1940s: unification into a single Korea.\u000a\u000aAnd so the standoff will continue. The North Korean regime will never be induced into trading its nuclear weapons, its only bargaining chip. Nor will it be inhibited by threats of a military attack or economic pressures from Beijing. The idea has always been to throw off the yoke of the great powers\u2019 \u201cgoverning principals\u201d\u2014all of them\u2014to achieve Korea\u2019s reunification and independence on its own terms.\u000a\u000aThe problem is that it\u2019s in the rest of the world\u2019s interest to keep the status quo: The division has a 70-year record of stability, and pulling out risks destabilizing the peninsula in the same way that critics of President Carter\u2019s withdrawal plan articulated 40 years ago. Even South Korea has no real interest in reuniting. And denuclearizing North Korea by force\u2014through bombing, or regime change\u2014would trigger a war on a densely populated peninsula whose consequences would be unknowable, and horrifying.\u000a\u000aDespite North Korea\u2019s ideological stance, its contemporary problem isn't really great power influence\u2014the nation even prospered for a time as a client state of the Soviet Union. The problem is how badly it has fared in the division system, an embarrassment that forces the regime to cast the blame everywhere else, and direct its energy toward unachievable goals and wild rhetoric about defeating the United States. Preserving the division system should be our clearly stated goal, and the clearest route is to work with the Chinese in encouraging the North Koreans to accept the division system and to help them succeed within it. This isn't unthinkable: North Korea\u2019s economy, with China\u2019s tacit encouragement, is actually growing.\u000a\u000aFor the United States, this means continuing to demonstrate our stalwart commitment to South Korea\u2019s defense by building up U.S. and South Korean defense systems, including deploying the four remaining THAAD elements in South Korea. Unfortunately, North Korea already is a nuclear state, and the most reasonable prospect isn\u2019t a violent disarmament, or a chimerical bargain, but an easing of sanctions\u2014yes, even for an odious regime\u2014and supporting China\u2019s lead in bringing North Korea back into the family of nations as part of a divided country.\u000a\u000aSheila Miyoshi Jager, professor of history and East Asian Studies at Oberlin college, is the author of Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea.

aVScaramucci launches media redemption tour -- Eric Bolling initiates lawsuit against Yashar Ali -- Fox CEO \u2018confident\u2019 Sky deal will be approved\u000a\u000aWith Cristiano Lima and Alex Weprin\u000a\u000aERIC BOLLING INITIATES LAWSUIT AGAINST YASHAR ALI OVER SEXTING STORY: Ali, who wrote a freelance article for HuffPost [he also writes for New York magazine and Mother Jones] reported that two women had received explicit photo messages from Bolling several years ago lead to the Fox News host\u2019s suspension over the weekend while an outside law firm investigations. Bolling\u2019s lawyer has said he \u201crecalls no such inappropriate communications\u201d and that the article is "is false, defamatory, and obviously intended to destroy this good man's career and family." Bolling himself took to Twitter recently to proclaim that he was going to clear his name.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a-- This \u201csummons with notice\u201d is the first step in a lawsuit. The summons says Bolling is suing for $50 million in damages over the article, but only names Ali, not HuffPost. However, HuffPost on Wednesday evening announced that even though Ali was under a freelance contract they stand by him and are willing to financially back him up through the legal process. Ali said in a statement \u201cI stand by my reporting and will protect my sources, especially the victims, at all costs.\u201d\u000a\u000a-- By issuing the summons, Bolling is essentially making sure Ali preserves any records he may have. But continuing on with the case could open Bolling up to discovery. According to the New York Supreme Court, \u201cafter a summons with notice is served, the defendant [Ali] will demand that the plaintiff serve a complaint. The plaintiff [Bolling] must then have the complaint served within 20 days after being served with the demand, or the case may be dismissed.\u201d On Twitter, Ali has suggested that Bolling shouldn't continue the suit and lead it to discovery.\u000a\u000a-- Of note: Bolling\u2019s lawyer is from the same firm, Kasowitz Benson Torres that represented former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, and previously represented President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aFOX CEO \u2018CONFIDENT\u2019 SKY TAKEOVER WILL BE APPROVED, by Alex Weprin: 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch told shareholders on Wednesday that the company was \u201cconfident\u201d that the U.K. would grant government approval to its proposed takeover of Sky in 2018. "We remain confident our transaction will be approved, but more likely in the first half of 2018 than before the end of this calendar year," Murdoch said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\u000a\u000a-- Murdoch, in an email to staff at the company, wrote that \u201cculture is critical,\u201d and emphasized the company\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts.\u000a\u000a-- Despite the troubles stemming from harassment allegations, Fox News was the financial bright spot for 21st Century Fox, helping offset lower revenues from Fox\u2019s film division and broadcast unit. Variety has more .\u000a\u000a--Former Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren weighed in on the channel\u2019s problems in a Facebook post . \u201cThe bottom line? A network should never be defined by a handful with bad behavior (or even alleged bad behavior) who get lots of attention for their conduct (real or not) but by the thousands who every day work really hard to do a good job...maybe not a perfect job...but always trying to do a good job.\u201d\u000a\u000a--And speaking of former Fox News stars, Bill O\u2019Reilly teased the unveiling of new behind-the-paywall content for paid subscribers of his independent website last night, writing on Twitter that on Wednesday, \u201cPremium Members will see a new prototype production of my No Spin News analysis.\u201d The former top Fox anchor said a public version of the rollout is set for today.\u000a\u000aGood morning and welcome to Morning Media!

Just about every major news show has been chasing to get former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, but we heard last week that Mooch chose ABC News as his first stop.\u000a\u000aSCARAMUCCI WILL THEN GO TO STEPHEN COLBERT FOR HIS FIRST LATE-NIGHT POST-EXIT INTERVIEW: The comedian announced on Twitter last night that Scaramucci would be joining him on Monday. \u201cThis is just a heads up for our censors to get ready! #themooch,\u201d the CBS late night host tweeted. Scaramucci teased a post-exit presser the week after his firing, but cancelled just prior to it, making the appearance this Sunday and Monday one of his first public outings since his fall from grace.\u000a\u000a-- Bonus: 5 times Colbert roasted \u201cThe Mooch\u201d ahead of their late-night next Monday. Read the list here .\u000a\u000aBUT HE\u2019S STILL NOT OVER THAT NEW YORKER INTERVIEW featuring numerous expletive-laden attacks on fellow White House staffers that ensnared the Trump administration in controversy just days after his official unveiling as communications director. Scaramucci took to Twitter late Wednesday to blast New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza: \u201c.@RyanLizza is the Linda Tripp of 2017. People know. And he is up at night not being able to live with himself.\u201d Asked online if he was accusing Lizza of taping their interview without permission, Scaramucci responded, \u201cYes. He absolutely taped the call without my permission. #lowlife\u201d The problem is, The New Yorker and Lizza say that Scaramucci at one point requested the conversation go off-the-record, which Lizza accepted, meaning the rest of the conversation was on. And assuming Lizza and Scaramucci were within Washington D.C. when they held their phone conversation, Lizza was legally within his right to record even if he did not notify Scaramucci - Washington D.C. adheres to "one-party consent" recordings.\u000a\u000aTHIS IS QUITE THE NEW YORK TIMES CORRECTION to their big story about scientists purposely leaking a climate change report out of fear the Trump administration would suppress the report. The article explains how a \u201cdraft report by scientists from 13 federal agencies concludes that Americans are feeling the effects of climate change right now\u201d and that \u201cit directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited.\u201d The idea that the report was leaked to the Times by concerned scientists before the Trump administration approved it for release was given a lot of play. But it turns out, according to the correction, the report was actually uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January.\u000a\u000a-- New York Times Washington bureau chief Elisabeth Bumiller told the Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple \u201cWe were just not aware that somebody involved in the report had put a draft on this nonprofit Internet site \u2026 it was not a well-known site to us and the point is that the people who shared the draft with us were not aware of it either. That doesn\u2019t change the larger point that scientists were worried that the government wouldn\u2019t approve the report or release it through normal channels.\u201d\u000a\u000aAMID LEGAL THREAT, TECHDIRT MOUNTS FREE SPEECH REPORTING PUSH: The news organization, currently the target of a $15 million lawsuit spearheaded by the same law firm that took down Gawker, announced a boost to its free speech reporting program Wednesday, including a $250,000 investment from outside groups. The initiative , launched in partnership with the Freedom of Press Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark\u2019s CraigConnects, among others, is will look to \u201cdraw attention to the threats news organizations face when reporting on powerful individuals who attempt to stifle criticism,\u201d the group wrote in a statement.

U.K. legislation is currently subject to ECJ rulings.\u000a\u000aBritish Prime Minister Theresa May and her government insist that the EU\u2019s highest court should have no jurisdiction over the U.K. after it has divorced from the bloc. But European lawmakers strongly disagree, claiming Britain would continue to be bound by ECJ rulings after Brexit. The U.K. government has conceded Britain could be subject to the court\u2019s rulings for some time during a transition period.\u000a\u000aLord Neuberger insisted the British judiciary will follow the letter of the law in either case.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the U.K. parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so,\u201d Lord Neuberger said. \u201cIf it says we shouldn\u2019t then we won\u2019t. Basically, we will do what the statute says.\u201d\u000a\u000aLord Neuberger, who has served as the president of the British Supreme Court since 2012, will step down next month.

aVThe episode encapsulates the Trump era so far: An impatient president prone to exaggeration and unfamiliar with the subtleties of diplomacy fires off bellicose comments | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Trump aides downplaying his North Korea threat as \u2018impromptu\u2019 The president\u2019s advisers are warning against reading too much into his \u2018fire and fury\u2019 talk against North Korea.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s promise that North Korea would face \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it keeps threatening the United States may be causing alarm around the world, but his aides are warning against reading too much into the combative talk.\u000a\u000aOne White House official who described Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday as \u201cimpromptu,\u201d said other senior officials weren\u2019t briefed on the language in advance, and described the president as simply being irritated by Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear tests and belligerent talk.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he just wanted to show North Korea he was tired of it,\u201d this official said.\u000a\u000aIn private, Trump has asked extensive questions about North Korea but has not shown any move toward an immediate action, the aides and advisers said. He has closely followed the news coverage of the North Korean leader and disliked his rhetoric after the sanctions, one person who spoke to Trump said.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea responded to Trump\u2019s warnings by saying it would, if attacked, strike U.S. military forces in Guam.\u000a\u000aTrump, the White House official said, was presented at his golf course on Tuesday with a new batch of information on North Korea a few hours before his controversial comments.\u000a\u000aThe episode encapsulates the Trump era so far: An impatient president prone to exaggeration and unfamiliar with the subtleties of diplomacy fires off bellicose comments; his Cabinet secretaries and advisers scramble to mitigate the damage; and ultimately, allies and adversaries are left struggling with what to believe.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Trump faced criticism from around the world, especially in Asia, which has watched North Korea\u2019s nuclear progress with trepidation. The latest reports indicate that Pyongyang has reached the stage where it can miniaturize a nuclear weapon to place it on a ballistic missile that could reach the U.S. mainland.\u000a\u000aNew Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Bill English, said Trump\u2019s comments \u201care not helpful in an environment that is very tense,\u201d according to media reports. The Chinese foreign ministry released a statement urging parties to avoid \u201cescalating the situation with words or actions.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea responded to Trump\u2019s warnings by saying it would, if attacked, strike U.S. military forces in Guam. Trump, via Twitter, shot back Wednesday morning that America\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u201cis now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.\u201d\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was traveling in Asia and, by scheduling coincidence, made a stop in Guam, went into clean-up mode \u2013 an increasingly familiar posture for him. The secretary downplayed the threat from Pyongyang and said Americans should \u201csleep well at night.\u201d He also cast Trump\u2019s comments as an attempt to break through to North Korea\u2019s leadership, which itself frequently uses bombastic rhetoric.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days. I think the president again, as commander in chief, I think he felt it necessary to issue a very strong statement directly to North Korea,\u201d Tillerson told reporters aboard his plane.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary James Mattis followed up on Wednesday with a statement that included harsher language but still stopped short of Trump\u2019s rhetoric.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe DPRK must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people,\u201d Mattis said.\u000a\u000aInside the White House, Trump\u2019s language was not taken \u201ctoo seriously,\u201d one White House adviser said.\u000a\u000aSenior aides milled about the Eisenhower Executive Office Building Tuesday afternoon, with one group singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on the second floor. \u201cThere was no sense of panic,\u201d a senior White House official said.\u000a\u000aBut beyond the Trump bubble, observers and analysts said the president needs to be careful what he says, especially when dealing with an isolated regime in Pyongyang that is in many ways paranoid about the rest of the world.\u000a\u000aThe fear among experts isn\u2019t that North Korea will launch an unprovoked nuclear strike on the United States, because the regime there knows that the United States would retaliate in a manner that would topple it. The fear is that some sort of miscalculation or misunderstanding could lead to an unintended clash.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment\u201d \u2014 Rex Tillerson\u000a\u000a\u201cI sure hope @POTUS can distinguish between reality TV and reality. There are millions of lives at stake here,\u201d tweeted David Axelrod, who previously advised former President Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aUpon handing over the Oval Office to Trump, Obama warned him that North Korea\u2019s nuclear program was a top threat. And while the roots of the North Korean challenge date back well before even Obama, Trump owns it for now.\u000a\u000aIn a show of his level of interest, Trump was personally involved in a terse statement issued by Tillerson earlier this year about North Korea, according to a senior administration official. \u201cNorth Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment,\u201d the statement from April read.\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly asked aides since then \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with this guy,\u201d in the words of one of the aides. Two weekends ago, Trump showed fury at China over Twitter after a North Korean missile launch, startling his aides.\u000a\u000aDespite his engagement with the North Korea issue, Trump is not necessarily winning over any critics.\u000a\u000aAccording to new MorningConsult/Politico poll, taken before Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d comments Tuesday, 62 percent of Americans think relations between the United States and North Korea have gotten worse under Trump \u2014 an unwelcome sign for a man who cares strongly about his poll standings.\u000a\u000aNahal Toosi contributed to this report.

The SPD\u2019s rhetoric, she added, was part of a \u201ctotally messed up election campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an op-ed co-authored with SPD leader and Merkel challenger Martin Schulz, the SPD official harshly criticized von der Leyen on Sunday for pledging to step up military spending to reach the NATO target by 2024.\u000a\u000aThat would require almost doubling the current defense spending level of \u20ac37 billion, making Germany the largest military force in Europe \u2014 a bad idea \u201cbecause of our past,\u201d Schulz and Oppermann argued, suggesting moving forward on the development of a pan-European army force instead.\u000a\u000aThe SPD continues to trail the CDU by double-digits in the polls, ahead of the election on September 24.\u000a\u000aThis article has been updated.

aVStephan Weil, Lower Saxony's Social Democrat premier | Holger Hollemann/AFP via Getty Images German state premier under pressure to quit after double trouble SPD\u2019s Stephan Weil accused of allowing VW to edit a speech.\u000a\u000aThe head of the German state of Lower Saxony has been urged to quit following twin crises in a matter of days.\u000a\u000aGerman media reported at the weekend that Stephan Weil, the state\u2019s Social Democrat premier, had allowed Volkswagen to edit a speech he gave on the Dieselgate emissions scandal.\u000a\u000aThe controversy comes less than seven weeks ahead of federal elections, in which Weil\u2019s party hopes to oust Chancellor Angela Merkel, and days after Weil\u2019s coalition government was brought down by a single lawmaker\u2019s surprise defection.\u000a\u000aAndreas Scheuer, general secretary of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, called Weil\u2019s VW decision \u201cdownright scandalous\u201d and demanded his resignation, according to regional daily Passauer Neue Presse.\u000a\u000aWeil is accused of having sought Volkswagen\u2019s blessing for a speech in parliament he gave in the midst of the VW emissions scandal in 2015. The carmaker received an advance copy of the speech, removing \u201cproblematic sections\u201d and adding \u201cpositive formulations,\u201d Bild am Sonntag reported.\u000a\u000aWeil and the Social Democrats (SPD) vehemently rejected accusations of wrongdoing, saying his consultations with the carmaker were innocuous and had long been known.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis purportedly new trouble is old news and was already discussed in Lower Saxony over a year ago. It\u2019s election maneuvering,\u201d Weil told the paper.\u000a\u000aWeil argued that the emissions scandal required him to weigh his words carefully to avoid unduly causing massive losses at Volkswagen. On Sunday, his regional government published a draft of the 2015 speech in an attempt to show that the state premier merely sought legal and technical advice from the carmaker.\u000a\u000aThe draft appears to show that stern criticisms of VW\u2019s behavior were not removed from the text after it was sent to the carmaker. However, a sentence on the legal implications of Volkswagen\u2019s behavior was amended at the company\u2019s behest.\u000a\u000aThe VW spat comes hot on the heels of yet more trouble for Weil and the SPD. On Friday, Green MP Elke Twesten switched her allegiance to the Christian Democrats, meaning the SPD-Green governing coalition lost its one-seat majority.\u000a\u000aSpeaking at a hastily convened press conference after Twesten\u2019s announcement Friday, Weil said he supported calling a new election, but ruled out stepping down. A snap election is scheduled for October 15.\u000a\u000aOther SPD leaders raised questions about whether the conservatives had made secret promises to buy the Green lawmaker\u2019s allegiance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a clumsy attempt at discrediting Stephan Weil\u2019s successful government and to distract from the machinations of the CDU,\u201d said the SPD\u2019s vice chairman, Ralf Stegner.\u000a\u000aFellow Social Democrat Thomas Oppermann, head of the party in the national parliament, added: \u201cI want to know if there was more, or if further promises were made by the CDU in Lower Saxony.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe U.S.-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has confirmed that 2016 was the planet's hottest year on record | NASA via Getty Images 2016 confirmed as planet\u2019s hottest year The report is the most comprehensive assessment of climate change released by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 Last year was Earth\u2019s warmest on record, according to an international climate report issued Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that documents other record-breaking global warming trends of 2016.\u000a\u000aThe report is the most comprehensive assessment of the effects of climate change released by the Trump administration, and it could make it easier to refute efforts from the president and his Cabinet members to publicly discount climate science as they have frequently done in the past. However, the annual report does not detail the link between climate change and human activities such as burning coal or gasoline. Those conclusions are drawn in a separate draft portion of the National Climate Assessment highlighted by The New York Times earlier this week.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cState of the Climate\u201d publication, which confirms findings released before President Donald Trump was sworn in, outlines the observed outcomes of swiftly rising temperatures. They include the highest sea levels ever recorded, extremes in rain cycles and declines in global ice and snow cover. The nearly 500 authors convened by NOAA explain the effects that are due both to long-term global warming and shorter-term weather events like El Niño.\u000a\u000aLast year was the third in a row to break global temperature records, the NOAA report found.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is basically like an annual physical of the climate system,\u201d said report co-editor Deke Arndt, NOAA\u2019s climate monitoring chief.\u000a\u000aIt \u201ccompiles the facts the data the observations from around the climate system and puts it in an annual manuscript,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump has referred to climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d and his environment and energy secretaries have plans to host a public debate of the science that have generated outcry among some climate scientists who say the human-caused climate change is definitely happening. EPA chief Scott Pruitt said his review could happen as soon as this fall.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe American people deserve an honest, open, transparent discussion about this supposed threat to this country,\u201d Pruitt said on a North Dakota radio show Wednesday.\u000a\u000aNOAA and NASA in January combined their data to announce 2016 was the hottest year so far, but the new report backs that finding up with science from around the world. NOAA, which is under the Commerce Department, stands out among other federal agencies. NOAA earlier this year released its annual Greenhouse Gas Index. The EPA, on the other hand, has removed climate change information from its website.\u000a\u000aNOAA said last year\u2019s heat record is \u201cfrom the combined influence of long-term global warming and a strong El Niño early in the year.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSeveral markers such as land and ocean temperatures, sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere broke records set just one year prior,\u201d NOAA said.\u000a\u000aArdnt explained that NOAA doesn\u2019t specify what warming is from climate change and what is from weather events.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe long-term climate change is like riding up an escalator over time, and things like El Niño and La Niña are like jumping up and down on that escalator,\u201d Arndt said.\u000a\u000aThe Times reported that some scientists are worried the Trump administration could suppress or interfere with climate science reports like the National Climate Assessment, which is required by law to be issued next year. Authors of the subsection of that report, however, said they\u2019ve seen no sign that might happen. Arndt, who has been working on the NOAA annual report for eight years, said it includes the \u201csame general material,\u201d and underwent the \u201csame general process.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists who was not involved with the report, said it is \u201calmost at the level of the daily weather report you get.\u201d NOAA releases monthly data, too.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is typical, and it\u2019s ironic that people make a big ado about the big reports that kind of tie it all together,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aEkwurzel said the government has a responsibility to inform people of the risks of man-made climate change.\u000a\u000aThe report includes science from nearly 60 countries and will appear in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society and on NOAA social media feeds.\u000a\u000aAmong its findings:\u000a\u000a\u2014 Greenhouse gas concentrations are higher than ever recorded. Between 2015 and 2016, carbon dioxide concentrations saw their biggest annual increase in the 58 years on record, reaching peaks not seen in the last 800,000 years of ice core measurements.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Global surface temperatures are the highest on record.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Sea levels are the highest they\u2019ve ever been since recordkeeping began. Global seas are about 3.25 inches higher than the 1993 average when satellite recording began. 2016 marks the sixth year that sea levels have risen.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Precipitation cycles are becoming more extreme.\u000a\u000a\u2014 The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Antarctic sea ice levels are lower than ever recorded.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Alpine glaciers have declined for 37 consecutive years. Glaciers shrunk an average of 2.8 feet.\u000a\u000a\u2014 There were more tropical cyclones, with 93 storms in 2016, compared with an average of 82 between 1981 and 2010.

aVEAST PALO ALTO \u2014 Toothaches or asthma can cloud the minds of children who are eager to learn, but a new private school started by Dr. Priscilla Chan and her husband, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, might be just what the doctor ordered.\u000a\u000aIn East Palo Alto, a city with minorities and families living in poverty near the wealthy enclaves of Silicon Valley, The Primary School opened its doors this year to 51 low-income preschool students. It boasts an innovative curriculum that addresses children\u2019s health needs as part of their educational experience.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are so many ways a school can really help a child be in their optimal frame of mind to be successful in the classroom that are way more common than what we traditionally define as special needs,\u201d said Chan, a pediatrician and CEO of the school, in an exclusive interview.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School\u2019s current students are 4 or 5 years old, but it continues to recruit more students and teachers. It will add more grades every year until it\u2019s fully built out to serve 700 families in East Palo Alto and Menlo Park\u2019s Belle Haven neighborhood. By that time, it will have 450 students from preschool to eighth grade and 250 kids from birth to 2 years old.\u000a\u000aThe school provides a free education for its students, who are selected through a lottery.\u000a\u000aAcross the nation, a growing number of schools such as the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone in New York and publicly funded \u201ccommunity schools\u201d also bring in health and social services, education experts say. And while some of these schools have seen success, the cost per child typically is expensive. Not all low-income communities have the resources to make it work.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a very fragmented system with different organizations and government offices that are responsible for different parts of the child, which means that the same child often slips through the cracks because no one thinks to check that the reason why they\u2019re not doing well in school is they can\u2019t see the blackboard,\u201d said Deborah Stipek, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.\u000a\u000aWhile the Primary School hasn\u2019t disclosed how much it costs to run, some of its executives noted they\u2019re leveraging help from community organizations and health care providers. The school said it isn\u2019t ready to let a reporter visit a classroom or talk to parents and teachers, but its leaders shared some of the work they\u2019ve been doing in its first school year.\u000a\u000aPartnering with the Ravenswood Family Health Center, the Primary School\u2019s teachers received training on how to spot and manage a child with asthma, one of the leading causes of school absenteeism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u000a\u000aAt least one-fifth of the kids at The Primary School have a significant asthma condition, said Meredith Liu, the school\u2019s president and chief operating officer.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur goal is to equip parents and teachers and people who work with kids every day to manage the health rather than building an expensive system on top of it,\u201d Liu said.\u000a\u000aRavenswood dentists also stopped by to clean some students\u2019 teeth as part of a project called \u201cVirtual Dental Home.\u201d\u000a\u000aParents of students at the school work with coaches and teachers to help write growth plans to measure and track a child\u2019s health, education and social-emotional progress, such as having a healthy relationship with adults or knowing how to ask for assistance.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe had some kids who were barely making eye contact when they came in and now they\u2019re speaking,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAnd just the ability to have a friend seems like small things for us, but makes all the difference for these kids.\u201d\u000a\u000aInside the classroom, kids learned about healthy eating and even pretended they were doctors in a clinic taking care of imaginary babies. Students start off the day in a community circle, and then split into smaller groups to discuss different topics, Chan said.\u000a\u000aIn one group, children discussed who lived in their community. One classroom decided insects lived in their community, so they drew pictures of bugs and studied them.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s really an immersive experience led by the child\u2019s interest,\u201d said Chan, a former teacher.\u000a\u000aThe Ravenswood City School District, another one of The Primary School\u2019s partners, is looking for what it can learn from the program to bring into its own public-school classrooms. Gloria Hernandez-Goff, the district\u2019s superintendent, said she\u2019s interested in working with the school to improve the professional development of the district\u2019s teachers and provide students with more social-emotional support.\u000a\u000aResearch shows that investments in early childhood education, especially for low-income kids, pay off. A recent study co-authored by Nobel laureate James Heckman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and the director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development, found that high-quality birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children deliver a 13 percent return on investment each year. That\u2019s because when they grow into adults, they\u2019re healthier, better educated and less likely to be incarcerated.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School is one of Chan\u2019s and Zuckerberg\u2019s most hands-on educational investments in the Bay Area. The couple in 2014 pledged to contribute $120 million to schools in low-income Bay Area communities.\u000a\u000aIn 2010, Zuckerberg and Chan donated $100 million to turn around public schools in Newark, New Jersey. But a book titled \u201cThe Prize,\u201d by Dale Russakoff, characterized the work as a failure because large chunks of the money went to labor and contract costs, charter schools and consultants.\u000a\u000aCiting concerns about student privacy, The Primary School declined to disclose its exact location, but noted it sits near the Ravenswood Family Health Center.\u000a\u000aCreating a culture where parents, teachers and doctors communicate better with each other about a child\u2019s needs doesn\u2019t necessarily need to cost more, Chan said.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s one area that Dr. Ryan Padrez is focusing on as the school\u2019s medical director.\u000a\u000aA challenge for pediatricians is that they see families only when they reach out to them and make an appointment. But parents and teachers see a student every day, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven in these first few months, we\u2019re still really just uncovering what can be possible in regards to developing a new innovative model to really go beyond what can be achieved in the pediatric office.\u201d

aVAfter nearly a year of disappointment, triumphalism, hand-wringing, head-scratching and confusion, Brexit talks are finally underway. The two teams met on schedule Monday with an exchange of gifts and an agreement on how the talks would proceed. The U.K. made a significant concession by agreeing to talk about what the EU wants to talk about (the terms of the divorce) before moving on to what it wants to talk about (trade and the future relationship between the two sides).\u000a\u000aOne key issue that must be tackled early on is settling the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the rest of the bloc \u2014 the so-called Brexit bill. That impacts on everything else because unless the EU27 deems \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the money negotiations, they say they aren\u2019t willing to move on to other things. Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to what is at stake in 16 different policy areas once that\u2019s out of the way.\u000a\u000aTRADE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K. and EU27 economies are interlinked to the closest possible degree, and any disruption in trade in goods or services will hit companies, banks and consumers on both sides hard \u2014 particularly the British. Hammering out a good trade deal will be difficult though \u2014 politically and in terms of time and negotiations constraints \u2014 and there\u2019s also trouble ahead at the World Trade Organization.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? EU trade deals with third countries will be affected but will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British business and consumers; German and Japanese carmakers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU businesses that snap up British counterparts (e.g. airlines, banks); EU hubs like Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris (as British businesses relocate).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a softer Brexit preserves single market access (like Norway) or an interim deal is struck, buying time for more talks on a full trade deal.\u000a\u000aKey people on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft, second permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), Catherine Webb, director of market access and budget at DExEU and Simon Case, director general for the U.K.-EU partnership at the U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep).\u000a\u000aKey people on EU side: Deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand, Antonio Fernandez-Martos (head of international agreements, trade and customs in the EU\u2019s Brexit team).\u000a\u000aCUSTOMS/SURFACE TRANSPORT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K.\u2019s biggest freight port and carmakers like Nissan, Toyota and BMW have issued stark warnings that leaving the EU customs union will put their businesses at risk. For the port of Dover, any border checks for truck transit would clog up roads almost immediately. Carmakers say they need access to EU markets for the output from plants in Brexit-voting areas of England like Sunderland and Derby, and they have called for interim single market and customs union access beyond 2019.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s rail and road systems will likely operate as normal, although London will have to figure out whether or not to follow EU policy on things like road tolling and social rules for road transporters in the medium-term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Car manufacturers worried about their supply chains and factory workers in their plants. Spare a thought for Ireland too \u2014 without easy access for road freight to and from the Continent via the U.K., the Emerald Isle\u2019s trade will suffer.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Everyone loses if traffic through Dover is disrupted as alternatives are slower and more expensive. But BMW has hinted it might shift production of the iconic Mini from a site near Oxford to one in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. strikes a deal for tariff-free, and crucially check-free, access to the EU customs union \u2014 commonly described in London as \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft and Catherine Webb. Oliver Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser who has been assigned to the thorny issue of an Irish border, assisted by Simon Case.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Antonio Fernandez-Martos. Sabine Weyand will be Robbins\u2019 counterpart on the Irish border.\u000a\u000aCITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTS\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Roughly 4.2 million EU citizens on either side of the Channel will be affected by Brexit \u2014 from British pensioners living in southern Spain to health professionals in the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. The EU has made a priority of settling rights for citizens like pensions and the protection of \u201clife choices\u201d after March 2019. Life choices implies the rights to residence, to work and to enjoy equal treatment with nationals when it comes to employment access, working conditions, benefits and taxes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? If the U.K. is genuine about its \u201cgenerous offer\u201d on citizens\u2019 rights, Brussels won\u2019t try to prevent the U.K. from cutting immigration after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, British universities and London\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU citizens on both sides of the Channel worried about their future status.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How will rights be enforced and protected? A role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is Brussels\u2019 preference and is enshrined in EU law, but that would be contrary to the \u201ctake back control\u201d desired by the U.K.\u2019s Hard Brexiteers.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Glyn Williams, director general at the Home Office.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Marie Simonsen, who is in charge of free movement of citizens and employment on Barnier\u2019s Brexit task force. Her boss is François Arbault, who is responsible for internal market and sectoral policies, but Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, will also follow this strand of the negotiations very closely.\u000a\u000aDEFENSE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake: The EU will lose a country with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear deterrent and an army that can be deployed around the world. On the plus side, the bloc will be free to pursue defense integration \u2014 something London has always opposed. The U.K. will want to ensure it can maintain leverage in areas like the Balkans and coordinate with EU partners outside of NATO operations.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not: The EU is unlikely to create a unified army with a Pentagon-style headquarters. At least not in the short term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. defense companies like BAE Systems if they cannot maintain access to the new EU fund for defense research; EU defense if it loses British military and technical expertise.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: The French, who currently steer EU foreign policy and will now dominate defense policy too; those in the EU who want defense integration.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether \u201cthird countries\u201d \u2014 as the U.K. will be post Brexit \u2014 will have access to EU funds and military operations.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill, national security adviser to the prime minister.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier, responsible for external relations and foreign and security policy on the Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCRIME/TERRORISM/SECURITY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Information sharing will be the key issue in negotiations on security. The U.K. is among the top four contributors to Europol\u2019s main database on crime and the fifth largest user of the agency\u2019s platform to exchange information. Britain will almost certainly lose access to both databases, which would leave EU and U.K. citizens less safe as a result.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Intelligence cooperation mainly occurs at a bilateral level, meaning that the U.K.\u2019s intelligence services will continue to partner with EU allies.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Europol; U.K. police and citizens.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Organized criminals and terrorists operating out of the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. can obtain access to Europol\u2019s databases and the Schengen Information System \u2014 something that would require ECJ oversight.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill and Chris Jones, director general at DExEU.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier.\u000a\u000aDIGITAL ECONOMY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? If London wants to keep its top reputation for startups and data innovation, it will have to negotiate ways to transfer data smoothly to and from the EU. The country\u2019s invasive surveillance practices could stand in the way of that. Migration is also high on the agenda for techies, who fear a brain drain of coders and entrepreneurs. The EU, on the other hand, stands to lose a tech-savvy member with the skills and pro-business agenda the Commission likes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The digital economy \u2014 everyone loves the digital economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Startups in London; research departments across Europe.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Privacy advocates; EU countries that take up Britain\u2019s lead role on tech.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a data transfer deal is struck.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Gila Sacks, director for digital and tech policy at the U.K.\u2019s department of culture, media and sports, will support the DExEU team with expertise.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: François Arbault, key person in charge of internal market and sectoral policies.\u000a\u000aAVIATION\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Some 50 percent of U.K. passenger travel is to or from the EU, and Brexit will also impact trips between the U.K. and trading partners with an open skies agreement with the EU, like the U.S. In total, 42 of the U.K.\u2019s air services agreements are through its membership of the EU and will have to be renegotiated.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Heathrow airport believes it will benefit from Brexit, provided the U.K. puts a system in place allowing for swift entry of passengers and goods.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. airlines \u2014 such as Thomas Cook, EasyJet and jet2.com \u2014 which run a lot of flights to or within EU countries; Passengers, who are likely to pay more due to reduced competition; Ireland, because it has more air traffic to the U.K. than any other EU country.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Some national airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia are looking forward to less competition from U.K. budget airlines.\u000a\u000aKey decision: If a new air services agreement is in place by the time the U.K. leaves the EU and the single aviation market.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Peter Sorensen, who is responsible for aviation, and François Arbault, head of internal market in goods and non-financial services in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCLIMATE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The EU has benefited from the U.K.\u2019s participation in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost renewables and energy efficiency. Britain is one of the EU\u2019s biggest emissions-cutters and a heavyweight country in favor of toughening climate policies such as the Emissions Trading System.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s national Climate Change Act, which aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, is unlikely to be affected. Nor are its policies pricing emissions from power plants and phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2025.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The EU27, which will have to divvy up the U.K.\u2019s national emissions reduction responsibilities, and the U.K., which will lose its influence as a larger member of a big bloc in international climate negotiations.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU27 countries that resist tougher future emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. pulls out of the Emissions Trading System, and whether it will continue to participate in the bloc\u2019s emission reduction efforts.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain, responsible for energy and climate and environment in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force and Nicola Pesaresi, who is in charge of regulatory issues on subjects like climate change and financial stability that could be impacted by the U.K.\u2019s departure.\u000a\u000aENVIRONMENT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? After Brexit, London will be free to decide whether to keep in place environmental rules and standards set by the EU over the years. If the U.K. lowers air quality standards, the EU could be directly impacted, as dirty air doesn\u2019t respect national borders. MEPs have also warned that products imported from the U.K. could, in the future, be made to lower environmental standards, undercutting EU goods.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K., home to a strong tradition of environmental activism, is unlikely to overturn environmental rules en masse, even if it does eliminate regulations it deems unuseful and uncompetitive.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Animal and plant species protected under the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, deemed \u201cEU red tape\u201d by British Brexiteers; the U.K. environment.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British housing developers \u2014 who may no longer have to worry about great crested newts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How environmental standards will be embedded in a future trade deal between the U.K. and EU countries.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aENERGY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? New tariffs or other trade barriers could push up the price of gas and power supplies, putting the U.K., Ireland and others at risk of shortages. In another blow to Britain, they could get in the way of new investment, equipment and expertise for energy infrastructure (particularly nuclear plants).\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The continued flow of electricity and gas between the two sides. Costs and volumes may change, planned new links might run into complications, but existing interconnectors will not disappear after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The Irish-Northern Irish single electricity market; U.K. energy companies in the EU; EU energy companies in Britain; the British nuclear safeguarding regime; new nuclear energy developers in the U.K.; British energy bill payers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Not many. Maybe a few small local energy companies, like those developing shale gas, that would benefit from less international competition.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. leaves the EU\u2019s internal energy market, and whether it continues to follow a complex set of power and gas network rules that make it easier to trade between EU markets.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aFISHING\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Access is the key word in fisheries negotiations. Thousands of EU fishermen rely on U.K. waters for their daily catch. However, the EU is the largest buyer of British fish. This co-dependency means Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s promise to wrangle back control of British seas will be difficult to keep.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? British waters are unlikely to become the Wild West of fishing because the U.K. ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British fish processors and exporters; EU fishermen.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: U.K. fishermen; EU fish processors.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether there will be a deal brokered to swap fishing rights in British waters for access to the world\u2019s largest fish market: the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth, responsible for agriculture, fisheries and maritime policy on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aHEALTH\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brits and Europeans could lose their health insurance for emergency care when policyholders travel abroad. The way medicines will be approved in the U.K. could also be affected once it leaves the bloc. Britain also risks shortages of doctors and nurses, as those from the EU will either leave the U.K. or no longer work in its National Health Service.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Big British pharmaceutical companies will continue to do business in the EU, even if they will probably have to rely more on their continental subsidiaries inside the bloc.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Holidaymakers, patients and the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Insurance companies providing travel insurance; the EU country that gets the European Medicines Agency once it\u2019s relocated from the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps the British medicines approval process aligned with that of the EU; and whether it remains in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which provides the right to free emergency medical care in the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Stefan Fuehring, who\u2019s responsible for health and food safety, as well as justice and home affairs on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aUNIVERSITIES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brexit could lead to a decline in the number of EU students coming to study in the U.K. because they would be recruited as international students, meaning their fees would rise significantly. British universities also risk losing the roughly 15 percent of their budget they get from the EU in research funding. Academics are likely to find it harder to collaborate on research projects with colleagues on the Continent. A change in visa arrangements for other European countries might also prevent them from joining British universities.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Demand for higher education is so high that even if fewer EU students came to study in Britain, universities would be no worse off financially as they compensate by taking more domestic students.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: EU students, and foreign staff and academics; the European Commission\u2019s Erasmus student-exchange program.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British students (who will have better chances of getting a place at university); U.K. universities (that can raise tuition fees for EU nationals and so increase budgets).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a deal is struck giving EU students and academics access to U.K. universities and vice versa.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aFINANCIAL SERVICES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Hundreds of international firms do business across the EU from their London headquarters thanks to so-called passports. The industry is most worried about losing its ability to operate across the bloc from British headquarters. Another issue topping the agenda is the possibility that London will lose euro-clearing activities, a nearly \u20ac1 trillion-a-day business that supports 83,000 jobs in the City of London.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? London\u2019s role as a world-class financial center. Some firms will move some of their operations, but the bulk is likely to stay, allowing the City of London and Canary Wharf to remain major international financial hubs.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British clearing houses; the European Banking Authority; young EU talent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Frankfurt, lawyers and banks (because they always win).\u000a\u000aKey decision: The shape and form of mutual market access, assuming the U.K. loses full single market access and passporting rights.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Bowman, director general, international finance at the Treasury and Philip Rycroft.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aAGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Market access will dominate discussions, with British farmers currently hooked into sophisticated supply chains that deliver produce across Europe. Many EU farmers depend on the U.K. market, but Britain has more to lose. Restricted trade either way will deal EU farmers a heavier blow than Russia\u2019s food import ban, which devastated the industry.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Farms run razor-thin profit margins \u2014 everything is at stake.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British farmers; Dutch and Spanish food exporters; Ireland\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: There are few, but French farmers might benefit if their government \u2014 which the U.K. has traditionally hindered in agricultural affairs \u2014 pushes for a better-funded Common Agricultural Policy.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether negotiators will agree to tariff-free mutual market access.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one on the negotiating team has been specifically assigned this brief but Catherine Webb will deal with market access issues.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth.\u000a\u000aSPACE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Whether the U.K. continues to contribute to the EU\u2019s space program will dictate whether it keeps access to contracts for satellite systems like Galileo, Europe\u2019s version of America\u2019s GPS network. The EU could also freeze British astronauts out of future space missions. As talks get underway on the broader Brexit deal, the government has set out a proposed new law allowing spaceports and satellite launches to take place in the U.K.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Galileo will be completed whether the U.K. keeps on paying or not \u2014 some 20 of the satellites are already in orbit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s aerospace research institutions and NewSpace startups that have already been advised to start looking at options on the Continent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Engineering companies and startups across the bloc, who will be quick to fill the gap left behind if the U.K. falls out of the EU\u2019s orbit.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps funding European space programs and contributing to broader EU research pools.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKait Bolongaro, Jacopo Barigazzi, Carmen Paun, Emmet Livingstone, Hans Joachim Von Der Burchard, Joshua Posaner, Cathy Buyck, Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli, Laurens Cerulus, Giulia Paravicini, Quentin Ariès, Sara Stefanini, Kalina Oroschakoff, Marion Solletty and Cynthia Kroet contributed reporting.

Finally, State searched a collection of emails the FBI assembled when it was investigating Clinton's use of the private account and server.\u000a\u000aIn all, State found 348 Benghazi-related messages or documents that were sent to or from Clinton in a period of nearly five months after the attack.\u000a\u000aHowever, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch argued that the search wasn't good enough because State never tried to search its own systems for relevant messages in the official email accounts of Clinton's top aides.\u000a\u000aThe Global Politico Susan B. Glasser\u2019s new weekly podcast takes you backstage in a world disrupted. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aIn a 10-page ruling issued Tuesday, Mehta \u2014 an Obama appointee \u2014 agreed.\u000a\u000a"To date, State has searched only data compilations originating from outside sources \u2014 Secretary Clinton, her former aides, and the FBI. ... It has not, however, searched the one records system over which it has always had control and that is almost certain to contain some responsive records: the state.gov e-mail server," Mehta wrote.\u000a\u000a"If Secretary Clinton sent an e-mail about Benghazi to Abedin, Mills, or Sullivan at his or her state.gov e-mail address, or if one of them sent an e-mail to Secretary Clinton using his or her state.gov account, then State\u2019s server presumably would have captured and stored such an e-mail. Therefore, State has an obligation to search its own server for responsive records."\u000a\u000aJustice Department lawyers representing State argued that making them search other employees' accounts for Clinton's emails would set a bad precedent that would belabor other FOIA searches.\u000a\u000aBut Mehta said the circumstances surrounding Clinton's email represented "a specific fact pattern unlikely to arise in the future."\u000a\u000aA central premise of Mehta's ruling is that the State Department's servers archived emails from Clinton's top aides. However, it's not clear that happened regularly or reliably.\u000a\u000aState Department officials have said there was no routine, automated archiving of official email during Clinton's tenure. Some officials did copy their mailboxes from time to time and put archived message folders on desktop computers or servers, so State may still have some messages from the aides, but the FBI may already have acquired some of those messages during its inquiry.\u000a\u000aA State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the judge's decision. A Justice Department spokesman said: "We are reviewing the judge's opinion and order."\u000a\u000aJosh Gerstein is a senior reporter for POLITICO.

aVU.S. and Afghan military commanders battling the Taliban and the Islamic State are encountering an obstacle they never expected, sources close to them say: months of indecision by President Donald Trump on whether to commit thousands of additional American troops.\u000a\u000aInstead of approving their plan for more troops as anticipated, the president has caught his generals off guard by questioning whether the 16-year-long effort to stabilize Afghanistan is still worth it, according to current and former military officials familiar with the conversations. Meanwhile, news reports raise the prospects he might replace the top U.S. commander in the region or hand private contractors the day-to-day task of advising the flagging Afghan security forces.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAmid the uncertainty, the security situation on the ground continues to deteriorate. Deaths of Afghan security forces in the early months of 2017 were \u201cshockingly high,\u201d the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction recently reported, continuing a years-long upward trend. The Afghan government \u201ccontrols or influences\u201d only 60 percent of the country\u2019s 407 districts as of early this summer, down from 65 percent the same time last year, according to the U.S. military headquarters in Kabul.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s important as soon as possible for senior administration officials to outline the importance of the region and why we have more combat troops in Afghanistan than in any other combat zone,\u201d said Seth Jones, an expert on the war at the government-funded RAND Corp. who has worked alongside the U.S. military there. \u201cWalking away right now, I can only see one direction this goes, particularly with neighboring states getting involved.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s failure to approve a plan \u2014 any plan \u2014 has surprised U.S. commanders in Afghanistan, in the Pentagon and at the U.S. Central Command, the officials said. Some had expected the tough-talking president to give a swift sign-off on their plan to add more U.S. troops \u2014 on top of more than 8,000 already there \u2014 to advise and assist Afghan forces, despite his campaign criticisms of George W. Bush\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s wars.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 13 that the administration\u2019s review of the military\u2019s plan and troop \u201cuplift\u201d request, as the reinforcement is referred to internally, would be complete by mid-July. But Trump has continued to insist in National Security Council meetings that he wants to consider other options.\u000a\u000aMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has conflicting impulses and is hoping someone can give him a better strategy,\u201d one government official said of the holdup.\u000a\u000aBut the impasse, combined with reports that Trump has considered replacing Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and a proposal to privatize large portions of the war, have shaken top commanders and their allies in the Afghan government and security forces. They are waiting to see how the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to Afghan stability measures up to its predecessors\u2019, according to officials involved in the review.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe herd is spooked here, and the delay has a practical effect,\u201d one American officer in Kabul said, referring to the multinational headquarters that Nicholson oversees. Without a U.S. commitment, other NATO allies are hesitant to commit reinforcements they are considering.\u000a\u000aThe delay is especially burdening the hard-hit Afghan security forces, which were counting on a stepped-up American advisory role to beat back gains by the Taliban and new inroads by the Islamic State terrorist group. The longer the decision takes, the less likely a significant number of the additional U.S. forces will arrive by the end of Afghanistan\u2019s so-called fighting season, which lasts into the fall.\u000a\u000aUntil then, U.S. advisers can support multiple operations by Afghanistan\u2019s commando forces, but only one large operation at a time by the conventional army. The proposed reinforcements include additional \u201cexpeditionary\u201d adviser teams that would allow the U.S.-led command to work in four or more remote areas at once, encouraging Afghan commanders to be more aggressive.\u000a\u000aBesides advisers to Afghan combat units, the extra troops would probably include rocket-artillery units and air controllers with expanded authority to call in strikes in support of Afghan forces. Those have been key to gains by U.S. allies in Iraq and Syria in recent months.\u000a\u000aBut instead of anticipating that Trump would have reservations about beefing up the U.S. military presence, some commanders were surprised by the president\u2019s wariness this summer.\u000a\u000aThey missed some early warning signs.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump visited MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, in February to huddle with leaders of Central Command and Special Operations Command, he used a discussion focused on Iraq and Syria to raise broad questions about U.S. military involvement overseas, a source familiar with the discussions said. That should have put them on notice about how the White House would view Nicholson\u2019s three- to four-year plan for turning the tide against the Taliban.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president was like, \u2018Yeah, I got what you\u2019re telling me, but what is the United States of America getting out of it? What are our citizens getting out of this effort?\u2019\u201d a military source familiar with the Tampa meetings said.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s past statements might have provided a clue, too. In 2013, he tweeted repeatedly that he thought the United States should wash its hands of the Afghan conflict. \u201cWe should leave Afghanistan immediately. No more wasted lives. If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick. Rebuild the US first,\u201d he wrote in one tweet before his presidential run.\u000a\u000aEven so, commanders and their staffs continued to expect White House support when their revised strategy and request for reinforcements crossed the president\u2019s desk later in the spring. It called for an expansion of the advisory effort to lower echelons of the Afghan security forces, something the U.S. did earlier in Iraq.\u000a\u000aInstead, their plan hit a roadblock \u2014 Trump approved an increase in forces, but continued to press for different strategy options. In July, as the review dragged on, Trump told a group of reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve been there for now close to 17 years, and I want to find out why we\u2019ve been there for 17 years, how it\u2019s going, and what we should do in terms of additional ideas.\u201d Asked about the troop increase, he answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\u000a\u000aNBC then reported that Trump, in an NSC meeting the day after those public remarks, had suggested firing Nicholson. That inspired a flurry of emails from his superiors in Tampa and the Pentagon expressing their unreserved support for the general, two military sources said.\u000a\u000aNicholson\u2019s backers include Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was present when the general testified over the winter that he needed extra forces, met with him during a visit to Kabul in early July and, after the NBC report, issued a statement saying Nicholson had \u201cearned my full confidence.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, McCain made good on a threat to introduce an amendment into the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act dictating aspects of an Afghan strategy.\u000a\u000aBilled as having been formulated with the help of \u201csome of our nation\u2019s most experienced and respected former military and intelligence officials,\u201d McCain\u2019s amendment goes further than the outstanding requests from Kabul and Central Command, calling for U.S. military combat advisers to embed not just with a few Afghan brigades but with their subordinate battalions throughout the country.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVSenior administration aides postponed the announcement at the urging of United Nations and State Department officials. | Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Trump's attack on Chinese trade gets sidelined over North Korea\u000a\u000aAn opportunity to hit North Korea with new United Nations sanctions has sidelined President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to punish China for its alleged unfair trade practice.\u000a\u000aThe White House had been preparing for a Friday announcement in which Trump planned to urge his administration to open a trade investigation into China\u2019s alleged violations of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers, three administration officials said.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut on Thursday afternoon, senior administration aides postponed the announcement at the urging of United Nations and State Department officials, who are in the sensitive final stages of convincing China to sign on to a U.N. resolution that would impose new sanctions on North Korea. U.N. and State Department officials warned that the trade announcement could kill their chances of winning Beijing\u2019s buy-in, according to the officials.\u000a\u000a"There are broader talks about diplomatic considerations,\u201d an administration official said.

The investigation could eventually result in tariffs or other punitive measures.\u000a\u000aLighthizer is expected to be out of the U.S. next week, but aides said that wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop Trump from making the trade announcement.\u000a\u000aThe president has railed against China in recent days, arguing the country isn\u2019t doing enough to stop North Korea from developing a nuclear weapon capable of striking the United States. A decision by China to sign on to the U.N. resolution sanctioning North Korea would be one step in easing U.S. tensions with Beijing.\u000a\u000aA State Department spokesperson declined to comment.

aVBedlam erupts as Wasserman Schultz speaks to Florida delegates Audience members wearing Bernie Sanders shirts shouted and yelled, waving signs that said 'Thanks for the "Help" Debbie.'\u000a\u000aPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Chaos erupted as Debbie Wasserman Schultz addressed Florida delegates on Monday, with opponents upset about leaked emails jeering the outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman as she delivered a speech at a state breakfast meeting.\u000a\u000a"So I can see there's a little bit of interest in my being here, and I appreciate that interest," Wasserman Schultz said amid the cacophony, which began as soon as the Florida Democrat started speaking.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"And a little bit of interest from the press," she continued \u2014 straining to be heard over shouts of "Shame!" \u2014 "but that really shows you that Florida is the most significant battleground state that will make sure that Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States of America. We are the state that will deliver the White House to make sure that we can continue to make the progress that we have been able to make under Barack Obama for the last eight years."\u000a\u000aWhen Wasserman Schultz entered the room, the crowd hushed momentarily, and then her supporters began cheering. As she began talking, though, audience members wearing Bernie Sanders shirts started shouting and yelling, waving signs that said \u201cThanks for the 'Help' Debbie" and signs that simply read \u201ce-mails.\u201d\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz is still slated to gavel in the Democratic National Convention later Monday, although she is not expected to deliver any longer speech.\u000a\u000aHer remarks were drowned out both by cheers and boos from the crowd. The Florida congresswoman, who faces a primary challenge from Bernie Sanders-backed candidate Tim Canova, attempted to pivot away from the party discord immediately, noting the overnight shooting at a Florida nightclub.\u000a\u000a"We have so much to do, and we have to make sure that we have to move forward together in a unified way. We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know it's not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is united," she said. "The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to create jobs like the 14.8 million jobs that were created under Barack Obama's leadership.

Riker said all delegates received an email that Wasserman Schultz would be speaking Monday.\u000a\u000a\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s their fault that this happened. There is absolutely no reason that a day after rightfully resigning in disgrace with the quote 'Bernie Sanders will not be president' leaked from an email that she should be addressing the delegates," Riker said. "It\u2019s bad for the party, it looks biased and, quite frankly, it looks tone-deaf.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI will literally boo anytime she\u2019s involved in the convention because she shouldn\u2019t be involved," Riker added, remarking that the emails confirmed the chairwoman's "biased conduct" and the state party made a poor decision in having her speak.\u000a\u000aFlorida state Sen.

aVPresident Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d over its nuclear threat, but China, which sells billions in fuel and food to North Korea, is far better positioned to weaken its volatile neighbor without firing a single missile.\u000a\u000aEven as a global nuclear crisis heats up, there\u2019s scant evidence China is willing to impose the major economic measures necessary to cripple Pyongyang \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s insistence Thursday that \u201cit do a lot more.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cChina is not willing to put the kind of regime threat pressure that we think is necessary because they don\u2019t want to cause a Korean collapse,\u201d said Joseph DeThomas, a former U.S. diplomat who specialized in sanctions and nonproliferation issues.\u000a\u000aThe prospect of millions of refugees pouring into China, economic instability in its northern provinces and a possible war on the Korean peninsula are more pressing realities for Beijing than North Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aChina agreed this week to a United Nations resolution prohibiting the purchase of some of North Korea\u2019s major exports \u2014 coal, iron ore, seafood and other items. Yet the legitimate and illicit trade that flows back and forth across the Yalu River every day is a stark reminder that China\u2019s view of the problem differs greatly from the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think they\u2019re genuinely unhappy with the North Koreans, genuinely want to penalize them and are prepared to join with the U.S. in doing that \u2014 but there\u2019s a limit to how far they want to go,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously served as special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department.\u000a\u000aTrump showed impatience with such limits, however, in remarks from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how I feel. It\u2019s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president has threatened tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports and has come close to ordering an investigation into Beijing\u2019s intellectual property rights violations that could lead to more trade restrictions. However, the latest trade action alleged violations of U.S. intellectual property rights and forced technology transfers against China\u2019s was put off as the U.S. recently sought China\u2019s support for sanctions at the U.N.\u000a\u000aBut Beijing would be hard pressed to curtail its exports of oil, vehicles, electronics and food that serve to prop up the North Korean economy, and by extension, the Kim Jong Un regime and its nuclear aspirations.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina is sort of there everywhere economically for North Korea,\u201d said DeThomas. \u201cThey\u2019re on the one hand the key and the other hand the lock.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough North Korea has become an increasingly ostracized nation over the years, China\u2019s support for the regime through trade remains strong. In the second quarter of 2017, China exported $934 million worth of goods, compared to $721 million in the first quarter of the year. Exports are also up 17 percent from the same period last year, according to Chinese data collected by Panjiva, a trade analysis firm.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear what types of goods account for the increase in trade flows, because China has redacted product-specific data since January, said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva.\u000a\u000aChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this week that China would \u201ccomprehensively and strictly\u201d enforce the U.N. resolution but in a statement recognized his country\u2019s \u201ctraditional economic bond\u201d with North Korea.\u000a\u000aWang made the point of "affirming" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s statement from earlier this month in which the top U.S. diplomat said American policy did not seek regime change, the regime\u2019s collapse, an accelerated reunification of the Korean peninsula or an American invasion.\u000a\u000aChina\u2019s recent agreement at the U.N. to cut off certain imports from North Korea may further squelch the flow of hard currency going into the country, but Pyongyang will likely continue to earn revenue from legitimate trade with China as well as its illicit activities.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you want to go down the road of economic pressure, China is the card you have to play because China has 90 percent of their trade; it\u2019s their sole source of oil, basically all their illicit trade goes through China,\u201d said DeThomas, who now teaches at Penn State University.\u000a\u000aFor example, China imported about $640 million worth of North Korean apparel in 2016, which is second only to coal in terms of what it imports from its neighbor. The latest U.N. sanctions don\u2019t place restrictions on exports of apparel and textiles. Chinese companies also supported North Korea\u2019s apparel industry with exports of $175 million of fabric across the border, according to data culled by Panjiva.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea also takes in foreign money via the wages its laborers earn in foreign countries. A large proportion of the estimated 100,000 North Koreans working abroad are employed in China. Over all, wages remitted from North Korean workers in other countries add a further $300 million to $600 million to North Korea\u2019s coffers, said Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korea Economic Institute of America. A State Department spokeswoman said today it was pressuring other countries to reduce the number of North Korean guest workers.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea also earns revenue through illicit channels such as online gambling operations and illegal arms sales to the Syrian government \u2014 each of which brings in $1 billion income, Stangarone said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a significant amount of revenue sources probably still out there beyond just sort of what we\u2019re looking at in, say, the licit goods side that\u2019s largely with China,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSuch trade gives the North Korean regime the hard currency it needs to sustain it nuclear activities, even after the recent U.N. sanctions promise to cut off about one-third of the $3 billion in revenue it earns in legitimate goods exports.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean workers load goods imported from China on a truck on the banks of the Yalu River in the North Korean town of Sinuiju on Oct. 22, 2006. | Cancan Chu/Getty Images\u000a\u000aChina was successful in watering down the U.N. resolution, Einhorn suggested, by pushing back on U.S. demands to cut their oil shipments.\u000a\u000aHe said China also likely dissented from proposals to expel North Korean workers altogether and to abandon any existing joint business ventures. Instead, the resolution only goes as far as prohibiting countries from hiring additional North Korean nationals and entering into new or expanded business joint ventures.\u000a\u000aChina agreed to cut off imports of North Korean coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood, but it was already tapering purchases on those items based on a U.N. resolution it agreed to at the end of last November. That action capped the amount of North Korean coal China and other U.N. members could buy but didn't eliminate imports altogether.\u000a\u000aSince the previous resolution went into effect on Nov. 30 and through the end of January, China imported about $218 million worth of North Korean coal, according to a South Korean energy analyst, who requested not to be named because of classified work he does for the South Korean government.\u000a\u000aAs of Feb. 19, China had already halted all shipments of coal from North Korea, the analyst said.\u000a\u000aCongress could further squeeze China by imposing so-called secondary sanctions to cut off the nation's financial institutions from the U.S. financial system.\u000a\u000aSens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) introduced legislation (S. 1591) in July to toughen efforts to sanction banks that allow North Korea to continue sanctioned business activities.\u000a\u000aBut unilateral action to hit China may compromise any efforts to further sanction North Korea through international cooperation.\u000a\u000a"We've begun to go after these [Chinese] entities, but there's always a reluctance there," said Einhorn. "On the one hand, you have to threaten China that we're going to be serious about going after their entities. On the other hand, we need Chinese cooperation. We needed the Chinese cooperation to get that resolution adopted. And even though it's not as strong a resolution as the U.S. had hoped for, it's still a pretty strong step forward."\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks at a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri in Washington, DC | Win McNamee/Getty Images Tillerson downplays threat posed by North Korea \u2018Americans should sleep well at night,\u2019 he says.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Wednesday that \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night,\u201d free from worry that North Korea\u2019s ever-progressing nuclear program presents an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to the United States.\u000a\u000aEn route to Guam, the U.S. territory in the Pacific that North Korea has threatened to destroy with an \u201cenveloping fire,\u201d Tillerson defended President Donald Trump\u2019s warning that Pyongyang \u201cbest not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think, in fact, the pressure is starting to show. I think that\u2019s why the rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang is beginning to become louder and more threatening\u201d \u2014 Rex Tillerson\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Americans should sleep well at night. I have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days. I think the president again, as commander in chief, I think he felt it necessary to issue a very strong statement directly to North Korea,\u201d Tillerson said in remarks to reporters aboard his plane. \u201cBut I think what the president was just reaffirming is, the United States has the capability to fully defend itself from any attack and defend our allies, and we will do so. And the American people should sleep well tonight.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe secretary of state said he did not reconsider rerouting his current Pacific trip away from a planned stop in Guam. He told reporters that \u201cI do not believe that there is any imminent threat, in my own view.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite the recent uptick in bellicose rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea, Tillerson was optimistic that recent diplomatic efforts have made headway on putting real pressure on North Korea. He cited support from China and Russia, North Korea\u2019s top two trade partners, on a package of sanctions passed unanimously last weekend by the United Nations Security Council.\u000a\u000aThe new sanctions imposed by the U.N. mark the latest response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, which in recent weeks has included tests of ballistic missiles that could have the potential to reach the continental U.S. North Korea\u2019s nuclear technology, too, has advanced, according to the Washington Post, which reported Tuesday that the Pentagon has concluded that the repressive state has successfully miniaturized a warhead small enough to fit on a missile.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think, in fact, the pressure is starting to show. I think that\u2019s why the rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang is beginning to become louder and more threatening,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWhether we\u2019ve got them backed into a corner or not is difficult to say. But diplomatically, you never like to have someone in a corner without a way for them to get out.\u201d

aVCongresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz defiantly stands by her decision to keep an information technology aide on her payroll for six months after he was banned from the House network and fired by other members of Congress.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe that I did the right thing, and I would do it again,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said Thursday in an exclusive interview with the Sun Sentinel. \u201cThere are times when you can\u2019t be afraid to stand alone, and you have to stand up for what\u2019s right.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would have been easier for me to just fire him,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe Weston Democrat did fire Imran Awan last week after he was arrested on bank fraud charges at an airport while trying to leave the country.\u000a\u000aAs the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Wasserman Schultz is the most prominent Democrat who employed Awan. Her decision to keep employing Awan has been under fire from her Democratic primary challenger, Republicans and multiple conservative websites. They\u2019ve suggested Wasserman Schultz is hiding something and the Awan matter is much more serious than she\u2019s letting on.\u000a\u000aHis arrest, the congresswoman said, had nothing to do with the months-long investigation of Awan as an IT worker for a variety of members of Congress. An FBI affidavit filed with the criminal complaint said Awan and his wife claimed a property used to secure a home equity line of credit was a \u201cprincipal residence,\u201d when it was, in fact, a rental property. Wasserman Schultz said there still hasn\u2019t been any evidence presented that he\u2019s done anything wrong involving his work for Congress.\u000a\u000aAnd, she said, she believes he may have been put under scrutiny because of his religious faith. Awan is Muslim.\u000a\u000aAwan, his wife and brothers worked for years for various members of Congress, including Wasserman Schultz. He was a so-called shared employee, with each office paying a part-time salary.\u000a\u000aIn February, Wasserman Schultz said, chiefs of staffs for members of Congress were told that Awan was under investigation and his access to the House network was suspended. House payroll records show that multiple members of Congress terminated Awan quickly, early in February.\u000a\u000aInstead of firing him, Wasserman Schultz said her office worked with the House chief administration officer to develop a job description that \u201cwould allow him to continue to do work \u2026 until such time as there were other charges brought or we had some evidence that there was something that was produced that warranted further action.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven without access to the IT network, Wasserman Schultz said, \u201cthere are plenty of technological issues that an IT person can assist with. He didn\u2019t have access to the network, but he was able to give us guidance and advice and troubleshoot on a wide variety of other technological issues.\u201d IT isn\u2019t limited to computer network issues, she said; it includes phones, printers, the website and helping people with software.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had grave concerns about his due process rights being violated,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen their investigation was reviewed with me, I was presented with no evidence of anything that they were being investigated for. And so that, in me, gave me great concern that his due process rights were being violated. That there were racial and ethnic profiling concerns that I had,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz said the chiefs of staff were told that Awan and his family members were having their access to the House IT network cut off because they were under investigation for \u201cprocurement violations and data transfer violations.\u201d Wasserman Schultz said from what she has been able to discern the data transfer issue doesn\u2019t involve anything sinister.\u000a\u000aA law enforcement official familiar with the case said after Awan\u2019s arrest there was no evidence of anything beyond the mortgage fraud for which he was charged and no indications of intelligence or national security implications. Because this is a pending case, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington said it wouldn\u2019t have any comment beyond the federal complaint.\u000a\u000aInstead, Wasserman Schultz said, it involved \u201ctransferring data outside the secure network, which I think amounted to use of apps that the House didn\u2019t find compliant with our security requirements.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn example, she said, is the storage service Dropbox, which allows people to store documents and other images and share them with others. Wasserman Schultz said she believes other IT employees engage in the same kind of data movement as Awan but aren\u2019t being investigated.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz said Awan didn\u2019t have access to any classified information. She and other members of Congress aren\u2019t allowed to store classified information in their offices and on their computers.\u000a\u000aWhen they go to secure locations to receive classified information, the members of Congress aren\u2019t allowed to bring in any kind of electronics \u2014 Wasserman Schultz even has to leave her Fitbit fitness tracker outside \u2014 and aren\u2019t allowed to leave the room with any written notes.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Awan was paid $20,000 by Wasserman Schultz. In 2017, he was paid about $7,800, from the beginning of the year until his July 25 termination. His salary rate didn\u2019t change while his duties changed, spokesman David Damron said.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz said she hired Awan when she went to Congress in 2005, at the recommendation of then-U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, a Democrat from Palm Beach County. She said he worked in various offices as needed.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz was also chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 2011 to 2016, resigning last summer after WikiLeaks published stolen internal party emails. She said Awan never worked for the DNC.\u000a\u000aShe said her concerns over the investigation were the reason she grilled Capitol Police Chief Matthew R. Verderosa about a laptop computer at a May 18 House Appropriations subcommittee hearing.\u000a\u000aShe said the laptop in question was issued by her office to Awan. \u201cHe accidentally left it somewhere,\u201d a loss Wasserman Schultz said was reported to the Capitol Police. When the Capitol Police recovered the laptop, the agency wanted to search its contents.

aVWhite House Deputy Assistant To The President Sebastian Gorka seemed to suggest to the BBC that a military conflict with North Korea was a distinct possibility. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Gorka: 'Nonsensical' for Tillerson to discuss military matters\u000a\u000aWhite House aide Sebastian Gorka said Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was out of line with remarks he made a day earlier assuring Americans that military action against North Korea is not imminent, telling BBC radio that it was \u201cnonsensical\u201d for the nation\u2019s chief diplomat to speak on military issues.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,\u201d Gorka said in the interview, which was reported by The Washington Post. \u201cIt is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally\u2026That is his mandate. Secretary Tillerson is the chief diplomat of the United States, and it is his portfolio to handle those issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAboard his aircraft Wednesday en route to Guam, the U.S. territory in the Pacific that North Korea threatened this week to destroy with an \u201cenveloping fire,\u201d Tillerson told reporters that \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night\u201d and that \u201cI do not believe that there is any imminent threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe secretary\u2019s efforts to tamp down rhetoric came after a warning from President Donald Trump, who said North Korea would face \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if it continues to threaten the United States.\u000a\u000aContrary to what Tillerson said, Gorka seemed to suggest to the BBC that a military conflict with North Korea is a distinct possibility. Asked by an interviewer whether North Korea should expect an attack if its actions are understood as threatening, Gorka seemed to imply just that.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you threaten a nation, then what should you expect \u2014 a stiffly worded letter that would be sent by courier?\u201d he said. \u201cIs that what the U.K. would do if a nation threatened a nuclear-tipped missile launched against any of the United Kingdom\u2019s territories?\u201d\u000a\u000aState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined on Thursday to directly address Gorka's comments because she said she became aware of them only shortly before the daily news briefing and had not personally heard them.\u000a\u000aShe said that Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have a "good, close, cooperative relationship" and that the secretary of state had not spoken about U.S. military capabilities. But she also emphasized that Tillerson's words as secretary of state carry significant weight.\u000a\u000a"I think that everyone has clearly heard what Secretary Tillerson's forceful comments have been and continue to be on the issue of DPRK and on other countries as well," Nauert said, using an abbreviated version of North Korea's official name. "He's a cabinet secretary. He's the fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick."\u000a\u000aGorka, in an emailed statement sent Thursday via a White House spokesman, said media interpretations of his comments as undercutting Tillerson's remarks represented a "deliberate distortion of my comments and yet another example of fake news."\u000a\u000a"I was clearly stating that it is absurd for reporters to try to press the secretary of state to give answers on military issues," the statement said. "Secretary Tillerson\u2019s answers to such questions are always gracious and thoughtful \u2014 a reminder of why he has been so effective in his role as the president\u2019s top diplomat. There is no daylight between the president\u2019s diplomatic and military teams, and any suggestion otherwise is either misinformed or willfully misleading."\u000a\u000aSpeaking on Fox News Thursday afternoon, Gorka pushed back on the assertion that he said Tillerson was out of line, instead placing blame on journalists.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was admonishing the journalist of the fake news complex that are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they\u2019re demanding he make the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state,\u201d Gorka said.\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

He relayed an anecdote that he said came from a survivor of the Holocaust, who said the lesson he had learned from the ordeal was that \u201cwhen a group of people repeatedly says they want to kill you, sooner or later you should take them seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea has said they wish to annihilate the United States and use nuclear weapons.

aVWhile few have gone as far as Belarus, which named a park after Hugo Chávez, there\u2019s no shortage of left-leaning European politicians who backed the late Venezuelan leader and his successor, President Nicolás Maduro, whose grab for more power is becoming hard to defend.\u000a\u000aChávez\u2019s \u201cBolivarian revolution,\u201d which promised to combat inequality by nationalizing and redistributing Venezuela\u2019s oil, seduced many politicians in Latin America and Europe, especially in his first decade in power when, according to a 2009 study by the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, he cut the poverty rate by more than half.\u000a\u000aUnder President Maduro, Chávez\u2019s heir who succeeded him in 2013, Venezuela has slid further and further toward one-man rule. Protests erupted when the Supreme Court announced on March 29 that it was taking over the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. At the end of last month, Maduro managed to get a new Constituent Assembly elected, with powers to dissolve the National Assembly.\u000a\u000aA U.N. human rights agency said more than 5,000 people were arbitrarily detained between the beginning of April and the end of July. The death toll from the unrest is about 125, according to the Venezuelan attorney general\u2019s office.\u000a\u000aThe turmoil is largely linked to economic collapse, including high inflation and a shortage of staple foods, triggered by the decline in oil prices since 2014. Poverty levels have shot back up again, with one survey estimating that 80 percent of the population lives now in poverty.\u000a\u000aAlthough the European Union has unequivocally condemned Maduro\u2019s latest power grab \u2014 EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini this week urged him to suspend its implementation, voicing concern that it provides \u201can excuse to further drive conflict and use power unchecked\u201d \u2014 some leading voices in European public life still find it hard to shake off their admiration for the Bolivarian revolution:\u000a\u000aJeremy Corbyn\u000a\u000aThe British Labour leader is a long-standing Chavista who in 2013 described Chávez as \u201can inspiration to all of us fighting back against austerity and neoliberal economics in Europe.\u201d In 2014, he called to congratulate the new president, Maduro, live on Venezuelan TV, and was introduced by Maduro as a \u201cfriend of Venezuela.\u201d Asked this week whether he was prepared to condemn Maduro\u2019s actions, Corbyn said: \u201cWhat I condemn is the violence that\u2019s been done by any side, by all sides, in all this.\u201d He refused to express regret for his support for Maduro.\u000a\u000aAlexis Tsipras\u000a\u000aThe Greek prime minister and leader of the left-wing Syriza party was one of the few European politicians who attended Chávez\u2019s funeral. He once mentioned Venezuela as an anti-capitalist model and his aides say one of his heroes is Chávez, with whom he shares a birthday (July 28). According to a recent press report, as opposition leader, Tsipras sought cheap Venezuelan oil and diplomatic support in the case of a Greek exit from the eurozone. The report cites a former Venezuelan minister, who said Tsipras traveled to Moscow in July 2013 for a secret meeting with a Venezuelan official.\u000a\u000aPablo Iglesias\u000a\u000aPodemos, the left-wing Spanish anti-austerity movement led by Iglesias, has long been plagued by allegations of funding from Venezuela and Iran. Last year, the conservative daily ABC published documents allegedly showing that between 2008 and 2012, a think tank close to Podemos, the Centro de Estudios Políticos y Sociales (Ceps), received \u20ac7 million from the Venezuelan government. The donations were intended to forge \u201ccloser links between left-wing and anti-capitalist forces in Spain,\u201d the documents said. Iglesias rejected the accusations which, he said, \u201chave already been thrown out three times, twice by the supreme court and once by the district attorney.\u201d\u000a\u000aJean-Luc Mélenchon\u000a\u000aThe leader of far-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who has called a big demonstration against President Emmanuel Macron on September 23, makes no secret of his admiration for the Bolivarian revolution and its leaders. In 2013, after the death of Chávez, he wrote in the communist newspaper L\u2019Humanité that \u201cthe Bolivarian revolution is for us a source of inspiration.\u201d He then hailed Maduro\u2019s appointment as president in a tweet saying \u201cwe welcome Maduro\u2019s victory.\u201d However, Mélenchon said in a French radio interview in April, when questioned about his support for the government in Caracas: \u201cI don\u2019t support any dictatorship, I\u2019ve never supported any dictatorship anywhere in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aPope Francis\u000a\u000aThe Argentine-born pope has been a strong backer of the so-called progressive leaders in Latin America, like Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales, and his critics accuse him of ambiguity regarding the government in Venezuela. The Vatican has attempted to mediate between Maduro and the opposition but, at a news conference in April, the pope appeared to blame the opposition for the lack of progress, saying: \u201cPart of the opposition does not want this.\u201d Vatican analyst Sandro Magister wrote in May that the pope has been \u201cunforgivably reckless with Maduro and Chavism, in addition to being incomprehensibly reticent on the victims of the repression and on the aggression that is striking the Church itself.\u201d\u000a\u000a5Star Movement\u000a\u000aThe anti-establishment 5Star Movement, which currently ranks first in some opinion polls, resists categorization as left- or right-wing but stands accused of ambiguity over Venezuela. While it has asked the U.N. to investigate claims of fraud in the election of the Constituent Assembly, when a delegation of 5Star lawmakers visited Venezuela in March, one of them appeared to justify Maduro\u2019s policies by making a comparison with Italy, saying that at home too \u201cmany people live in bad conditions, there are many young jobless people.\u201d Alessandro Di Battista, who would very likely be the movement\u2019s foreign minister if it won power, said: \u201cBoth sides have made many mistakes.\u201d

Duncan Hunter\u2019s campaign treasurer as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations the California Republican used tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds for personal expenses, court documents show.\u000a\u000aFederal law-enforcement officials on Feb. 23 seized several computers, tablets and iPads, bills and disbursement records, as well as a computer hard drive, from Election CFO, an Alexandria, Virginia.-based company that handled the California Republican\u2019s campaign finances.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe raid was disclosed in a search and seizure warrant filed with the Eastern District of Virginia and signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Nachmanoff.\u000a\u000aHunter and his lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. The three-term lawmaker and his wife personally repaid more than $60,000 in charges after news reports suggested he used campaign funds to cover personal expenses, which would be in violation House rules and federal campaign law.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

While the records do not include the arguments the FBI made to obtain the warrant, investigators must show probable cause to raid private property.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department\u2019s probe of Hunter\u2019s finances was made public in late March after the House Ethics Committee announced it would delay its own investigation of Hunter\u2019s campaign finance practices because of the federal probe.\u000a\u000aCampaign records show Hunter spent tens of thousands of dollars of campaign funds on items that appear to be personal in nature from 2015 to 2016, including groceries, outdoor equipment, a visit to a nail salon, and dental services and hotels in Italy and Arizona.\u000a\u000aWhile Hunter later repaid nearly $60,000 to his campaign, the Office of Congressional Ethics last August recommended that the Ethics Committee begin a full-scale investigation. The Justice Department, however, asked the Ethics Committee to hold off while it continued its own probe.\u000a\u000aHunter's attorneys have argued in the past that any improper use of campaign funds was "inadvertent and unintentional."\u000a\u000a\u201cLast year, Congressman Hunter became aware of expenditure issues confronting his campaign committee. Out of an abundance of caution, he took corrective action in consultation with the [Federal Election Commission] and, ultimately, he and his wife personally repaid the campaign approximately $60,000," Hunter\u2019s lawyers, Elliot Berke and Gregory Vega, said in a late March statement when the Justice Department probe first came to light.\u000a\u000a"Congressman Hunter intends to cooperate fully with the government on this investigation, and maintains that to the extent any mistakes were made they were strictly inadvertent and unintentional.\u201d\u000a\u000aJason Torchinsky, the lawyer for Election CFO, confirmed the raid but said employees Marston and Hankins did not appear to be the subjects of the investigation and are fully cooperating with authorities.\u000a\u000a"Both have cooperated fully with all government inquiries related to the Committee," he said in a statement.

aVTwo years after Ireland introduced some of the strictest laws in the world on lobbying transparency, the reforms are being held up as the gold standard for policymakers looking to shine a light on the often murky world of influence peddling.\u000a\u000aCalls for transparency are growing louder across Europe, especially in Germany, where a series of scandals have put a spotlight on the car industry\u2019s close ties with senior politicians.\u000a\u000aIreland\u2019s experience, say proponents of the law, has dispelled worries that tough lobbying rules would cripple the industry or limit the ability of politicians to do their job \u2014 as MEPs in Brussels resisting similar obligations have argued.\u000a\u000a\u201cTransparency is catching hold,\u201d said Sherry Perreault, head of lobbying regulation at Ireland\u2019s Standards in Public Office Commission, who\u2019s traveled across Europe to showcase the Irish reforms. \u201cTo see this catching fire outside of Ireland is really terrific.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Irish reforms are simple. Any individual, company or NGO that seeks to directly or indirectly influence officials on a policy issue must list themselves on a public register and disclose any lobbying activity. The rules cover any meeting with high-level public officials, as well as letters, emails or tweets intended to influence policy.\u000a\u000aEight EU countries have mandatory registers for lobbyists \u2014 though none are as tight as Ireland\u2019s.\u000a\u000aFor those in the business, the impact of the register and its requirements are primarily about the way the industry is perceived \u2014 and, broadly, they\u2019re happy about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anybody suggest the Lobbying Act has impacted in any way the willingness or the ability to influence [policymakers],\u201d said Conall McDevitt, CEO of Hume Brophy, one of Ireland\u2019s largest lobbying firms. \u201cIt\u2019s always better in our industry to have transparency, we\u2019re all the stronger for it.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, the push for more transparency is often advocated by lobbyists themselves, eager for legal clarity and happy to present themselves as fulfilling a vital role in modern democracies through the information they provide to policymakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cLobbying has got a very bad name because of the actions of some individuals,\u201d said Cian Connaughton, president of the Public Relations Institute of Ireland. \u201cWhat the register has done is clarify to people what is happening, who is doing what.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt means people can\u2019t say, \u2018God knows what\u2019s going on there,'\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact that [the] new regime has hopefully increased people\u2019s trust in the system, it\u2019s a big plus.\u201d\u000a\u000aPopular revulsion\u000a\u000aThe tougher laws have their origins in the 2008 financial crisis that brought the Irish economy to its knees. The country\u2019s travails are widely regarded as a consequence of the close relationships between politicians from the Fianna Fáil party, in power at the time of the crisis, and Ireland\u2019s property developers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact that we had gone through this economic collapse [and that there was] a broadly held belief that influence had been peddled, there was such a ground swell of support for reform,\u201d said Brendan Howlin, currently leader of the Labour Party and minister for public expenditure and reform between 2011 and 2016.\u000a\u000aPopular revulsion at corruption had been building for decades. Several inquiries \u2014 including one into Ireland\u2019s planning system that found widespread corruption had taken place in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 had concluded that underhand payments had become endemic in the country.\u000a\u000aTo write what would become the 2015 Regulation of Lobbying Act, Howlin looked at existing rules across the world, including Canada\u2019s, whose government first introduced transparency requirements in 1989 and subsequently strengthened them four times.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much opposition to the concept,\u201d Howlin said.\u000a\u000aThe law uses one of the broadest possible definitions of a lobbyist: anyone who employs more than 10 individuals, works for an advocacy body, is a professional paid by a client to communicate on someone else\u2019s behalf or is communicating about land development is required to register themselves and the lobbying activities they carry out.\u000a\u000aThat means NGOs and other civil society organizations are just as much subject to the rules as groups representing multinationals or local industries.\u000a\u000aFailure to register or filing incorrect information can result in a fine of up to \u20ac2,500 and a two-year prison sentence.\u000a\u000aAs of this week, 1,649 organizations were signed up to the register. Collectively, they had filed 14,551 reports on lobbying activities since the law came into force.\u000a\u000aTrending in Europe\u000a\u000aAs corruption allegations continue to break across the EU, calls for similar action are becoming louder.\u000a\u000aEight EU countries have mandatory registers for lobbyists, according to Transparency International EU, an NGO that campaigns against corruption \u2014 though none is as tight as Ireland\u2019s. Lobbying legislation is under discussion in Spain, Italy and Germany, where lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party have recently proposed the introduction of transparency rules for lobbyists.\u000a\u000aIn France, a far-reaching law known as the Sapin Law is being rolled out, and in Brussels, European institutions will shortly begin discussions to upgrade the existing voluntary register, which as of August had 11,366 organizations signed up.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn all countries, associations are asking for regulation because it improves the way we work,\u201d said María Rosa Rotondo, managing partner of the Madrid-based lobbying firm Political Intelligence and president of the Public Affairs Community of Europe, a European network of lobbyists.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople should be able to know which special interests try to influence EU policy\u201d \u2014 Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans\u000a\u000aTo many, it\u2019s not the regulations but the lack of consistency across countries that\u2019s the problem. \u201cWe need coherence, a balanced approach,\u201d said Rotondo.\u000a\u000aFor example, Ireland\u2019s rules, which regulate the interaction between lobbyists and anyone defined as a \u201cdesignated public official\u201d without regard to where that interaction takes place, have caused a headache for firms lobbying Irish MEPs.\u000a\u000aSome registers, such as that currently in place for the European Parliament and European Commission, ask lobbyists to disclose how much money they\u2019re spending, while others don\u2019t. And in some countries, like the U.K., the definition of a lobbyist is so narrow that most individuals influencing public policy are not subject to transparency rules at all.\u000a\u000aFor officials pushing stricter rules, such as Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who wants to beef up the Brussels register, examples like Ireland provide helpful ammunition.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople should be able to know which special interests try to influence EU policy,\u201d he said.

aVAn Iranian woman looks at cartoons of U.S. President Donald Trump at an exhibition of the 2017 International Trumpism Cartoon and Caricature contest in Tehran, Iran | Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images Opinion How Trump\u2019s Iran threats could backfire \u2014 in North Korea Walking away from the deal with Tehran could leave us with a nuclear crisis on two fronts.\u000a\u000aIf, as he has clearly signaled, President Donald Trump chooses in the coming months to hold Iran in noncompliance of the nuclear accord, the impact will be felt in Tehran and the already volatile Middle East.\u000a\u000aBut the more serious casualty could be both more widespread and more distant\u2014thousands of miles away, on the Korean Peninsula. And the Trump administration needs to begin connecting the dots now.\u000a\u000aThe United States has few options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear challenge, and no good ones. A pre-emptive strike risks an unspeakable catastrophe. Sanctions have not worked, and tightening them further is no more likely to. Diplomatic talks will be difficult for the United States because an agreement would involve a compromise that would allow North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, if the goal is to prevent Pyongyang from developing an accurate nuclear-tipped ICBM, then negotiating with Pyongyang may well be the only way to try to defuse a looming crisis.\u000a\u000aEven under current conditions, such talks would be fraught, the odds tilted against success. But if the U.S. thrusts aside the nuclear deal with Iran\u2014and uses contrived evidence to do so\u2014the message to North Korea and others will be that America\u2019s word is disposable and the U.S. cannot be trusted to honor its commitments. This would deal a possibly fatal blow to any chance of a diplomatic effort to, if not halt or reverse, at a minimum slow down North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u000a\u000aIf anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aIndeed, walking away from the Iran deal, or contriving circumstances that force Iran to do so, would not only open up a now dormant nuclear crisis with Tehran, it would also close down perhaps the only option that might prevent a far more dangerous crisis with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea already harbors heightened suspicion and mistrust of Washington\u2019s motives, fearing that the U.S.\u2019 real objective is removal of the Kim regime and reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korean leadership. U.S. abandonment, without just cause, of the Iran deal would both validate and exacerbate those beliefs; to Pyongyang, the lesson would be that Washington saw diplomacy merely as a prelude to efforts to isolate, pressure and seek to remove the Iranian regime. Why would Kim Jong Un even begin negotiations if he is convinced that Washington would then look for excuses to unravel an agreement, should one be reached?\u000a\u000aThe message from Washington, of course, would not be heard in Pyongyang alone. The administration\u2019s too-clever-by-half strategy of messing around with the Iranian nuclear accord\u2014doing just enough to tempt Tehran to walk away from the deal after Trump publicly acknowledged that his goal is to undo it\u2014almost certainly would undermine its credibility with nations whose cooperation it desperately needs to deal with the North Korean nuclear challenge. The recent unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea demonstrates two things: first, that a unilateral U.S. approach is impracticable; and second, that China and Russia can be useful partners in pressing Pyongyang on its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. If anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aBut consider China\u2019s reaction should the U.S. treat the nuclear agreement with Iran in a slapdash, dismissive manner. Beijing might well be angered given its interests in buying Iran\u2019s oil and investing in its infrastructure. But it would be positively alarmed at the implications for North Korea, which presents China with a major security headache on its doorstep. China long has maintained that diplomacy with Pyongyang is the only viable answer to the North Korean nuclear problem, and it believes in the six-party format, which, not entirely unlike the seven-party format of the Iran negotiations, includes both China and the U.S. The precedent of the U.S. effectively dismissing an accord negotiated by a team of countries and ratified by the U.N. Security Council would give China considerable pause, raise serious questions in its mind about whether the U.S. can be trusted not to act similarly with North Korea, and make it virtually impossible for Beijing to vouch for Washington\u2019s good faith vis-à-vis Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility.\u000a\u000aAllies also might lose faith. Throughout the long-simmering nuclear crisis with North Korea, the Bush and Obama administrations managed to preserve solidarity with South Korea and Japan. Going forward, any sustainable solution to this crisis will require implementation of a joint U.S.-South Korea strategy backed by Japan. Moon Jae-In, South Korea\u2019s newly elected president, is a strong proponent of engagement with the North, and both Seoul and Tokyo are desperate to contain the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. It\u2019s hardly an exaggeration to suggest that both would be apoplectic if, by repudiating the nuclear accord with Iran, the U.S. effectively cut off the path to a diplomatic solution on the peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently offered the welcome suggestion that the U.S. is open to diplomacy and reassurance to Pyongyang that the U.S. is not intent on regime change. Surely, both he and others in the administration\u2014Generals James Mattis, H.R. McMaster and John Kelly in particular, all of whom reportedly lobbied for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear accord the last time around\u2014understand how hollow those words will ring if, the next time certification is in play, they fail to persuade the president. The least one can hope is that they will see the linkage, because it\u2019s a pretty good bet that this president won\u2019t. And it\u2019s just as good a bet that, by failing to peek just around the corner, he would be creating the prospect of a two-front nuclear crisis that America and the world can ill afford.\u000a\u000aAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aRichard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

aVThe 27th annual State of the Climate report has confirmed that 2016 topped 2015 as the warmest year in 137 years of record keeping. The report found that most indicators of climate change continued to follow trends of a warming world, and several, including land and ocean temperatures, sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere broke records set just one year prior. Last year\u2019s record heat resulted from the combined influence of long-term global warming and a strong El Nino early in the year.\u000a\u000aThis annual check-up for the planet, led by researchers from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, is based on contributions from more than 450 scientists from nearly 60 countries. It provides a detailed update on global climate indicators, notable weather events and other data collected from land, water and space. It\u2019s published as a special supplement to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\u000a\u000aNotable findings from the report include:\u000a\u000aGreenhouse gases were the highest on record. Major greenhouse gas concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide, rose to new record-high values in 2016. The 2016 average global CO2 concentration was 402.9 parts per million (ppm), an increase of 3.5 ppm compared with 2015 and the largest annual increase observed in the 58-year record.\u000a\u000aGlobal surface temperature was the highest on record. Aided in part by the strong El Nino early in the year, the 2016 combined global land and ocean surface temperature was record-high for a third consecutive year, according to four global analyses. The increase in temperature ranged from 0.81\u20131.01. degrees F (0.45°\u20130.56°C) above the 1981-2010 average.\u000a\u000aAverage sea surface temperature was the highest on record. According to four independent datasets analyzed, the record-breaking globally averaged sea surface temperature for 2016 was 0.65\u20130.74 degrees F (0.36\u20130.41 degrees C) higher than the 1981\u20132010 average and surpassed the previous mark set in 2015 by 0.02\u20130.05 degrees F (0.01\u20130.03 degrees C).\u000a\u000aGlobal upper-ocean heat content neared record high. Heat in the uppermost layer of the ocean, the top 2,300 feet (700 meters), saw a slight drop compared to the record high set in 2015. The findings are consistent with a continuing trend of warming oceans.\u000a\u000aGlobal sea level was the highest on record. The global average sea level rose to a new record high in 2016, and was about 3.25 inches (82 mm) higher than that observed in 1993, when satellite record-keeping for sea level began.\u000a\u000aArctic sea ice coverage was at or near record low. The maximum Arctic sea ice extent (coverage) reached in March 2016 tied last year as the smallest in the 37-year satellite data record, while the minimum sea ice extent in September tied 2007 as the second lowest on record.\u000a\u000aTropical cyclones were above-average overall. There were 93 named tropical cyclones across all ocean basins in 2016, above the 1981-2010 average of 82 storms. Three basins \u2013 the North Atlantic and Eastern and Western Pacific basins \u2013 experienced above-normal activity in 2016.\u000a\u000aFor more, see the full State of the Climate 2016 report, offsite linkhighlights and downloadable visuals.

aVAfter the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, the CIA appeared eager, even desperate, to embrace the version of events being offered by the FBI, the Secret Service and other parts of the government. The official story: that a delusional misfit and self-proclaimed Marxist named Lee Harvey Oswald killed the president in Dallas with his $21 mail-order rifle and there was no evidence of a conspiracy, foreign or domestic. Certainly, the CIA\u2019s leaders told the Warren Commission, the independent panel that investigated the murder, there was no evidence of a conspiracy that the spy agency could have foiled.\u000a\u000aBut thousands of pages of long-secret, assassination-related documentsreleased by the National Archives last week show that, within a few years of Kennedy\u2019s murder, some in the CIA began to worry internally that the official story was wrong\u2014an alarm the agency never sounded publicly.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, key CIA officials were concerned by the mid-1970s that the agency, the FBI, the Secret Service and the White House commission led by Chief Justice Earl Warren had never followed up on important clues about Oswald\u2019s contact with foreign agents, including diplomats and spies for the Communist governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union, who might have been aware of his plans to kill Kennedy and even encouraged the plot. (There is no credible evidence cited in the documents released so far that Cuban leader Fidel Castro or other foreign leaders had any personal role in ordering Kennedy\u2019s murder.)\u000a\u000aThe CIA documents also offer tantalizing speculation about the chain of events in late 1963 that explained Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy, which have previously never been established with certainty\u2014how he may have become enraged after reading a detailed article in his hometown newspaper in New Orleans in September suggesting that his hero Castro had been targeted for assassination by the Kennedy administration. According to that theory, Oswald, who had rifle training in the Marine Corps, then set out to seek vengeance on Castro\u2019s behalf\u2014to kill Kennedy before the American president managed to kill the Cuban leader.\u000a\u000aThat 27-page memo, which does not identify its author, is among the most intriguing of the documents in last week\u2019s batch unsealed by the National Archives.\u000a\u000aIf that proved true, it would have raised a terrible question for the CIA: Was it possible that JFK\u2019s assassination was, directly or indirectly, blowback for the spy agency\u2019s plots to kill Castro? It would eventually be acknowledged the CIA had, in fact, repeatedly tried to assassinate Castro, sometimes in collusion with the Mafia, throughout Kennedy\u2019s presidency. The CIA\u2019s arsenal of weapons against Castro included a fungus-infected scuba suit, a poison-filled hypodermic needle hidden in a pen\u2014and even an exploding cigar. The Warren Commission, never told about the CIA\u2019s Castro plots, mostly ducked the question of Oswald\u2019s motives, other than saying in its final report that he had expressed a \u201chatred for American society.\u201d\u000a\u000aJFK historians and the nation\u2019s large army of private assassination researchers are still scrambling to make sense of the latest batch of tens of thousands of pages of previously secret CIA and FBI documents that were unsealed last week by the National Archives. The documents\u2014441 files that had previously been withheld entirely, along with 3,369 other documents that had been previously released only in part\u2014were made public under terms of a 1992 law that requires the unsealing of all JFK assassination-related documents by October, the law\u2019s 25-year deadline.\u000a\u000aSince the release last week, researchers do not appear to have identified any single document that could be labeled a bombshell or that rewrites the history of the assassination in any significant way. Many of the documents, which were made public only online, are duplicates of files that had been released years earlier. Other documents are totally illegible or refer to CIA and FBI code names and pseudonyms that even experienced researchers will take months to decipher. Several documents are written in foreign languages.\u000a\u000aStill, the newly released documents may offer an intriguing glimpse of what comes next. The National Archives is required to unseal a final batch of about 3,100 never-before-seen JFK-assassination files by the October deadline, assuming the move is not blocked by President Donald Trump. Under the 1992 Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, the president is the only person empowered to stop the release. (Congressional and other government officials have told us in confidence that at least two federal agencies\u2014likely the CIA and FBI\u2014are expected to appeal to Trump to block the unsealing of at least some of the documents. Even after 54 years, some government officials apparently still want to keep secrets about this seminal event in U.S. history. The CIA and FBI acknowledged earlier this year they are conducting a final review of the documents, but have been unwilling to say if they will ask the president to block some from being released.)\u000a\u000aNone of the files released last week undermines the Warren Commission\u2019s finding that Oswald killed Kennedy with shots fired from his perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza\u2014a conclusion supported by 21st century forensic analysis\u2014and that there was no credible evidence of a second gunman.\u000a\u000aBut the new documents do revive the question of why the CIA, so skeptical internally of many of the commission\u2019s other findings by the 1970s, never acknowledged those suspicions to later government investigators\u2014or to the public. Documents released decades ago show that CIA and FBI officials repeatedly misled\u2014and often lied outright\u2014to Chief Justice Warren and his commission, probably to hide evidence of the agencies\u2019 bungling in their surveillance of Oswald before the president\u2019s murder. The CIA appears also to have been determined to block the commission from stumbling on to evidence that might reveal the agency\u2019s assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the CIA\u2019s in-house historian concluded that the spy agency had conducted a \u201cbenign cover-up\u201d during the Warren Commission\u2019s investigation in 1963 and 1964 in hopes of keeping the commission focused on \u201cwhat the Agency believed was the \u2018best truth\u2019 \u2014 that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut what if the \u201cbest truth\u201d was wrong? According to documents made public last week, the CIA was alarmed by the mid-1970s to realize that no one had properly followed up on clues about an especially mysterious chapter in Oswald\u2019s life\u2014a six-day, apparently self-financed trip to Mexico City beginning in late September 1963, two months before the assassination. The reason for the trip has never been determined with certainty, although he told his wife, Marina, that he went there to obtain a visa that would allow him to defect to Cuba, much as he had once attempted to defect to the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aThe CIA acknowledged long ago that the agency\u2019s Mexico City station had Oswald under surveillance during the trip, and that he met there with Cuban and Soviet diplomats and spies. The CIA station chief said later he was convinced that Oswald had a brief sexual relationship with a Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate. Although there is no credible evidence of Soviet involvement in the assassination, Oswald\u2019s other contacts in Mexico included\u2014shockingly enough\u2014a KGB assassinations expert who doubled as an accredited Soviet diplomat. A top-secret June 1964 FBI report, made public in the 1990s but apparently never seen by key investigators for the Warren Commission, suggests that Oswald was overheard threatening to kill Kennedy during his visits to the Cuban diplomatic compound in Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe files released last week also show that the CIA and other agencies failed to pursue clues that Oswald, who publicly championed Castro\u2019s revolution even while serving in the Marine Corps, had been in contact with Cuban diplomats years before the Mexico trip\u2014possibly as early as 1959, when he was deployed to a military base in Southern California. The information initially came to the FBI and the Warren Commission from a fellow Marine who recalled how Oswald boasted about his contacts with Cuban diplomats in Los Angeles, where Castro\u2019s government then had an office.\u000a\u000aThe account from the fellow Marine was of \u201ca lot more possible operational significance\u201d than was realized in the months after the assassination but was never \u201crun down or developed by investigation,\u201d according to a 1975 CIA internal memo released last week. \u201cThe record of the beginning of OSWALD\u2019s relationship with the Cubans starts with a question mark.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat 27-page memo, which does not identify its author, is among the most intriguing of the documents in last week\u2019s batch unsealed by the National Archives. Copies of the document were found inside larger CIA files released last week, including thick agency files labeled HELMS HEARING DUPLICATE. That seems to suggest the memo was given to former Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms, who led the agency from 1966 to 1973, when he was later summoned to testify secretly to Congress about his involvement in the CIA assassination plots against Castro and other foreign leaders. Similar documents about the Kennedy assassination and Oswald were written in the 1970s by a senior CIA counterintelligence official, Raymond Rocca, who had served as the agency\u2019s chief liaison to the Warren Commission.\u000a\u000aLabeled \u201cSECRET\u201d and stamped \u201cREPRODUCTION PROHIBITED\u201d on each page, the 1975 memo lists several important clues about Oswald that went unexplored in the months and years after Kennedy\u2019s death. (Versions of the same CIA memo were part of the flood of millions of pages of documents released after the 1992 law, although it has never attracted detailed attention outside a small circle of assassination researchers. Brian Latell, a respected former CIA analyst on Cuban intelligence, cited a version of the document in his 2012 book Castro\u2019s Secrets, which suggested much closer links between Oswald and Cuba than had previously been known.)\u000a\u000aThe 1975 document noted the failure of the CIA, FBI and the Warren Commission to interview a key witness in Mexico City\u2014Silvia Duran, the Mexican woman who worked in the Cuban consulate and was reported to have had the affair with Oswald. She is the \u201csole live witness on the record regarding Oswald\u2019s activities,\u201d yet her testimony \u201cwas taken and presented, solely, by the Mexican governmental authorities,\u201d the CIA memo said. Duran, who is still alive, has repeatedly insisted she had no sexual relationship with Oswald, although she readily acknowledges that she helped him with his unsuccessful visa application for Cuba.\u000a\u000aIt was that same CIA memo that offered a detailed theory of the chain of events that led Oswald to kill Kennedy\u2014how Oswald, who lived in his hometown of New Orleans for much of 1963, may have been inspired to assassinate the president if, as seemed probable, he read an article on Monday, September 9, in the local newspaper, that suggested Castro was targeted for murder by the United States.\u000a\u000aThe article, written by a reporter for The Associated Press in Havana and then published prominently in the Times-Picayune, was an account of an AP interview with Castro two days earlier, in which the Cuban strongman angrily warned the Kennedy administration that he was aware of U.S. assassination plots aimed at Cuban leaders, presumably including him, and was prepared to retaliate. The article quoted Castro as saying: \u201cU.S. leaders would be in danger if they helped in any attempt to do away with leaders of Cuba.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe CIA memo suggested that if Oswald, who was known to be an \u201cavid reader\u201d of the Times-Picayune, saw the article, it might have put the idea in his head to kill Kennedy as retaliation for the threat the United States posed to Castro\u2014an idea that would have been in his mind as he left for his trip to Mexico that month. The possibility that Oswald read the article \u201cmust be considered of great significance in light of the pathological evolution of Oswald\u2019s passive/aggressive makeup\u201d and \u201chis identification with Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution,\u201d the CIA memo said.\u000a\u000aImmediately after the assassination, the CIA\u2019s Mexico City station warned CIA headquarters that the AP article might contain a vital clue about Oswald\u2019s motives for killing Kennedy\u2014and even about possible Cuban involvement. But according to the 1975 analysis, \u201cThere is no evidence in the files on the Kennedy assassination that the Castro interview was considered in following up leads or in dealing with the Warren Commission, although Mexico Station specifically directed headquarters to the AP story very shortly after the Dallas killing.\u201d\u000a\u000aPreviously released internal documents from the Warren Commission show that one of the commission\u2019s most aggressive staff lawyers believed that Castro\u2019s remarks to the AP\u2014and the possibility that Oswald read the article\u2014might be of great significance in explaining Oswald\u2019s motives. But the internal files show that more senior staff members decided against any reference to the AP article in the commission\u2019s final report for fear of feeding conspiracy theories about a possible Cuban link to Kennedy\u2019s death. It does not reflect well on the legacy of either the CIA or the commission that, half a century after those gunshots rang out in Dealey Plaza, the newly released documents suggest that at least some of those conspiracy theories might be true.\u000a\u000aPhilip Shenon, a former Washington and foreign correspondent for the New York Times, is the author of A Cruel and Shocking Act: The Secret History of the Kennedy Assassination.\u000a\u000aLarry J.

aVAfter the full repeal of Obamacare stalled in the Senate last month, one of the sharpest and most-shared online rebukes of the Republican turncoats came from one unassuming woman who loves dogs, Texas and Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cTHESE 3 GOP Senators Just KILLED #RepealFirst Replace Later,\u201d wrote @ChristieC733, tagging the senators who stalled the push as well as the official accounts of the Republican National Committee and the Senate Republicans. Her tweet was shared hundreds of times within an hour, eclipsing many of the more famous pundits inside the Beltway.\u000a\u000aGiven her 238,000 followers\u2014100,000 more than Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s social media director, and more than three times as many as famed white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2014you might guess Christie is a prominent activist. But besides listing her membership in the National Rifle Association and ownership of a small business, Christie\u2019s profile offers little information about her offline life or any explanation for her impressive following.\u000a\u000aChristie\u2019s clout comes from her presence in some of the leading pro-Trump \u201crooms,\u201d private spaces on conservative Twitter that allow followers to coordinate messages and then retweet each other\u2014dramatically multiplying their impact. One of her fellow \u201cTwitter patriots,\u201d as they call themselves, tweeted and retweeted more than 4,100 times over a recent four-day period.\u000a\u000aTHESE 3 GOP Senators Just KILLED #RepealFirst Replace Later\u201d @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito \u2611\ufe0fhttps://t.co/G1EmSrujGm\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4BIpcK7ehg \u2014 ChristieC733 \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 (@ChristieC733) July 18, 2017\u000a\u000aThe pro-Trump rooms are an outgrowth of Twitter\u2019s group direct message function, which was introduced with little fanfare in January 2015, just as the presidential campaign was getting underway. At that time, Twitter was considered a decidedly liberal bastion. But the platform\u2014as well as its group direct message function\u2014proved to be especially useful for the type of populist outsider movement spurred by Trump, whose denunciations of elitist figures and institutions were easily conveyed in no more than 140 characters.\u000a\u000aIn the months surrounding Trump\u2019s surprise victory, mystery and conjecture shrouded his fiercely loyal social media network, a force that continues to lend a president who is highly unpopular by conventional polling metrics a unique kind of clout. Other political leaders fear his ability to shape the news cycle and flog his critics before millions of voters who may not receive news from any other source.\u000a\u000aMany dismissed their staggering output as inflated by automated \u201cbot\u201d accounts run by expert computer programmers, whether foreign agents or domestic trolls. But that may be an exaggerated theory: So many months after the election, tens of thousands of tweets per day continue to emanate from a very human, grass-roots organization.\u000a\u000aThe invite-only rooms have names like \u201cPatriots United\u201d and \u201cTrump Train,\u201d and many have accompanying hashtags to track members\u2019 tweets as they propagate.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy hypothesis was always that these accounts were organizing somewhere,\u201d said Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who monitored political activity on Twitter during the election and wrote about indications that pro-Trump users were working in coordination. He long suspected that bots alone could not account for Trump\u2019s social media dominance, but never identified a key mechanism unearthed in interviews with the Twitter patriots.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey were clearly organizing in some private space. It makes so much sense that it\u2019s within Twitter,\u201d Lotan said.\u000a\u000aBy design, the precise size and organization of the pro-Trump online network is difficult to discern. But POLITICO traced this corner of hard-right Twitter through interviews with Trump\u2019s most fervent online boosters\u2014a group that includes anonymous mothers in the Midwest, otherwise unremarkable Florida businessmen who amass thousands of followers through nonstop #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, and a younger cadre of meme provocateurs. As Trump\u2019s presidency barrels forward, this network continues to evolve and even splinter. But its infrastructure, largely invisible, remains a powerful tool for the administration and its supporters to broadcast their messages and help dictate media coverage.\u000a\u000a\u201cGreat to meet like-minded people,\u201d said Julie King Jackson, a Manhattan-based Trump supporter, when asked about the rooms.\u000a\u000aThe invite-only rooms have names like \u201cPatriots United\u201d and \u201cTrump Train,\u201d and many have accompanying hashtags to track members\u2019 tweets as they propagate. Each room can accommodate as many as 50 people.\u000a\u000aTheir private nature makes it impossible to know how many rooms formed in the run-up to November 8, or when they first cropped up. One member said she\u2019s contributed to rooms since winter 2015, and several others said they joined the fray before the state primaries began.\u000a\u000aMost people in the rooms are not native internet users. Many joined Twitter or dusted off dormant accounts just to stump for Trump. These novices were coached by more experienced compatriots on tending their feeds and cultivating followers. Those who spoke with POLITICO were virtually all older than 35 and predominantly female.\u000a\u000aSome might have joined rooms to discuss news and to vent about Hillary Clinton or the Democrats. But their primary purpose is to amplify and coordinate messaging.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe whole idea is to share tweets and retweet people in the group\u2019s tweets,\u201d explained Brian Fraser, a central node in the network who manages one of the \u201cPatriots United\u201d rooms. Since last summer, Fraser\u2019s following has increased dramatically, from 13,000 followers to nearly 170,000 today.\u000a\u000aAnother room manager told members that mutual retweeting is \u201cthe cardinal rule.\u201d\u000a\u000aA single room can quickly disseminate a given post to its members. But the real strength of the pro-Trump rooms is in their interconnectedness, since one user can be in multiple rooms simultaneously.\u000a\u000aEven the power of the #MAGA hashtag alone can\u2019t make every fawning Trump tweet get noticed.\u000a\u000aOne woman said she was in as many as 20 rooms at a time. Another said she contributed to two rooms as of November 8, and joined three more since Election Day. Even allowing for duplicates, that\u2019s hundreds of potential retweets with just a few clicks.\u000a\u000aMany experts were unaware of these rooms.\u000a\u000aLotan has researched the role of social media in politics and propaganda for years. He noted last September that Trump\u2019s followers were actively organizing to get particular hashtags trending.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey clearly had a sense for hubs in the network, the mechanics of attention and how information can propagate,\u201d said Lotan, who joined BuzzFeed as head of data science in December 2016.\u000a\u000aAlthough Lotan had never heard of anything like the rooms, he regularly observed \u201chighly organized networks of users who used the same term at the same time.\u201d\u000a\u000aScreenshots provided to POLITICO from inside one room illustrate how powerful a tool the pro-Trump rooms can be for this type of coordination and amplification.\u000a\u000aIn mid-May of this year, Debbie tweeted about Trump\u2019s patriotism.\u000a\u000aHe loves our Country & military and all the Veterans\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u27b0\U0001f499\u27b0\U0001f454\U0001f451\U0001f454 \u2014 \u2650Debbie\u2194Trump\u2650 (@debra_derienzo) May 19, 2017\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen he Salutes you\u2026He means it. I never seen a President as Patriotic as Donald J. Trump! We Love him! I stand with my President!\u201d she wrote alongside a photo of Trump saluting the band at his inauguration. At the time, around 5,500 people were following her account, which was started in August 2016. That number has since swelled to nearly 11,000.\u000a\u000aEven the power of the #MAGA hashtag alone can\u2019t make every fawning Trump tweet get noticed. But after Debbie copied the tweet into the \u201cTrumps WarRoom\u201d [sic] thread, which she managed at the time, the post was shared nearly a thousand times.\u000a\u000aTwo other tweets that Debbie shared via \u201cTrumps WarRoom\u201d garnered more than 400 and 200 retweets, respectively.\u000a\u000aAnother user known as Eagle Wings posted to \u201cTrumps WarRoom,\u201d the shared screenshots show. Like many Twitter patriots, her profile is bare on biographical details, indicating only that she\u2019s a retired Air Force veteran. Just before July 4, Eagle Wings tweeted about Trump\u2019s love for America.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith great respect Patriotism is being restored Celebrating 4th of July knowing we have a POTUS who loves America & fights for We The Ppl,\u201d she wrote to her tens of thousands of followers. Her post included a meme of Trump\u2019s face etched over the stars and stripes.\u000a\u000aLacking any Trump-specific hashtags, this tweet might have been doomed. But Eagle Wings is a heavy hitter in the rooms, according to other users, and she got results: This rather garbled post racked up more than 1,000 retweets by Independence Day.\u000a\u000aAnother member of the same room, @VoteTrumpPics, is explicit in using Twitter to coordinate Trump supporters\u2019 online messaging, often to match the president\u2019s own tweets. After Trump used the hashtag #FraudNewsCNN in early, @VoteTrumpPics tweeted an urgent order.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re changing it folks!\u201d the account wrote, directing that the network \u201cis to be referred to as #FraudNewsCNN. Effective immediately!\u201d The post was shared more than 2,500 times.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is clearly tapping into a group of people that are zealous, have a lot of time on their hands, and are tenacious as can be\u201d \u2014 Alan Rosenblatt\u000a\u000aThe rooms allow members to post, share and follow each other with machine-like efficiency and speed. On particularly prodigious days, it\u2019s common for a single user to tweet and retweet hundreds of times.\u000a\u000a\u201cI get called a Russian bot 50 times a day, it\u2019s so stupid,\u201d complained one woman in her late 40\u2019s.\u000a\u000aDr. Alan Rosenblatt, an expert in the history of online political campaigning, explained that the rooms are the latest iteration of people finding ways to leverage a small design feature like group messages for political advocacy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is clearly tapping into a group of people that are zealous, have a lot of time on their hands, and are tenacious as can be,\u201d said Rosenblatt, who is director for digital research at Lake Research Partners and senior vice president of digital strategy at Turner4D, both in Washington.\u000a\u000aThe room dwellers are true believers in the power of Twitter to promote politicians and their platforms. As one manager seeking to monetize his network of rooms sees it, he can offer candidates mass advertising and \u201cname recognition beyond anything other mediums can offer.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut there is a competing account of how the Twitter rooms benefit Trump.\u000a\u000aMicrochip, a Twitter user who uses several different accounts and is routinely banned from the site, told POLITICO the pro-Trump rooms help him spread racist and otherwise controversial material. His dual aims are to prod the left and entice the media into covering the latest online controversy he helped stoke.\u000a\u000aMicrochip said he started several rooms in November 2015. A handful of people in other rooms confirmed that he was an \u201cearly player.\u201d But he has been blocked from many rooms because of his \u201cwild claims,\u201d one said, as well as anti-Semitic and inflammatory remarks.\u000a\u000aIn April, Microchip told BuzzFeed about his skill at gaming Twitter algorithms using a combination of automated bot accounts and \u201cretweet groups\u201d of like-minded users, most of them younger people with ties to 4chan and other platforms, he explained.\u000a\u000aIn subsequent interviews with POLITICO, Microchip detailed how this was just the first step. After \u201cseeding\u201d a given hashtag with bots and his internal network, he ports messages and memes over to other nodes within the broader pro-Trump network of rooms, which is primarily populated by boomers.\u000a\u000a\u201cBots don\u2019t really count toward hashtag boosting that well, raw tweets do,\u201d he said. To accomplish his goals, then, Microchip needs individuals to consistently share the material he\u2019s pushing.\u000a\u000aBut Microchip, who described himself as an \u201catheist liberal that just hates immigration\u201d and transgender people, has open contempt for most of Trump\u2019s base.\u000a\u000a\u201cConservatives are generally morons,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like herding cats.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s just as frank about what he\u2019s peddling to Trump supporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know how I know they\u2019re spreading lies?\u201d Microchip asked one die-hard this week. \u201cBecause I do the same thing, it\u2019s fake news and spin.\u201d\u000a\u000aChaos is Microchip\u2019s metric of success, not voter turnout. His rooms put out a mix of outright vile and what he calls \u201cboomer approved\u201d messages without the gross-out element.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of this is contrived to force outrage and trigger new MSM journos to cover shit because they buy the meme,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have already figured this out and stopped covering us.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether their aim is earnest advocacy or to foment backlash, the rooms are now an entrenched part of conservative Twitter.\u000a\u000aMicrochip and his crew were giddy at hearing President Trump\u2019s declaration that the military would no longer accept transgender soldiers. In between mulling ideas for inflammatory messaging, Microchip marveled that Trump \u201cis going to force the Left to remain drenched in identity politics through 2018.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Left still hasn\u2019t learned to ignore this trigger game,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aLike the \u201cnormies,\u201d as he calls Trump supporters in the mainstream rooms, Microchip fears concentrated government power and shares frustration with leftward shifts he saw under Obama. But he sees the network of rooms as a vehicle to spread right-wing content that triggers \u201cextreme\u201d response from liberals, and Trump himself as but \u201ca tool in this purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe hopes extreme actions from either end of the political spectrum will scare more people to the center.\u000a\u000aMicrochip said it would be impossible to corroborate many of his grandiose claims because of the extent to which he covers his tracks.\u000a\u000aLotan said Microchip\u2019s claims explain the link between the boomer generation in the mainstream rooms and the younger meme producers on 4chan and reddit.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe boomers are there, thirsty for ammunition. And 4chan is so good at generating ammunition,\u201d Lotan said. \u201cBut the boomers will not go to 4chan.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople in the mainstream pro-Trump rooms said Microchip had not been active there for many months. In turn, Microchip said he maintains pseudonymous accounts to hide his identity from \u201cbrain dead\u201d Trump supporters.\u000a\u000aWhether their aim is earnest advocacy or to foment backlash, the rooms are now an entrenched part of conservative Twitter. New offshoots continue to spawn, additional members join daily, and their overseers are weighing next steps.\u000a\u000aEver volatile, Microchip suggested last week that he might shift his attention away from using the rooms, although he was characteristically cryptic.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m dumping most groups, turning inward,\u201d he tweeted after decrying everything from globalism to the New Right in a missive comprised of hundreds of tweets.\u000a\u000aThe mainstream rooms, meanwhile, are scrambling to anoint sufficiently pro-Trump candidates nationwide while taking aim at the president\u2019s detractors, particularly moderate Republicans. When Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who is up for reelection in 2018, blasted Trump online last week, suggesting the GOP was in denial about the president\u2019s flaws and shortcomings, heavy hitters made their intentions clear.\u000a\u000aTweeted one \u201cTwitter patriot\u201d about Flake: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know he now has ALL of #TrumpsArmy #TrumpTrain #TrumpNation who will work for opposing candidates!\u201d\u000a\u000aShawn Musgrave writes about social media and politics for POLITICO.

aV\u000a\u000aThe deputy assistant to President Trump, Sebastian Gorka, appears at the Conservative Political Action Conference. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aUpdate: Gorka is now saying his comments have been misconstrued and that he was merely saying the media shouldn't ask Tillerson questions about military matters. "I said for reporters to force our chief diplomat -- the amazing Rex Tillerson -- to give details of military options is nonsensical. He is the secretary of state. ... I was admonishing the journalist of the fake news-industrial complex ... who are demanding that he make the military case for action."\u000a\u000aFor those worried that President Trump might get into nuclear war with North Korea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson provided some solace Wednesday. \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night,\u201d Tillerson said, tempering Trump's promise to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea if it continued to threaten the United States. Tillerson emphasized that no conflict was imminent.\u000a\u000aBut now another Trump administration voice is suggesting that we shouldn't pay Tillerson much mind.\u000a\u000aSebastian Gorka appeared on BBC radio Thursday and delivered one of the most aggressive takes to date on what Trump might do \u2014 even allowing that a mere threat from North Korea could be construed as an act of war, as Trump seemed to do earlier this week. In doing so, Gorka played down Tillerson's role in all of this.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou should listen to the president; the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,\u201d Gorka said in a recording shared with The Washington Post. \u201cIt is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally. He said, \u2018Woe betide anyone who militarily challenges the United States,\u2019 and that is his portfolio. That is his mandate. Secretary Tillerson is the chief diplomat of the United States, and it is his portfolio to handle those issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe suggestion seems to be that Tillerson was out of his element when he provided those assurances Wednesday \u2014 that Tillerson wouldn't even know how imminent such a conflict might be because it's not in his purview.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post revealed that U.S. analysts think North Korea has produced a nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles. Worried about what that means? Here are four things you need to know. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aAnd that's a striking message from another member of the White House team. For a president who has publicly undermined his own attorney general and whose communications director railed against his two top White House aides in an interview two weeks ago, it looks like more backbiting and internal discord.\u000a\u000aTrump on Tuesday seemed to be setting the red line for North Korea at any kind of threat \u2014 which Pyongyang, of course, makes often and would do again, soon after Trump's comments, by threatening Guam. \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey will be met with the fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d\u000a\u000aTillerson seemed to scale back that red line Wednesday. But Gorka's comments provide yet more conflicting information from the White House about precisely where that red line lies. Gorka seems to be saying it's right back to where Trump suggested it was \u2014 or at least that Trump reserved the right to consider mere threats to be acts of war.\u000a\u000aThe interviewer pressed him on that point:\u000a\u000aQ: But are you telling me though, Mr. Gorka, that if there is an action by North Korea that is felt by the United States to be threatening, then that is war? Is that the understanding that the North Koreans should have? GORKA: If you threaten a nation, then what should you expect \u2014 a stiffly worded letter that would be sent by courier? Is that what the U.K. would do if a nation threatened a nuclear-tipped missile launched against any of the United Kingdom\u2019s territories?\u000a\u000aThat's very different from what Tillerson said.\u000a\u000aThe Fix's Aaron Blake looks at how President Trump's threats to North Korea contrast with the milder tone of his Cabinet secretaries. (Jenny Starrs,Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aAs I wrote Wednesday morning, we may be witnessing a little \u201cGood Cop, Bad Cop\u201d here, with the administration providing different signals to keep North Korea guessing. It's the \u201cMadman theory\u201d that says you want your enemies to think you're capable of anything.\u000a\u000aBut this also seems to fit into a pattern of the White House not really having its story straight and figuring things out on the fly \u2014 which would be a perilous strategy given the stakes of the North Korea situation. And it also fits into a long-running pattern of White House officials undermining one another, both privately and publicly. Having members of your staff undercut your own secretary of state doesn't seem like a great way to do business.\u000a\u000a(h/t Adam Taylor)

aVPresident Donald Trump has dismissed man-made climate change, and EPA chief Scott Pruitt plans to launch a debate about the science. | Getty Insiders don't expect White House interference with climate report\u000a\u000aSeveral sources involved in producing a government climate change report due out soon say they have seen no indication that the White House might suppress the scientific research that offers the clearest indication yet that human activity is altering the planet's temperature.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times reported Monday evening that it had received a copy of the latest draft of the report, and that scientists involved with it said they were worried the Trump administration could change or suppress the findings.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Climate Science Special Report, a part of the National Climate Assessment, was written by scientists at 13 federal agencies. Each of those agencies must sign off on the final version by August 18.\u000a\u000aTwo federal climate program leaders and several report contributors said they don\u2019t expect the Trump administration to stall a scheduled late-November deadline or try to make revisions. Some said the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which coordinates the project, is already preparing a website to showcase the report.

The report finds it \u201cextremely likely\u201d that more than half of the average global temperature increase since 1951 is linked to human activity.\u000a\u000aHayhoe said the report also says that there\u2019s no alternative, credible explanations for why temperatures would have climbed. But the report, which compiled feedback from the National Academy of Sciences as well as a public comment period, does not make policy recommendations. It contains "ultra-cautious," peer-reviewed scientific conclusions, she said.\u000a\u000aThe White House could still accept, reject or request changes to the report, Hayhoe said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe currently have no indication which of those three they are going to choose,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cWe believe we\u2019re on target, we\u2019re on the [same] time frame at this point.

aVU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson | Mohd Rasfan/AFP via Getty Images Tillerson: US will respond to Russia\u2019s move to expel diplomats by September 1 Moscow responded to congressional sanctions by turfing out 755 American embassy and consulate staff.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government will respond by the end of this month to the Russian government\u2019s decision to reduce the number of American diplomatic staff in Russia by more than 700, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday morning, according to an Associated Press report.\u000a\u000aTillerson\u2019s promise of a U.S. response followed his Sunday meeting in the Philippines with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, where the secretary of state said he asked his Russian counterpart \u201cseveral clarifying questions.\u201d The U.S. has yet to decide on what retaliatory steps it would take, Tillerson said, only that those steps would be taken by September 1.\u000a\u000aRussia\u2019s move to order a 755-person reduction of U.S. embassy and consulate staff was itself a retaliatory step, retribution for sanctions legislation passed last month by Congress that targets the Russian government, along with the governments of Iran and North Korea. President Donald Trump, accused by critics of being too cozy with Russia, signed the bill last week despite what he described in a signing statement as the bill\u2019s Constitutional flaws.\u000a\u000aTillerson also told reporters that the Russian delegation had shown \u201csome willingness\u201d during their Sunday meeting to begin discussions on ending the ongoing violence in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia\u2019s military has been active since a 2014 revolution that removed pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych.\u000a\u000aThe secretary of state said the U.S. has been purposefully deliberate in its negotiations regarding Ukraine, ensuring that no party feels cut out of the process.\u000a\u000aDeep differences between the U.S. and Russia remain, Tillerson said, although he added that the two nations still have important security issues to discuss. Russia and the U.S. should not \u201cjust cut everything off on one single issue\u201d like Ukraine, Tillerson said.

aVScotland's Brexit Minister Michael Russell | Andy Buchanan/AFP via Getty Images Scottish ministers call for return of powers from EU, changes to Repeal Bill Ahead of a meeting Wednesday, Scottish Brexit Minister Michael Russell called on UK government to abandon its \u2018attempted power grab.\u2019\u000a\u000aScottish ministers will call for increased powers during talks in Edinburgh on Wednesday, after again threatening to ax the U.K. government\u2019s Repeal Bill, local media reported.\u000a\u000aU.K. First Secretary of State Damian Green and Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell are set to meet with Scottish Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Scotland\u2019s Brexit minister, Michael Russell, to discuss what powers Holyrood will gain after Brexit.\u000a\u000aThe British government\u2019s plan to convert the vast majority of EU law and regulation into English law \u2014 known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, or Repeal Bill \u2014 was met with intense criticism from the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales when it was presented in July.\u000a\u000aNicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the Repeal Bill was \u201ca naked power-grab\u201d that returned EU powers to Westminster instead of sharing them with Scotland and Wales.\u000a\u000aIn a statement prior to Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Russell reiterated that both the Scottish and Welsh governments would withhold consent to the Repeal Bill in its current form and said he would make clear that changes must be made to protect devolution.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe bill \u2014 as it currently stands \u2014 means that Westminster would take exclusive control over significant areas of devolved policy, such as support for Scotland\u2019s farmers and food producers and many aspects of environmental protection and control of our seas,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know that the U.K. government has its eye on more than 100 policy areas. That is a direct threat to the devolution settlement which the people of Scotland overwhelmingly voted for in 1997.\u201d\u000a\u000aRussell added that Holyrood is not opposed in principle to U.K.-wide frameworks in certain areas, but that must be \u201con the basis of agreement among equals, not imposed by Westminster.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen, the U.K. first secretary of state, said the meeting showed the government\u2019s \u201ccommitment to progressing discussions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn some areas there will need to be a common approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be other areas where I intend that the Scottish and U.K. governments can make progress in identifying policy areas that could be released to Holyrood under the new legislative arrangements.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe expect there will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration and we want to address this in a way which delivers certainty and continuity for people and businesses across the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the June 2016 Brexit vote, Scotland overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU. In an open letter in July, over 60 prominent figures from Scottish civil society urged the U.K. to reverse course on Brexit altogether.

aVBERLIN \u2014 Before she fled her home country of Lebanon, Eliana could only find work as an escort. As a trans woman, she faced the constant threat of arrest and torture at Beirut\u2019s notorious Hbeish prison.\u000a\u000aIn Germany, where she applied for asylum in October 2015, Eliana worked at a beauty salon, went to German language classes and wore what she wanted. For the most part, she felt accepted.\u000a\u000aThat feeling of security was shattered earlier this year, when she received a deportation letter from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, known locally by its German acronym, BaMF.\u000a\u000aThe office had rejected her application for asylum on the grounds that Eliana crossed the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece as a man and therefore could not be considered trans, despite reports that women regularly suffer sexual abuse on migrant routes to Europe.\u000a\u000aFor Eliana, who still bears the traces of violence inflicted by family members and acquaintances on her body, the deportation order was a shock. \u201cIt was humiliating,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I had been planning and working on fell apart.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn her Berlin apartment, Eliana rolls down a sock to show me the places where her skin is still stained deep purple. In 2012, Eliana\u2019s brother found out she was trans and gay, and working as an escort. On the first day of Ramadan, he sent his friends to find her. They beat her in the street.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are sending people back for reasons that don\u2019t reflect the reality in their home country\u201d \u2014 Knud Wechterstein, founder of Rainbow Refugees\u000a\u000aScrolling through images she took of her injuries, she shows me an image of her foot, ripped open to reveal slashes of raw flesh. Her ribs and hips still cause her pain, she says.\u000a\u000aSalma Arzouni, a friend who works at Gladt, an organization that supports LGBT asylum seekers, was also surprised by the letter. \u201cHer case was very strong so we didn\u2019t expect this decision at all,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aEliana is one of many LGBT asylum seekers in Germany who have received deportation orders telling them to return to countries considered \u201csafe\u201d by the German government \u2014 but where their lives are still at risk.\u000a\u000aThere are no statistics for the number of LGBT asylum seekers who have received deportation orders, but rights groups report that up to 50 percent of their clients\u2019 applications have been rejected.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s decision-making process does not take into account the specific dangers LGBT people face in their home countries, says Knud Wechterstein, founder of Rainbow Refugees in Frankfurt.\u000a\u000a\u201cBaMF are making a lot of wrong decisions,\u201d he says, leafing through a large binder of letters that explain why his clients \u2014 who come from Iraq, Pakistan, Serbia and Iran \u2014 were refused the right to stay in Germany. A large part of his work involves helping LGBT asylum seekers appeal their deportation orders.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are sending people back for reasons that don\u2019t reflect the reality in their home country.\u201d\u000a\u000aA BaMF spokesperson says the ministry reviews each case individually, considering refugee protection \u201cif the asylum seeker can credibly show that they would be in danger because of their sexual orientation in their country of origin.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsylum applications made by Lebanese nationals, for example, are rarely accepted. According to BaMF statistics, in the first half of 2017, under 12 percent of asylum seekers from Lebanon received positive replies. But members of Lebanon\u2019s LGBT community do not feel safe in their country. A 2017 report by Beirut-based equal rights organization Proud Lebanon details incidents of public and police violence, including arrest, torture and prosecutions on the grounds of sexual orientation.\u000a\u000aOfficially, Germany only considers a handful of countries \u2014 EU member countries, the western Balkans, Ghana and Senegal \u2014 as safe. Unofficially, authorities decline to grant asylum to migrants from many other countries, say lawyers and rights groups. And for asylum seekers from Morocco, Pakistan, Russia and Tunisia who are gay or trans, the working assumption that their country is \u201csafe\u201d does not match their own experience of institutional or violent persecution. In Tunisia, for example, same-sex relations are punished by up to three years in prison.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we see is that LGBT people who don\u2019t come from Syria usually have a lot of difficulties,\u201d says Sabrina Latz, project manager at the Queer Refugees Network based in the east German city of Leipzig. In 2017 so far, over 93 percent of Syrian applicants have been granted asylum, compared to 58 percent of Iraqis and 8 percent of Russians.\u000a\u000aWhen the ministry made a U-turn on an asylum case earlier this year, it became clear to Latz that not all BaMF decisions stand up to public scrutiny.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Lebanon, animals have more rights than trans women\u201d \u2014 Eliana, a trans woman seeking asylum in Germany\u000a\u000aA 29-year-old gay man from Tunisia, who had been forced by police to undergo an anal test \u2014 a practice condemned by the U.N. Committee Against Torture but still used in Tunisia to determine whether a man is gay \u2014 was rejected for asylum in Germany in January. The Queer Refugees Network \u2013 which had supported the man\u2019s case \u2014 made the decision public and drummed up support on social media, prompting BaMF to reopen the case. A month later, it reversed its decision and granted the applicant refugee status.\u000a\u000aThe victory was a rare exception, Latz says, adding that it was not easy to get BaMF to change its mind without consistent public pressure even if the decisions were in large part \u201cnot fair\u201d or \u201chumane.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a recent case, BaMF officials rejected an Iraqi man\u2019s application on the grounds that he is married to a woman and has three children, and that he could therefore not be considered as gay.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe asylum process needs BaMF to be more sensitive towards the topic of LGBTI persecution and the situation inside different countries,\u201d Latz says. \u201cMany of our clients are married because they are not able to live openly as gay men in their home countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to Frankfurt-based migration lawyer Jonathan Leuschner, the gist of German authorities\u2019 argument is often that people are unlikely to face serious persecution in their home countries if they keep their sexual orientation to themselves.\u000a\u000a\u201cYet the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that any such argument poses an infringement on one\u2019s right to the free development of personality,\u201d Leuschner says.\u000a\u000a\u201cI recently received a rejection for an LGBTI applicant from Jamaica \u2014 a country where homosexuality is punished with up to 10 years in jail \u2014 that argued Jamaica does not criminalize homosexuality \u2018as such,\u2019 but \u2018only\u2019 for sexual intercourse and physical intimacy between men,\u201d Leuschner says. \u201cIt is beyond me how one would sustain this differentiation.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aWhile BaMF rejected Eliana\u2019s case on the basis that Lebanon is \u201csafe\u201d for her, she is dreading her return to a country where she has to live in fear.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Lebanon, animals have more rights than trans women,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aEliana chose not to appeal her deportation decision, a process that can take years. \u201cI\u2019ve already lost two years of my life, I can\u2019t wait two more,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aHer friends tried to persuade her to stay, but the deportation order changed her perception of German hospitality. \u201cI would rather live on the street than be humiliated here.\u201d\u000a\u000aMorgan Meaker is a freelance human rights journalist covering minorities in Europe and the Middle East.

aVVolkswagen fraudulently secured \u20ac400 million in loans from the European Investment Bank to develop the engine at the heart of the Dieselgate scandal, according to officials at the EU anti-fraud watchdog OLAF.\u000a\u000aThe results of the fraud probe are another blow to the reputation of the German car industry, following the Dieselgate revelations in 2015 and reports in the last few weeks that the big five players in the sector colluded secretly to thwart competition. Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the car companies Sunday they had \u201ca damned responsibility to rebuild trust and fix mistakes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe OLAF investigation, concluded in the past few days, delved back into Dieselgate, when VW fitted engines with so-called defeat devices, or software that enabled diesel cars to perform far better in emissions tests in a laboratory than in real driving conditions. VW admitted that 11 million cars had installed the illegal software, enabling them to spew out more poisonous nitrogen oxides (NOx) than tests suggested they would.\u000a\u000aOLAF officials said they opened a case in November 2015 to look into financing granted to VW in 2009 by the EIB, the EU mega-bank largely dedicated to infrastructure and development projects. The loan was supposed to help the world\u2019s biggest carmaker develop an engine that would comply with increasingly stringent emissions rules in the EU and the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe EU investigators concluded, however, that VW secured the loan by \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeception.\u201d\u000a\u000aOLAF\u2019s chief complaint was that the money was channeled toward VW\u2019s EA 189 diesel engine, although senior company employees knew that this model would only meet its emissions targets by using a defeat device. The EU investigators argued that VW failed to disclose this to the lender, and added that the EIB would not have granted the loan if it been fully briefed, according to officials familiar with the probe.\u000a\u000aThe EU investigators did not find, however, that EIB money had been used directly for creating defeat devices \u2014 which had been a subject of press speculation in the past 18 months.\u000a\u000aRecommendation to prosecutors\u000a\u000aOLAF itself cannot take judicial action. Instead, it has sent recommendations to public prosecutors in Braunschweig, who are leading criminal inquiries into VW, asking them to take its findings into consideration.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for the EU watchdog added it had also told the EIB to take \u201cactive steps\u201d in implementing its anti-fraud policy.\u000a\u000aIt did not, however, recommend that any money should be clawed back from VW, because the carmaker had already paid back the loan in 2014, the spokesperson added.\u000a\u000aBraunschweig prosecutors\u2019 office did not respond to requests for comment. The EIB said it was weighing up OLAF\u2019s conclusions \u201cto determine more precise appropriate action.\u201d\u000a\u000aVW did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThe EU watchdog\u2019s case centered on two senior employees, Richard Dorenkamp and Thorsten Duersterdiek, according to the officials briefed on the case.\u000a\u000aThe investigation found that the two men were aware that shortcomings of the EA 189 engine meant that they would need to cheat to meet emissions targets. This information was withheld from the EIB in applying for the loan, and for the whole duration of the financing.\u000a\u000aBefore granting the loan, the EIB specifically requested information from VW about the environmental impact of the project to be funded, and received an email stating how the projects \u201cwere components of VW aspiration to become the most innovative mass car manufacturers with an emphasis on further reduction of emissions and fuel consumption.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn February 2011, once the EIB-funded project was completed, VW even sent material to the lender boasting of how successful it had been in slashing emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe main result, to produce fuel efficient and reliable vehicles as well as complying with new EU legislation to reduce car emissions, has been fulfilled. Therefore, the project was consistent with the Bank\u2019s policy on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe project has been implemented according to the technical description. The results are very satisfactory with carbon dioxide emissions reduction of up to 20 percent, NOx emissions reductions of up to 30 percent and particle emissions reduction superior to 90 percent for the diesel engines,\u201d VW was quoted as saying in the EIB project completion report of December 2011.

aVAfter a fleeting spring romance with Beijing, President Donald Trump now seems eager to make good on his pledge to \u201cget China to stop ripping us off.\u201d The administration reportedly is planning to launch an investigation into China\u2019s intellectual property and trade practices. The move follows weeks of White House efforts to pressure Beijing to reduce steel production and to threaten to restrict U.S. imports of Chinese steel.\u000a\u000aThe administration\u2019s tougher line is a welcome shift \u2014 as even Senate Democrats acknowledged\u2014but bringing China\u2019s economic abuses to heel will take a far more comprehensive and creative strategy than either party has yet offered. The real problem is that our strategy is too limited \u2014 too beholden to outdated \u201ctrade\u201d concepts that do not contemplate the kind of challenges China poses today. It needs rethinking for a world where our largest competitors blur the lines between state and market. Our current trade paradigm was purpose-built to dismantle tariffs, a goal it largely accomplished by the early 2000\u2019s. We now need a paradigm that does the same for the host of anti-competitive policies that China and other countries have long pursued at our expense: currency manipulation; state-owned enterprises; indigenous innovation and forced localization requirements; mercantilist financial incentive packages and tax policies; and a slew of protectionist domestic rules and regulations.\u000a\u000aCurrent U.S. efforts target specific abuses \u2014 intellectual property theft, for example, or steel dumping. But China has employed a range of strategies to advantage its firms; some of these are susceptible to traditional trade enforcement tools. But many are not. What\u2019s needed is a strategy to begin challenging the very foundations of China\u2019s state capitalist economic model and its industrial policies. If we get this right, it could win bipartisan support \u2014 finally allowing a way to tackle China as both an economic challenge and a geopolitical one.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s what this would entail.\u000a\u000aFirst is a shift to a general principle of reciprocity. For too long, the U.S. has remained open to Chinese exports and investment, even as China imports little from the U.S. and severely restricts U.S. investment. Whereas the U.S. broadly allows Chinese investment, China evaluates all foreign investment on a case-by-case basis, and lists some 328 items that remain either heavily restricted or closed entirely to foreign investors (including golf courses, Mr. President). The multilateral trading system, enshrined in the WTO, is built on the notion of reciprocity \u2014 and allowing China a pass has served neither the system, nor the United States well.\u000a\u000aSecond, reciprocity should not merely pave the way for increased U.S. investment in China, but should ensure that U.S. and Chinese companies are competing on fair footing around the world. That means focusing less on a strict, \u2018tit-for-tat\u2019 version of reciprocity and more on leveraging U.S. market access to address the kitchen sink of Chinese industrial policies \u2014 everything from protectionist technical standards, to mandatory joint venture requirements for foreign firms, to generous state-financing for domestic \u2018national champion firms\u2019 that shelter Chinese firms from competition at home and arm them with unfair advantages abroad. Increasingly, they are going abroad.\u000a\u000aThird is a willingness to dust off old tools and invent new ones. Longstanding measures like Section 301 should be used to restrict Chinese investment in U.S. markets \u2014 especially high-technology areas prized by Beijing, until China begins dismantling its subsidies. The search for new tools must go beyond trade to areas like antitrust and even aspects of criminal law. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, for example, restricts U.S. firms from giving foreign governments things of value in exchange for commercial gain. Might there be a rationale for prohibiting U.S. firms from caving to Beijing\u2019s demands for technology transfer on this same principle?\u000a\u000aFourth, any serious challenge to China\u2019s state capitalist system and its industrial policy must win support from U.S. industry. Most U.S. firms fall into two camps: those already inside China, and those still hoping to find a foothold. But both camps remain too intimidated by Beijing to endorse a tougher line from Washington, their private complaints and pleadings to \u201cdo something\u201d notwithstanding.\u000a\u000aFor many U.S. firms, the primary threat is no longer getting shut out of China\u2014it is getting acquired by a Chinese firm. Chinese investment in the U.S. is up some four-fold since 2014. Given the rise of activist shareholders pressuring U.S. firms to sell to the highest bidder, it is hardly clear these companies can shield themselves from Chinese acquisition. After all, these activist shareholders, which frequently are hedge funds, care little that a Chinese high bid may be playing with sovereign cash; only that the bid is high. A meaningful fix would require reforms to U.S. securities law to curb the influence of activist shareholders, as well as new public investment to rejuvenate U.S. industries like semiconductors, which are targets of Chinese government acquisition efforts.\u000a\u000aFinally, this tougher approach to China should be a priority in its own right, not simply a ploy to compel Chinese cooperation against North Korea. There is reason to doubt how serious Trump really is about addressing Chinese economic abuses \u2014 in April, he tweeted \u201ca trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for [China] if they solve the North Korean problem!\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on \u2026 North Kore[a]?\u201d\u000a\u000aI raise this concern as someone who has sought for longer than a decade to get U.S. foreign policy to rely more on its economic \u2014 rather than military \u2014 might to solve geopolitical challenges like North Korea, a brand of statecraft I call \u201cgeoeconomics.\u201d But years of continually subjugating our economic interests to geopolitical ones, especially where China is concerned, has done real harm to American workers. Policymakers in both parties have been guilty on this score since China joined the World Trade Organization some 16 years ago. The Trump campaign vowed to rectify this problem \u2014 pledging that, as president, Trump would \u201cnever again sacrifice the U.S. economy on the altar of foreign policy\u201d \u2014 only to do just that after he entered office.\u000a\u000aThe administration is once again talking a tough game on China. But talk is cheap. The jury is still out over whether it understands how to take aim at the foundations of Chinese state capitalism and whether it has the will to do so.\u000a\u000aJennifer Harris is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and co-author of War by Other Means: Geoeconomics and Statecraft (Harvard University Press, 2016).

aVEU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini made a \u20ac75,000 trip to Baku in Azerbaijan | Thierry Roge/AFP via Getty Images Commissioners spent half a million on travel in two months Chartered plane rides make up a large chunk of the costs.\u000a\u000aA visit to Baku, Azerbaijan costing \u20ac75,000 was the most expensive trip made by a European commissioner in the first two months of 2016, according to travel expenses scrutinized by Belgian magazine Knack and published Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIn those two months, commissioners spent close to \u20ac500,000 on 261 official trips, Knack\u2019s analysis shows. The costs of accommodation and transport were generally modest: The most expensive overnight stay, in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, cost \u20ac629.\u000a\u000aCosts rose when commissioners used chartered planes \u2014 as happened when foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini made the \u20ac75,000 trip to Baku. The Commission said such \u201cair taxis\u201d can be used if no commercial flights are available that fit a commissioner\u2019s schedule.\u000a\u000aOther expensive trips include European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s two-day visit to Rome in February 2016, which cost \u20ac27,000, and a trip to a series of countries, including Somalia and Turkey, by Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for humanitarian aid, for a total of \u20ac11,000.\u000a\u000aThese are the first expenses of this kind and scale to be made public and the Commission tried to stop them being disclosed. The documents on travel expenses were requested by Spanish transparency NGO Access Info, but the NGO spent three years tussling with the European Commission over which and how many documents it could look at. It is still pushing to get reports for other time periods.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe just ask basic information about how the Commission is using public funds. Any taxpayer has the right to know how his money is spent,\u201d Helen Darbishire, director of Access Info Europe, told Knack.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Commission, making public the travel expenses for the rest of 2016 would create an \u201cexcessive administrative burden\u201d and the EU institution is already \u201cone of the most controlled organizations in the world,\u201d having to submit its spending to the European Parliament and European Court of Auditors.\u000a\u000aGünther Oettinger, now the budget commissioner, was last year criticized for taking a private plane to Budapest at the invitation of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The plane was owned by Klaus Mangold, a pro-Russia German businessman and lobbyist.\u000a\u000aCommission deputy spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Wednesday that the Juncker trip to Rome involved an air-taxi as the Commission president travelled with nine other people and no commercial flights were suitable.

aVPoland\u2019s unprecedented refusal to clearly obey an injunction from the European Court of Justice forbidding logging in the protected Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest is the latest battle in an increasingly bitter conflict between Warsaw and Brussels.\u000a\u000aPoland\u2019s right-wing Law and Justice party government says the forest is under attack from a plague of bark beetles, and the best defense is to chop down affected trees. Environment Minister Jan Szyszko last year authorized a tripling of the permitted logging outside of the most strictly protected heart of the forest \u2014 and loggers have harvested an estimated 93,000 trees so far this year. The wood isn\u2019t affected by the insects.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission, backed by NGOs and many forestry scientists, condemns Szyszko\u2019s approach. Bia\u0142owie\u017ca is unique in Europe, bearing traces of the primeval forest that once covered the Continent. It is designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO along with the neighboring Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus and is protected under the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 program.\u000a\u000aPoland\u2019s defiance of the ECJ in recent days is being swept into other ongoing conflicts with the EU. Brussels launched an infringement procedure in July over concerns the government is undermining the independence of its judiciary, and also opened an unprecedented probe of the country\u2019s adherence to the rule of law. If continued logging is confirmed, \u201cthe issue will be taken up in the ongoing rule of law procedure with Poland,\u201d Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said last week.\u000a\u000aIn mid-July, the Commission referred Warsaw to the Court of Justice of the EU to stop large-scale logging. The Commission requested an injunction \u201ccompelling Poland to suspend the works immediately,\u201d and the court issued a temporary order on July 27. The Commission is worried continued logging would cause \u201cserious and irreparable damage\u201d to the forest while the court works on the case.\u000a\u000aBut the injunction allows trees to be cut down in the name of public security, which Poland is using as its argument for continuing to log.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are currently removing trees attacked by the spruce bark beetle that can break and fall on roads or trails,\u201d said a spokesman for the Bia\u0142ystok branch of the state-owned forest company.\u000a\u000aThe forest is protected but parts are open to hikers and guides must accompany visitors to a more stringently controlled section. Some areas are no-go zones for tourists.\u000a\u000aA wayward EU member\u000a\u000aThe standoff puts Brussels into uncharted waters.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea that the member state wouldn\u2019t comply with a court order is unprecedented, and [so is] what the consequences would be,\u201d an ECJ spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s big.\u201d\u000a\u000aCommission Vice President Frans Timmermans and Environment Commissioner Karmenu Vella wrote to Warsaw last week, urging the Polish government to comply with the court\u2019s order, according to a letter seen by POLITICO.\u000a\u000aThe commissioners also undercut the Polish rationale for continued logging. The ECJ injunction says the temporary ban would \u201cnot seriously compromise the objective invoked by Poland for the logging, i.e. to combat the outbreak of bark beetles,\u201d they wrote.\u000a\u000aThe Commission asked the court on Monday to treat the issue as a priority.\u000a\u000aThe action has also galvanized protests in Poland, with hundreds of demonstrators trying to block loggers. Police have arrested some participants, and a TV news crew was roughed up by lumberjacks in late July when filming logging operations.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is difficult to assess what will happen next, as it is the first time in history when an EU state ignores an injunction by the EU\u2019s top court,\u201d said Agata Szafraniuk from ClientEarth Poland, an environmental law nonprofit organization.\u000a\u000aThe ECJ has issued emergency injunctions only three times in nature conservation issues, she said, one of which was filed against Poland a decade ago when Szyszko was also environment minister and Poland conflicted with the EU over building a highway through an area protected by the Natura 2000 program. That time Poland obeyed and the highway was eventually build in a different area.\u000a\u000aShould Poland continue to resist the court\u2019s temporary injunction, it may face financial sanctions. In other cases where countries failed to comply with an ECJ final ruling, they were hit with penalties.\u000a\u000aSzyszko insists Poland is doing nothing wrong. He told Polish state television Tuesday evening that in an August 4 letter to the ECJ he \u201cclarified all doubts\u201d and accused Brussels of using the situation to pile pressure on the country so \u201cthat it gives up its legitimate rights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPoland wants to clarify all these issues as quickly as possible, which is why we are demanding a hearing before the European Court of Justice to see if Poland is in the right or not,\u201d Szyszko said, adding, \u201cPoland is in the right.\u201d\u000a\u000aA ministry spokesman said the government is obeying the injunction and \u201cwas only conducting actions aiming to ensure public safety.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd ending the logging would mean a financial hit for Poland, Szyszko said. In a submission to the ECJ outlining the government\u2019s reasons for cutting the trees, the environment ministry said the beetles would cause an estimated 3.2 billion Polish zlotys (\u20ac751 million) in environmental damage to the forest if it halted logging until the court comes out with a final ruling, according to the Polish Press Agency.\u000a\u000aControversial arguments\u000a\u000aEnvironmental activists and scientists say the safety argument is a cover for commercial logging.\u000a\u000a\u201cDry trees do not fall on the heads of tourists, and there are no fires in the forest,\u201d Szafraniuk said.\u000a\u000aThe UNESCO World Heritage Committee recently called on Poland \u201cto immediately halt all logging and wood extraction in old-growth forests.\u201d And Polish scientists Rafa\u0142 Kowalczyk, Piotr Tryjanowski and Micha\u0142 \u017bmihorski say the 62,000-hectare Polish section of the forest has seen beetle outbreaks before and its ecosystem successfully contained them without the need for logging.\u000a\u000aIn neighboring Belarus, the Belovezhskaya Pushcha national park is also affected by the bark beetle, but the Belarusians are not undertaking any large-scale logging, Vasily Filimonov, chief forester of the Belarusian park, told Poland\u2019s Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe logging I observed a month ago in the Polish part of the forest is huge,\u201d he said, \u201cdisproportionate to the need to fight beetles.\u201d\u000a\u000aCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the date of Mina Andreeva\u2019s statement.

aVMark Zuckerberg insists he's not running for president. But just like your finely tuned privacy settings, things in Facebook Land are never quite what they seem.\u000a\u000aOr so hopes the newly formed super PAC Disrupt for America, whose purpose is to convince the boy king of Silicon Valley not so much to abdicate his throne as to augment it.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the group wants the Zuck to run for president in 2020. Like, really badly. So badly that it has taken upon itself the task of fomenting what has to be the most significantly misguided wave of peer pressure this country has seen in at least six months.\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: No, Mark Zuckerberg isn\u2019t running for office\u2014his tour is much bigger than that\u000a\u000a"We are committed to convincing the American people to convince Mark Zuckerberg to consider a Presidential run in 2020," the groups states on its website, "or at least join the conversation."\u000a\u000aWe had sooooo many questions, and called up the PAC's treasurer as listed on its FEC statement of organization with the hope of getting some answers. The treasurer, Rodney Giles, declined to go on the record but did direct us to Disrupt for America's press arm. Unfortunately, just like Zuckerberg's effort to discover what it's like to be human, that effort went nowhere.\u000a\u000aOur SuperPAC is designed to provide \u2018resistance with a purpose and & plan\u2019 as well as the goal of drafting Mark Zuckerberg #DraftZuck2020 \u2014 Disrupt For America (@Disrupt4America) May 23, 2017\u000a\u000aBut that's OK, because there is a wealth of information on the group's site \u2014 like the fact that Zuckerberg, in many ways, is already presidential. How do we know this? Why, because of all the qualities he shares with our current president Donald J. Trump, of course.\u000a\u000a"In addition to a set of steadfast liberal principals," the website notes, "Mark shares (perhaps more legitimately) many of the qualities of Donald Trump that resonated with everyday Americans \u2013 a wealthy, anti-establishment outsider unbeholden to special interests."\u000a\u000aOh good.\u000a\u000aLike many things in the world of politics, Disrupt for America's goal of drafting Zuckerberg is probably a long shot. Or at least we should all hope it is, because if his blandly apolitical 50-state tour has taught us anything, it's that the man is fundamentally incapable of taking any kind of meaningful stand.\u000a\u000aAnd while that may have suited Zuckerberg in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, it didn't end up working out so well for the rest of us.

aVPresident Trump's approval rating dropped 5 percentage points in August to a new low of 32%, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll, with 59% saying they disapprove of the job he's doing as president.\u000a\u000aTrump lost significant support across the board, but saw big declines among areas of core support, including Republicans, Midwesterners, middle-income families, white men and the high-school educated. The results come in the wake of the Senate's failure to repeal ObamaCare, upheavals in the White House staff, the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the election, and the daily beatings administered by the mainstream press.\u000a\u000aAmong Republicans, for example, Trump's approval rating fell from 83% in July to 71% in August. Trump's already low approval ratings remained relatively unchanged among Democrats (4%) and independents (30%).\u000a\u000aIn terms of income, Trump lost the most support from those with household incomes between $30,000 and $50,000. Among this group, Trump's approval rating dropped from 40% in July to 27% in August.\u000a\u000aTrump's support among white men \u2014 the one demographic group who approved of Trump \u2014 dropped from 51% in July to 44% in August. The nearby chart shows other groups with big drops in August.\u000a\u000aIn a series of tweets Monday morning, Trump complained about the results of other polls, saying that his "base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio......"\u000a\u000aThe nationwide IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted from July 28 to Aug. 5 and includes 904 respondents. IBD/TIPP was credited with having the most accurate poll in the November election, and was one of only two national polls that correctly predicted a Trump victory.\u000a\u000aThe August IBD/TIPP Poll found that just 33% give Trump high marks for his handling of immigration, and just 34% do so for his handling of the economy. Both are down from last month.\u000a\u000aThese numbers come at a time when the economy has shown signs of improvement, with companies reporting strong earnings, job growth topping expectations, and the stock market continuing its strong upward march. The IBD/TIPP Poll found that 51% now say the economy is improving, compared with 47% who said that in July.\u000a\u000aAs IBD noted previously, Trump's approval ratings are unusually low given the current economic environment.\u000a\u000a"Despite Americans' optimism regarding the economy, multiple factors are collectively offsetting the boost that the economy should be giving Trump, and driving down his approval rating," said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, which conducts the IBD/TIPP Poll.\u000a\u000a"Congress' failure to repeal ObamaCare has upset even some Republicans. The appearance of disarray within the White House has created a sense of uncertainty and puzzlement among Americans. Trump's skirmish with Attorney General Sessions did not go well with many conservatives, and former communications director Anthony Scaramucci's vulgar exchange with a reporter upset many. On top of this, the daily dose of insinuations from the media regarding collusion with Russia also help to explain the low approval rating," he said.\u000a\u000aRussia Collusion\u000a\u000aThe public has also grown more concerned about the Russia scandal over the past months.\u000a\u000aOf those following the Russia scandal closely, nearly two-thirds (65%) now think that members of his campaign colluded with Russia to help sway the November election. That includes 30% of Republicans and 64% of independents.\u000a\u000aThis comes after news that Trump's son met with a Russian lawyer and issued misleading statements about the nature of it, and represents a dramatic shift in the public's views about the Russian scandal.\u000a\u000aIn June, for example, nearly half thought the investigation into Trump's ties with Russia was a "witch hunt," and 57% thought the media had prematurely declared Trump and his allies guilty of collusion.\u000a\u000aNow just 31% say special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump is illegitimate because there's been no evidence of a crime. Only 37% say that Mueller's probing Trump's past business dealings goes beyond his mandate.\u000a\u000aImpeachment Talk Goes Mainstream\u000a\u000aWorse for Trump, fully 47% of the public now think that talk of impeaching the president is appropriate today, with 50% saying it's premature.\u000a\u000aWhen IBD/TIPP asked this question in June, only 32% thought it was appropriate to talk about impeaching the president, with 65% saying such talk was premature.\u000a\u000a"The meeting between Trump's son and the Russian lawyer was covered by the media continuously," Mayur said. "Some view the special counsel's impaneling of a grand jury to be a serious milestone. Further, it is much more common these days to see hypothetical discussions in the media about how Trump could fire Mueller, and how that would create a constitutional crisis, which could lead to impeachment. When you throw enough mud at the wall, some of it will stick and help to promote the impeachment discussion."\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aMethodology: The August IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted from July 28-Aug. 5. It includes responses from 904 people nationwide, who were asked questions by live interviewers on cell or landline phones. The poll's margin of error is +/-3.3 percentage points.\u000a\u000aFor the questions about Russia and impeachment, the sample was limited to the 611 people who said they were following the news about this story closely, resulting in a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points.\u000a\u000aThe IBD/TIPP Poll has been credited as being the most accurate poll in the past four presidential elections, and was one of only two that correctly predicted the outcome of the November elections.\u000a\u000aRELATED:\u000a\u000aIBD/TIPP Poll: Presidential Job Approval, Direction Of Country

aVPatient consent is an important principle in medicine, but when it comes to mental illness, things get complicated. Other diseases don\u2019t affect a patient\u2019s cognition the way a mental illness can. When the organ with the disease is a patient\u2019s brain, how can it be trusted to make decisions?\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s one reason that, historically, psychiatric patients were given very little authority to make decisions about their own care. Mental illness and incompetence were considered the same thing. People could be hospitalized and treated against their will if they were considered mentally ill and \u201cin need of treatment.\u201d The presumption was that people with mental illness\u2014essentially by definition\u2014lacked the ability to appreciate their own need for treatment.\u000a\u000aIn the 1970s, the situation began to change. First, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a patient could be hospitalized against his will only if he were dangerous to himself or others, or \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d a decision that led to the de-institutionalization of most mental health care. Second, anti-psychotic medications came into wide use, effectively handing patients the power\u2014on a daily basis\u2014to decide whether to consent to treatment or not, simply by deciding whether or not to take their pills.\u000a\u000aToday, even when hospitalized, psychiatric patients in about half of U.S. states have the right to refuse medication if they are competent. As a result, assessing competence and obtaining a patient\u2019s consent to be medicated has become a critical hurdle in the care of people with mental illness.\u000a\u000aThe truth is that many patients with psychiatric disorders don\u2019t want to be on psychotropic medications, and many patients, in and out of hospitals, refuse. Sometimes it\u2019s because they don\u2019t like the side effects, such as gaining weight, or feeling sluggish. Sometimes it\u2019s because once they feel better they don\u2019t think they need the meds anymore. And sometimes patients believe that successfully getting off of medication would prove they are not ill, and soothe the psychological injury of having an illness and needing treatment.\u000a\u000aThis can be a very frustrating situation for family or friends of those with mental illness. With the best of intentions, they may want to find a way to mandate treatment, so their loved one could get better. And residents of towns and cities where some of the untreated people with mental illness wind up living on the streets may think that it would also be in the best interests of those patients to somehow mandate treatment.\u000a\u000aBut as I can attest from personal experience, however paradoxical it may seem, the best way to increase the number of mental patients who consent to treatment is to make it easier for them to refuse.\u000a\u000aThis is because if patients have a right to refuse, they have a chit with which to bargain with their doctor. And, indeed, there is evidence that when patients have input into the medication decision, they are likelier to adhere to their medication regimen. This is in part because they can provide valuable information about what works for them and what is most tolerable in terms of side effects. And it is also because, if they are involved in the decision, they are likelier to be committed to it\u2014it is, after all, what they have chosen.\u000a\u000aMy own story helps explain why. I fell ill with schizophrenia when I was in my early 20s and was given a \u201cvery poor\u201d and \u201cgrave\u201d prognosis. I was expected to be unable to live independently, let alone to work. For about 10 years I made multiple efforts to get off medication, undertaking each effort with great gusto and failing miserably every time. My main motive was to prove I wasn\u2019t really mentally ill\u2014that it was all some terrible mistake. My analyst eventually threatened to stop seeing me unless I stayed on my meds.\u000a\u000aI decided to try one last time, and when that failed, I reconciled to being on the meds. And then something magical happened: My life got immeasurably better. I\u2019m now a chaired professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, happily married and with many friends.\u000a\u000aWhen I look back on my journey, while I am sorry I didn\u2019t get smarter sooner, I know that forcing me to take the pills would have backfired and kept me locked in a power struggle over whether or not I was ill, instead of letting me come to terms with my illness in my own time and my own way.\u000a\u000aI would hope that many patients will eventually end up in the same place I did. But even if they don\u2019t, giving them the choice is a necessary precondition to helping them address their mental illness. And if and when they do come around, they will be that much more committed to working with their doctors and staying healthy.\u000a\u000aAs a result, I believe it\u2019s important to expand the definition of competence so more patients with mental illness are deemed competent and retain control over their treatment, and I\u2019m working with colleagues at the University of California-San Diego School of Medicine on ways to do that.\u000a\u000aCurrently, psychiatrists often use something called the MacArthur capacity instruments to decide whether a psychiatric patient is competent to refuse care. Using MacArthur, doctors evaluate four items: a patient\u2019s understanding of her condition, her appreciation of its seriousness, her ability to use reason and her capacity for choice.\u000a\u000aThe \u201cappreciation\u201d piece is perhaps the most critical, evaluating a patient\u2019s ability to form correct beliefs about treatment and its risks and benefits. Far from most psychotic people being incompetent, on the MacArthur Appreciation scale, only about 23 percent of people hospitalized with schizophrenia scored \u201cimpaired.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Elyn Saks gave a TED talk describing her struggles with schizophrenia. | Ted.com\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s still too high.\u000a\u000aAlong with my collaborators at UCSD, I have designed a new appreciation test called the California Scale of Appreciation (the CSA). While MacArthur requires a patient to express roughly correct beliefs to pass the appreciation test, our standard would rule out only patently false beliefs. For example, under our CSA standard, a patient could refuse meds because of reasonably foreseeable side effects or risks, even if they are fairly uncommon. He could not refuse, however, if he believes he was helped by the meds in the past but a voice told him not to take them again or he would trigger a nuclear holocaust. Under this standard, our experts have rated just 8-13 percent of outpatients with schizophrenia incompetent\u2014roughly half as many as MacArthur.\u000a\u000aAnother approach being tested by researchers at Stanford University is \u201cenhanced consent\u201d\u2014protocols that review and summarize information in a user-friendly way. In these protocols, a video presentation may take the patient through the important elements of the treatment he or she is facing. These have been found to raise the mean performance of patients consenting to the same level as that of healthy comparison subjects. This approach shows that with proper supports, all but a small minority of mental patients can make competent decisions about their treatment, making it more likely that more of them will get better with time.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that instead of designing new ways to force medication on patients, we need to put our efforts into finding new ways to help people want treatment so we don\u2019t have to use force. That\u2019s the best way to improve compliance and push the era of forced treatment deeper into the past.\u000a\u000aElyn R. Saks is a law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, a recipient of the MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d award and author of the memoir, \u201cThe Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness.\u201d

aVNo wonder Belgium is panicking.\u000a\u000aA snowballing health scandal over a poisonous insecticide in eggs has revived the specter of a massive political crisis in 1999 that brought down the government.\u000a\u000aBelgium will convene an emergency session of ministers in parliament Wednesday to determine whether it can still rely on the food safety apparatus created nearly 20 years ago to prevent a rerun of the dioxin crisis, which is now etched into Belgians\u2019 memories.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, toxic dioxins entered the food chain through animal feed via an oil and fat recycling company in Flanders: Vetsmelter Verkest. Health authorities sat on the information for months, leading to accusations from then-opposition leader Guy Verhofstadt of a premeditated cover-up. Ministers resigned, shoppers panicked, demand for dairy products dried up and pigs were slaughtered. Neighboring countries lambasted Belgium\u2019s opacity and France banned a wide range of Belgian food items.\u000a\u000aFast forward two decades, and Belgium is again in the thick of it, and many of the same problems of poor communication are re-emerging, with Germany especially furious about the lack of information it is receiving.\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aThe latest crisis hinges on a poison called fipronil that has contaminated eggs across several EU countries, thanks to an illegal mite-killing detergent for chickens made by a company in Flanders called Poultry Vision. While tests identifying a \u201cserious\u201d risk were first conducted in May and an investigation was opened in June, the public was only informed at the end of July, and then only because of concerns in the Netherlands. Across the EU, hundreds of farms have closed and sales of tens of millions of eggs have been halted.\u000a\u000aFipronil can damage organs ranging from the liver to the thyroid gland, and it\u2019s especially harmful to children.\u000a\u000aBelgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme and Health Minister Maggie De Block will try to explain Belgium\u2019s handling of the crisis to parliamentarians Wednesday. Ducarme has called for a detailed report from Belgium\u2019s Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) and prioritized consumer safety.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission said Monday that seven countries may be affected.\u000a\u000aGermany, which fears it has imported millions of contaminated eggs, is the most vocal critic. Regional officials angrily accused the Belgians of not picking up the phone and of not being \u201cup to the job.\u201d The agriculture ministry in Berlin said Christian Schmidt, Germany\u2019s farm minister, called his Belgian counterpart Monday to demand \u201ca fast and complete clarification of the ongoing situation.\u201d\u000a\u000aTurbid timeline\u000a\u000aMuch of the appraisal of the scandal will hinge on its messy chronology.\u000a\u000aAFSCA said it was informed in early June that traces of fipronil had made it into the food chain via eggs. But the agency failed to notify its partners in Europe of the scandal for nearly two months.\u000a\u000aThe frustration with the Belgian authorities is shaping into the biggest black mark against the country\u2019s administration since its intelligence networks were widely accused, especially by French President François Hollande, of failing to identify the terrorist networks behind attacks in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aAccording to an official notification form filed by the Belgian state, the sampling of the contaminated eggs took place May 15. However it wasn\u2019t until July 20 that Belgium informed its European partners via the EU\u2019s so-called Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Only on August 1 did AFSCA make its first public announcement on the issue.\u000a\u000aKatrien Stragier, a spokesperson AFSCA, said the May 15 date referred to the day that a private egg producer in Belgium conducted its own tests to check for fipronil. It was not until early June that AFSCA was informed.\u000a\u000aThijs Verbeurgt, head of the policy unit for the Flemish Social-Democratic Party, said \u201cThe big question is who knew what when.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been feeling is that they [Belgium\u2019s food safety authority] took a minimalist approach, minimal [communication] and minimal action, while in the Netherlands and Germany they\u2019ve been taking maximal steps,\u201d Verbeurgt said. \u201cThat means destroying eggs and chickens in the interests of the consumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aQuestions about measuring egg safety\u000a\u000aThe question of whether dangerous levels of fipronil have been found in Belgium is \u2014 at best \u2014 confused.\u000a\u000aIn Germany\u2019s view, dangerous eggs have been found in Belgium. According to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany, Belgian eggs have recorded fipronil levels of between 0.0031 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg. Only eggs with a fipronil level of up to 0.72 mg/kg are considered safe for human consumption.\u000a\u000aBut Belgium says there is no danger. On Monday, AFSCA said test results from 21 egg-producing businesses showed a maximum level of fipronil recorded of only 0.096 mg/kg.\u000a\u000aAsked why Belgian authorities had not used the 1.2 mg/kg result, Stragier explained that figure was from the private producer and not from AFSCA\u2019s data. \u201cWe base our analysis on the results that we see in the analysis we have done here in Belgium. We\u2019ve done our own analysis and taken samples of companies which are suspected of having used fipronil, and the results indicate that there is no health risk in Belgium,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aGermany also complained that the context of 1.2 mg/kg reading was not properly explained by the Belgian authorities.\u000a\u000aAndreas Tief, spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, said that when Belgium finally did inform other countries, authorities said there was no risk to other nations. They didn\u2019t tell EU countries about Poultry Vision\u2019s tainted DEGA-16 detergent.\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir message was that neighboring countries were not concerned and they did not inform us about DEGA-16,\u201d Tief said.\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater.\u000a\u000aAnd poor communication isn\u2019t helping.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe federal [agriculture] minister has not only spoken publicly about problems in the cooperation. He has also had talks on the highest levels with Belgian counterparts,\u201d Tief said. \u201cThat gives you a sense of how things are going.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother big question for the Belgians to explain is why the Netherlands declared the risk to be far greater. The Hague declared eggs from 59 producers to be unfit for consumption by children.\u000a\u000aBenno Bruggink, a spokesperson for the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, said that any time fipronil levels rise above 0.72 mg/kg the authorities will issue a public warning.\u000a\u000aAsked if the approach in the Netherlands was of a more precautionary nature when compared to Belgium, he said: \u201cIt would seem so.\u201d

We\u2019re going to save a lot of money.\u201d\u000a\u000aRussia recently announced that it would expel hundreds of American diplomats from Russia in retaliation for new sanctions the U.S. put on the Kremlin. Those sanctions are in response to Russia\u2019s suspected attempts to meddle in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election through a disinformation campaign and cyberattacks on Democratic Party officials.\u000a\u000aTrump, whose campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia is the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, had pushed back against the sanctions bill, but signed it into law after it passed Congress with veto-proof majorities in both chambers.\u000a\u000aThe State Department has not yet released the details of how it will handle the drawdown. But many, if not most, of the positions cut will likely be those of locally hired Russian staffers, though the local staff who are let go will likely get severance payments. Cost savings are possible in the long run.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.

"Everyone seems pretty amazed. This statement is naive and shortsighted. It sends a terrible signal to local employees everywhere."\u000a\u000a"THANK Putin?" another bewildered State Department official responded. "I don't have words that are printable to describe my reaction."\u000a\u000aThe reaction to Trump's comments on social media was equally as withering, with many suggesting he simply didn't understand how the U.S. Foreign Service is structured and others shocked by his gesture to Putin.\u000a\u000aNicholas Burns, who served as undersecretary of state for political affairs during the second Bush administration, called Trump's statement "shameful."\u000a\u000a"He justifies mistreatment of U.S. diplomats by Putin," Burns wrote on Twitter.\u000a\u000aEver since Trump won the election, the State Department has felt sidelined by the president and his aides. Trump largely ignored U.S. diplomats who were ready and willing to offer him briefings when he talked to foreign leaders during the transition period. Since taking office, Trump has proposed cutting the State Department's budget by a third, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is considered isolated and aloof from many of the diplomats he oversees.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVSen. Jeff Flake is one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in 2018. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Top Trump donor ponies up to take out Flake Robert Mercer is donating $300,000 to a super PAC backing Kelli Ward, who is running against the GOP senator in a primary next year.\u000a\u000aOne of Donald Trump\u2019s most generous political benefactors is providing a six-figure donation to a super PAC devoted to unseating Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been fiercely critical of the president.\u000a\u000aRobert Mercer, a reclusive hedge fund billionaire who was intimately involved in Trump\u2019s rise and helped to bankroll his 2016 campaign, is contributing $300,000 to a super PAC supporting former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who is challenging Flake in a Republican primary next year.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s the latest sign that Trump\u2019s political machine is preparing to take on Flake, whose persistent attacks have angered the president. The White House has met with Ward and two other Republicans who are mulling primary challenges to the Arizona senator, state Treasurer Jeff DeWit and former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham.\u000a\u000aA longtime Trump critic, Flake has made waves with the release of his new book, \u201cConscience of a Conservative.\u201d He argues that his party is in denial about the Trump presidency and blames the GOP for his rise. Over the past week, Flake has launched a national TV tour in which he\u2019s made the case that his party has taken the wrong course.\u000a\u000aDuring the 2016 campaign, Flake refused to endorse Trump and called on him to withdraw after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Trump was heard boasting about groping women. The senator refused to attend the GOP convention, saying that he had to stay home to mow his lawn.\u000a\u000aHis jabs rankled candidate Trump, who at one point said that he would be willing to spend $10 million of his own money to defeat Flake in a 2018 primary.\u000a\u000aAnd during a press briefing last week, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to rule out the possibility that the president would help finance an anti-Flake primary effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cSen. Flake would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the president" and more involved in "passing legislation,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aTies between the Mercer family and Trump run deep. Mercer\u2019s daughter, Rebekah, is close to several of the president\u2019s closest aides, including chief strategist Steve Bannon. In August 2016, Rebekah Mercer, a major GOP donor in her own right, played an instrumental role in engineering a shakeup that placed Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, now a White House counselor, atop Trump\u2019s campaign.\u000a\u000aIn December, then-president-elect Trump, Bannon, and Conway attended a lavish \u201cVillains and Heroes\u201d-themed costume party at the Mercer family\u2019s Long Island home.\u000a\u000aRobert Mercer also contributed to the pro-Ward super PAC, KelliPAC, during the 2016 campaign, when Ward unsuccessfully challenged GOP Sen. John McCain. Mercer is a primary funder of the pro-Trump website Breitbart, which published a number of flattering stories about Ward during her previous bid.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are so grateful to Mr. Mercer for his courageous support for Kelli Ward, a true conservative champion. Early investments in a campaign like this are so valuable,\u201d said Doug McKee, KelliPAC\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cKelli is in prime position to carry her message of accountable, constitutional government all the way to the United States Senate. Interest from additional donors is pouring in, and we are confident that leadership like Mr. Mercer\u2019s will allow us to run a robust winning effort all the way to November of 2018.\u201d\u000a\u000aA Mercer spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aFlake is one of the most vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in 2018, and many senior Republicans are worried that his manifesto will hurt his prospects \u2014 and further inflame tensions with the administration. Within Arizona, some of Trump\u2019s biggest donors have been searching out a primary opponent to challenge the senator.\u000a\u000aThe president has yet to declare his support for any of Flake\u2019s prospective opponents, yet he is keeping tabs on the primary. During a recent meeting in the Oval Office, Trump asked the Arizona GOP chairman, Jonathan Lines, for an update on the contest.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVViewed from Brussels, the U.K. seemed so ill-prepared in the early rounds of Brexit negotiations that some EU countries think it must be a trap.\u000a\u000aWhile the EU\u2019s negotiating team say they are unconcerned and prepared for anything \u2014 and that any disorganization on the London side comes from serious divisions in the British political class \u2014 some EU diplomats are growing alarmed. Trade attachés in particular who know their British colleagues as tough, canny negotiators are suspicious of the seemingly fickle and aimless procrastination from the British government.\u000a\u000aThe Brits\u2019 chaotic early posture in the Brexit talks has left them wondering whether London is pulling some sort of deft ploy \u2014 a strategy of pretending not to have a strategy.\u000a\u000aOn the face of it, that looks unlikely. The inconclusive outcome of the June election and Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s resulting loss of authority muddied London\u2019s stance on Brexit. Cabinet rows over the nature of a post-Brexit transition have played out in public, casting doubt on whether there is a settled government position on key issues such as migration and membership of the customs union.\u000a\u000a\u2018A bluff\u2019\u000a\u000aBut those, by and large, are issues for later in the Brexit talks. The suspicion among some in Brussels is that the lack of clarity at cabinet level is being used as cover during the early negotiating salvos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s tactics: They are playing for time on purpose,\u201d one attaché from a Western EU country said, \u201cunder the pretext of chaos in London.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn September they\u2019re going to swamp us with [position] papers on the fault lines \u2014 exactly the issues where they know we [the EU27 countries] are divided,\u201d he warned.\u000a\u000aHis colleague from a Southern country, asked: \u201cDo they have a strategy? Or are they playing a bluff with the European Union? \u2026 It could be a strategy because the British are always so organized.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat expressed the same skepticism last week: \u201cPeople who say the Brits don\u2019t know what they are doing are wrong,\u201d he told the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, \u201cI have lived in Britain, I know the British mentality. A non-prepared British government official simply doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cBy the end of the year, the tables will have turned\u201d \u2014 a diplomat\u000a\u000aJean-Paul Gauzès, who served as a French MEP from 2004 to 2014 and negotiated frequently with British counterparts as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, said that in his experience, U.K. officials pursued their goals with single-minded determination while keeping others off balance.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Brits are pragmatic and very concrete,\u201d Gauzès said, adding: \u201cThe Brits never ask for clarity because the more ambiguous it is, the better it is.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn negotiations on finance directives, Gauzès said: \u201cEverybody would move except the British MEPs who would wait until the end of the process to say: \u2018I will tell you how to say that in proper English.\u2019 Their \u2018proper English\u2019 always meant in favor of British interests.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne EU official said that it was just common sense not to underestimate the British. \u201cHaving seen the movie \u2018Dunkirk\u2018 over the weekend, history might suggest that the British could turn disaster and disorganization around,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aIf the Brits are faking, then among the potential scenarios, officials said, is a stall for time that would leave the EU side feeling pressured to agree to a future trade deal rather than allow a disorderly withdrawal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Ollie Robbins [the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser and chief civil servant in the Brexit department] knows very well what he is doing,\u201d the Western diplomat said. \u201cHe is telling Davis to wait \u2026 By the end of the year, the tables will have turned.\u201d\u000a\u000aContinental fault lines\u000a\u000aAnother strategy that some EU officials fear is an aggressive outreach by the U.K. to corporate executives in the EU27, particularly in countries with businesses that could be hard hit by Brexit. The fear is that the U.K. might win friends with an argument that Brussels has been overly focused on winning the initial negotiating battle over the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill to plug a budget hole, rather than focusing on securing a trade deal that would protect businesses for decades to come.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019ll say \u2018we want to talk about trade, but the EU only wants to talk about money,\u201d\u2019 the western diplomat said.\u000a\u000aOthers on the EU side though said that given the clear evidence of real political divisions at the top of the ruling Conservative party in the U.K. such fears were unwarranted, even fantastical.\u000a\u000aA seasoned EU diplomat said that if London had constructed an elaborate ruse to gain the upper hand in Brexit, it had fooled even the British negotiators. If it is indeed a mise en scène, this diplomat said: \u201cIt would be an extremely sophisticated one.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd an EU official directly involved in the Brexit talks dismissed as unjustified \u201cspeculation\u201d the idea that the U.K. is operating a hidden cunning plan. \u201cIt seems to me, based on what I read, there is no clarity on the direction in which they want to move and it\u2019s very difficult to implement a negotiating strategy if you don\u2019t have that clarity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis official did not rule out the possibility that London was preparing some sort of Brexit Trojan horse, but said it seemed highly unlikely. \u201cNobody underestimates the capability of British diplomats. British diplomacy has been admired not only in the EU but globally,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe only ones who know the truth are the Brits themselves. Are they ready or are they trying to dance some very strange ballet that we don\u2019t fully get?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Sitting on our hands\u2019\u000a\u000aIrish Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan summed up the feeling in Brussels when he told Ireland\u2019s RTÉ Radio One Saturday that Britain\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations is beset by \u201cinconsistency and lack of coordination\u201d that \u201cbeggars belief.\u201d Hogan warned that \u201cit seems that the United Kingdom still have to come to terms with their negotiating mandate and this is happening at a time when the clock is ticking.\u201d\u000a\u000aA senior U.K. government official said that any perception of chaos or incompetence was false: \u201cThis idea that we\u2019ve been sitting on our hands for the last year is just bollocks. We have been working extremely hard. What you will start to see over the next couple of months is the government setting out in public what has been happening in private.\u201d\u000a\u000aA second government aide said there would be a number of official position papers published in August before the next round of U.K.-EU negotiations, which are due to take place between August 28 and September 1 in Brussels. The papers will set out the government\u2019s official position on a number of \u201ccore\u201d elements of Brexit, the aide said.\u000a\u000aTom McTague and Maïa de La Baume contributed reporting.

aVMost people appear to see Brexit as a thing which is happening, not a debating point. At least for now | Leon Neal/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight Why an anti-Brexit party is unlikely David Davis\u2019 chief adviser goes rogue on Twitter, but his suggestion that Britain needs a new party unlikely to gain traction.\u000a\u000aDavid Davis\u2019s former chief adviser, James Chapman, may have gone rogue but he is not the only British government insider who thinks Brexit will be a disaster.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve not met a single person in the department who voted for Brexit,\u201d one official admitted to POLITICO recently. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a Brexiteer in the U.K.\u2019s representation in Brussels either.\u000a\u000aAfter a year in government Chapman believes the only answer is to call Brexit off and establish a new centrist party \u2014 perhaps under the guiding hand of his old boss and political soulmate George Osborne? \u2014 to \u201cresist\u201d Britain\u2019s exit.\u000a\u000aInside the Department for Exiting the European Union there is a widespread problem of morale, with junior staff leaving and even senior directors unhappy with how things are being handled, according to government officials speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aMost of the grumbling, however, is not to do with Brexit. What is exercising officials is far more prosaic \u2014 HR problems that come with setting up a new department, pay and conditions mainly, and accusations of bad management.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to it, most people appear to see Brexit as a thing which is happening, not a debating point. At least for now. And in that sense staff are a microcosm for the British population at large.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot once did somebody bring up the single market,\u201d one leading Labour shadow minister recalled, reflecting on the election.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Chapman, a respected former political editor of the Daily Mail and then an adviser to Osborne before joining Davis in the Brexit department, has seen right into the heart of government, so his warnings should not be discarded. Like most Western democracies right now, British politics is febrile. If Brexit is the disaster he and others warn it will be \u2014 bringing unemployment and pay cuts \u2014 the mood could quickly turn.\u000a\u000aSo could an anti-Brexit party work? Early evidence suggests it\u2019s unlikely.\u000a\u000aBetween them, the Conservatives and Labour won 82.3 percent of the vote in June\u2019s election \u2014 the highest since 1970. If there is space for a new party to emerge it is hard to see it. The one party which stood on a clean anti-Brexit position, the Liberal Democrats, finished with 7 percent of the vote.\u000a\u000aBut Labour\u2019s unexpected success in June\u2019s election shows there are no rules in politics any more. If Brexit is a disaster, somebody will get the blame and, as the response to Chapman\u2019s tweets has shown, the backlash will be bitter.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2018s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVAt home, Julián Castro\u2019s been spending more time reading and watching television in Spanish, trying to get his speaking skills up to speed.\u000a\u000aOn the job as Housing and Urban Development secretary, he\u2019s been carefully working the levers in Washington, with coaching from Bill Clinton and a twin brother who\u2019s a popular and up-and-coming congressman himself.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aStarting Saturday, he\u2019ll be out on the trail for Hillary Clinton in in Nevada, Iowa and Maine.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s plotted his rise carefully, studying and strategizing with a clear goal in sight. But if Clinton picks him to be her running mate, it\u2019ll be more about perfectly fitting his party\u2019s moment and the nearly non-existent Democratic bench than about his 18 months as a HUD secretary who hasn\u2019t left a deep mark at his agency, the White House or the housing world.\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s got a made-for-campaign commercials biography, and an undeniable savvy that\u2019s helped him spin a job as a part-time mayor of San Antonio into an unusually successful 2012 Democratic convention keynote and then the answer to the second term Obama White House\u2019s own search for more diversity in the Cabinet, without having to wait until he could win statewide in Texas.\u000a\u000aSince he got to Washington in 2014, Castro\u2019s invested in building relationships with key members of Congress, paying close attention to the people who have control of HUD budgets and who might make good political connections to have down the line. He\u2019s used the allure of getting to hang out with a possible future vice president to make fans out of housing industry leaders who nonetheless have trouble citing anything specific they like about his work, streamlined a famously dysfunctional bureaucracy and walked the hallways to improve employee satisfaction so much that several HUD employees who rolled their eyes at his appointment now say he was a needed change.\u000a\u000aAlong the way, Castro\u2019s inner circle of aides and advisers have come to see Clinton\u2019s running mate decision as a pretty simple math problem: it\u2019ll be a white man, a black man or a brown man, they figure.\u000a\u000aAnd then they run it down from there: the white man\u2019s Sen. Tim Kaine, and though he\u2019s got a lot of good government experience and the geography that could help with Ohio and Pennsylvania on top of his own Virginia, they say that at 58 he\u2019d be too old to provide a generational contrast to the 68-year old Clinton, and too white for a campaign being defined by immigration reform and Black Lives Matter and Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on minorities. Yes, Kaine speaks Spanish\u2014and fluently, from his days as a missionary in Honduras, as opposed to Castro, who like so many first-generation Americans, had parents who only spoke English with him\u2014but they don\u2019t think it\u2019ll go over too well for Clinton to try explaining to Latinos that at least the white guy she picked over a Latino speaks their language.\u000a\u000aIf it\u2019s a black man, they say, then it\u2019s Deval Patrick or Cory Booker. Patrick\u2019s out, the Castro circle figures, because Massachusetts doesn\u2019t help Clinton and that Bain Capital job he took after leaving office is a killer. Booker\u2019s possible, though maybe a New York-New Jersey ticket\u2019s a bit much.\u000a\u000aCastro declined comment on any of the gaming out. But ask the Castro circle if there\u2019s any other Latino they can imagine Clinton picking and they stammer. Xavier Becerra, they say skeptically, their voices trailing off as they stretch a question mark out the last vowel in the California congressman\u2019s name. And at 57, they figure, he\u2019s also too old.\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s a young-looking 41, a lower-level Cabinet secretary with a record that\u2019s most distinguished for not having anything go wrong. He's the former mayor of the seventh-largest city with a record that includes a big win in implementing universal pre-K, but the job is technically part-time and pays only $3,000 per year. (Most of the municipal government is run by an unelected city manager, though many San Antonians expect the mayor to act like they're full-time.)\u000a\u000aA Clinton spokesman declined comment on where the campaign is in the running mate selection, but to Castro\u2019s backers, the choice is obvious.\u000a\u000aHenry Cisneros, a Castro mentor and the other former mayor of San Antonio who became HUD secretary, under Clinton, said he pushes the idea of picking him to the former president and secretary of state every chance he gets.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you consider all of the balancing factors\u2014female/male, baby boomer/gen X, traditional American/minority American, Northeastern-Midwestern orientation/Southwestern orientation, long heritage in office/representative of a new generation,\u201d Cisneros said, \u201ca lot of things suggest a very nice pairing.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aBill Clinton first met Castro at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2008, in the San Antonio home of Henry Muñoz, now the DNC finance chairman. Four years later, Clinton dialed him up with advice about the convention keynote. Clinton invited him to a small lunch with Cisneros when he was back in San Antonio in February 2014, and then was on the phone again a few weeks after President Barack Obama nominated Castro for the HUD job, providing an intense 45-minute rundown on HUD policy, management and politics.\u000a\u000aThen, a few weeks after Castro got to Washington, Clinton invited him to a dinner with friends at his D.C. home, without Hillary. Back then, Castro had only met her once, for a couple minutes backstage at a conference at the University of Southern California in late 2013.\u000a\u000aCastro turned down the first two jobs he considered for the Obama administration.\u000a\u000aHe said no to Homeland Security before anyone ever offered it, after a Democratic operative with White House ties reached out to gauge his interest in taking over for Janet Napolitano. No way, Castro and his tight circle of advisers decided. The concern wasn\u2019t that he had no national security or law enforcement experience, but, according to people familiar with the conversations at the time, because: what if there was an attack on his watch? That would have ended the political career he\u2019d started with a fundraiser with his twin brother among his Harvard Law classmates before they graduated.\u000a\u000aWhen Obama did call with an offer a few months later, Castro had already figured out what it was\u2014Transportation secretary\u2014and that he didn\u2019t want it, though he and his advisers had been intrigued by the kind of travel he could do with the private jet that came with the job. You can tell Obama\u2019s a good lawyer, Castro told people after he got off the phone, from how he felt Castro out without ever actually saying what the call was about. Castro couldn\u2019t see what he was going to get from spending a couple of years cutting ribbons on infrastructure projects and talking up the Highway Bill.\u000a\u000aBefore they hung up, though, Castro pitched Obama on Education secretary, if and when that opened. That\u2019s the kind of thing he felt like he could do something with.\u000a\u000aCastro remembers very well what Walter Mondale told Cisneros during his 1984 running mate interview: it\u2019s hard to go from being mayor right onto a national ticket.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe believes,\u201d said one person who knows him, \u201cin being on the right platform.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro looked hard at the 2014 Texas governor\u2019s race, always wanting to be convinced that it was the right move, at the right time. He passed again, waiting.\u000a\u000aA year and a half after that first call from Obama, Castro got another. He took the weekend to think about it, but he already knew the answer was yes. Within weeks, he was at HUD calling in new staff and holdovers, asking them for their vision for the year ahead. If they started rattling off about policy, he\u2019d wave them off.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere\u2019s the message,\u201d he\u2019d say, according to several people in those conversations. \u201cHUD is the Department of Opportunity. And everything we do will be around that message.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen detailed policy questions about housing and mortgage financing came up, those people said, he\u2019d freeze up. He seems genuinely interested in helping people, they\u2019d say, but not interested enough in HUD policy to want to engage deeply.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople like Julián Castro and he\u2019s not stopping them from doing their work,\u201d said one person familiar with the Department. \u201cHe\u2019s also not driving it. He\u2019s not interested and engaged like that. But it\u2019s hard not to like him.\u201d\u000a\u000aSitting in his office on the tenth floor of the particularly brutal Brutalist HUD headquarters in Southwest D.C., a vintage poster from his mother\u2019s 1970s San Antonio city council run framed on the wall behind him (having her on the campaign trail would be reason enough for Clinton to pick Castro, some fans argue), Castro said he wasn\u2019t having fun at first. As mayor he was the center of attention, in charge of deciding what he\u2019d do. This was a change.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I said that is there no part of my ego that likes it when people know that I did something,\u201d Castro said. \u201cPeople are bullshitting you if they say there\u2019s zero percent of that involved. But I think that the main satisfaction that policy makers can have is understanding that what they do makes an impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s no \u201chouser,\u201d as HUD people say, and he\u2019s suffered in a lot of eyes from the comparisons to Shaun Donovan, the rare HUD secretary who truly came up through housing finance and policy and was known on the job for his seemingly endless policy brainstorming sessions that Castro\u2019s scrapped. Instead of Donovan\u2019s giant briefing books, Castro\u2019s ordered they all come with one-page summaries with very clearly defined options.\u000a\u000aTo many around town, Castro\u2019s reputation as HUD secretary was cemented by his first hearing in front of the House Financial Services Committee last February. Close Castro allies blame Republicans with 2016 on their minds for trying to discredit a potential vice presidential candidate the same way they'd used the Benghazi hearings to go after Clinton. But the faces of the aides behind him in told a different story: he was bumbling, confused on details and letting very eager Republicans ride all over him.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s taken him some time to get up to speed,\u201d said Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wisc.), the chair of the Oversight & Investigations subcommittee on Financial Services.\u000a\u000aAides admit they fumbled by giving Castro too much information that hadn\u2019t been boiled down enough for a relative novice, never resolving internal fights about how to present some of the dicey facts around housing finance, not realizing how often in tutorials he was just nodding along instead of asking questions.\u000a\u000aBut the real change came during the lunch break. Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) is his twin brother\u2019s closest adviser, side-by-side at college and law school and in San Antonio politics\u2014\u201cthey're almost like their own political party together,\u201d said one Democrat who\u2019s seen them in action together \u2014 and that day he came close to shaking his brother: Push back. Get aggressive.\u000a\u000aCastro was noticeably different in the second half of that hearing, and by the next one in June, he still didn\u2019t know all the specifics, but he covered that by parrying and counterpunching, but mostly working the room before, during and after with phone calls, lunches and district visits.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d mastered the politics, if not the policy, of going before Congress.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is a cool drink of water in a desert of hostility,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).\u000a\u000aThere are other benefits, people who\u2019ve been watching closely note. Cleaver, for example, is more than just the ranking member on Oversight & Investigations for Financial Services; he\u2019s a prominent African-American Democrat with ties to the Clintons. Castro\u2019s invested a lot of time in him.\u000a\u000aCleaver now says his \u201cgreat hope\u201d is that Clinton will consider Castro for VP.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe made a conscious effort to cover our bases and make things move on the committees,\u201d Castro said.\u000a\u000aDuffy gushed about how much Castro\u2019s engaged him, including taking an extra night in northwestern Wisconsin to have dinner with him before visiting the district in November.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a Republican, he\u2019s a Democrat, a cabinet official, and I\u2019m well aware being talked about as the vice presidential candidate. But putting partisan politics aside and coming out to my district, for me, that was a really big deal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a person,\u201d Duffy said, \u201cwho is engaging and building coalitions and looking out for people in, I think, a unique way.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aAsk many people in the West Wing what they think about Castro, and the answer is: they don\u2019t think about him much at all. They\u2019re protective of him at the top levels of the White House, and sense his political potential, but he\u2019s not one of the cabinet favorites in the building.\u000a\u000aAt HUD and the White House, people strain to think of many moments between the secretary and the president that stand out, aside from Obama inviting him to ride in his limo between every stop on a trip together to Arizona last January.\u000a\u000aThe one moment that does: when Obama came to HUD for the welcome ceremony after Castro was confirmed, and the secretary wouldn\u2019t let him leave before he took a picture with the cleaning staff. Obama was touched by the idea, say people who spoke with him after, and impressed with the political sensibility it showed.\u000a\u000aBut the word that often comes up in describing their relationship is \u201ccordial.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an interview at the end of last year, Castro said it had been \u201csome time\u201d since he\u2019d spoken to the president, and that wasn\u2019t unusual.\u000a\u000aCastro said he\u2019s gotten to know Obama \u201cmuch better than I did when I was mayor. Am I his best friend? No.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro was one of the three suggested replacements that Donovan gave Obama when he was getting ready to move over to the Office of Management of Budget. They liked the work Castro had been doing on Promise Zones in San Antonio\u2014\u201cYou can see the needle moving for kids on the east side of San Antonio because of the way he organized his resources and federal resources,\u201d said Cecilia Muñoz, Obama\u2019s domestic policy advisor, and Castro\u2019s main point of contact in the White House.\u000a\u000aWhite House aides didn\u2019t have any illusions about Castro. They knew he didn\u2019t know much about housing, and without a deputy secretary in place to run HUD on a day-to-day basis for him, they vetoed his first choice for chief of staff, a political pick from back in San Antonio who also didn\u2019t come out of housing.\u000a\u000aComing in six years into the administration, with nothing Obama wants coming out of Congress and the White House\u2019s focus moved on after stabilizing the housing crisis, Castro\u2019s been working in a narrow lane.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not like he comes to town and set the world on fire around housing. But it\u2019s a very difficult environment to do that,\u201d said Sheila Crowley, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. \u201cIf the measure is progress and the addressing of affordable housing issues, there\u2019s nobody who\u2019s going to be able to point to many outstanding successes.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s big contribution to administration policy, the mortgage premium reduction that was one of the spotlighted policy roll-outs for Obama\u2019s 2015 State of the Union, was ordered up by the White House months before Castro arrived in Washington.\u000a\u000aOn that and top administration priorities like ending veteran\u2019s homelessness, Castro\u2019s had good results, White House aides say, though more as an implementer than an innovator\u2014just the way this White House likes it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is a Castro agenda,\u201d said Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. The president \u201cwasn\u2019t looking for someone with their own agenda, he was looking for someone who shared his agenda. Since his appointment, he has been delivering on the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce Castro\u2019s decided on an issue, though, he wraps his arms around it. He was the one who made the final call on who\u2019d qualify for the mortgage premium reduction, and even HUD employees who think he\u2019s out of his depth say he deserves credit for taking a chance that could have come back to bite him if the housing market had tanked at the end of last year.\u000a\u000aCastro has expressed concerns to White House aides that they\u2019re tilting too much to the banks in making rules about loans, not giving enough flexibility to consumers. But most of the decisions have already been made, and the White House has left the remaining ones mostly in the hands of Donovan, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, National Economic Council director Jeff Zients and their teams.\u000a\u000aThe White House has also tapped Castro to advise and promote the White House\u2019s work with mayors around the country on issues like paid leave and universal pre-K. He\u2019s been \u201cimmensely helpful both in talking through the ideas and managing those relationships with the nation's mayors since he knows the challenges and opportunities first-hand,\u201d Muñoz said.\u000a\u000aCastro and his team have embraced the freedom of not having to create a full agenda. Instead of staying in Washington, he\u2019s on the road nearly every week promoting some aspect of what HUD is doing -- and building up press, speaking experience and connections for himself as he goes.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis experience as a mayor far exceeds his portfolio for housing, because he understands what it takes to make communities healthy,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t housing in a vacuum, it\u2019s housing where you have good education, safe streets, jobs, infrastructure.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s taken advantage of being the new guy who can get his calls returned \u2014 getting Obama to be part of the rollout of his signature ConnectHome initiative to expand broadband access in public housing, playing a central role in putting out the Affirmative Furthering Fair Housing rule (which provides a long-sought mechanism for HUD to force anyone getting federal housing money to address discrimination), enjoying wide latitude over how he runs his relationships with Congress and the media.\u000a\u000a\u201cWas he pounding on the table at the White House?\u201d said one sympathetic former HUD official. \u201cNo, but he\u2019s a quieter leader, and he knows how to pull the levers together for what needs to get done. He\u2019s very disciplined.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s greatest liability, people around her point out, is the sense that she\u2019s willing to do and say anything to get elected. Wouldn\u2019t picking a running mate who makes so much political sense but has such a thin résumé put a face on that feeling?\u000a\u000aThen again, though Castro clearly wouldn\u2019t be Al Gore, Dick Cheney or Joe Biden coming in, she\u2019d have the experience argument covered herself, they say. Anyway, what are the chances Clinton\u2019s going to give much power to her vice president?\u000a\u000aBut the decision could be more basic than any of that.\u000a\u000aBy the time Clinton\u2019s making the choice, they say, she\u2019ll be thinking there\u2019s better than even odds she\u2019ll be president, coming in at 69 as one of the two oldest presidents to take office. \u201cWhat if I die?\u201d is going to be a real question for her. Is the answer really going to be, Julián Castro\u2019s the president?\u000a\u000aThen again, her best-case scenario is a trudge through November with nearly every voter in the country already decided on her one way or the other. The primary\u2019s proven that she doesn\u2019t seem fresh or new, that there\u2019s such an enthusiasm gap that an ornery socialist senator from Vermont has turned a symbolic challenge against her into a real primary challenge, and so some wonder, can she win without him?\u000a\u000aEspecially young Latino audiences go nuts over Castro, but for a guy whom Clinton would count on to electrify, he\u2019s often not too electrifying \u2014 one of those people who\u2019s almost easier to read and connect with in front of 10,000 people at a rally or on TV than in front of one, people who\u2019ve worked with him say.\u000a\u000a"All of us have this sense of a politician that\u2019s stuck in the mid-20th century of the glad-handing, larger than life image," Castro said. "Bill Clinton maybe gave a little oxygen to it. But if we step back and take a look at folks who put themselves up for office, rarely does it match that anymore. And why would it?"\u000a\u000aBut even the people who complain about Castro\u2019s caution say it\u2019s less him protecting his VP prospects than just never wanting to be out on a limb on anything. The good news, say people who know him, is that if he\u2019s picked he won\u2019t make rookie mistakes. The bad news, others say, is that they fear he\u2019ll be too wary of taking chances to make any impression at all.\u000a\u000a\u201cSometimes folks consider me overly cautious because of my personality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at the track record of what I\u2019ve actually swung for \u2014 that\u2019s stuff that wasn\u2019t being done before.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro offered to endorse Clinton the third time he was ever in the same room as her, when they ran into each other at the National Council of La Raza convention in Kansas City in July. She wanted to wait, but when her campaign was trying to accelerate the end of Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s 2016 flirtation, they quickly came calling. Standing in the back of the ballroom of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute gala at the beginning of October, they sealed it.\u000a\u000aTheir event together in San Antonio, when Clinton said she\u2019d \u201clook really hard\u201d at Castro, was the only time she\u2019s said anything about any potential vice presidential pick. These days, all a campaign official would say is, \u201cHillary Clinton greatly appreciates the endorsement and support he\u2019s shown for her campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro calls her \u201cunflappable. Very knowledgeable. Just generally stronger on the stump and in those debates than anybody else, Republican or Democrat.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I haven\u2019t spent a whole lot of time with her, but the time that I have, I\u2019ve had the chance to start to get to know her,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOn the question of how he thinks Clinton would differ from Obama as president, he ducks. On the question of how he thinks his experience might fit into an administration, he ducks again.\u000a\u000aWhen he\u2019s asked about the vice presidency, inevitably, everywhere he goes, he smiles the same smile and slowly says his line about how he\u2019s focusing on his job now, and that\u2019s the best thing he can do.\u000a\u000aAsk him whether America\u2019s at a turning point moment for Latinos to get a bigger role in national politics, and he answers quickly.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve been at that moment,\u201d Castro said, \u201cfor a while now.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBelgian Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme | Flickr via Creative Commons Belgium shifts blame over egg scandal to the Netherlands Agriculture minister says probe was slowed down by lack of cooperation by the Dutch.\u000a\u000aBelgian authorities are seeking to pin the blame for an international scandal over toxic eggs onto the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aOver the past two weeks, Belgium has been under fire over the speed of its reaction to the discovery of a poison called fipronil that was introduced into the EU food chain by a small company in Flanders, which makes a cleaning product for chicken coops to kill chicken mites. The contamination led to the closure of hundreds of poultry farms and blocked the sale of tens of millions of eggs across Northern Europe.\u000a\u000aBelgium first received information that fipronil, which can cause liver damage in humans, contaminated eggs in the country on June 2. It waited until July 20 to inform European partners of the health scare via the EU\u2019s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.\u000a\u000aBelgium reconfigured its system for handling food safety concerns after a crippling dioxin scandal nearly 20 years ago. Its parliament Wednesday grilled Agriculture Minister Denis Ducarme and Health Minister Maggie De Block about the handling of the case during an emergency session.\u000a\u000aLawmakers lambasted the two ministers for not reacting more quickly to the health scare and raised questions about why Belgian food safety authorities had not promptly informed the Cabinet.\u000a\u000aPoultryVision, a Belgian company, sold its fipronil-laced product mostly to ChickFriend, a Dutch company, which travels around the Netherlands and Belgium delousing chicken coops.\u000a\u000aConducting tests on eggs earlier was \u201cnot possible when a country like the Netherlands, one of the biggest egg exporters in the world, does not share its information,\u201d Ducarme said. \u201cI wrote to my Dutch colleague to ask him to explain the absence of exchanges of information throughout the month.\u201d\u000a\u000aBelgium\u2019s Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA) also said the delay was because the Netherlands wasn\u2019t forthcoming with information.\u000a\u000a\u201cConsidering that the businesses [selling fipronil] are located in the Netherlands, information and support were immediately requested from the Dutch food safety authority NVWA. This support was obtained slowly and with difficulty after three weeks,\u201d AFSCA said. \u201cBelgian investigators, therefore, had to work in the dark and had to develop alternative approaches in order to substantiate their inquiries.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Dutch government said it would issue an official statement later Wednesday in response to the Belgian accusations.\u000a\u000aAFSCA\u2019s timeline does not explain what happened immediately after June 2. Belgium did not sound the EU-wide alarm immediately that day because the tests showing fipronil in Belgian eggs came from a private company, rather than being commissioned and checked by the government. Belgium passed its first warning to The Hague on June 15.\u000a\u000aOn June 19, AFSCA said it asked Dutch food safety authority NVWA for information concerning a Dutch company supplying fipronil to Belgian egg producers, according to an internal report obtained by POLITICO. It said it didn\u2019t receive a response until June 28.\u000a\u000aAFSCA said the information was incomplete, forcing it to make an official request to the Netherlands via the EU\u2019s so-called Administrative Assistance and Cooperation System for food fraud on July 6.\u000a\u000aIt was only after a Belgian judge took up the case on July 20 and asked the Dutch for a full list of companies affected by fipronil in Belgium that AFSCA received the information it needed to conduct official health checks.\u000a\u000aMuddying the waters still further, Ducarme said the Belgians had seen an internal Dutch government report that fipronil had been found in eggs in the Netherlands as early as November 2016.

aVFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's hire of Joel Benenson is a signal that he and his wife plan to make their philanthropy more politically focused | Drew Anderer/Getty Images Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg builds political profile, team Benenson will advise the Facebook founder\u2019s philanthropy, but the move comes amid speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have hired Democratic pollster Joel Benenson, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama and the chief strategist to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant, according to a person familiar with the hire.\u000a\u000aBenenson\u2019s company, Benenson Strategy Group, will be conducting research for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the couple\u2019s philanthropy. The organization \u2014 whose mission statement, according to its website, is \u201cadvancing human potential and promoting equality\u201d \u2014 is endowed with the couple\u2019s Facebook fortune.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg and Chan have vowed to give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares, worth an estimated $45 billion, to charity. Bringing on Benenson is the latest sign that they\u2019re pushing their philanthropic work more heavily into the political and policy world.\u000a\u000aIn January, the couple hired David Plouffe, campaign manager for Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run, as president of policy and advocacy. Plouffe had previously worked at Uber. Ken Mehlman, who ran President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign, also sits on the board.\u000a\u000aAnd earlier this year, the couple also brought on Amy Dudley, a former communications adviser to Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine.\u000a\u000aBenenson\u2019s involvement in the group gives them access to someone who was one of the top lieutenants of Clinton\u2019s doomed campaign and Obama\u2019s longtime pollster, just as speculation about Zuckerberg\u2019s political ambitions is mounting.\u000a\u000aBenenson did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative said: \u201cAs a philanthropic organization focused on a number of substantive issues including science, education, housing, and criminal justice reform, any research efforts we undertake is to support that work.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven though he has said he has no interest in running for office, Zuckerberg\u2019s name \u2013 along with just about every other billionaire or elected official with half the name recognition of a second-tier Trump adviser \u2013 has been floated as a potential 2020 presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aZuckerberg, 33, stirred the speculation in June when he posted pictures of his road trip through Iowa, the first state to caucus in the primaries, as part of the tech entrepreneur\u2019s year-long project to visit every U.S. state. He has also toured a Ford assembly plant outside Detroit, a key city in the critical Rust Belt state that Clinton lost to Trump; and Dayton, Ohio, the state long considered an election bellwether.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome of you have asked if this challenge means I\u2019m running for public office,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page last May. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven before his is-he-or-isn\u2019t-he road trip, Zuckerberg had shown an interest in politics and social issues. In 2010, he announced during an appearance on \u201cOprah\u201d that he was donating $100 million to help fix the Newark City public school system. The influx of Facebook cash, however, didn\u2019t generate the desired results, and the gift became a nationally-recognized failure of good intentions.\u000a\u000aBut the hiring of Benenson is sure to fuel speculation that Zuckerberg is getting more serious about how he plays in the political and policy worlds.\u000a\u000aSpeculation, however, may be the beginning and the end of the Zuckerberg for President story.\u000a\u000aThe Benenson Strategy Group does work for many non-profit groups, including AARP, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way Foundation.\u000a\u000aOn July 27, for instance, Gaga tweeted a link to a research study on youth mental wellness that she commissioned from Benenson\u2019s company. The survey, according to Gaga\u2019s Twitter post, included \u201cover 3,000 young people between the ages 15-24 and over 1,000 parents, asking questions about mental health and wellness.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 When do peaceful \u2014 if extremist \u2014 opinions become an incitement to violence? That\u2019s the question British security services are struggling with after a spate of deadly attacks, in which previously nonviolent groups inspired radicalized youth to commit acts of terror.\u000a\u000aAt the center of the debate is al-Muhajiroun, a fundamentalist Islamist network that was formally shut down by the government in 2004 but has continued to live in a series of successor organizations.\u000a\u000aThe perpetrators of at least half of all domestic terrorist attacks in recent years \u2014 including the 2005 London tube bombings and the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in 2012 \u2014 had links to the al-Muhajiroun network, according to a study by Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. And around a third of all European Muslims who went to Syria to fight on behalf of the Islamic State had ties to the group.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an organization that has been sending people abroad to fight for decades, whether it\u2019s going to Chechnya, Syria, Iraq, even Africa,\u201d said Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at the anti-extremism watchdog Hope Not Hate and author of a major report on al-Muhajiroun. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a terror attack in the U.K., one of the first things we do is see if there\u2019s links to al-Muhajiroun because it\u2019s become so regular.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd yet, for the most part, the organization has been allowed to operate in plain sight. Its activities have been so public that a January 2016 Channel 4 documentary showed members of the group unfolding a black Islamic State flag in London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Park.\u000a\u000aA few weeks before the show aired, one of its main characters, Abu Ramaysah, appeared in a video of a beheading carried out by the Islamic State in Syria. Over a year later, another man who appeared in the documentary, Khuram Butt, went on a murderous rampage on London Bridge, killing seven people.\u000a\u000aThe group has made a point of calling attention to itself, with extremist publicity stunts, such as a \u201cmarch against alcohol\u201d in London\u2019s East End, and demonstrations protesting the repatriation of soldiers killed overseas. In 2010, Islamists affiliated with the group set fire to poppies outside London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall and chanted \u201cBritish soldiers burn in hell.\u201d\u000a\u000aAl-Muhajiroun \u201cpreaches a very aggressive exclusionist rhetoric,\u201d said Pantucci, who is also the author of \u201cWe Love Death As You Love Life: Britain\u2019s Suburban Terrorists.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re nonviolent in what they say but the reality is they are very much pushing and agitating a violent direction.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor years, one of al-Muhajiroun\u2019s founders, Anjem Choudary, was a regular fixture on British news shows, as an extremist rent-a-quote who could always be relied on to say something incendiary. \u201cFor a long time, they were laughable,\u201d said Mulhall. \u201cThey did these outrageous stunts that were so extreme they were almost funny. The press found them amusing but didn\u2019t take them seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe stunts \u2014 and the heavy press coverage \u2014 helped the network appeal to new young recruits.\u000a\u000a\u201cI saw Choudary on TV talking about how Muslims are mistreated and \u2026 it appealed to me at the time,\u201d said Hasan (not his real name), a London-based youth worker who was briefly drawn to the group in 2008. \u201cI was angry, I was lost, I was seeing atrocities overseas, I didn\u2019t have anywhere to put that anger.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a sense of community that I didn\u2019t feel I had before because I was lonely and doing badly at my studies,\u201d he added. Hasan did not stay long in the group, as he began feeling alienated by some of its darker rhetoric.\u000a\u000a\u201cPublicly, it was all anti-violence, but as I spent more time [with the group], I just had this feeling that something isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m glad I got out when I did or I dread to think where I could be now.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group\u2019s vocal appearances in the media have been a source of deep frustration for British Muslims, who have long feared that the small extremist network is conveying a false narrative of the community as a whole.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur sensationalist and irresponsible media has, in fact, been deeply complicit in the rise of this fanatic [Choudary], devoting quite disproportionate and counterproductive coverage to his various rantings,\u201d wrote prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan in 2010. A Facebook group named \u201cMuslims Against Anjem Choudary\u201d has nearly 4,000 members.\u000a\u000aFor much of the past decade, al-Muhajiroun has managed to remain just on the right side of various laws prohibiting incitement to violence. And when the authorities would shut down one organization, its members would simply found another, nearly identical group.\u000a\u000aFor example, Islam4UK \u2014 a major recruitment network for the Islamic State \u2014 was banned in 2010, but was replaced the following year by Muslims Against Crusades, which in turn was also banned. Muslims Against Crusades is \u201csimply another name for an organization already proscribed under a number of names,\u201d said then Home Secretary Theresa May, who made the decision to impose the ban in November 2011.\u000a\u000aMore recently, however, as the group\u2019s ties to foreign fighters have become impossible to ignore, the government has started to crack down. In September 2016, Choudary and a co-defendant, Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, were found guilty of providing support to a terrorist organization, the Islamic State. Both men were sentenced to five years and six months in prison.\u000a\u000aThe convictions have left the group weakened, but still potentially dangerous.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that people that are left are still organizing but they don\u2019t seem to have the structures they once did,\u201d said Mulhall.\u000a\u000aThe government crackdown has taken its toll, as has the fact that hundreds of its followers have left for Syria. \u201cBut the legacy of that group still exists, the way they radicalized and indoctrinated people,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we saw [with the attack on London Bridge], it\u2019s a continuing threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aSamira Shackle is a freelance journalist based in London.

aVLONDON \u2014 Britain is about to show its hand in Brexit negotiations in plans that reveal the U.K. wants a smooth route out of the European Union.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. will seek a transitional customs agreement with the EU before moving to a new permanent relationship under plans sent to relevant members of Theresa May\u2019s Cabinet for agreement before being published later this month, according to senior government officials.\u000a\u000aThe proposal \u2014 if it is agreed politically \u2014 will be set out in an official \u201cposition paper\u201d that has been penciled in for publication the week of August 14, an official familiar with the content of the paper said. A second position paper, outlining the government\u2019s long-awaited \u201csolution\u201d to the Northern Ireland border issue, which the U.K. considers bound up with its customs relationship with the EU, has been earmarked for publication the same week, officials said.\u000a\u000aThe position papers will form part of what officials described as a \u201cbig push\u201d to counter a perception among the EU27 that the U.K. is underprepared for Brexit. They are the first of up to a dozen U.K. position papers to be published by the government over the next two months, ahead of the crucial October European Council summit, as set out to POLITICO in conversations with five senior U.K. government officials involved in the preparations for Brexit.\u000a\u000aThe plans show the British government wants a smooth exit from the EU that preserves trading relations in a nod to Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s vision of a more gradual divergence from Brussels as opposed to the hard break preferred by more hard-line cabinet ministers such as Trade Secretary Liam Fox. It is not yet clear whether the proposed transitional arrangement would allow the U.K. to strike trade deals with third countries outside the EU.\u000a\u000aThe bulk of the work on the position papers was completed some time ago, but in recent weeks there has been a discernible \u201cpickup of the pace,\u201d one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a cranking up of the machine into another gear. There is an awareness that we have to get to the European Council having shown seriousness,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s performance during the first substantive round of talks last month was criticized in Brussels and in the British press for appearing slapdash, an impression encapsulated by a photo of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his team seated at the negotiating table without notes, while EU negotiators arrived with reams of papers. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, was particularly frustrated by the U.K.\u2019s refusal to put forward a counter-proposal setting out the cost of divorce.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. will make a concerted effort in the next round of talks later this month to agree on a final package on the rights of EU citizens who want to stay in the U.K. and British citizens living elsewhere in the EU, an issue that is also among the EU27\u2019s top 3 priorities. \u201cWe want to put it to bed as soon as possible,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe will exert some pressure to get that one over the line at the next round.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe plans make clear the U.K.\u2019s priorities for the next rounds of talks. They suggest the two sides are aligned on the importance of citizens\u2019 rights and the need for agreement on the Irish border. The EU has insisted \u201csufficient progress\u201d must be made on its top 3 priorities \u2014 citizens\u2019 rights, Britain\u2019s financial obligations to the EU and the Irish border \u2014 before talks can consider future relations between Britain and the rest of the bloc.\u000a\u000aBut while the EU is likely to welcome the emerging clarity in London\u2019s position, senior U.K. aides said the government remains determined to hold back on resolving how much the U.K. must pay to settle what the EU sees as its financial liabilities, a move that is likely to infuriate Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is also insistent that the Irish border question must be considered alongside future customs arrangements, something the EU wants to delay until its first three priorities are resolved.\u000a\u000aCustoms arrangements \u2018critical\u2019\u000a\u000aWhile Britain\u2019s future customs agreement with the EU is not on the agenda for this month\u2019s Brexit talks, the U.K. believes the issue is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the Northern Ireland question, which Brussels has demanded progress on. By publishing the two documents together before the talks in Brussels, London hopes to persuade Barnier that the two cannot be dealt with separately.\u000a\u000aUnder the original plan drawn up in Whitehall, with input from No. 10 Downing Street, the position papers were set to be published in two tranches \u2014 one before the August talks in Brussels and the second before the next round in September.\u000a\u000aHowever, the publication dates are now in flux, according to aides familiar with the discussions. Officials have even discussed publishing them all simultaneously this month in a show of force to counter accusations that the British government does not have a plan.\u000a\u000aThe customs paper is regarded by the U.K.\u2019s Brexit team as being of \u201ccritical importance,\u201d according to one senior government official involved in the planning process who asked to remain anonymous.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe one we\u2019re looking at most intently is customs,\u201d the official said. There has been input from HMRC \u2014 the department responsible for tax collection \u2014 from the Treasury and from leaders in Northern Ireland, the official added. \u201cThat\u2019s the paper that\u2019s most critical,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe customs position paper will substantially clarify the government\u2019s proposals on an issue that had been left wide open.\u000a\u000aIn her Lancaster House speech in January, May set out a range of options: a completely new customs arrangement; associate membership of the existing customs union; or the U.K. signing up to \u201csome elements\u201d of the customs union and not others.\u000a\u000aHowever, she also ruled out remaining part of the EU\u2019s common commercial policy and common external tariff \u2014 elements of the customs union that, she said, prevent the U.K. striking its own free-trade agreements with other countries.\u000a\u000aA key question for Cabinet to decide will be whether the U.K.\u2019s proposals reconcile May\u2019s wish for \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade with the EU and avoiding arduous customs checks, with the need to liberate Britain from measures that would restrict future bilateral trade talks, either during any transition period or afterward.\u000a\u000aThe position paper dedicated to Northern Ireland will set out the U.K.\u2019s long-awaited proposals for avoiding a \u201chard border\u201d with the Republic of Ireland.\u000a\u000aFox has indicated he would not support a transition arrangement that prevented him making trade deals. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show in July that such a settlement would disadvantage the U.K. if Britain \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to take full advantage of the freedoms available to us when we leave the European Union.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome of his Cabinet colleagues \u2014 most notably Hammond \u2014 have indicated they favor a longer transition. In a speech in June, the chancellor told finance and business leaders in the City of London that Britain will \u201calmost certainly need an implementation period, outside the customs union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running.\u201d He added that such frictionless customs arrangements were needed to keep the Irish land border \u201cfree-flowing.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorthern Ireland proposal\u000a\u000aBoth sides agree Northern Ireland is a priority, though neither has yet put forward a proposal to manage the land border without destabilizing peace in the region once the U.K. leaves the bloc.\u000a\u000aLondon hopes its position paper will break the deadlock on the issue, which is being managed directly by Britain\u2019s leading Brexit official Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union and May\u2019s EU sherpa, and by Barnier\u2019s deputy Sabine Weyand.\u000a\u000aNorthern Ireland is viewed by the EU27 as an exit issue \u2014 and therefore a priority for the initial phases of Brexit talks \u2014 but Britain believes a resolution depends heavily upon issues that the EU considers to be part of the future relationship bucket of issues, namely customs and transition.\u000a\u000aThe position paper dedicated to Northern Ireland will set out the U.K.\u2019s long-awaited proposals for avoiding a \u201chard border\u201d with the Republic of Ireland. While officials declined to share details of the plan, the U.K. government has been considering technical fixes \u2014 such as camera recognition technology and pre-registered cargo \u2014 to minimize the need for physical border check points.\u000a\u000aLondon is not convinced by arguments, made recently by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, that the matter cannot be resolved by such \u201ctechnical solutions.\u201d One of the U.K. officials said Coveney\u2019s comments, to RTÉ in July, had been \u201cpremature.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe British have been \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the more assertive tone of the new Irish administration, under Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the official added. On Friday, Varadkar called on the U.K., if it must leave the EU customs union, to join a new bilateral customs union with the EU similar to Turkey\u2019s.\u000a\u000aWith talks due to resume in the last week of August, both sides in the negotiation will soon find out exactly how far they are apart on key issues.

aVDanielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for The New York Times, said "Fox & Friends" did not attempt to "confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment." New York Times requests apology from Fox on ISIS story\u000a\u000aThe New York Times on Sunday took the unusual step of requesting an apology from a competitor, asking "Fox & Friends" to retract a report that the Times was to blame for the 2015 escape of an ISIS leader. Fox subsequently updated the story on its website with the NYT letter.\u000a\u000a"I am writing on behalf of The New York Times to request an on-air apology and tweet from Fox & Friends in regards to a malicious and inaccurate segment 'NY Times leak allowed ISIS leader to slip away,'\u201d wrote Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for the Times.\u000a\u000aThe "Fox & Friends" report, which aired Saturday, apparently spurred a tweet by President Donald Trump: \u201cThe Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, al-Baghdadi,\u201d the president wrote later Saturday. \u201cTheir sick agenda over National Security.\u201d The "Fox & Friends" hosts had said the Times was "failing in its credibility. It\u2019s failing our country."\u000a\u000aIn her request, Rhoades Ha added: "Neither the staff at Fox & Friends, nor the writers of a related story on Foxnews.com, appeared to make any attempt to confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment."\u000a\u000aLater Sunday, Fox attached the New York Times letter to its original story and issued this statement: "The FoxNews.com story was already updated online and Fox & Friends will also provide an updated story to viewers tomorrow morning based on the FoxNews.com report. For all of their concern about accuracy, the New York Times didn't reach out to anyone at Fox News until Sunday afternoon for a story that ran Friday night."\u000a\u000aMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Tony Thomas, who told Fox that the published report caused a lead to the ISIS leader's whereabouts to go dry. "That was a very good lead. Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,\u201d said Thomas, who leads the U.S. Special Operations Command.\u000a\u000aA Fox News spokesperson said "There is absolutely no comparison between Herridge's brief report on Fox News Sunday" and the Times "reported much more compromising details than Herridge did, in revealing revealing specific details about how Baghdadi communicated and who played a role delivering those communications. Also, [the Times] reported the terrorist's wife was cooperating and how an informant led to the target."\u000a\u000aThe Times claims the pertinent material was actually disclosed by Carter in his public statement and stated that the Pentagon did not object to its more detailed June article.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on background, a Fox News executive slammed Rhoades Ha for seeking the apology only on Sunday afternoon and for alerting reporters at the same time.\u000a\u000a"NYT PR VP Danielle Rhoades Ha did not contact Fox News until Sunday afternoon \u2014 a day and a half AFTER the FoxNews.com story was published. She sent a letter to the reporter on the story \u2014 Catherine Herridge \u2014 at 3:30 pm on Sunday while being too cute by half and sending it to the press simultaneously \u2014 likely bcc\u2019ing reporters," the executive said. (The Times directly emailed POLITICO a copy of the letter that was sent to the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer on Sunday at 3:33 p.m.) "Herridge interviewed General Thomas at the Aspen Security Forum on Friday and did a wrap-up story on the panel for FoxNews.com, which was published on Friday night. Seems like an awfully long time to wait to correct something if they were so concerned about accuracy. And Ha did not reach out to Fox & Friends until 2 p.m. on Sunday for a story that aired Saturday morning. ... Why did it take them so long to reach out?"\u000a\u000aThe executive added: "If we notified the press every time the N.Y. Times had to update an online story or correct something, your inbox would crash."\u000a\u000aIn response, Rhoades Ha said she initially emailed the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer at 12:53 on Sunday, asking for a response by 3 p.m. Rhoades Ha also said she "sent a separate request to Catherine Herridge and her co-author to update their story, which I would have done with or without the Fox & Friends segment. I did not ask Catherine for an apology. She responded and updated her story."\u000a\u000aRhoades Ha said she has yet to receive a response from the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer.\u000a\u000a"We asked them for an apology because the entire premise of their segment is false," Rhoades Ha said. "I find it curious they are focusing on the timing of my emails instead of whether or not their reporting if false."\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, the Times sought clarification from the White House after Trump's tweet:\u000a\u000a"We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet. If the President is referring to this 2015 story, the Pentagon raised no objections with the Times before publishing the story in 2015 and no senior American official ever complained publicly about it until now, as noted in Peter Baker's story this morning."\u000a\u000aUPDATE July 24, 2017:\u000a\u000a\u201cFox & Friends\u201d addressed the Times\u2019 concerns in a segment Monday morning but did not apologize, saying, \u201cThe Times described its 2015 reporting to the Pentagon before publication and they had no objections, and no senior American officials have ever complained publicly \u2013 until now.\u201d The show then directed viewers to read the full statement online.\u000a\u000aIn response, The Times said the updated segment "wasn't an apology, nor did it begin to address the larger issues with the Fox & Friends Weekend segment, one of which was sheer hypocrisy. The host railed against The New York Times for covering a raid stating that the U.S. government 'would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked' to The New York Times when Fox News had covered the same raid three weeks earlier in a segment in which their correspondent said, 'The newly recovered intelligence may bring U.S. closer to Baghdadi's kill or capture,'" a Times spokesperson said. "According to the curious logic of the Fox & Friends host, Fox News itself was unpatriotic."\u000a\u000aIn an updated statement on Monday afternoon, Fox said that "Neither Fox News\u2019 report nor the subsequent on-air coverage was inaccurate." The network then links to a recent piece the Times wrote, explaining why it decided to name a CIA operative in one of its recent stories as something the Times is trying to distract people from by seeking an apology from Fox. "We find it beyond disappointing that the New York Times, in an attempt to distract from their recent debacle, decided to blame Fox News for comments made publicly by General Thomas during a widely viewed panel at the Aspen Security Forum. It might behoove the Times to actually check in with their reporter Eric Schmitt to see whether Gen. Thomas\u2019 comments have merit and whether Schmitt\u2019s reporting in 2015 revealed intelligence that allowed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to slip away.\u201d

It asks more than 120,000 workers to sign a letter telling \u201call responsible politicians\u201d at national and state level to stop \u201cpulling Volkswagen employees into the election campaign,\u201d a union spokesperson said.\u000a\u000aLast month, reports emerged that VW colluded with other major carmakers for decades to thwart competition, which came hot on the heels of the Dieselgate scandal of 2015 which revealed that the firm used special software to cheat in emissions tests.\u000a\u000aAn attempt to get the issue off the agenda last week failed: A meeting between CEOs and politicians in Berlin ended with a deal widely seen as making major concessions to the industry.\u000a\u000aThe critical backlash against the \u201cdiesel summit\u201d prompted stern warnings to the car giants from across the political spectrum, but more than two out of three Germans continue to believe their politicians are too soft on the industry, according to a survey for public broadcaster ARD.\u000a\u000aVolkswagen has attracted particular attention since news emerged that the company was allowed to vet speeches by the state premier of Lower Saxony, the site of the company\u2019s headquarters. That triggered calls for stricter oversight and proposals for a new government office that would oversee VW.\u000a\u000aThe carmaker issued \u201ccommunication guidelines\u201d for the government of David McAllister \u2014 now a prominent MEP \u2014 who ran the state from 2010 to 2013 for Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. His Social Democrat (SPD) successor, current incumbent Stephan Weil, is reported to have allowed VW to edit a speech he gave on the diesel emissions scandal.\u000a\u000aLower Saxony owns a 20 percent stake in VW and the state premier, by virtue of his office, gets a seat on the carmaker\u2019s board of supervisors.\u000a\u000aIG Metall argues that the accusations being thrown around over VW amount to thinly-disguised party political campaigning ahead of the national election in September and a snap regional vote in October.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t complicate things further for Volkswagen employees by trying to make a name for yourself in the political row over Volkswagen,\u201d the petition asks politicians.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s biggest trade union has strong influence over the country\u2019s politicians: When CEOs and politicians sat down for the Diesel summit last week in Berlin, IG Metall was the only group representing employees invited to take part.\u000a\u000aDieselgate and the cozy relationship between carmakers and politicians are turning public opinion against Germany\u2019s most important industry, and the poll for ARD also found that 58 percent of Germans surveyed have \u201clost trust\u201d in the industry. Lower Saxony\u2019s Stephan Weil has come under intense criticism from conservative politicians, some of whom have called for his resignation.\u000a\u000aVolkswagen declined to comment directly on the matter, but pointed out that it was normal for members of the supervisory board to coordinate their statements with the company.\u000a\u000aLower Saxony holds snap elections on October 15, after the current government lost its parliamentary majority due to an unrelated defection by a lawmaker last week.

aVFormer Vice President Joe Biden has been critical of his own party\u2019s failings since leaving office. | Getty Biden launches PAC, keeping options open\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden will launch a new PAC, American Possibilities, giving him a way to support Democratic political candidates while keeping his own options open for a potential 2020 presidential run.\u000a\u000aOfficially, the group will be \u201cdedicated to electing people who believe that this country is about dreaming big, and supporting groups and causes that embody that spirit," according to the PAC's launch materials\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBiden has hired Greg Schultz, his political director during his second term as vice president, as the executive director of the PAC.\u000a\u000a\u201cThinking big is stamped into the DNA of the American soul,\u201d Biden wrote in a post that will go live on Medium in the morning. \u201cThat\u2019s why the negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics today drives me crazy. It\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\u000a\u000aThough he repeatedly bashed Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year and again at an appearance in New Hampshire in late April, Biden has been just as critical of his own party\u2019s failings.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m absolutely positive they want to be with us, but we have to prove again that we understand that hopelessness,\u201d he said in New Hampshire. \u201cWe have to show them, we have to be the source of their hope.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd he\u2019s made clear in private, and to an extent in public, how disappointing he found Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and his problems with her as a messenger of the Democratic Party.\u000a\u000aThough the PAC is geared toward helping other candidates, the website launching with it is centered on photos of Biden: holding a baby on the campaign trail, seated waving in front of a giant American flag, and locking arms with Rep. John Lewis and others in a commemorative march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.\u000a\u000aThe email to supporters and donors ends on a tantalizing note: \u201cSee you out there.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aV"FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences," spokesman Jason Maloni said in a statement. | Olivier Douliery/Sipa USA FBI raid on Manafort's home shows Russia probe ramping up Manafort's lawyers have said he is cooperating with congressional probes and special counsel Robert Mueller, but the FBI raid indicates that Mueller's office may not believe it is getting full cooperation.\u000a\u000aFBI agents raided the residence of former Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort last month, and he also has turned over hundreds of pages of documents to congressional investigators, as probes ramp up into the president\u2019s campaign and Russia's role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000aThe pre-dawn raid on July 26 at the Alexandria, Virginia, home roused Manafort, who was in town to appear before Congress, according to a person familiar with the situation. Agents took reams of material from his home.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well," said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for the former Trump campaign chairman.\u000a\u000aManafort is also under scrutiny from congressional investigators, and he has turned over 400 pages of documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee, a committee spokesman said Wednesday, including information on his foreign lobbying work.\u000a\u000aThe longtime Republican campaign operative and lobbyist has also provided information to the Senate Intelligence Committee about a meeting he attended at Trump Tower last year with a Russian lawyer. The meeting was originally billed as a chance to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aManafort's lawyers have said he is cooperating with congressional probes and special counsel Robert Mueller, but the FBI raid, first reported Wednesday by The Washington Post, indicates that Mueller's office may not believe it is getting full cooperation, according to several former federal prosecutors and attorneys involved in the Russia probe.\u000a\u000aMueller spokesman Joshua Stueve declined to comment on the raid.

And they also do not do this to \u2018send a message.\u2019 They do it because they think there is evidence to be found and that if they do not act aggressively, it could be destroyed.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who this week got into a public spat with Trump, called the Manafort search \u201ca significant and even stunning development.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis kind of raid \u2014 in the early morning hours with no advance notice \u2014 shows an astonishing and alarming distrust for the president\u2019s former campaign chairman. It seems to decimate his claim that he is cooperating with law enforcement,\u201d Blumenthal said.\u000a\u000aDuke Law School professor Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor, said a search warrant would be needed only if Mueller doubted Manafort would comply with document requests or a subpoena.\u000a\u000a"Of course it confirms, beyond doubt, serious, criminal investigative focus on Manafort," Buell said.\u000a\u000aAnother former federal prosecutor, Renato Mariotti, said the FBI\u2019s search warrant likely goes into detail on what information federal authorities were permitted to seize from Manafort\u2019s home. He said Manafort should have received a copy of the document during the raid, and if one becomes public it will open a large \u201cwindow into what the FBI is investigating.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven more explosive, according to white-collar defense attorney William Jeffress, could be the FBI affidavit approved by a federal judge that cleared the way for last month\u2019s raid. That document, normally kept under a court seal, likely spells out in detail what the government intends to accomplish in the investigation. \u201cI\u2019m sure that is dynamite,\u201d said Jeffress, who represented Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, in the investigation into who leaked the identify of CIA operative Valerie Plame.\u000a\u000aA Washington-based defense lawyer with a client caught in the Russia probe said Mueller may also want to turn Manafort into a cooperative witness, something the former campaign manager's representatives had previously said wasn't happening.\u000a\u000a\u201cManafort is on many levels a key subject of the investigation and someone who might be leveraged to share information about others,\u201d the white-collar attorney said.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department gave Mueller significant authority upon his appointment in May as special counsel to examine \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\u201d That mandate included picking up on previous FBI work examining Manafort, who served as chairman of Trump\u2019s campaign starting in March 2016 before moving into the role of campaign manager that June.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Associated Press, Manafort was actually under FBI scrutiny starting in early 2014 \u2014 more than a year before Trump announced his presidential bid \u2014 when federal officials started looking into Manafort\u2019s lobbying work on behalf of pro-Kremlin officials in Ukraine.\u000a\u000aManafort is only one prong in a Mueller probe that is examining a wide range of issues related to the 2016 election, including the use of Kremlin-linked social media bots to influence American voters on Trump\u2019s behalf; the hacks into email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta; and Trump\u2019s decision in May to fire FBI Director James Comey.\u000a\u000aMueller has a team of 16 attorneys working on the investigation, and he\u2019s also using a grand jury in Washington to present evidence, question witnesses and issue subpoenas for business and financial records.\u000a\u000aCongress is also moving ahead on its examinations into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee was aiming to interview nearly 90 witnesses before it broke for the August recess, and Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) has said he is trying to finish his investigation by the end of 2017. The Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has received documents from the Trump campaign and Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who organized the meeting last year with the Moscow-connected lawyer who offered dirt on Clinton.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s campaign has turned over about 20,000 pages of documents to the Senate Judiciary panel, the committee's spokesman said. Trump Jr. has provided about 250 pages. ABC News first reported on the documents being given to the Senate panel.\u000a\u000aThe committee spokesman said Glenn Simpson, founder of the firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier of unsubstantiated allegations about Trump during the campaign, has yet to provide the panel any documents.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

It still didn\u2019t stop illegal activities along the border and we know that that\u2019s a reality.\u201d\u000a\u000aVaradkar has repeatedly said he does not want to see an economic border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, adding that he does not believe an invisible border \u2014 using the likes of camera recognition technology and preregistered cargo \u2014 would be effective. Although Varadkar is from a different party, Fine Gael, Roche stood by the PM.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he\u2019s absolutely correct in being forthright in saying that it won\u2019t work,\u201d said Roche. \u201cThere is a solution if everybody sits down and thinks in terms of an all-island solution where we can continue to have free travel for persons and with very little disruption, we could continue to have free movements of goods.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoche also called on the British government to provide more clarity on its Brexit position.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s time there is an outbreak of common sense in London,\u201d said Roche. \u201cThe unionist population and the unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have to be brought closer into the discussions. But we still don\u2019t know what the British government\u2019s position is actually going to be. And this is so frustrating. I mean it\u2019s boiling frustration under the surface here in the Republic because this is so critical for the wellbeing of the entire island.\u201d\u000a\u000aRoche added that Varadkar should stop further progress in Brexit negotiations if U.K. officials cannot present a working plan for the Irish border.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think sometimes you have to speak on strong terms to even your best friends. We\u2019ve a great relationship with the U.K. \u2026 We have a good relationship north and south of the border since the agreements. And it would be absolutely reprehensible if politicians don\u2019t wake up to the realities that without some creative thinking, they\u2019re not going to solve this particular problem.\u201d

aVIf, as he has clearly signaled, President Donald Trump chooses in the coming months to hold Iran in noncompliance of the nuclear accord, the impact will be felt in Tehran and the already volatile Middle East.\u000a\u000aBut the more serious casualty could be both more widespread and more distant\u2014thousands of miles away, on the Korean Peninsula. And the Trump administration needs to begin connecting the dots now.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe United States has few options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear challenge, and no good ones. A pre-emptive strike risks an unspeakable catastrophe. Sanctions have not worked, and tightening them further is no more likely to. Diplomatic talks will be difficult for the United States because an agreement would involve a compromise that would allow North Korea to keep its nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, if the goal is to prevent Pyongyang from developing an accurate nuclear-tipped ICBM, then negotiating with Pyongyang may well be the only way to try to defuse a looming crisis.\u000a\u000aEven under current conditions, such talks would be fraught, the odds tilted against success. But if the U.S. thrusts aside the nuclear deal with Iran\u2014and uses contrived evidence to do so\u2014the message to North Korea and others will be that America\u2019s word is disposable and the U.S. cannot be trusted to honor its commitments. This would deal a possibly fatal blow to any chance of a diplomatic effort to, if not halt or reverse, at a minimum slow down North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u000a\u000aIndeed, walking away from the Iran deal, or contriving circumstances that force Iran to do so, would not only open up a now dormant nuclear crisis with Tehran, it would also close down perhaps the only option that might prevent a far more dangerous crisis with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea already harbors heightened suspicion and mistrust of Washington\u2019s motives, fearing that the U.S.\u2019 real objective is removal of the Kim regime and reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korean leadership. U.S. abandonment, without just cause, of the Iran deal would both validate and exacerbate those beliefs; to Pyongyang, the lesson would be that Washington saw diplomacy merely as a prelude to efforts to isolate, pressure and seek to remove the Iranian regime. Why would Kim Jong Un even begin negotiations if he is convinced that Washington would then look for excuses to unravel an agreement, should one be reached?\u000a\u000aThe message from Washington, of course, would not be heard in Pyongyang alone. The administration\u2019s too-clever-by-half strategy of messing around with the Iranian nuclear accord\u2014doing just enough to tempt Tehran to walk away from the deal after Trump publicly acknowledged that his goal is to undo it\u2014almost certainly would undermine its credibility with nations whose cooperation it desperately needs to deal with the North Korean nuclear challenge. The recent unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea demonstrates two things: first, that a unilateral U.S. approach is impracticable; and second, that China and Russia can be useful partners in pressing Pyongyang on its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. If anything, the Trump administration is banking too heavily on Beijing to somehow solve the problem on our behalf.\u000a\u000aBut consider China\u2019s reaction should the U.S. treat the nuclear agreement with Iran in a slapdash, dismissive manner. Beijing might well be angered given its interests in buying Iran\u2019s oil and investing in its infrastructure. But it would be positively alarmed at the implications for North Korea, which presents China with a major security headache on its doorstep. China long has maintained that diplomacy with Pyongyang is the only viable answer to the North Korean nuclear problem, and it believes in the six-party format, which, not entirely unlike the seven-party format of the Iran negotiations, includes both China and the U.S. The precedent of the U.S. effectively dismissing an accord negotiated by a team of countries and ratified by the U.N. Security Council would give China considerable pause, raise serious questions in its mind about whether the U.S. can be trusted not to act similarly with North Korea, and make it virtually impossible for Beijing to vouch for Washington\u2019s good faith vis-à-vis Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aAllies also might lose faith. Throughout the long-simmering nuclear crisis with North Korea, the Bush and Obama administrations managed to preserve solidarity with South Korea and Japan. Going forward, any sustainable solution to this crisis will require implementation of a joint U.S.-South Korea strategy backed by Japan. Moon Jae-In, South Korea\u2019s newly elected president, is a strong proponent of engagement with the North, and both Seoul and Tokyo are desperate to contain the North\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. It\u2019s hardly an exaggeration to suggest that both would be apoplectic if, by repudiating the nuclear accord with Iran, the U.S. effectively cut off the path to a diplomatic solution on the peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe odds against a negotiated agreement with North Korea are preternaturally long, but it would be the height of irresponsibility not to test its possibility. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently offered the welcome suggestion that the U.S. is open to diplomacy and reassurance to Pyongyang that the U.S. is not intent on regime change. Surely, both he and others in the administration\u2014Generals James Mattis, H.R. McMaster and John Kelly in particular, all of whom reportedly lobbied for Trump to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear accord the last time around\u2014understand how hollow those words will ring if, the next time certification is in play, they fail to persuade the president. The least one can hope is that they will see the linkage, because it\u2019s a pretty good bet that this president won\u2019t. And it\u2019s just as good a bet that, by failing to peek just around the corner, he would be creating the prospect of a two-front nuclear crisis that America and the world can ill afford.\u000a\u000aAaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.\u000a\u000aRichard Sokolsky is a non-resident senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

aVAUSTIN, Tex., June 23\u2014 It was a tale of Texan proportions, complete with epic name-calling, massive lobbying and political skulduggery. It was Ross Perot's foray into the turbulent world of education reform -- and it offers a rare chance to examine how he operates in a political arena.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot proved he could learn quickly, sell bold policies to the public and ram them through a reluctant Legislature. But he also showed a taste for attention-grabbing invective that alienated some of the very people whose help he needed to change the state's education system.\u000a\u000aIn 1984, Texas adopted one of the most sweeping education laws in its history, paid for by its first state tax increase in 13 years. Although he must share credit with top state officials, it was Mr. Perot who led the charge. It was he who barnstormed the state in his own jet convening public hearings on Texas's schools. It was his biting one-liners that sold many Texans on the changes. It was his money that paid for one of the biggest lobbying efforts this state capital had ever witnessed. Measure of Leadership\u000a\u000aMr. Perot touts the $2.8 billion education package as proof that business methods, plain speaking and listening to people are indeed what it takes to forge policies, make changes and lead a nation. The law established a state preschool program for children with disadvantages, shifted school aid from rich to poor districts, reduced class sizes in early grades, toughened academic standards, mandated testing for teachers and raised teachers' salaries but linked raises to performance. And in a state where football reigned supreme, the law required students to pass all their courses or give up extracurricular activities like team sports.\u000a\u000aTo shake up education in Texas, Mr. Perot used the very methods he says he would apply as President to all national policies: Convene experts; hold extensive public meetings; decide on a policy; and beat back every attempt to compromise it.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot did not answer messages left at his headquarters requesting comment on his role in the education law.\u000a\u000aIt is clear that for all Mr. Perot's protestations about the evils of political action committees and political insiders, he knew how to leverage his considerable influence and money to railroad opponents.\u000a\u000a"It was like being in a sword fight with a pocket knife," said Eddie Joseph, executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. The coaches fought Mr. Perot bitterly on the law, along with most Texas teachers unions, the state board of education and several powerful legislators.\u000a\u000aIt is less certain whether Mr. Perot could have succeeded had he actually been in government. He did not have to worry about angering those whose support might be crucial for re-election. Some of his opponents say his acid tongue and occasional strong-arm tactics alienated many school insiders.\u000a\u000aRidiculing the widespread practice of making coaches principals, for example, Mr. Perot would ask all administrators to stand up during the public hearings he held across the state, recalled Becky Brooks, a teachers union lobbyist. Then he would ask those who were coaches to sit down. Nearly everybody sat, proving Mr. Perot's point, but humiliating coaches and many administrators.\u000a\u000aNor do observers agree on the lasting impact of the education law, although most believe it marked a dramatic step forward for Texas schools. Texas Whirlwind More Than State Had Bargained For\u000a\u000aThe education law that Mr. Perot helped shape and pass sought far-reaching changes. It gave Texas a preschool program for poor and non-English-speaking children. It transformed school finances, the state's first step toward redressing huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.\u000a\u000aTeachers received raises, but had to pass a competency test to keep their jobs. The law set maximum class sizes of 22 in early grades and required high-school students to pass a proficiency test to graduate. The infamous "no pass, no play" rule took on some of Texas's most sacred institutions, including football and county fairs, by forbidding students who failed a course to participate in extracurricular activities.\u000a\u000aTexas officials had not planned on legislation so sweeping. But Gov. Mark White had promised teachers raises, and he decided he needed an influential businessman to help persuade the Legislature to raise the taxes to pay for them. In June 1983 he asked Mr. Perot to head a Select Committee on Public Education. 9-Month Investigation\u000a\u000aGovernor White got more than he had bargained for. Mr. Perot set the committee's agenda from the start, plunging it into a nine-month investigation of Texas schools. He paid education experts to testify before his committee, commissioned surveys of Texas teachers, held committee meetings in plush Dallas hotels with catered meals, flew an entourage of about 50 people around the state for public hearings and paid Thomas W. Luce, a prominent attorney and now head of his petition drive, to manage the effort.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot did not like what he found, and he told Texans so in blunt, uncompromising terms. Texas had world-class education in only a few areas, he said: "drill team, band and football." The state would no longer be able to count on oil to stay prosperous; it's children would need solid educations to compete in a high-technology world.\u000a\u000aTexans did not care enough about education, he said. Schools spent money on towel warmers and multimillion-dollar stadiums. "Kids who can barely read and write are leaving school at noon to cook hamburgers so they can make payments on their cars," he told audiences. His signature anecdote was a story about the boy who had been absent from school 35 days so that he could exhibit his pet chicken at livestock shows.\u000a\u000aBut what got people talking was one state icon, Mr. Perot, taking on another: football, a game that defines Friday nights in Texas.\u000a\u000a"It was very difficult to tell during the heat of that battle whether he was a hero or Public Enemy No. 1," said George Christian, a lobbyist who later worked for Mr. Perot.\u000a\u000aTexans are still divided. Many who worked with him, and even some who fought him on the education bill, said he was a sympathetic listener, an engaging and convincing talker. Visionary or Demagogue?\u000a\u000aSome people complain that he didn't budge in the end. "When he talks about his town meetings, maybe Ross Perot has a vision of how things ought to be settled pre-town meeting, and maybe he uses the town meeting to solidify that," suggested Ms. Brooks, then president-elect of the Texas State Teachers Association, which fought the bill.\u000a\u000aSonia Hernandez, then a high-school principal and president of a grass-roots group working on school-finance issues, remembers a different Perot. After he had angered Hispanic parents by criticizing bilingual education, she asked him to reconsider and visit her school. "A couple of weeks later, I got this phone call out of the blue: Mr. Perot's in his plane, and he's going to land shortly, and he'd like to see what you're talking about." He came, listened and modified his position.\u000a\u000aOthers, however, saw him as dictatorial, simplistic and inflammatory. His cutting remarks made implacable enemies, like the longtime chairman of the State Board of Education, whose portrait, Mr. Perot once suggested, "may glow in the dark."\u000a\u000aHe attacked courses such as drivers' education: "That's where they house the assistant coaches who are too dumb to teach regular classes."\u000a\u000aMr. Joseph of the coaches association said, "A lot of it was demagoguery."\u000a\u000aDemagoguery or no, Mr. Perot's sound bite transfixed Texans, convincing many that their schools had to change. "That's where he came through, drawing up the final recommendations and selling them," said Camilla Bordie, who worked on the committee. "What was sold was the four or five main thrusts. You can kill the public with details, and he knows better than to do that." Lobbying Tactics Suffer No Fools, Take No Prisoners\u000a\u000aAt the opening of the June 1984 special legislative session convened to consider education reform, it appeared that Mr. Perot's bill was in serious trouble. He had angered many of the state's most powerful political groups: teachers unions, vocational educators, coaches, the State Board of Education and wealthy school districts that feared a drop in state aid.\u000a\u000aA member of the State Board of Education hosted a lavish barbecue for legislators at a lakeside retreat, with swimming, water skiing and volleyball. The message got through; a survey of legislators by a Texas newspaper when the session began showed only a few willing to vote for the bill.\u000a\u000aIn response, Mr. Perot unleashed a massive lobbying effort and drew on his influence in his home state. Mr. Perot loaned five of his own lobbyists and lawyers from Electronic Data Systems, his computer services company, to the effort, sent Mr. Luce to Austin to lead the charge, and hired three of the state's most influential lobbyists. He "hired anybody who was warm," recalled Bill Hobby, then Lieutenant Governor. Inspired a Verse\u000a\u000aMr. Perot even sent female employees from Electronic Data Systems to talk to legislators and help host parties -- a common practice and master stroke, Ms. Brooks of the teachers association says.\u000a\u000aMr. Hobby commemorated the E.D.S. women in a poem he wrote about the battle: What with taxes and all, Lobbyists were thick as roaches. So it took all the Luce women To win the war against coaches.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot helped forge a new alliance between traditional business groups and the state's growing high-technology industries, which were already demanding an improved education system. In the months before the session, he crisscrossed Texas addressing influential business groups: chambers of commerce, the Houston Board of Realtors, the Texas and Southwest Cattle Raisers Association. He videotaped his speech and sent it to places he did not visit personally.\u000a\u000a"Mr. Perot did essentially what Reagan did; he went beyond the system and appealed to the people and sold them on the need for reform," said Jack Vowell, a Republican state legislator from El Paso who opposed the bill. "If pressure came to me to support the movement, it did not come from Mr. Perot; it came from my constituents, who felt like this was a good idea."\u000a\u000aIn the fight to move the bill through the Legislature, Mr. Perot, or at least the lobbyists he hired, proved to be masterful coalition builders. To pay for the expensive education wish-list, lawmakers would have to raise taxes for the first time in 13 years. Mr. Perot's allies chose to increase gasoline taxes, assuring the help of the powerful highway lobby because most of the tax revenues would be used for roads. All or Nothing\u000a\u000aThe same stubborn refusal to compromise that makes some people wary of Mr. Perot proved invaluable in forcing fundamental educational changes after years of failed efforts, veterans of Texas political battles say. He insisted that lawmakers pass all his recommendations or none of them.\u000a\u000a"He did not permit the Legislature to cut it up in little pieces," said Craig Foster, executive director of the Equity Center, an association of poor school districts. "It shortcut all the usual nonsense. Leadership is bringing things to closure and getting on with it. That's what Ross Perot does better than anyone I've ever seen."\u000a\u000aAs influential as Mr. Perot was, he did not single-handedly turn around Texas education. Some of the most important political support and maneuvering came from Governor White, Lieutenant Governor Hobby and Gib Lewis, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. When the House Education Committee gutted the school bill in a daylong session, Mr. Lewis reportedly threatened to strip the chairman of his post unless he introduced a bill that incorporated Mr. Perot's recommendations.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot got much of the credit for the new law, but it was Governor White who paid a political price. He lost his re-election bid in 1986 -- a defeat he and others attributed to the anger of the powerful teacher unions and the coaches association. A Mixed Legacy Time Has Dimmed Legislation's Glory\u000a\u000aAt the time, the legislation was hailed by education experts as a quantum leap forward for Texas schools. The mid-1980's were a time when sweeping education acts were being enacted by several states, including Arkansas under Gov. Bill Clinton and Tennessee under Gov. Lamar Alexander, now Secretary of Education. Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, which monitors school reform around the country, called Texas's law a "reasonably good example," although he believes that South Carolina's changes were probably the best in the nation.\u000a\u000aYet even eight years later, some of the changes enacted in Texas's schools seem visionary -- particularly in early childhood education, school finance and public attitudes about education.\u000a\u000aTexas was ahead of its time in creating a state version of the Federal Head Start program for preschoolers. Educators continue to call for more emphasis on early childhood education, and Ms. Hernandez, now director of education for Gov. Ann W. Richards, says the impact of these programs in Texas has been enormous.\u000a\u000aThe law overhauled school financing, marking Texas's first real effort to address huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot's support for the last two provisions -- whose proponents at the time were generally liberals -- shows his political eclecticism.\u000a\u000aAnd his fighting words forever changed the political landscape in education. "A lot of people in their very own school districts started asking a lot of questions," said Ms. Bordie, who was on the committee staff. "A lot of the reforms that occurred were not the result of the Legislature so much as Perot highlighting the issue and making people pay more attention to what was going on in their own school."\u000a\u000aThe "no pass, no play" law infuriated many parents who felt that their children were being unfairly penalized, and it spawned a rush of lawsuits. But it also drove coaches to insure that their students got tutoring help, Ms. Hernandez said.\u000a\u000aMr. Perot lost one major battle. He wanted a permanently appointed State Board of Education, reasoning that an elected group would not take on powerful vested interests. The law did establish an appointed board for four years, but voters turned down a referendum that would have made it permanent. Mr. Cole says that defeat allowed many who opposed further changes to sabotage the law effectively. Mixed Record of Success\u000a\u000aAnd the 1984 law led to only modest improvements in student achievement. "We've had some changes in attitude, but, regrettably, many of the schools look the same as in 1983," said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, the only union that supported the bill.\u000a\u000aScores did climb steadily on the tests the law required, and the dropout rate fell from 34 percent to 21 percent. But that is still relatively high, and in the 1989-90 school year 23 percent of high-school seniors could not pass an English and math test required for graduation.\u000a\u000aSome of the legislated changes brought unforeseen problems, particularly in light of the deep recession that hit Texas after the law was passed. Limiting class sizes to 22 in the lower grades is still widely praised, but it forced school districts to hire more teachers, and it strained budgets. The school-finance system has been ruled unconstitutional three times in the last four years, twice because, despite the 1984 law, huge inequities remained between rich and poor school districts, and once because the remedy was financed with an illegal tax. It is still being challenged in the courts.\u000a\u000aSenator Parker, Governor White and nearly every teacher in Texas say that the teacher competency test, administered once in 1986, was a big mistake. Fewer than 1 percent of teachers failed, but the experience insulted and angered them.\u000a\u000a"He got crossways with teachers, and that could have been avoided," Senator Parker said.\u000a\u000aEducation experts now say that the Texas law, like others of those years, focused too much on rule-making and too little on setting goals for students and letting teachers help them achieve those goals any way that works.\u000a\u000a"In hindsight, they look very outmoded," Mr. Newman said. "But they said: 'Attention! The old world of half-baked schools isn't good enough.'

aVTrump endorses bill to halve legal immigration The bill sells itself as a way to raise wages and create jobs \u2014 and it would drastically reduce legal immigration over the next decade.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump came out Wednesday for a bill that would reduce legal immigration by one-half over the next decade.\u000a\u000aTrump joined Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia to present a reworked version of the so-called RAISE Act, S. 354 (115), which the senators introduced in February. Like the original measure, the revised bill would, over 10 years, reduce legal immigration to roughly 500,000 annually, down from the current level of about 1 million.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe bill would favor worker skills over family ties in determining who may immigrate to the U.S., and \u201cwould represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in a half a century," Trump said. The president appeared to refer to the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, a landmark Great Society law that ended four decades of strict limitations and vastly increased immigration by non-Europeans.\u000a\u000aBut the Cotton-Perdue bill faces steep odds of becoming law, given likely opposition from Democrats and pro-immigration Republicans. In a written statement, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that while "I've always supported merit-based immigration," the bill's halving of immigration "would be devastating to our state\u2019s economy."\u000a\u000aTrump, along with Cotton and Perdue, stressed that a reduction in legal immigration and a shift to skills-based admissions would boost wages for U.S. workers and promote economic growth. That view conflicts with a near consensus among economists that economic growth will require a large expansion of the U.S. workforce.\u000a\u000aCotton, a strong proponent of lower immigration levels, called the current immigration system \u201can obsolete disaster,\u201d ripe for reform. He said the current annual level of legal immigration equals the population of Montana, and stressed that today most new lawful permanent residents come to the U.S. because of family ties.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Spouses and minor children would still have preference under the measure.\u000a\u000aThe legislation would also eliminate the diversity visa lottery, which makes available 50,000 visas to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the bill would cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000, the level Trump called for in the travel ban executive order that he issued in March.\u000a\u000aTo rank incoming immigrants, the legislation would institute a \u201cpoints system\u201d similar to the admissions processes in Canada and Australia. Among the criteria would be education, English-language ability, prospective salary, age, entrepreneurship and past achievements.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aV'I don\u2019t really do anything halfway,' Debbie Wasserman Schultz told POLITICO. DNC chair's power play\u000a\u000aDebbie Wasserman Schultz spent 18 months slogging through 885 events in 31 states to boost President Barack Obama\u2019s chances for reelection.\u000a\u000aNow, she is planning to employ the nearly unrivaled Rolodex she\u2019s built to turn it into political muscle in the Capitol \u2014 for herself.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Florida Democrat is using the Democratic National Committee\u2019s extensive and deep-pocketed donor network to construct a stronger and more expansive political operation, and at least \u201cdouble\u201d the money she gives to Democrats in the House, Senate and state capitals around the country, she said in an interview.\u000a\u000a( PHOTOS: Celebrities spotted at the DNC)\u000a\u000aPower in the Democratic Party will soon be up for grabs. Nancy Pelosi, who has for years been the top House Democratic fundraiser, won\u2019t be around forever. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer is the heir apparent, but once Pelosi leaves, there will be a void that needs to be filled.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz\u2019s political team explicitly said her goal this cycle is to give away as much money as Hoyer \u2014 $2.5 million \u2014 which would position her to be one of the party\u2019s biggest ATMs and a player, if she wants.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t really do anything halfway,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told POLITICO in an interview at DNC headquarters. \u201cWe thought with the higher profile I have at the DNC, and the donor relationships I\u2019ve been able to build \u2014 and thankfully, a lot of people who want to help me be successful, because we share the same goals. We kind of put the leadership PAC on steroids. That\u2019s the best way to describe it.\u201d\u000a\u000a( VIDEO: Debbie Wasserman Schultz not calling for Anthony Weiner to exit race)\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not clear what Wasserman Schultz wants \u2014 she pointedly wouldn\u2019t rule out running for leadership, governor or senator.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far, the people of the 23rd Congressional District still continue to want me to represent them, and I don\u2019t have any immediate plans to run for statewide office, but I can\u2019t tell you I would never run for statewide office,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aHer ascension in the House Democratic Caucus is not assured. Some of her House colleagues feel she hasn\u2019t created the personal relationships necessary to build a coalition to support a leadership run. Others have grumbled that she hasn\u2019t done enough for them since joining the DNC \u2014 one source pointed out that Hoyer, as well as Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel and Rep. Joe Crowley, both of New York, all have contributed more to the House committee.\u000a\u000aHer staff counters that she raised and gave just more than $2.3 million for her colleagues in 2011 and 2012 \u2014 including $1.26 million that she raised and contributed on her own. DCCC insiders level sharper criticisms and say that she went after their donors from her perch at the DNC.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s times I call up a donor that is a mutual donor of all three or four or five entities and Steve Israel has gotten to them before me, and there\u2019s a cap and they\u2019ve maxed and their max out donation isn\u2019t available for us anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s happened to him \u2014 I assume it has. Look, we\u2019re all on the same team.\u201d\u000a\u000aThen there is her relationship with Obama. She didn\u2019t have a great rapport with some of the key players in the administration \u2014 but she was asked to serve as DNC chairwoman for another four years.\u000a\u000aBut if the next few years go as she plans, she will be nearly impossible to dismiss.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz already has started her campaign by contributing and raising nearly $1 million for 35 members this year. Her second quarter DWS PAC fundraising haul was roughly $368,000 for her leadership PAC \u2014 the most she\u2019s raised in a quarter, according to Federal Election Commission reports.\u000a\u000aBetween now and October, she\u2019ll hit Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. She\u2019ll also visit Montana, a new state in her 2014 fundraising travel schedule.\u000a\u000aPart of her strong fundraising showing is due to Lindsey Schulte, a former DCCC aide who is now executive director of her PAC. Most of Wasserman Schultz\u2019s team \u2014 Jason O\u2019Malley, her longtime political hand and top communications aide Jonathan Beeton \u2014 have been loyal to the Florida Democrat for more than a decade.\u000a\u000aHer political staff, which is holed up in the DNC headquarters in Southeast D.C., is planning to \u201cdo things with the leadership PAC that have never been done before.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very engaged in helping Democrats,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. Pressed whether that meant they would run advertisements on behalf of members, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be very engaged in helping elect Democrats \u2014 assuming we meet our goals.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem, partially because the timing of her chairmanship of the DNC has been fortuitous. Obama forbade his party committee from taking money from lobbyists and corporate political action committees \u2014 something no other DNC chair has had to contend with \u2014 so Wasserman Schultz has had to rely on individual donors around the country. And that meant meeting a lot of really rich people.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

Castro expanded a little more in a June interview on the Austin PBS show \u201cOverheard with Evan Smith,\u201d telling the Texas Tribune\u2019s Smith that he will \u201clook and see how things develop over the next year or so and then make a decision as to whether that\u2019s something I want to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe is taking several preliminary steps associated with presidential campaigns; in addition to forming a political group, Castro is also writing a memoir.\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s signature accomplishment as San Antonio\u2019s mayor was championing a one-eighth cent sales tax increase to fund new pre-kindergarten centers, and as secretary of Housing and Urban Development he described the department as \u201cthe Department of Opportunity.\u201d On the national political stage, Castro delivered a well-received keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention \u2014 where he called on the nation to \u201cinvest in opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow\u201d \u2014 before then-President Barack Obama nominated him to the Cabinet in 2014.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He traveled to Georgia to help Democrat Jon Ossoff turn out voters ahead of the special House election there, and Castro has also endorsed Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign for governor in Florida and former HUD staffer Colin Allred\u2019s congressional run in the Dallas suburbs.\u000a\u000aOpportunity First has filed paperwork both as a federal PAC and as a \u201c527\u201d organization to give the group flexibility to play in congressional and non-federal elections, a source said. 527 groups are allowed to collect contributions in unlimited amounts, but it\u2019s not clear if Castro\u2019s group will accept donations above the federal PAC limit.\u000a\u000aCastro is one of several potential Democratic presidential candidates who have formed new political organizations in recent months, the earliest maneuvers in what is expected to be a long and crowded fight to be the party\u2019s 2020 nominee.\u000a\u000aMontana Gov.

aVBERLIN \u2014 To understand Angela Merkel\u2019s campaign strategy, look no further than the posters her party is about to splash all over Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cEnjoy the summer now, and make the right choice in the fall,\u201d one of them tells voters, depicting a dreamy young woman in a meadow.\u000a\u000aAfter the conservative chancellor returns from her three-week vacation on Friday, her main goal is to ensure the final stretch of the campaign up to the September 24 election remains low-key. Or, as one official from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) put it: \u201cIf everything stays the way it is right now, any move is a move too many.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith just over six weeks to go until Germany votes for a new parliament, Merkel\u2019s conservatives are comfortably polling over 40 percent. Her main rival, former European Parliament President Martin Schulz, has little to show for the three weeks he spent on the campaign trail while Merkel was enjoying a hike in the Italian Alps. Despite rushing from retirement homes to factories, Schulz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) continue to poll below 25 percent, more than 15 percentage points behind Merkel.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe race for No. 1 is over,\u201d Christian Lindner, party chief of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), a potential coalition partner for the conservatives, said last weekend, echoing widespread opinion among commentators and pollsters.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermans want to be left in peace. It\u2019s finally summer, they\u2019re slowly coming back from holidays, everyone has a job, there are barely any refugees visible anymore\u201d \u2014 Conservative official\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s strategy, which has helped the long-time chancellor get reelected twice already, is to avoid confrontation, safe in the knowledge that her supporters will cast their votes for her conservatives whether she campaigns or not, unlike other parties\u2019 voters who need to be mobilized.\u000a\u000aThe CDU believes their relatively prosperous electorate responds better to specific promises like creating full employment by 2025 or cutting income taxes than to Schulz\u2019s attempts to provoke heated campaign debates.\u000a\u000aMerkel's laid-back campaign goes horizontal: "enjoy the summer vote the right way in the autumn" pic.twitter.com/1uQ9rQztH4 \u2014 Stefan Wagstyl (@stefanwagstyl) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000a\u201cGermans want to be left in peace,\u201d a conservative official said. \u201cIt\u2019s finally summer, they\u2019re slowly coming back from holidays, everyone has a job, there are barely any refugees visible anymore. They don\u2019t want to debate things.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe refugee factor\u000a\u000aThere is not much that could go wrong, conservative party officials say \u2014 with only a few exceptions.\u000a\u000aOn top of that list: migration.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, an unexpected influx of asylum seekers arriving in Europe via the Greek islands threw Merkel into the worst crisis since she took office in 2005. Since then, the number of arrivals in Greece has dropped significantly, but more asylum seekers have begun to arrive via the central Mediterranean route from Libya in Italy.\u000a\u000aLast month, Schulz sounded the alarm that a new refugee crisis could be looming. It was widely understood as an attempt to draw Merkel out of her shell, reminding voters of her handling of the 2015 refugee crisis, when she decided to temporarily open the country\u2019s borders for migrants stranded in Hungary.\u000a\u000aHowever, Schulz\u2019s tactic backfired when the media focused more on a flawed number he quoted than the argument he was trying to make, and Merkel was able to ignore the entire episode.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, well aware that a new increase of asylum seekers making their way to Germany could pose a threat to her campaign, Merkel\u2019s team is eager to send out the message that the chancellor is watching closely what\u2019s happening in Italy.\u000a\u000aOne of Merkel\u2019s first appointments when she\u2019s back from her holiday on Friday is lunch with the chiefs of the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration to discuss the situation, followed by a joint press conference.\u000a\u000aOn the campaign trail\u000a\u000aOne day later, on Saturday, Merkel will kick off a six-week series of campaign appearances across Germany.\u000a\u000aCDU officials say the chancellor wants to be seen on the campaign trail to send out the signal that despite her lead in polls, she is not taking an election victory for granted \u2014 but at the same time, she will avoid confrontation wherever possible.\u000a\u000aNext Wednesday, for example, Merkel is giving an online interview to four German YouTube celebrities, her office announced.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago, when another YouTube blogger interviewed Merkel, it was the chancellor who essentially ended up running the conversation while dodging critical questions. This time, it also seems unlikely that the four young interviewees \u2014 among them a beauty expert and a tech blogger \u2014 will succeed in bringing the experienced chancellor out of her shell.\u000a\u000aSo far, there seem to be mainly two occasions that could turn out to become difficult for her, officials believe.\u000a\u000aOne of them is a televised \u201ctown hall meeting\u201d later in August, during which the chancellor has to react directly to questions from the audience.\u000a\u000aThe other one is a major debate in early September when Merkel will face Schulz head-to-head on live TV.\u000a\u000aThe real challenge\u000a\u000aHowever, the most interesting fight, according to one CDU official in the Bundestag, won\u2019t happen until after the election, when Germany\u2019s political parties \u2014 after having pulled each other apart for weeks \u2014 will sit down for coalition talks to try to form a governing majority.\u000a\u000aSuch sentiments suggest the CDU considers it virtually impossible for Merkel to be unseated by Schulz. With more than six weeks left until the vote, history suggests this could be premature.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn all those years \u2026 has there ever been anyone who made Angela Merkel dance the tango?\u201d \u2014 CDU official laughing at Martin Schulz\u2019s chance of turning things around\u000a\u000aBack in 2005, at around this point in the campaign, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was also lagging around 15 percentage points behind Merkel, who was opposition leader at the time.\u000a\u000aDuring the last weeks ahead of the vote, however, he managed to catch up. On election day, Merkel only won by a wafer-thin margin.\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether Schulz has a better chance of sparking a real debate and catching up in the polls now that Merkel is back from her vacation, as it takes two to tango, the CDU official burst out into laughter.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn all those years \u2026 has there ever been anyone who made Angela Merkel dance the tango?\u201d

aVFive members of a Pakistani family under criminal investigation for allegedly misusing their positions as computer administrators for dozens of Democrats in the House of Representatives were paid at least $4 million from July 2009 to the present, The Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s Investigative Group has learned.\u000a\u000aEvidence suggests some of the dozens of House Democrats \u2014 many of whom serve on the intelligence, homeland security and foreign affairs committees \u2014 who employed the suspects were inexplicably paying people they rarely or never saw. See the interactive graphic at the end of this story for the names of the employing representatives.\u000a\u000aThe suspects had full access to the emails and office computer files of the members for whom they worked. A focus of the investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police is an off-site server on which congressional data was allegedly loaded without the knowledge of authorities.\u000a\u000aEven before Capitol Police told chiefs of staff for the employing Democrats Feb. 2 that the Awans \u2014 including brothers Imran, Abid and Jamal, and two of their wives, Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova \u2014 were suspects in a criminal theft and cybersecurity probe, there were multiple signs that something was amiss.\u000a\u000aFor example, four of the 500 highest-paid House staffers are suspects, according to TheDCNF\u2019s analysis of payroll records. There are more than 15,000 congressional staff employees with an average age of 31, according to Legistorm.\u000a\u000aDo You Think The Awan Family Was Paid Too Much By House Democrats? Yes No Login with your social identity to vote Thanks for participating in this survey, in order to vote you must register with your email address.\u000a\u000aSign out.\u000a\u000aTop slots on Capitol Hill are subject to fierce competition, and for most employees, the hours are long and job security is nonexistent. The median salary for legislative assistants is $43,000 annually, according to InsideGov.com.\u000a\u000aImran Awan has collected $1.2 million in salary since 2010, and his brother Abid and wife Hina Alvi were each paid more than $1 million.\u000a\u000aImran first came to Capitol Hill in the early 2000s and Abid joined him in 2005. Imran\u2019s wife Hina Alvi was added to the payroll in 2007, while Abid\u2019s wife, Natalia Sova, appeared in 2011. Finally, in 2014 the youngest sibling, Jamal, joined the payroll in 2014 at the age of 20 with a salary of $160,000.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn Imran\u2019s wife\u2019s offices, she didn\u2019t show up or rarely showed up and Imran would handle it,\u201d a former House staffer with direct knowledge of the brothers told TheDCNF. \u201cOnce in a while he would take her around to the offices but after a while he stopped even putting up the illusion and did all that stuff himself.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe former staffer said \u201cJamal was always there,\u201d but Imran would only work \u201codd hours.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince 2003, the family has collected $5 million overall, with Imran making $2 million and Abid making $1.5 million, according to Legistorm.com, which tracks congressional staff data. Of some 25,000 people who have worked in the House since 2010, only 100 have taken home more than Imran.\u000a\u000aAs \u201cshared\u201d employees, their salaries were cobbled together with part-time payments from multiple members, with a result that the Awans appeared at one time or another on an estimated 80 House Democrats\u2019 payrolls.\u000a\u000aYet the brothers spent significant time in Pakistan, TheDCNF was told. They even had time beginning in 2009 to operate a Northern Virginia car dealership, with Abid as its day-to-day manager. The dealership received a $100,000 loan that was never repaid from Dr. Ali Al-Attar, a onetime Iraqi politician who fled the U.S. on tax charges and who reportedly has links to the terrorist group Hezbollah.\u000a\u000aAmong the House Democrats employing the Awans was Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former Democratic National Committee Chairman whose tenure there was marked by a disastrous email hack that she blamed on the Russians.\u000a\u000aSome of the House Democrats terminated the suspects on their payrolls following the meeting with investigators, but it\u2019s uncertain how many have done so.\u000a\u000aCourt documents show that Imran was flush with enough cash to loan $30,000 to a friend. Yet Abid declared bankruptcy in 2012, discharging debts to others while keeping retaining ownership of two houses.\u000a\u000aThe interactive graphic below shows the sources of the Awans\u2019 congressional income.\u000a\u000aFollow Luke on Twitter.

aVAs a child growing up in rural Alaska, Vera Starbard was diagnosed with major depression. She\u2019d been sexually abused by her uncle and was plagued by thoughts of suicide. By the age of 10, she\u2019d already spent time as an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cIt was a really dark time,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t feel like it was ever going to get better.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when she was 11, things changed. Her family moved to Anchorage, and they joined the Southcentral Foundation, a health care provider for native Alaskans. The foundation was launching a new approach to health care\u2014one that wove mental health into the rest of its primary care.\u000a\u000aFor Vera, that meant every checkup included a mental health evaluation. Her primary care team included a psychologist or social worker who offered care on-site. There were a variety of group counseling programs to choose from. Every person she saw had her health record, there were no outside charges, and there was never a wait to make an appointment.\u000a\u000aPerhaps most important, accessing mental health treatment was as easy as going to her regular doctor, and there was no stigma attached: Her mental health services were provided at the same time and in the same place as other medical care, just like heading down the hall for an X-ray or blood test.\u000a\u000aIn Anchorage, she still had a lot to work through, and difficult times ahead. But today, at age 35, she says that Southcentral\u2019s approach to mental health care saved her life. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher than not probability that I would have committed suicide without the resources at my disposal,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aVera Starbard at home in Anchorage, Alaska. A victim of sexual abuse as a child, she credits the easy access to behavioral health care at Southcentral Foundation with helping her overcome profound depression. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aIt's a truism that the mind and the body are connected, but the U.S. health care system has long treated them as separate\u2014with separate doctors, separate hospitals, separate payment systems. That\u2019s a major reason people with acute mental illnesses don\u2019t get help. Ditto for chronic conditions like depression and anxiety. People may not seek help because of stigma. They may not find it because there are too few providers and they are too hard to locate. Or people don\u2019t have health insurance, or can\u2019t afford the co-pays, or lose interest when faced with a long wait.\u000a\u000aThe result is that many people who need mental health care aren\u2019t getting it. According to a recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, nearly 18 percent of adults surveyed in 2015 reported having a mental, behavioral or emotional disorder. And 20 percent of respondents said either they or a family member had needed mental health care but didn\u2019t get it, either because they couldn\u2019t afford it, their insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it, they were afraid or embarrassed, or they had no idea where to go.\u000a\u000aAt the patient level, this means people with mental health issues suffer when they don\u2019t need to. And at the policy level, there are huge reasons to fix this, primarily the high long-term cost of untreated mental illness. Mental health plays a big role in chronic conditions like hypertension, obesity and diabetes. \u201cYou can go ahead and give all the insulin you want,\u201d says Donald Berwick, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a big proponent of behavioral health integration. \u201cIf you\u2019re not addressing the attendant behavioral health issues, you\u2019re not just missing the chance to reduce suffering, you\u2019re reducing the chance to save a lot of money.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn part because of their Alaska Native heritage, which puts a high value on spiritual health, the leaders of Southcentral recognized decades ago that behavioral health is tightly linked with bodily health. So they became one of the early adopters of integrated care. They embedded treatment for mental and emotional ills in their primary care practices, and found that patient satisfaction rates skyrocketed and usage of medical care went down, saving millions of dollars while improving patient outcomes.\u000a\u000aIn the nearly 30 years since Southcentral hired its first psychologist, pretty much every study has shown that integrating mental health care into medical care results in better patient outcomes and lower costs. A few years ago, analysts at actuarial firm Milliman estimated that integrating medical and behavior heath care could shave $26 billion to $48 billion each year from the nation\u2019s health care costs.\u000a\u000aBut adoption has been slow, in part because of the way much health insurance is structured. Mental health is often a separate benefit, if insurance pays anything at all. Doctors are paid more for procedures on sick people. They get less if they keep their patients healthy and out of the hospital.\u000a\u000aOf all the structural problems in the U.S. health care system, the segregation of mental health care from the rest of medical care is arguably the most costly, both financially and in terms of patient health. With new pressure to find ways to bend the curve of health care costs, and the growing burden of chronic disease and worker disability, perhaps no policy could have as much bang for the buck as finally integrating mental and physical health care.\u000a\u000aIN THE MIDDLE of the 20th century, mental illnesses weren\u2019t considered illnesses per se; fully debilitating illnesses were seen as \u201cinsanities\u201d and their sufferers often confined against their will in special mental hospitals. Illnesses that were less debilitating\u2014milder depressions, say, or anxiety or substance abuse\u2014were viewed as weaknesses of will, often ignored by medical professionals. Payment followed suit; for mental health providers it was low, for primary care providers it was essentially nonexistent.\u000a\u000aPeople had to either figure out a way to live with their conditions, or suffer as their illnesses got more acute. The arrival of more effective medications for mental illnesses opened things up a bit\u2014doctors could write a prescription, and patients could feel better without months or years of talk therapy. Still, several studies in the 1980s showed that many patients didn\u2019t get treatment, with as many as one-half of patients saying no when their doctors suggested they get mental health care.\u000a\u000aThe search was on for something better. In the early 1990s, private foundations and the federal government, through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, began funding clinical studies around the country. Could primary care providers be trained to recognize depression, and get their patients treated? Would that make a difference? The studies showed the answers were yes and yes. In 1996, the Institute of Medicine published a suggestion\u2014integrate primary and behavioral health care so that patients would get diagnosed and treated by their doctors or via direct referral to a behavioral health specialist as part of their routine medical care. Big health care systems like Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Administration began experimenting with integrating behavioral health care in some locations.\u000a\u000aPhysician's assistant Ingrid Carlson examines 6-month-old Milo Rebne. Southcentral Foundation's exam rooms have comfortable chairs and minimal equipment \u2013 the idea is to encourage conversation between health providers and patients, or in this case Milo's mom, Heather Lee Rebne. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aSouthcentral Foundation was ahead of the trend, having started thinking about integrating its care in 1985. CEO Katherine Gottlieb, an Alaska Native who won a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant award for her work at Southcentral, says there was a simple reason: \u201cWe did a survey of our community.\u2019\u2019\u000a\u000aSouthcentral asked community members to rank their health care priorities among choices like cancer care, diabetes, obesity and behavioral health. The top five priorities, says Gottlieb, were all related to behavioral health\u2014child sexual abuse, child neglect, domestic violence, behavioral health counseling and addictions.\u000a\u000aSo Southcentral forged forward with its goal of making patients with behavioral health issues feel welcome. It built an airy new primary care center that looks as much like a mountain lodge as it does a place to get medical care. Huge windows frame the snowcapped peaks of the nearby Chugach Mountains, and the halls are filled with Alaska Native art\u2014beadwork, blankets, dolls, carvings and paintings of totem animals such as ravens, orcas and eagles. There\u2019s an expansive lobby designed to host community gatherings. Foundation planners say the setting sends the message that the health of the community directly relates to the health of each of its members.\u000a\u000aToday, a patient with a history of mental illness, like Vera, gets evaluated by her doctor whenever she comes in for a medical appointment. If Vera seems anxious or depressed, the doctor might talk to her about it, or call in the behavioral health consultant. But the same goes for patients without a history of behavioral problems. A diabetes patient who has stopped taking his pills, for instance, might find himself in a 20- or 30-minute discussion with his primary care doctor about ways to deal with anxiety or depression. The primary care doctor or the behaviorist on the team might suggest more formal counseling, or the request might come from the patient. When hospital care is needed, patients are sent by their care team, and they return to that care team when they get out.\u000a\u000aThe system puts mental illnesses into the realm of routine health care. \u201cWe know that for tons and tons of people, stigma is a really big deal in behavioral health,\u201d says Douglas Eby, vice president of medical services at Southcentral and one of the many staffers who\u2019ve been there since the beginning. \u201cBut getting behavioral health during your visit with your primary care provider, or by the guy down the hall, at the same place and maybe during the same visit\u2014then it\u2019s nothing different, and not likely to be stigmatized.\u201d Your employer won\u2019t find out, and your buddies won\u2019t see your truck parked outside a mental health office. Integrating behavioral health care into a medical setting normalizes it, he says.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral takes things a step further, with several innovative group therapy programs, some of them building on Native American culture\u2014\u201clearning circles\u201d where people talk about how they dealt with internal conflict and about how to resolve their feelings. Vera attended an intensive one-week group therapy session where people shared memories of domestic violence, abuse and neglect. \u201cThat was the week I figured out I could be happy,\u201d she says. Family, faith and friends also helped, but what she learned at Southcentral was instrumental. \u201cThat was the start of not being a victim anymore, of seeing that there was light at the end of the tunnel and I wouldn\u2019t always be depressed.\u201d\u000a\u000aSouthcentral\u2019s administrators credit integration for lowering hospital admissions and visits to the emergency room by more than a third between 2000 and 2015. In a recent survey, 97 percent of patients said they were satisfied with the care. In 2011, the foundation was awarded a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for delivering top-quality care for less cost than the vast majority of U.S. providers.\u000a\u000aTHE BIGGEST CHALLENGE all along, says CEO Gottlieb, has been money.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral gets by on a combination of private insurers and government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and the Indian Health Service. But most of them don\u2019t pay much for mental health care, and they don\u2019t pay anything at all for some of the counseling and group sessions the foundation offers. So Southcentral subsidizes behavioral health care with savings from the medical side, and it gets grants as well.\u000a\u000aTOP: A mask in the lobby of the primary care building at the Alaska Native Medical Center. Beadwork, sculpture, and paintings are intended to make the foundation\u2019s 65,000 patients feel connected to their native Alaskan heritage. BOTTOM: Behavioral health consultant Emily Degroot speaks with patient Elizabeth Pawluk. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aPayment is a challenge across the country.\u000a\u000aA landmark study of 113,452 patients in 102 group practices within the Intermountain Healthcare system in Utah and Idaho showed how much can be saved by integrating mental health care. Some practices included mental health care in a \u201cmedical home.\u201d In other practices, patients were referred to outside therapists. Annual medical costs were $515 higher per year for patients who did not get mental health services through their primary providers.\u000a\u000aWhile the benefit to patients was clear, the study had a second conclusion\u2014that providers lost money by integrating mental health. As physician Thomas Schwenk noted in an accompanying editorial, during the 2010-13 study period the integrated practices received $115 less per patient per year than the traditional practices, because payment was based on procedures and office visits. Since patients in the integrated practices needed less medical care, the doctors made less money.\u000a\u000aSuch payment practices are common, and Schwenk wrote that it\u2019s going to take \u201ca profound change in the fundamental structure of the U.S. health care delivery system\u201d to integrate behavioral health care into the primary care environment. That would take heavier reliance of payments going to groups of doctors caring for groups of patients, not piecemeal payments for individual services.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s broad support for behavioral health integration within the health care community and in Congress; there are few critics on record, and no one is lobbying against it. The trade association for companies that provide health care services to people in insurance plans, the Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, is a big booster. Patient groups love it for the access it gives, and for the destigmatization. Supporting health care reform that favors behavioral health care is a major legislative priority for the National Alliance for Mental Illness, which represents people with mental illnesses and their family members.\u000a\u000aAndrew Sperling, a lobbyist for NAMI, echoes the conclusion that the chief challenge is money. According to a SAMHSA estimate, Medicare spent $29 billion on mental health care in 2016, and the Medicaid bill was $67 billion. Sperling would like to see more for various demonstration programs. And if funds for Medicaid are cut, \u201ca lot of the innovation we\u2019ve seen with primary behavioral health integration would be stifled,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aStill, some doctors and other providers are not totally on board. Many psychiatrists today don\u2019t accept Medicare or other insurance, making access still a problem. And primary care practitioners and behavioral health workers may need training in how to work in an integrated system. \u201cPeople who become cardiologists and rheumatologists and all the other \u2018\u2013ologists\u2019 get minimal instruction in behavioral health,\u201d says Berwick.\u000a\u000aPsychologists and social workers may also have to be retrained, says Berwick\u2019s IHI colleague Mara Laderman. Mental health consultants in integrated care systems work differently. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on action-oriented problem solving over one session or a couple of 20-minute sessions, as opposed to having a more longitudinal therapeutic relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, that 50-minute, hour appointment.\u201d Southcentral\u2019s Eby confirms that\u2014he says they have to look long and hard for people willing to give care outside of those 50-minute boxes.\u000a\u000aLEFT: A garden with Alaska Native traditional healing plants outside Southcentral Foundation\u2019s primary care facility.

RIGHT: Health care providers use a bulletin board to send the message that patients are in charge. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aSOLVING THESE PROBLEMS will take more than money; it will require changing the culture of medicine. Many groups are moving in that direction; the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and other groups have policies promoting integrated care and offer information to their members on how to adopt it.\u000a\u000aThe federal government supports a multitude of initiatives designed to promote behavioral health care integration. The Affordable Care Act set aside money for model projects. Close to a billion dollars has been granted for programs that will promote behavioral health care, like setting up patient-centered medical homes within Medicaid. And starting last January, Medicare has been paying physicians for behavioral health care management and consultation. There are new billing codes that allow physicians to charge for helping their patients get behavioral health treatment, managing their patients\u2019 care, and working with psychiatrists.\u000a\u000aAuthors of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine say it\u2019s a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d and predict millions of beneficiaries will benefit and that there will be millions of dollars in savings. There could be a ripple effect: Medicare often serves as an example to other insurers.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral Foundation leaders are often invited to speak at conferences or to health care organizations in the Washington, D.C., area, and when they do, they usually stop by Capitol Hill or federal agencies to talk about the benefits of providing mental health care in a primary care setting. Douglas Eby\u2019s trips have led him to believe that there will be more support in the future for fully integrated systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are popular with the whole political spectrum,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cut costs like crazy and emphasize self, and family, so Republicans love us. Democrats love us because we\u2019re all about community and social factors and reforming the pillars of society so that everyone has improved access to care. When we walk into different political offices, we emphasize different parts of the system so that they can hear our story in their words and values, but it is all very true and the truth is the same truth.\u201d\u000a\u000aConversations are a key part of the relationship between providers and patients -- called "customer-owners" -- at Southcentral Foundation. Physician\u2019s Assistant Ingrid Carlson speaks with customer-owner Taylir Kueter, 20. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aBerwick, with plenty of experience on Capitol Hill when he was head of CMS, is concerned about protecting funding for some of the demonstration projects in the current chaos of health care funding. But in the long run, he says, integrating behavioral health into primary health care is inevitable. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got to solve the health care cost problem,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aIn Anchorage, Vera Starbard is watching with interest. Until recently, she figured that all health systems offered mental health care right along with primary care. \u201cThat\u2019s literally what I had grown up knowing as health care.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut recently, she\u2019s seen several friends who are not part of Southcentral struggle to get mental health services. One friend, who, like Starbard, had been sexually abused, struggled for months to get approval from her health insurance company. Then her friend\u2019s intended counselor stopped taking new patients. \u201cI\u2019m only now seeing how good integrated care is,\u201d says Starbard. \u201cWe definitely took it for granted.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoanne Silberner is a freelance health writer based in Seattle.

aVLONDON \u2014 There is a black hole at the center of the Brexit negotiations \u2014 hard-liners can kick and scream, but it\u2019s sucking everyone into its gravitational pull. Its name is transition, and its shape is Norway.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. rejoining the European Economic Area from outside the European Union \u2014 the so-called Norway model \u2014 is European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s favorite option for a post-Brexit transitional arrangement.\u000a\u000aIt would allow for a smooth exit with minimum disruption for British business \u2014 by maintaining access to the single market \u2014 and give negotiators precious time to work out the details of a future trading arrangement. In Brussels, it is now seen as the only serious proposal that the European Commission is likely to make when it comes to a transitional deal. Five EU diplomats told POLITCO it would be a reasonable solution to the Brexit transition conundrum.\u000a\u000aTwo senior U.K. government figures, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the EU\u2019s stance on this and in recent weeks a succession of British cabinet ministers have come out in favor of a transition period of up to three years after Brexit.\u000a\u000aWhile none are yet explicitly talking about the EEA model, even Brexiteers like Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Environment Secretary Michael Gove now sing from the same hymn sheet as Brexit doves like Chancellor Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Home Secretary Amber Rudd \u2014 all emphasizing the importance of avoiding a \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit for British business.\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled.\u000a\u000aThe opposition Labour Party too, appears to be gravitating toward that position. Its leader Jeremy Corbyn had said that leaving the EU also means leaving the single market (which would preclude EEA membership). But Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, told the Guardian on August 1 that the party would try to force a vote on keeping the country in the single market.\u000a\u000aInexorably, under pressure from British business, political opponents and sheer realpolitik, they are all being pushed toward an EEA transition.\u000a\u000aEFTA door is open\u000a\u000aIn the alphabet soup of variations on the fringes of the European Union, the EEA is the organization with the largest membership. It includes all EU member countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Those three states are also members (along with Switzerland) of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), a regional free-trade area that operates alongside the EU. To rejoin the EEA from outside the EU, Britain would have to join EFTA.\u000a\u000aThe bloc\u2019s spokesman Thorfinnur Omarsson confirmed to POLTICO that their door is open. \u201cWe are open to receiving a U.K. membership application,\u201d he said. EFTA has not had an indication that this is what London wants yet, but if it takes that option, then the U.K\u2019s entry into EFTA \u201cshould not be too complicated,\u201d he added. That\u2019s so long as an application comes relatively early in the negotiation process.\u000a\u000aWhile there is broad consensus in the British Cabinet that some kind of transition is required, some aspects of EFTA/EEA membership would be unappealing to Brexiteers, even temporarily. Steve Baker, a junior minister in the Brexit department who was promoted after the election, said last month that staying in the EEA post Brexit would be like \u201cputting blood in the water\u201d \u2014 indicating the soft Brexiteers can expect a fight.\u000a\u000aOne reason is that EFTA/EEA members are subject to freedom of movement. The British government\u2019s public position is still that freedom of movement will end on March 29, 2019, when the U.K. leaves the EU. But seemingly contradictory statements from Hammond, who has said it will be \u201csome time\u201d before full migration controls can be imposed, and Rudd, who has promised businesses no \u201ccliff edge\u201d on migration, suggest the government is heading toward a compromise.\u000a\u000aOne such escape clause was proposed by former chair of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee Crispin Blunt immediately after the election in a Times article suggesting an EEA transition. He pointed out that it would be possible to invoke powers held by EEA members to restrict freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aArticle 112 of the EEA Agreement allows a party to the agreement to unilaterally take \u201csafeguard measures\u201d to limit freedom of movement in particular regions or sectors.\u000a\u000aStephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, son of former leader Neil Kinnock and partner of former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said that the clause meant an EEA transition met all three of his party\u2019s manifesto pledges on Brexit: that the U.K. must leave the EU, retain the benefits of the single market and reform freedom of movement.\u000a\u000aThe only legal precedent for invoking it comes from Liechtenstein but, Kinnock said, \u201cif that\u2019s a deal that tiny little Liechtenstein could secure, that\u2019s something we could secure given the diplomatic and economic clout of the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s up to Theresa May and David Davis to deliver,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aKinnock is one of a group of Labour MPs seeking to ally with like-minded Conservative backbenchers to force a vote on staying in the EEA during a transition when the government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill comes to the House of Commons in September.\u000a\u000aOne Labour shadow cabinet member said it was now \u201calmost inevitable\u201d that the transition period would be the EEA model, because there is not enough time between now and the close of negotiations, likely to be in fall 2018, to devise a bespoke transition arrangement. Hammond is reported to have made a similar case to business leaders in recent days, calling for an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d transition arrangement.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Labour shadow cabinet member said EEA membership was not a permanent solution. \u201cIf you have any respect for yourself as a 21st-century global power you can\u2019t become Norway,\u201d the shadow cabinet figure said. One major downside of EEA membership outside of the EU is that you must accept the rules of the single market without having any influence over them. By leaving the EU, Britain will lose its representation in the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, as well as it right to nominate a commissioner.\u000a\u000aBrexit bill link\u000a\u000aThe EFTA/EEA option is no silver bullet to a smooth transition.\u000a\u000aIt does not cover customs arrangements and if trade disruption is to be avoided during a transition, a separate agreement would be needed to maintain or replicate the U.K.\u2019s place in the EU customs union.\u000a\u000aOne U.K. government official, meanwhile, said it would not be straightforward to rejoin the EEA, via EFTA, given the reform of the two organizations\u2019 procedures, and structures required to accommodate such a large new member. However, the official did not rule out transition inside the EEA, or \u201csomething novel, but conceptually similar.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, there is a clear position that no agreement on a transition \u2014 EEA or otherwise \u2014 can be settled until separation issues, like the Brexit bill, are settled. Martin Selmayr, Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s head of Cabinet, on Thursday retweeted a Times article making this point with the words: \u201cVery true. Good analysis.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Commission views the transition deal as an issue for phase two of the Brexit negotiations. These can only begin if, in the fall, the European Council is satisfied that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in phase one. This judgment is likely to rest on whether the U.K. has made an acceptable proposal on the so-called Brexit bill \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the EU.\u000a\u000aReports in the British press that U.K. officials will propose paying £10 billion a year for three years as part of a transition deal chime with expectations on the EU side.\u000a\u000aTwo EU diplomats said they expected the U.K. to link the Brexit bill to the transition in talks this fall. If the U.K. were to meet its financial obligations under the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework until 2020, the diplomats argued, Brussels could play fair and not make the U.K. pay again as an EEA member to get market access. The Brexit bill could, in this scenario, become the ticket for getting market access under a transitional deal. Norway will have paid \u20ac1.3 billion to the EU between 2014 and 2021, but its gross domestic product (\u20ac313 billion) is much smaller than the U.K.\u2019s (\u20ac2.2 trillion) so the British payments would be much higher.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill\u2019\u201d \u2014 Conservative MP David Jones\u000a\u000aLinking the Brexit bill to EEA membership may suit the U.K., whose negotiators have made clear that it would be \u201cpolitically impossible\u201d for Theresa May to go public with a Brexit bill figure in the tens of billions of euros without having something to show for it.\u000a\u000aGuntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, said an early agreement on an EEA transition \u201cwould take the sting out of the very toxic Brexit bill debate. The discussion can calm down, which could also help advancing in other areas such as negotiating a future trade agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut an EEA transition would not be seen as good value for money by all, and some MPs will want the U.K. to hold out rather than accept that an EFTA/EEA transition is the only option on the table.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe negotiations will obviously require give and take on both sides. We need to understand the EU\u2019s methodology in respect of the calculation of the \u2018bill,\u2019\u201d said Conservative MP David Jones, a former Brexit minister who was fired after the election and staunch Brexiteer. \u201cWe want a free-trade agreement that gives the best possible access to the single market.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cFurther than that, there will clearly have to be negotiation and I would guess that we are some considerable way off seeing what the final position will be,\u201d Jones said.

aVYou\u2019ve road tripped to meet with real Americans in a quest to visit all 50 states. You\u2019ve hired Barack Obama\u2019s pollster along with his first campaign manager to advise your philanthropic fund. You\u2019ve given a flat \u201cno\u201d to the question whether you are planning a run for president, but it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re not thinking about it. And if you are, you have a lot of work to do.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re not the only billionaire looking at Donald Trump and thinking: I\u2019m smarter, I\u2019m richer, I\u2019m more likable, I\u2019m not colluding with Russia. If he can do it, so can I.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut it would be dangerous to assume that America is interested in electing just any ol\u2019 CEO to be commander in chief. Putting aside the fluky nature of his victory sans popular vote, Trump didn\u2019t suddenly emerge from the boardroom. He was in our living rooms for decades, had a well-developed ultraconfident public persona and had long been testing the political waters.\u000a\u000aSo, if you are serious about embarking on the presidential path, here are four things you need to do:\u000a\u000a1. Don\u2019t assume anybody likes you. You begin this quest providing one of the most popular services in the world, used by 2 billion people. But don\u2019t think that means YOU are popular. As a recent poll of a hypothetical 2020 matchup showed you perform worse against Trump\u2014tying him 40-40\u2014compared with established Democratic politicians. Nearly half of Americans don\u2019t have an opinion about you. Of those that do, for slightly more it\u2019s a negative one. That may suggest a need to shed your image of the socially awkward boss trying to look cool in a T-shirt. Or it may reflect the conflicted feelings many people have about Facebook and its effect on privacy, safety and political polarization.\u000a\u000aEven among those 24 percent of Americans with a favorable opinion of you are not clamoring for a presidential run. There is only one #DraftZuck group, Disrupt for America. It has 15 Facebook likes.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no passion behind a Zuckerberg candidacy. At least not yet.\u000a\u000a2. Show you can do more than write checks: Traditional politicians prove their commitment to the public good by passing legislation or administering government programs. As a CEO candidate, you can\u2019t do that. But you need to do something on behalf of the public that exemplifies your values, your leadership ability and your competency.\u000a\u000aBut wait, you say, Trump never did anything like that. Well, maybe not in the traditional sense. However, his \u201cbirther\u201d crusade checked that box. Championing a baseless conspiracy theory, while a racist outrage to many, humiliated Obama, provoked the \u201cliberal\u201d media and proved Trump could troll better than anyone. And in retrospect, that\u2019s the skill conservative voters wanted most.\u000a\u000aThe last big CEO candidate before Trump, independent billionaire Ross Perot, also built a bond with a voter niche well in advance of his 1992 bid. How? By pursuing for decades his own conspiracy theory\u2014that America left behind prisoners of war in Vietnam. He even charged the government with a cover-up during congressional testimony delivered in August of the presidential campaign (after he dropped out in July but before he rejoined in the September).\u000a\u000aBut lest you start to believe only conspiracy-minded CEOs can mount presidential campaigns, Perot also earned political credibility by leading a gubernatorial task force to revamp the Texas education system, and pressuring the state government, successfully, to enact major reform legislation. So there\u2019s a highbrow path available.\u000a\u000aAnd you\u2019re on that path. You\u2019ve launched the philanthropic Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with ambitious long-range goals: \u201cHelping cure, prevent or manage all diseases in our children\u2019s lifetime\u201d and \u201cHelping every child seize opportunities and solve the challenges of a changing world\u201d through advancements in \u201cpersonalized learning.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese are laudable and important goals. But without any concrete successes before 2020, they will only paint a picture of a rich guy who likes to throw money at problems.\u000a\u000aYou know about that pitfall all too well\u2014having seen your $100 million donation to the Newark, New Jersey, public school system result in the book The Prize, which chronicles how that money got squandered. And the fact that your wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, is doing most of the heavy lifting for the foundation also can feed a perception that you only know how to write checks.\u000a\u000aOne promising project you have is the Primary School\u2014a free preschool that opened in East Palo Alto, California, last year for low-income families that incorporates health care into its curriculum. (Chan, a pediatrician, is the school CEO.) However, while you are planning an expansion into San Francisco, you still aren\u2019t letting reporters visit classrooms. Such opacity won\u2019t fly in a presidential campaign. You not only need good works, your works need to be transparently good.\u000a\u000a3. Own an issue. Mashable\u2019s Jack Morse said, when considering your political prospects, \u201cif his blandly apolitical 50-state tour has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the man is fundamentally incapable of taking any kind of meaningful stand.\u201d That\u2019s fine for being CEO of Facebook, a business that depends on a massive user base and cannot afford to alienate customers on ideological grounds. But running for president in an age of polarization requires taking clear stands and mobilizing devout supporters.\u000a\u000aTrump grabbed on to the immigration issue and never let go. You started FWD.us, in a failed attempt to pass immigration reform under Obama, and seemingly gave up. The group still exists, but you remain behind the scenes.\u000a\u000aNow, immigration is back on the front page, as Trump is proposing a 50 percent cut in the number of legal immigrants America will accept, with an emphasis on skilled, English-speaking workers. FWD.us is opposing the legislation. But your personal Facebook page is silent, when you could be playing a much bigger public role. Since a priority of imported skilled workers is good for Silicon Valley corporations, you would have extra credibility in going against your self-interest, and arguing that a strict emphasis on high-skill labor is economically myopic and antithetical to the American spirit.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ve said your life\u2019s mission is to \u201cconnect the world,\u201d a mantra with great potential as a sharp contrast to the wall-loving Trump. But if immigration is not the specific issue that most motivates you, then figure out what issue related to breaking down global barriers you are passionate about, and act on it.\u000a\u000a4. Take down an opponent. Politics is blood sport. It won\u2019t come easily for you, as you are more accustomed to geeky Facebook live chats. But political neophytes need to show voters they can throw a punch.\u000a\u000aTrump did so with a strategy of sophomoric put-downs, and that\u2019s not your thing. But there is another model from the corporate world for you to emulate: 1940 Republican nominee Wendell Willkie.\u000a\u000aAs president of the utility company Commonwealth & Southern, Willkie engaged in high-profile battles with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over regulation. And he made a huge splash when he jousted with Roosevelt\u2019s top antitrust official, Robert H. Jackson, in a 1938 radio debate heard by 3 million listeners.\u000a\u000aThe program \u201cTown Hall Meeting of the Air\u201d set the debate topic as \u201cHow Can Government and Business Work Together.\u201d Jackson, who came in with a strong reputation as a debater, predictably excoriated big corporations as a scourge. But Willkie\u2019s polish and charm turned the tables, making the New Dealers look small for pillorying CEOs as \u201ceconomic royalists.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs one Willkie biographer recounted: \u201cThe applause of Town Hall amounted to an ovation. Willkie had spoken with dynamic effect, and the audience realized that it had just witnessed the skyrocketing of a man to national fame.\u201d (Jackson, who had his own early buzz for president, saw his political stock fade, though he later made it to the Supreme Court.)\u000a\u000aOf course, there are risks in on-air clashes. Perot permanently ruined his political prospects in 1993 when he debated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Vice President Al Gore on CNN. He had wanted to shift his signature issue from the budget deficit to the trade deficit, but the drubbing Perot took marginalized him and made his second presidential bid a mere historical footnote.\u000a\u000aAs a champion of global connectivity, you have plenty of nationalist targets from which to choose. What Democrat wouldn\u2019t love seeing you take down Rep. Steve King on the subject of immigration? Or challenge a fellow CEO\u2014like the cantankerous, and litigious, coal mogul Bob Murray\u2014on climate change. You\u2019ve indicated you oppose barriers to global trade; a daring move would be a debate with that former CEO presidential candidate, Ross Perot.\u000a\u000aSo pick your issue. Debate a worthy opponent. Prep like hell. And do it with a smile.\u000a\u000aBut if you\u2019re not prepared to \u201ctake any kind of meaningful stand\u201d and fight for it, you can always stick to writing checks.\u000a\u000aBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d

aVCHICAGO \u2014 Walk into Organizing for Action\u2019s new hipster downtown hardwood space here, and there\u2019s no big picture of Barack Obama, just a deep blue wall with a giant \u201cOFA\u201d painted in white.\u000a\u000aLook down the street from the front door, though, and Chicago\u2019s Trump skyscraper looms directly in the line of sight, a perpetual reminder of the group\u2019s new purpose.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aFresh off a huge win for anti-Trump forces in the Obamacare repeal fight, the Democratic activist group is gearing up for its next showdown this fall \u2014 battling President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts with the same state- and district-focused strategy it employed on health care. The organization inspired by Obama hasn't heard from him in months, though a person close to the former president said he's likely to lend his support later this year to OFA as well as the Democratic National Committee and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. That could include fundraising and other help, but not a direct leadership role.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, OFA isn't sitting still. It's already looking at plans to go into 2018 with a massive voter registration drive that could become its main project ahead of the midterms.\u000a\u000aFirst, though, OFA will spend Congress\u2019 August recess sending organizers to town halls and district offices. It has a calendar of \u201caccountability\u201d (read: protest) and \u201cappreciation\u201d (read: drop-ins like the one to deliver cupcakes to Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s West Virginia office last week) events, based on senators\u2019 votes on repealing Obamacare. They\u2019re showing up to cheer for John McCain, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and yell at people like Jeff Flake and Dean Heller.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur members are home. And it\u2019s time to go talk to them,\u201d OFA executive director Katie Hogan said of lawmakers.\u000a\u000aEvery version of OFA when the initials didn\u2019t stand for Obama for America (its presidential campaign inception) has struggled. When it was reconstituted after the 2012 campaign as a vehicle for promoting Obama\u2019s second-term agenda, few people understood what its mission was or how it wanted to measure success. Some Democrats remain bitter that Obama favored OFA over the DNC as his main political arm, and others wonder how effective OFA can be as a nonprofit barred from engaging directly in campaigns.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

It\u2019s become the lead organizing hub of the Trump resistance.\u000a\u000aOFA has organized thousands of people to attend events protesting the president\u2019s policies, while also advising new progressive groups taking shape. Matt Traldi, a top organizer at Indivisible, met with OFA in January for a primer on what the group does and how. Others, like Swing Left, have come for crash courses. And since April, some 1,000 people in 29 states have participated in the group\u2019s six-week fellowship program.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf anything changed, it\u2019s the interest level of people who were not previously active \u2014 not the type of people, but the numbers,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cNow there is a recognition of what we were always doing.\u201d\u000a\u000aHogan said she\u2019s been surprised how evenly the split of interested activists is between people who are under 18, 18 to 35, and over 35. The response has skewed toward women, and 30 percent to 40 percent of those who\u2019ve signed up are nonwhite, she said.\u000a\u000aBefore the election, OFA had drafted plans for how to retool and scale back under a Hillary Clinton presidency. It didn\u2019t start working on the Trump plan until the week after he won.\u000a\u000aIt started with a hiring spree, doubling its staff to 40 full-time employees in Chicago and two dozen spread across other states, supplemented by in-state contract hires in Maine, Arizona, Ohio and Alaska. The group has grown to 102 chapters, each required to host at least two events per month, plus run a fellowship program.\u000a\u000aOne full-time staffer is based in Washington to coordinate with other groups, whether on the network\u2019s daily 9:45 a.m. call or meetings of the pro-Obamacare \u201cProtect Your Care\u201d alliance of progressive groups.\u000a\u000aAfter the inauguration, OFA ruled out jumping into the battles over Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing aware of what and how you\u2019re organizing people is something that we in the progressive world haven\u2019t always done well,\u201d said Jen Warner, who came back to OFA as the national organizing director after a stint as Clinton\u2019s deputy field director in Ohio. \u201cYou can\u2019t mobilize for eight years. That will burn everyone out.\u201d\u000a\u000aObamacare was the obvious battle to focus on, they decided. A few other Trump moves prompted responses, like his announced withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, but little more.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou had people who had the courage to finally get up,\u201d Warner said. \u201cNobody wants to be part of something where you\u2019re just standing on a corner shouting at the wind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey have their stats: 1.1 million people who signed up to take some kind of action, which resulted in 2,500 events that OFA hosted or participated in; 40,000 people trained in person or by webinar; and 110,000 calls made to members of Congress and volunteers.\u000a\u000aAfter controlling Obama\u2019s Twitter account while he was in the White House, OFA returned it to him in January. OFA staff and Obama's personal office staff have stayed in touch. But the flow of information has mostly been OFA keeping Obama\u2019s staff up to speed on what it\u2019s doing, and Obama\u2019s staff warning against using quotes or images of the former president in ways that could violate nonprofit tax restrictions.\u000a\u000aHe has no official role, but \u201cObama's deep belief in the power of ordinary people to come together to enact change has always been at OFA's core,\u201d Hogan said.\u000a\u000aObama spokesman Kevin Lewis said \u201cit\u2019s no surprise\u201d that people who joined Obama on the campaigns and in the White House have kept at it at OFA.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the president credited those who mobilized and organized for protecting health care for millions of people, it wasn\u2019t lost on him that OFA, among other grass-roots organizations, played a significant part in that effort by training local organizers and educating communities about what was at stake,\u201d Lewis said.\u000a\u000aTop OFA staff members assume that before long they\u2019ll be back in the fight to stop Republicans from changing Obamacare. They expect that many in the office will empty out over the back half of next year, as people move to midterm campaigns, and go to presidential campaigns afterward.\u000a\u000aThere continues to be talk that parts of OFA\u2019s organizer training might eventually be folded into the Obama Library Center, though Lewis said nothing is in the works so far.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Democratic politicians have been asking OFA for help with events, eager for the support and some Obama sheen. Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Dick Durbin, Tammy Duckworth, Tammy Baldwin and Brian Schatz have all sent emails on behalf of OFA, as have Reps. John Lewis, Joe Kennedy III and Ruben Gallego, and former Secretary of State John Kerry and failed Missouri Senate candidate Jason Kander. Some have asked to send them. Some have been asked.\u000a\u000aWhat OFA doesn\u2019t do for any of them, though, is reciprocate by sharing its famed and much-sought-after email list, compiled over the course of Obama\u2019s two campaigns.\u000a\u000aOFA is looking to slowly draw more people in. To get new people comfortable with being involved, it encourages local chapters not to talk overtly about politics at meetings. The group hosts screenings of movies about global warming, taking credit for some of how the conversation has changed outside of Washington. OFA is providing tools and guidance to local elected officials looking for help.\u000a\u000aThe group may make more noise about the Paris accord withdrawal, or immigration, but it\u2019s trying to stay focused.\u000a\u000aMost of the opposition groups that have sprouted up since Trump won are election-oriented and inexperienced in coordination. OFA believes it now has the tools and know-how to keep the fight going when others will fade or stumble.\u000a\u000a\u201cMobilizing in the moment,\u201d Warner said, \u201cis different from organizing in the long term.\u201d\u000a\u000aCORRECTION: In a headline on an earlier version of this story, the name of the organization was stated incorrectly.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVDr. Priscilla Chan, wife of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has been in talks with city and school officials to open a charter or alternative public school in San Francisco for nearly a year, the San Francisco Examiner has learned.\u000a\u000aThe school, modeled after a private school Chan and her husband opened in East Palo Alto last year called The Primary School, would focus on the health and education of at-risk children from before birth through eighth grade and their parents.\u000a\u000aThe school would be the first expansion of The Primary School and mark yet another endeavor into The City for the couple, who donated $75 million to the newly renamed Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe goal of The Primary School has always been to create a holistic system of care for children that can be replicated across the Bay Area and nationally,\u201d a spokesperson for The Primary School said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited The Primary School model is being considered by the San Francisco Unified School District.\u201d\u000a\u000aThrough a public records request, the Examiner obtained emails between The Primary School, city and school officials that detail months of discussion about the project that continued into February.\u000a\u000aChan first inquired about opening a charter school in The City last June. The conversation has since turned into whether to open the school as a charter or Small School by Design.\u000a\u000aCharters offer more flexibility for hiring staff than small schools, which are still governed by school district policy, have low-student enrollment and are focused on student equity.\u000a\u000aBut charters, which have more independence, are not as well received in San Francisco unless they serve particular populations like inmates at County Jail or juvenile offenders.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are at a cross-roads and would like to explore the options of [The Primary School] becoming a Small School by Design within the SFUSD structure, or applying for a jointly designed public charter,\u201d Hydra Mendoza-McDonnell, Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s education advisor, wrote in an email Feb. 2.\u000a\u000aMendoza-McDonnell, who is also vice president of the Board of Education, is supportive of the project and has been leading the conversations since June 2016. At the time, she and then-Superintendent Richard Carranza hoped to have board approval for the school to open as a charter by March 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is also a question about whether you need to be a charter next fall or if we should start with an MOU and convert it into a charter in a couple of years when we actually have students old enough to begin the infant/toddler classroom,\u201d she wrote in June.\u000a\u000aThere was a lull in discussions about The Primary School after Carranza left in September. His permanent replacement, Vincent Matthews, will take the reins next month.\u000a\u000aThe Primary School is meant to help those most likely to fall through the cracks of traditional public school, including recent immigrants, homeless families and teen mothers. Costs for running the school would be split between public funding and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative \u2014 the couple\u2019s philanthropic effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re interested in any approach that might ensure better outcomes for San Francisco\u2019s highest need families and children,\u201d Interim Superintendent Myong Leigh said in an email through a spokesperson.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Primary School model offers something that we aren\u2019t currently doing: starting with when a child is born and providing consistent coordinated services to parents and their children over more than a decade,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is all just exploratory at this time, we haven\u2019t yet gotten into the details with regards to oversight, staffing, finances and location.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeredith Liu, president and COO of The Primary School, said in an Aug. 21 email that they want the school \u201cto be within walking distance of SFGH but could also look at Bayview/Hunter\u2019s Point or other areas of the city with a concentration of high-need families.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe project could have the potential to compete for space with other priorities the school district has, like building new schools in the Bayview to meet the demand of the development boom or the construction of teacher housing, which both rely on the availability of city- and district-owned property.\u000a\u000aIn an Aug. 23 email, Mendoza-McDonnell said the school will likely need its own campus.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis sounds like a stand-alone space and not a shared space,\u201d Mendoza-McDonnell wrote, adding that she wanted to have further conversation with \u201cThe City\u2019s real estate folks and Office of Economic and Workforce Development for city and private property considerations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe following month, Mendoza-McDonnell said in a Sept. 12 email there were a range of potential sites for the school from \u201csharing a space at Malcolm X Academy in the Bayview,\u201d which is an under-enrolled school, \u201cto a stand-alone site in the Mission just blocks from\u201d SFGH.\u000a\u000aSchool board President Shamann Walton said in an interview Monday he is excited about the potential partnership but would prefer to see it benefit children in the Bayview as a small school rather than a charter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would love for them to infuse their pediatric practices into one of our schools in the southeast sector,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take resources away from the traditional system.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here or scroll down to comment

aVTrump says 'fire and fury' warning to North Korea maybe not 'tough enough' 'Let\u2019s see what he does with Guam,' Trump said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said he could have used even stronger language this week toward North Korea and issued a new warning to dictator Kim Jong Un over his threat to strike the U.S. territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aTrump said he might not have been "tough enough" when he threatened earlier this week to bring "fire and fury like the world has never seen" down on North Korea if it continued provocations, and he said the United States was preparing for various alternatives involving the isolated nation.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly, the people that were questioning that statement \u2014 was it too tough? \u2014 maybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea had warned of a possible attack on Guam and dismissed Trump\u2019s threat as \u201ca load of nonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s see what he does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event, the likes of which nobody\u2019s seen before, what will happen in North Korea,\u201d Trump said of Kim.\u000a\u000a"No, that's not a dare," he continued. "That is a statement of fact."\u000a\u000aSome members of Trump's team, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have sought to downplay the president's fiery language, which was off-the-cuff and criticized by some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\u000a\u000aAs tensions rose, Trump\u2019s team has seemed at odds at times about the severity of the North Korea threat. Tillerson told reporters Wednesday that \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night\u201d and expressed \u201cno concerns\u201d about the president\u2019s statements.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary Jim Mattis in a statement later that day took a more aggressive stance, saying North Korea \u201cshould cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump insisted that there were no mixed messages coming from his administration, and he said Americans \u201cshould be very comfortable\u201d because \u201cif North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us, they can be very, very nervous.\u201d He further warned North Korea that \u201cthings will happen to them like they never thought possible, OK?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe people of our country are safe.

aVPaul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign manager, has emerged as a central figure in Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images FBI raided Manafort\u2019s Virginia home in Russia probe FBI agents recently raided the residence of Paul Manafort as part of the ongoing probe into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 FBI agents recently raided the residence of Paul Manafort, and he has turned over hundreds of pages of documents to congressional investigators as probes ramp up into President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000a\u201cFBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,\u201d said Jason Maloni, a spokesman for the former Trump campaign chairman.\u000a\u000aThe pre-dawn raid at the Virginia home, which was first reported by the Washington Post, roused Manafort, who was in town to appear before Congress, according to a person familiar with the situation. Agents took reams of material from the home.\u000a\u000aManafort is also under scrutiny from congressional investigators, and he has turned over 400 pages of documents to the Senate judiciary committee, a committee spokesman said Wednesday, including information on his foreign lobbying work.\u000a\u000aThe long-time Republican campaign operative and lobbyist has also provided information to the Senate intelligence committee about a meeting he attended last year with a Russian lawyer that was billed as chance to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aManafort\u2019s lawyers have said he is cooperating with congressional probes and special counsel Robert Mueller, but the FBI raid indicates that Mueller\u2019s office may not believe it is getting full cooperation.\u000a\u000aMueller\u2019s spokesman Joshua Stueve declined to comment on the raid.\u000a\u000aDuke Law School professor Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor, said a search warrant would only be needed if Mueller doubted Manafort would comply with document requests or a subpoena.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course it confirms beyond doubt serious criminal investigative focus on Manafort,\u201d Buell said.\u000a\u000aA Washington-based defense lawyer with a client caught in the Russia probe said Mueller may also want to turn Manafort into a cooperative witness, something the former campaign manager\u2019s representatives had previously said wasn\u2019t happening.\u000a\u000aAustin Wright contributed to this report.

aVISTANBUL \u2014 If you travel to Turkey these days, you might want to mind your sartorial choices.\u000a\u000aLast week, an Azerbaijani national was detained and deported from the northeastern town of Kars, while across Turkey more than 30 unsuspecting citizens have been picked up by the police over the past month. Their alleged crime? Wearing a T-shirt.\u000a\u000aThe trouble began on July 13, when Gokhan Güçlü, a soldier accused of participating in last year\u2019s coup attempt, appeared in court in a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cHero\u201d printed in black-and-white letters across his chest.\u000a\u000aHis attire sparked a heated exchange in the courtroom, forcing the judge to adjourn the hearing. The following day, enraged protesters hung white T-shirts with the word \u201ctraitor\u201d from miniature gallows outside the court.\u000a\u000aAlthough the offending item was a widely available T-shirt sold by the Turkish clothing brand Defacto, the ensuing scandal transformed it into a symbol of sympathy with the putschists \u2014 and underscored just how brittle the rule of law has become in Turkey.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe didn\u2019t follow the news. We got the T-shirts at a shopping center. We didn\u2019t know they were forbidden\u201d \u2014 Detained university students\u000a\u000aAnyone caught sporting the same T-shirt was detained and accused of \u201cmaking propaganda for a terrorist organisation\u201d \u2014 referring to the movement of U.S.-based imam Fethullah Gülen, whom Turkey has named as the attempted coup\u2019s mastermind.\u000a\u000aThe flagship pro-government newspaper Sabah even detected a secret message in the T-shirt slogan: \u201cHERO,\u201d they wrote, was short for \u201cHoca Efendi Razi Olsun,\u201d translating roughly to \u201cMay the teacher bless you.\u201d \u201cHoca efendi\u201d \u2014 a title of respect for religious teachers \u2014 supposedly refers to Gülen, who is often addressed as such.\u000a\u000aMany suspects, however, said they were simply unaware of the scandal and the rather serious fashion faux pas they had committed. Two university students who were detained for wearing the T-shirt told the police: \u201cWe didn\u2019t follow the news. We got the T-shirts at a shopping center. We didn\u2019t know they were forbidden. We wore the same T-shirts because we wanted to match each other.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore than 30 people have been detained as of early August; all but two have been released. State prosecutors announced they would investigate Güclü\u2019s sister, who reportedly sent him the T-shirt, and the prison authorities who permitted him to wear it.\u000a\u000aAmong those detained were several teenagers. The youngest, aged 13, was picked up while sitting at a cafe with his father. One student wearing an entirely different gray T-shirt with the slogan \u201cpart-time hero\u201d was also detained.\u000a\u000aDemonstration of loyalty\u000a\u000aThe T-shirt hysteria was largely met with ridicule from government critics, yet many also saw its darker side.\u000a\u000aArbitrary arrests and prosecutions based on spurious evidence have become increasingly common over the past year. Turkey has imprisoned more than 50,000 of its citizens since the attempted coup, ostensibly to rid the state and society of suspected Gülen supporters.\u000a\u000aMany Turks, including government critics, consider Gülen\u2019s opaque movement suspicious and dangerous. But the purge expanded as it rumbled on, targeting not only putschists and established Gülenists, but any citizen with the slightest connection to the group.\u000a\u000aThese days, it does not take much to be labelled a Gülenist: A one-dollar bill at home or an account at the Gülen-linked Bank Asya, both considered evidence of terror crimes by the state, have cost many Turks their jobs and their freedom.\u000a\u000aPresident Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has established significant control over the judiciary, exerting pressure on judges to rule in favour of the state. But the government\u2019s degree of involvement in the spate of T-shirt arrests and similar cases remains uncertain.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear sense of how centralised these arrests are,\u201d said Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey expert at New York\u2019s St. Lawrence University and fellow at the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington-based think tank.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy strong sense is that much of this is generated by prosecutors and facilitated by judges who are guessing at what the government wants, who are feeling pressured by a cheerleading press. You have an environment where everyone is trying to demonstrate their loyalty,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBranded traitors\u000a\u000aFear and suspicion have gripped Turkey since the failed coup. Critics worry about their country\u2019s democratic decline, the erosion of state-mandated secularism, increasing government surveillance and the potential of arrest.\u000a\u000aBut among loyalists, too, paranoia reigns. Fearful of another coup attempt, the government is constantly on the lookout for enemies within. Civil servants who criticise or rule against the state face suspension, investigation or arrest.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re a policeman or prosecutor, perhaps you\u2019re a true believer, but perhaps you\u2019re doing what bureaucrats have always done \u2014 you look at the potential cost of action and inaction and take steps accordingly,\u201d Eissenstat said. \u201cAnd the cost of not prosecuting, not detaining, can be pretty steep.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn one much-cited example that alarmed government critics, three judges were suspended earlier this year after deciding to release a group of journalists, against the wishes of the state prosecutor. The journalists were re-arrested instantly.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the T-shirt frenzy shows no sign of abating. On Monday night, a man wearing the by now infamous top was arrested while having dinner in the western city of Adana.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Erdo\u011fan announced that coup suspects would be required to wear a brown uniform in court.\u000a\u000aWith nearly 500 coup suspects currently standing trial, the government appears keen to avoid a repeat of the controversy.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Erdo\u011fan announced that coup suspects would be required to wear a brown uniform in court. The president had previously called for defendants to be dressed in orange jumpsuits akin to those worn by detainees in Guantanamo.\u000a\u000aBut Takvim, a pro-government tabloid with little regard for facts, has already identified the next fashion scandal.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper zoomed in on other coup suspects\u2019 clothes last week and found that they wore American brands such as Calvin Klein \u2014 as far as Takvim was concerned, evidence that the U.S. conspired with Gülen to overthrow Erdo\u011fan.

The host governor, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, may also be open to a presidential run.\u000a\u000aAnd while each is from a decidedly more Democratic state than Mr. Bullock, both are also unapologetic, business-friendly pragmatists with a focus on economic development that borders on obsessive.\u000a\u000aMr. McAuliffe will not retreat from his support for free trade pacts, slyly noting that he stands with \u201cthe president\u201d (as in: Barack Obama) on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u000a\u000aAnd Ms. Raimondo, noting that \u201call I\u2019m doing is jobs,\u201d recalled with a touch of incredulity how she recently gave an economic speech and was told afterward by attendees that it was \u201crisky\u201d to \u201chave that pro-growth, pro-job message as a Democrat.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aRecounting her efforts to promote apprenticeships in Rhode Island\u2019s shipyards, Ms. Raimondo echoed Mr. Bullock on free college for all. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they ever go and get a four-year degree or not,\u201d she said, warning her party not to be \u201csnobby\u201d about higher education.\u000a\u000aThe challenge for the would-be presidential contenders on the center left, however, can be found in how Mr. Trump found success.\u000a\u000aUnlike Republican nominees before him, the president ran on a platform of racially tinged nationalism, vowing to tear up trade deals and protect entitlements while using language rarely heard from mainstream politicians about minority communities.\u000a\u000aIn attempting to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, many Democrats have therefore chalked it up to his racial demagogy and rhetorical populism. They find the first of these tactics reprehensible, but many have an impulse to counter the president with their own, more robust brand of populism.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThis reaction does not point toward budget-balancing governors preaching pragmatism.\u000a\u000aYet the whims of political fate can be fickle.\u000a\u000aAfter the 2004 election, Democrats\u2019 second consecutive presidential loss, some in the party believed that they could win in 2008 only by nominating a red-state centrist. They won with an African-American Chicagoan named Barack Hussein Obama.\u000a\u000aAnd after their own back-to-back presidential defeats, Republicans said after 2012 that the path back to the White House could be found in nominating a candidate better able to connect with the younger and more diverse rising American electorate. Enter Mr. Trump.\u000a\u000aSo there may be hope yet for Mr. Bullock, a former state attorney general whose down-home boosterism about Montana\u2019s natural wonders belies a Columbia Law degree and stint as a Washington lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson. He has already started on the Democratic speaking circuit, appearing before a Center for American Progress forum in May. Next week, he will attend another donor-filled gathering on the \u201cDivided States of America\u201d at the Aspen Institute.\u000a\u000aTo the barricades it is not.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe values folks want is for government to run its own budgets and be as careful with their money as a family is with their own,\u201d Mr. Bullock said.

aVOver the past 72 hours, a teetering uncertainty has loomed over the ongoing crisis in North Korea. There\u2019s been a dizzying array of news: military exercises, intelligence reports that the nation now has the ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and fit it onto a missile, President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cfire, fury and, frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before\u201d if North Korea continues with its current path, and, hours later, a North Korean response announcing plans for a missile strike near the U.S. territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aBut what actually changed this week? Not much, says Lisa Collins, an expert on North Korea and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Collins says that what we\u2019re seeing is very serious, but also unlikely to lead to a war anytime soon. And, she cautions, if you understand North Korea\u2019s point of view, you\u2019ll see why Trump\u2019s comments might be just what North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un was looking for.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Magazine: What is the practical impact of Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d comments on the North Korea crisis?\u000a\u000aLisa Collins: The rhetoric has been heightened, but I don\u2019t think that it changes the actual reality of the North Korean threat. North Korea is used to giving and relaying this kind of rhetoric, and North Korea is very used to these responses.\u000a\u000aThreatening war or military action against North Korea \u2026 works more towards the advantage of North Korea, not our advantage. After all, it\u2019s a totalitarian regime\u2014it uses threats from the U.S. to consolidate control within the country. It represses its people. The more that North Korea can create the perception of an outside threat, the more it can control the internal domestic situation. That gives the regime more power internally, which it can use externally.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: So far, has North Korea\u2019s response to the U.S. been different than in past crises?\u000a\u000aCollins: The threat that North Korea made about shooting missiles at Guam, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very different qualitatively than other statements it has made. It frequently threatens to make Seoul into a \u201csea of fire\u201d\u2014that means shooting missiles or artillery at Seoul. It also routinely releases videos showing North Korean missiles aimed at Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Capitol building.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: How seriously should we take North Korea\u2019s ability to cause damage?\u000a\u000aCollins: The North Korean threat is very real. I don\u2019t think we should take it as a joke. The North Koreans are very focused on their goal, which is technology. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go to war tomorrow. The tensions are high, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s spiraling out of control. The United States and South Korea are determined to contain the threat, and are working hard within the bounds of their alliance to do so.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I think we tend to underestimate North Korea and how fast they can develop technologies. They\u2019ve consistently surprised us with how fast they\u2019ve been able to develop this stuff. Think about the missile tests on July 4 and July 28: People hadn\u2019t expected North Korea would have the technical ability to shoot ballistic missiles at such a far range, but they showed they could do it at least once. So we shouldn\u2019t underestimate how quickly they\u2019re working.\u000a\u000aSomething important to note is that they tend to not be afraid of failure in comparison to other countries. North Korea consistently tests technology even if they\u2019ve had failures in the past. They get information from every test that helps them improve technology. In other countries, they wait to perfect things before testing them. North Korea doesn\u2019t do that.\u000a\u000aThere are two objectives of this kind of rapid testing. One, they prove they can do what they say they will do. When there\u2019s a test, a lot of people question them; experts go on TV and question whether North Korea can really do what they say they will. Two, North Korea wants to prove that they can actually do the damage they want to in order to achieve their strategic objectives. They want to show their hand.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: What catalysts cause these kinds of threats from North Korea?\u000a\u000aCollins: They usually do it in response to something that\u2019s happened. For example, if a sanctions resolution is passed that targets North Korea, they might do something like release a video showing missiles being aimed at D.C.\u000a\u000a[Kim\u2019s regime] has two audiences for almost every action: It has an internal audience, the North Korean people, and it has an external audience, the rest of the world. So I think when North Korea engages in bombastic rhetoric, it\u2019s speaking to an internal audience, saying \u201cthe U.S. is a threat, therefore we need to concentrate our resources on building up our army, and you should contribute money to that.\u201d They\u2019re trying to consolidate power within country; they\u2019re creating a perception threat that they can use to repress people. That\u2019s one rationale.\u000a\u000aAnd the other, in external communication, is to show to the world that North Korea isn\u2019t about to back down to any sort of U.S. pressure, while communicating that message to China and South Korea at the same time. So there are many different audiences North Korea is targeting when it makes statements.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: On a leader-to-leader level, is the more aggressive language Trump\u2019s using likely to be more effective, because it\u2019s sort of more in Kim\u2019s wheelhouse?\u000a\u000aCollins: So Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump don\u2019t have a personal relationship\u2014they\u2019ve never met in person\u2014but in terms of communicating between leaders around the world, this is definitely not traditional. I don\u2019t think leaders usually communicate over Twitter or KCNA [North Korea\u2019s state-run news agency] messages; there are other channels of communication that normal leaders use, such as secret phone calls or messages communicated through military [channels].\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t think the communication over Twitter is particularly helpful\u2014that\u2019s my personal opinion\u2014but it depends on what Trump\u2019s motive is. We don\u2019t know what that motive is. Is he just doing something to draw a response from North Korea? Is his audience China or Russia instead? We don\u2019t really know what his motives are, and unless we know that, it\u2019s pretty hard to judge what he\u2019s trying to do. But no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a particularly effective way of communicating with North Korea.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: Regardless of Trump\u2019s motives, how do you think a North Korean audience, whether that\u2019s Kim Jong Un or the general populace, reads Trump\u2019s rhetoric?\u000a\u000aCollins: North Koreans don\u2019t generally respond very well to threats. I think they\u2019d be unlikely to back down from this because they\u2019d see it as weakness to back down. There\u2019s been a pattern of North Korean response in the past, going back to Kim\u2019s father and grandfather, that generally they tend not to back down from, but to escalate threats until they get some sort of benefit out of it. They use escalation as leverage to get something they want, and return to negotiations of some sort. Unfortunately, the more rhetorical back and forth there is, the greater chance for miscalculation that could spiral into conflict.\u000a\u000aI do think there are people around Trump, like Secretary of State [Rex] Tillerson and chief of staff [John] Kelly, and [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster, who are all trying to tone down and moderate the kind of back-and-forth communications.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: You said that in the past, North Korea has made threats similar to the one they made this week about Guam, promising the tiny island an attack in the form of \u201cenveloping fire.\u201d Is there something more troubling about the message this time?\u000a\u000aCollins: So the statement about Guam from North Korea yesterday was more specific than it normally is. I think one of the reasons they mentioned Guam was because there\u2019s a U.S. base there that houses some of the B-1B bombers that are sent to fly over the Korean Peninsula to show North Korea that the U.S. is ready to respond at any time. So I think that\u2019s probably one of the reasons\u2014I believe it was Tuesday when U.S. last sent fighter flights near the Korean Peninsula from Guam.\u000a\u000aGuam is about 3,500 kilometers from North Korea, and the missiles that North Korea is developing\u2014one of their latest missiles they tested is called the Hwasong 12. It\u2019s in the range between medium-to-intercontinental ballistic missile. It can reach Guam\u2014or, North Korea has claimed that it can reach Guam. So North Korea might be using this to show that they have this technology that they\u2019ve developed in this missile that can be launched at any time. It [would be] more technical proof that they possess technology and the capabilities they\u2019ve been claiming this entire time.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d agree that North Korea isn\u2019t a rational actor, and if not, how do we deal with that?\u000a\u000aCollins: I do think North Korea is a rational actor. It\u2019s not doing what we anticipate or expect it to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily irrational.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has a goal and objective to everything it does. It just might not be very clear to us what its motives are at the time. Deterrence is working and we can see that because a lot of people anticipated that North Korea was going to conduct a sixth nuclear test over the last few months, and it has not yet done that. There might be a couple of reasons for that: It might be because of fear of reaction of U.S., or because of fear of reaction from China.\u000a\u000aSo I think we do see deterrence working in effect because what we anticipate North Korea might do, it actually does not do sometimes. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t underestimate what North Korea can do. But I think the U.S. is consistently working with its allies to show and demonstrate that deterrence is in effect. That's through sending aircraft carriers to the region, doing flights of stealth aircraft over the peninsula, working with Japan and South Korea on missile defense systems. There's different pieces of this that the U.S. is always working on.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: You lived in South Korea for 10 years. How does the North Korea threat look from there?\u000a\u000aCollins: South Koreans often don\u2019t react at all to what's happening in North Korea. Overnight, there wasn\u2019t much reaction from the South Korean public in terms of what was happening with North Korean threats, but in the U.S., obviously, people were very concerned. South Koreans have lived under the North Korean threat for more than 50 years now. They\u2019ve become accustomed to North Korea doing unexpected things and making threats like this, so part of it is that they\u2019ve tuned it out.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Mag: How do we find an off-ramp for this crisis?\u000a\u000aCollins: I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be sitting down in public for a negotiation, but there would probably have to be some communication\u2014either public or through back channels\u2014just to make sure there are no misunderstandings that can lead to further escalation of tensions. There\u2019s a hotline between the North and the South: A military hotline that could be opened to sort of maybe create a channel that could relieve some of the tensions.\u000a\u000aDiplomacy is ultimately a goal that we want to strive for\u2014that\u2019s the only solution to the North Korean nuclear situation or crisis: an agreement to encourage them to get rid of their program.\u000a\u000aThis interview has been edited and lightly condensed for clarity.\u000a\u000aSarah Holder is an editorial intern at Politico Magazine.

aVBrigitte Macron is unlikely to be put on a par, title-wise, with Melania Trump | Pool photo by Michel Euler/EPA Brigitte Macron: President\u2019s wife, not first lady \u2018Emmanuel Macron has backed down on his position in light of our mobilization these last few days, and we thank him for it,\u2019 says petition organizer.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 Brigitte Macron will not be given the official title of \u201cfirst lady\u201d after an online uproar that roused France from its summer slumber.\u000a\u000aHowever, she will still be widely referred to as the first lady and have access to a small staff to run her office, housed near her husband\u2019s.\u000a\u000aPresident Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push to change his wife\u2019s official status seems to have confused quite a lot of people, including the man who launched the petition that stopped the plan in its tracks.\u000a\u000aNearly 30o,000 people signed the petition set up by artist and activist Thierry Paul Valette, who argued that Brigitte Macron should not be legally recognized as first lady because doing so would give her access to a \u201cbudget\u201d with \u201cpublic funds.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEmmanuel Macron has backed down on his position in light of our mobilization these last few days, and we thank him for it\u201d \u2014 Thierry Paul Valette\u000a\u000aValette also said the move would be unfair as the French parliament has backed legislation barring MPs from employing their spouses and relatives \u2014 a direct response to the fake jobs scandal that scuppered conservative François Fillon\u2019s chances of becoming president.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, when the Elysée suggested it would not pursue legislation changing Brigitte Macron\u2019s legal status (and instead would publish a \u201ctransparency charter\u201d with detailed accounts on her activities), Valette took to Facebook to declare a \u201cbeautiful citizens\u2019 victory.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEmmanuel Macron has backed down on his position in light of our mobilization these last few days, and we thank him for it,\u201d wrote Valette.\u000a\u000aThe artist, who campaigned against Macron during the presidential and parliamentary elections, had scored a political point against a president whose approval ratings are in free fall because of budget cuts and controversial reform plans.\u000a\u000aIn doing so he was in step with far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose party criticized Brigitte Macron getting first lady status in parliament last month (despite no legislation on the issue being on the agenda).\u000a\u000aHowever, their main argument against the idea \u2014 that she should not be using taxpayers\u2019 money to pay staff \u2014 seemed to miss the point. Title or no title, Brigitte Macron\u2019s arrangement at the Elysée will be no different than that of every presidential spouse since the time of Valéry Giscard d\u2019Estaing.\u000a\u000aExcept in one important regard: Brigitte Macron will get less money than her predecessor \u2014 François Hollande\u2019s now former partner Valerie Trierweiler \u2014 because of solidarity with budget constraints elsewhere, and her staff resources will be made public for the first time (previously it was wrapped up with the rest of the Elysée\u2019s operating budget).\u000a\u000aMaking the office of the president\u2019s partner more transparent \u2014 and avoiding accusations that she was wasting taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 were precisely the reasons Macron suggested changing her status at the Elysée.\u000a\u000aYet the protesters were not necessarily interested in transparency, they wanted to force the president to back down.\u000a\u000aIn that sense, they have likely succeeded. An Elysée spokesman told POLITICO that a statement to be issued in the coming weeks regarding Brigitte Macron\u2019s status would clarify her role and number of staff, but not dwell on her legal status.\u000a\u000aIn other words, she is unlikely to be put on par, title-wise, with Melania Trump.\u000a\u000aThe former teacher will still be able to run a children\u2019s charity. She just won\u2019t be able to do so in an officially recognized capacity. And yet the press and some official communications will still refer to her as \u201cla Première Dame\u201d \u2014 a direct translation of \u201cfirst lady.\u201d

Debbie Wasserman Schultz after his arrest on a bank fraud charge.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe allegations levied against Imran Awan are alarming and could have serious national security ramifications,\u201d DeSantis, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a news release accompanying his letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Department of Justice must work to immediately mitigate the damage done by Awan and take whatever measures are necessary, including freezing illicit funds, in order to fully investigate this incident,\u201d DeSantis wrote.\u000a\u000aHours later, Wasserman Schultz defended her actions surrounding Awan, saying she resisted terminating him out of her concerns for due process.\u000a\u000aAwan is accused of attempting to defraud the Congressional Federal Credit Union by obtaining a $165,000 home equity loan for a rental property, which is against the credit union\u2019s policies since it is not the owner\u2019s primary residence. Investigators say those funds were then included as part of a $283,000 wire transfer to two individuals in Faisalabad, Pakistan.\u000a\u000aIn his letter, DeSantis asks whether DOJ is bringing in the Treasury Department\u2019s financial crimes bureau to help look at Awan\u2019s finances for evidence of other crimes, and whether any U.S. banks tipped off the feds regarding any suspicious activity with accounts held by Awan or his wife.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Awan\u2019s attorneys filed a motion Wednesday seeking the return of roughly $9,000 he said Capitol police took from him when he was arrested July 24 as he attempted to leave the United States for Pakistan, where his wife had previously moved.\u000a\u000aAwan has also been at the center of a criminal investigation on Capitol Hill for months for allegedly pilfering House computer equipment.\u000a\u000aDeSantis wants to make sure DOJ is investigating whether any money made from selling the allegedly stolen equipment was included in the wire transfer to Pakistan. He asks whether DOJ lawyers will seek a court order freezing any proceeds Awan made from selling the equipment or any real estate transactions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile we can never tolerate breaches of the public trust, the wire transfer to Pakistan is particularly alarming, as Pakistan is home to numerous terrorist organizations,\u201d DeSantis wrote.\u000a\u000aNational security aside, the case has a political dimension for DeSantis, a likely candidate for governor who has mused about calling Wasserman Schultz to testify before the judiciary panel about the case.\u000a\u000aThe case has captured the attention of conservatives abuzz with speculation that Awan \u2014 despite a lack of evidence \u2014 might have been involved in the hack of information at the Democratic National Committee when Wasserman Schultz was chair. The U.S. national intelligence community has blamed the hack on Russia.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The day before his arrest, the Daily Caller reported that Awan\u2019s house was raided by the FBI, which seized smashed computer hard drives. It is unclear whether the bank fraud case is directly related to the cybersecurity probe.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz defended her decision to keep Awan on the payroll, even if that meant she was the only member of Congress who would.\u000a\u000a"As a mother, a Jew, and a Member of Congress, if there is one thing I know for sure, it's this: my commitment to doing what's right and just \u2014 even if it isn't what's easy and simple \u2014 is unyielding,\u201d she said in a statement. "Whether that meant standing in opposition to the Terri Schiavo bill, combating prejudice by encouraging my colleagues to bring Muslim-American constituents to the State of the Union, or questioning whether an employee has been afforded due process before terminating him, I have never been afraid to stand alone when justice demands it."\u000a\u000aHer office says it paid Awan less than $8,000 this year.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz spokesman David Damron said her office worked with House staff to set up a way for "us to obtain, and our employee to provide, valuable services without access to the House network. Those services included consulting on a variety of office needs, such as on our website and printers, trouble-shooting, and other issues."\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz said it would have been \u201cundoubtedly\u201d easier to fire him, "despite the fact that I had not received any evidence of his alleged wrongdoing; but that is not the woman my constituents elected, and that is not the mother my children know me to be.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the investigation "raised troubling concerns for me about fair treatment, due process, and potential ethnic and religious profiling,\u201d as she vowed to "always protect the democratic and pluralistic values that we South Floridians hold so dear.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite the arrest, Wasserman Schultz said she has no regrets about the choice.\u000a\u000a"At the end of the day, there are times in our lives when we must do what may be hard but right, even when there is a cost,\u201d she said. "This was one of those times for me and I would make the same decision again."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVCNN severed ties with Jeffrey Lord on Thursday, hours after he ignited controversy by tweeting the words "Sieg Heil!" at a prominent liberal activist.\u000a\u000a"Nazi salutes are indefensible," a CNN spokesperson said in a statement. "Jeffrey Lord is no longer with the network."\u000a\u000aLord said his tweet was misunderstood. He said he was mocking fascists, not acting like one.\u000a\u000a"I love CNN, but I feel they are caving to bullies here," he said in a telephone interview shortly after the network's decision was announced.\u000a\u000aLord said his contract was set to expire at the end of the year. He said he greatly respected CNN management despite disagreeing with the decision.\u000a\u000aThis is not the first time CNN has cut ties with a prominent personality on the network due to an offensive tweet.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year CNN cancelled Reza Aslan's documentary series "Believer" after he posted profane anti-Trump tweets.\u000a\u000aLord, a former Reagan administration staffer, had been one of CNN's best-known commentators. He was the first explicitly pro-Donald Trump commentator to join the network, back in August 2015, two months after Trump entered the GOP primary race. At the time Lord was a counterweight to CNN's other conservative commentators, who were all dismissive of Trump's candidacy.\u000a\u000aOther pro-Trump voices joined the network later. But Lord always stood out from the pack -- for his interpretations of history and his intense exchanges with commentators like Van Jones on "Anderson Cooper 360" and other programs.\u000a\u000aLord, a columnist for The American Spectator, has been harshly critical of the activist he tweeted at, Angelo Carusone, and the liberal group of which Carusone is president, Media Matters for America.\u000a\u000aLord and Carusone have had many sharp disagreements. Media Matters has repeatedly condemned Lord and criticized CNN for employing him as a commentator.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week the two men got into another entanglement on Twitter, specifically over Media Matters' past financial support from George Soros.\u000a\u000aCarusone told Lord that one of his columns was "full of lies" and said "Soros gave us one donation one time...in 2010."\u000a\u000aLord wrote a follow-up column for The American Spectator on Thursday morning, calling Carusone's group the "Media Matters Fascists," casting them as "anti-free speech bigots who, in typical fascist style, make it their mission to shut down speech they don't like."\u000a\u000aMedia Matters has been promoting an ad boycott against Fox News host Sean Hannity, a friend of Lord's.\u000a\u000aLord said Carusone was playing a "fascist game" by targeting Hannity's sponsors, and said Media Matters has been doing it for years against other conservatives.\u000a\u000a"This is America, Angelo. Not Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany or Communist Russia," he wrote.\u000a\u000aLord tweeted the column at Carusone, who responded, "Your headline has a mistake in it." Carusone asked, "Why do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you don't take yourself seriously."\u000a\u000aLord's response was "Sieg Heil!"\u000a\u000aThe tweet caused a Twitter storm. There was renewed criticism both of Lord, personally, and of CNN for having him on the payroll.\u000a\u000aCarusone tweeted on Thursday afternoon and said "CNN does not seem to hold Jeffrey Lord to any kind of standard."\u000a\u000aUnder withering criticism from others on social media, Lord did not backtrack from the Nazi reference.\u000a\u000aHe repeatedly told commenters that he was "mocking Nazis and Fascists."\u000a\u000aHe asked, "Why would I delete something that mocks the Fascists at Media Matters Fascists?"\u000a\u000aLater, in a telephone interview with CNN, Lord said, "I think these people are very dangerous."\u000a\u000a"They run around bullying people, bullying advertisers to take people off the air," he added.\u000a\u000aOf the offensive tweet, he said, "I'm mocking people who are posing a serious threat to the American free press. That's what I'm mocking."\u000a\u000aAnother Trump-supporting conservative commentator, Kayleigh McEnany, recently left CNN under unrelated circumstances.\u000a\u000aMcEnany asked to be let out of her CNN contract to become the spokeswoman for the RNC.\u000a\u000aCNN has about a dozen other conservative commentators who tend to support the president's agenda.

aVLONDON \u2014 This much is clear: If there is a Brexit deal, the U.K. is going to pay for it.\u000a\u000aReports in the British press that London\u2019s opening offer will be £36 billion (\u20ac40 billion) have focused attention on the all-important question of the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations \u2014 one of the three exit issues on which the EU wants to see \u201csufficient progress\u201d by October if Brexit talks are to move on to trade.\u000a\u000aThe specific figure of £36 billion is not recognized by Downing Street, Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman said Monday.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s no surprise, because while the EU wants an estimate of the bill, or at least a methodology, by October, U.K. government officials have long said they don\u2019t want to make a formal estimate until they have something to show for it. To do otherwise would be tantamount to paying tens of billions \u201cfor a conversation\u201d about trade, said one official speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is clearly prepared to pay something. The longstanding government line has been that Britain is a country that meets is legal obligations.\u000a\u000aAn opening offer of £36 billion would be well below the minimum \u20ac65 billion (£59 billion) that the EU will ask for, according to the consensus among officials in Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe debate in Whitehall is not whether the U.K. should pay, but how that payment should be managed \u2014 and how it should be presented to Euroskeptic MPs and a British public that voted for Brexit at least in part based on the false promise of £350 million a week being repatriated from the EU budget, not 100 times that amount going the other way.\u000a\u000aStaggered payment plan\u000a\u000aThe latest thinking is that part of the bill can be paid off as annual contributions to the EU budget, in exchange for market access on something close to existing terms, during a transition period.\u000a\u000aThe Telegraph, citing U.K. officials, reported that £10 billion a year net payments for three years would be proposed. Officials POLITICO spoke to said detailed proposals were not yet finalized, but the \u201cprinciples seemed sensible.\u201d\u000a\u000aPayments for three years after Brexit would end in 2021, by which time the EU\u2019s current budgetary round will have expired, and long-term planning for life without the U.K. could have taken place without any \u201ccliff edge\u201d drop in income.\u000a\u000aCharles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform think tank, said such a proposal had merit and could allow the Brexit talks to progress to the next phase.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a strong feeling among U.K. and EU officials that the best way to present the Brexit bill is as payments during a transition, in return for market access,\u201d he said. \u201cThree years of paying about £10 billion a year would mean the U.K. handing over a large part of what the EU wants \u2014 not all of it, but enough to create goodwill and probably to get the EU to talk about trade.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrexit Secretary David Davis, speaking back in December, pointedly declined to rule out a Brexit deal that in one shape or other saw the U.K. paying for market access.\u000a\u000aAn opening offer of £36 billion would be well below the minimum \u20ac65 billion (£59 billion) that the EU will ask for, according to the consensus among officials in Brussels.\u000a\u000aHowever, both sides\u2019 projections of the Brexit bill are in part aimed at their hard-liners.\u000a\u000aOn the British side, these are the Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs, some of whom still insist that it\u2019s the EU that should be paying Britain, not the other way round. They matter because, with the balance of power in parliament so precarious, there are enough of them to, in theory, sink the Brexit deal when it comes to a vote.\u000a\u000aOn the EU side, the hard-liners are those nation states that either receive the largest sums from the EU budget, or contribute the most. Both are determined that chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s strategy won\u2019t leave them with a shortfall.\u000a\u000aMP problem\u000a\u000aAmong Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs, the response to reports Britain is prepared to pay £36 billion were mixed.\u000a\u000aJacob Rees-Mogg, a darling of the party\u2019s traditional right wing, said it was \u201cmuch too much,\u201d warning that the U.K. should not fall into the EU \u201ctrap\u201d of conceding a bill early in negotiations. Peter Bone, one of the most hard-line Brexiteers, repeated a favorite argument that as net contributors for many years, Britain should be the one receiving a divorce bill.\u000a\u000aHowever, a more emollient tone was struck by one significant figure. Suella Fernandes chairs the European Research Group group of Brexit-backing backbench Conservative MPs. Its former chair, Steve Baker, left in June after being given a job in the Department for Exiting the European Union. The group has played a pivotal role in mediating between MPs and the government on Brexit strategy, allowing ministers to ensure they were bringing the party with them.\u000a\u000aResponding to the £36 billion reports Monday, Fernandes told POLITICO: \u201cThe U.K. has always paid its legal dues. This reported figure is however pure speculation. There\u2019s no basis for it and we don\u2019t recognize the figure. The government is focused on getting the best deal for the U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, she added: \u201cAny agreement must be fair to the EU and the U.K. taxpayer. A bad deal is worse than no deal.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs recently as the spring, members of the European Research Group were arguing that May would never get a Brexit bill through parliament. After Davis\u2019 comments in December, Baker said that paying for market access would not constitute free trade. Fernandes calling for a deal that is \u201cfair\u201d to the EU represents a concession \u2014 holding out hope that May will be able to convince the group to back a Brexit bill of some form.\u000a\u000aThe Boris factor\u000a\u000aOne possible obstacle remains in the way of Tory backbenchers assenting to a Brexit bill in the tens of billions: Boris Johnson.\u000a\u000aThe foreign secretary, who was the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, was closely associated with the £350 million a week promise, so his personal reputation is bound up with the issue. Last month, he invited EU negotiators to \u201cgo whistle\u201d over their demands for a significant exit tab, positioning himself as a possible champion of those hard-liners who have yet to budge.\u000a\u000aLegally, the U.K. could leave the EU without paying a penny if there is no deal, a fact that Brexiteers such as former minister David Jones have noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis presents Boris Johnson and other hard-line ministers with a difficult dilemma: resign and perhaps fatally weaken the government; or accept a substantial budget payment and lose credibility with the Tory right-wingers,\u201d said Grant of the Centre for European Reform.\u000a\u000aJohnson\u2019s team declined to comment on Grant\u2019s suggestion that the foreign secretary might quit rather than accept a big Brexit bill \u2014 but the Brexit hard-liners, looking for a figurehead, will want a clear position from him as soon as MPs return from their summer holidays.\u000a\u000aFor some Brexiteers, however, the focus on what the U.K. owes risks the British side underestimating their negotiating hand.\u000a\u000aDavid Campbell-Bannerman, a Tory MEP and ardent Brexiteer, said: \u201cWe should be going into these negotiations like any sensible negotiator would, being confident \u2026 We have a very strong position. The EU wants access to our market \u2026 [and] to the largest financial center in the world. Let\u2019s not sell ourselves short on this.\u201d

aVLast year was the third in a row to break global temperature records, the NOAA report found. | Fred Tanneau/AFP/Getty Images 2016 confirmed as planet's hottest year The report is the most comprehensive assessment of climate change released by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aLast year was Earth's warmest on record, according to an international climate report issued Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that documents other record-breaking global warming trends of 2016.\u000a\u000aThe report is the most comprehensive assessment of the effects of climate change released by the Trump administration, and it could make it easier to refute efforts from the president and his Cabinet members to publicly discount climate science as they have frequently done in the past. However, the annual report does not detail the link between climate change and human activities such as burning coal or gasoline. Those conclusions are drawn in a separate draft portion of the National Climate Assessment highlighted by The New York Times earlier this week.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe \u201cState of the Climate\u201d publication, which confirms findings released before President Donald Trump was sworn in, outlines the observed outcomes of swiftly rising temperatures. They include the highest sea levels ever recorded, extremes in rain cycles and declines in global ice and snow cover. The nearly 500 authors convened by NOAA explain the effects that are due to both long-term global warming and shorter-term weather events like El Niño.\u000a\u000aLast year was the third in a row to break global temperature records, the report found. It includes science from nearly 60 countries and will appear in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society and on NOAA social media feeds.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is basically like an annual physical of the climate system,\u201d said report co-editor Deke Arndt, NOAA\u2019s climate monitoring chief.\u000a\u000aIt \u201ccompiles the facts the data the observations from around the climate system and puts it in an annual manuscript,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump has referred to climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d and his environment and energy secretaries have plans to host a public debate of the science that has generated outcry among some climate scientists who say the human-caused climate change is definitely happening. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt said his review could happen as soon as this fall.\u000a\u000a"The American people deserve an honest, open, transparent discussion about this supposed threat to this country,\u201d Pruitt said on a North Dakota radio show Wednesday.\u000a\u000aNOAA and NASA in January combined their data to announce 2016 was the hottest year so far, but the new report backs that finding up with science from around the world. NOAA, which is under the Commerce Department, stands out among other federal agencies. NOAA earlier this year released its annual Greenhouse Gas Index. The EPA, on the other hand, has removed climate change information from its website.\u000a\u000aNOAA said last year\u2019s heat record is \u201cfrom the combined influence of long-term global warming and a strong El Niño early in the year.\u201d\u000a\u000a"Several markers such as land and ocean temperatures, sea level and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere broke records set just one year prior," NOAA said.\u000a\u000aArdnt explained that NOAA doesn\u2019t specify what warming is from climate change and what is from weather events.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe long-term climate change is like riding up an escalator over time, and things like El Niño and La Niña are like jumping up and down on that escalator,\u201d Arndt said.\u000a\u000aThe Times reported that some scientists are worried the Trump administration could suppress or interfere with climate science reports like the National Climate Assessment, which is required by law to be issued next year. Authors of the subsection of that report, however, said they\u2019ve seen no sign that might happen. Arndt, who has been working on the NOAA annual report for eight years, said it includes the \u201csame general material,\u201d and underwent the \u201csame general process.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists who was not involved with the report, said it is \u201calmost at the level of the daily weather report you get.\u201d NOAA releases monthly data, too.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is typical, and it\u2019s ironic that people make a big [to-do] about the big reports that kind of tie it all together,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aEkwurzel said the government has a responsibility to inform people of the risks of man-made climate change.\u000a\u000aAmong its findings:\u000a\u000a\u2014 Greenhouse gas concentrations are higher than ever recorded. From 2015 to 2016, carbon dioxide concentrations saw their biggest annual increase in the 58 years on record, reaching peaks not seen in ice-core measurements representing the past 800,000 years.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Global surface temperatures are the highest on record.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Sea levels are the highest they\u2019ve ever been since record keeping began. Global seas are about 3.25 inches higher than the 1993 average when satellite recording began. 2016 marks the sixth year sea levels have risen.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Precipitation cycles are becoming more extreme.\u000a\u000a\u2014 The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the world.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Antarctic sea ice levels are lower than ever recorded.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Alpine glaciers have declined for 37 consecutive years. Glaciers shrunk an average of 2.8 feet.\u000a\u000a\u2014 There were more tropical cyclones, with 93 storms in 2016, compared with an average of 82 between 1981 and 2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe Trump White House is quietly courting a few dozen House Democrats on tax reform \u2014 eager to avoid the fate of the GOP's straight party-line attempt to jam through a repeal of Obamacare.\u000a\u000aEven as congressional GOP leaders largely embrace a partisan path on taxes, White House officials have been wooing 15 to 20 centrist House Democrats since early summer. The Trump administration is all too aware of congressional Republicans\u2019 struggles to come together on a range of hot-button issues \u2014 from health care to government spending \u2014 and tax reform is littered with political minefields for the party.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSo the president and his staff are opening a line of communication with moderate Democrats in case a Plan B is needed. At a mid-June dinner at the White House with four centrist House Democrats, President Donald Trump expressed interest in a bipartisan package combining tax reform with infrastructure spending, multiple sources said.\u000a\u000aSince then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and top White House staff have huddled with conservative Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019d prefer bipartisan support for the tax plan,\u201d Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, said in an interview. \u201cWe still think we can earn the support of [Democrats] on the tax package.\u201d Short acknowledged, however, that Hill Republicans \u201cwill choose the path that they want.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear just last week that Republicans will pursue a partisan bill. The sweeping bipartisan tax overhaul of 1986 is unlikely to be repeated this go-round, McConnell said as he announced plans to use the simple-majority budget reconciliation process to overcome a likely Democratic filibuster.\u000a\u000aMcConnell and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) have argued that Democrats could still get on board, but multiple GOP insiders say the plan for now is to proceed along party lines.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the White House isn't giving up on Democratic buy-in. Short and his staff have kept in touch with Problem Solvers Caucus leaders, including New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer, the top Democrat in the group who also attended the June meeting with Trump. And White House officials have made a pointed effort to gauge centrists\u2019 priorities for tax reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think there are a lot of practical folks in the House, Senate and the administration who are looking at health care and saying, \u2018That didn\u2019t work. Maybe we should have a backup Plan B \u2014 a coalition of Democrats and Republicans,\u2019\u201d said New York Rep. Tom Reed, the top Republican in the Problem Solvers Caucus.\u000a\u000aMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Short said he will begin additional outreach to Senate Democrats soon. In multiple interviews, Blue Dog Democrats sounded eager to work with the White House on a tax bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe door is open, and this should be a bipartisan issue,\u201d said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.). \u201cI hope they consider us.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore than most other minority members, \u201ccentrist Democrats are more focused on doing what can be done to lower the corporate rates and the rates for [small businesses],\u201d said Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), who is working on a list of Blue Dog tax priorities and red lines that will be made public this fall.\u000a\u000aIn the Senate, three of 48 members of the Democratic caucus declined to endorse a letter outlining their opposition to any bill that would add to the deficit or cut taxes for the top 1 percent of earners. One of those three, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, said he hasn\u2019t heard from the White House recently, but has expressed openness to a tax reform deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018I\u2019m happy to work with you all,'\u201d Manchin said of his discussions with McConnell. But he also warned the Republican leader against racking up more debt, and said using the option-limiting reconciliation maneuver is a mistake.\u000a\u000aAnd other Senate Democrats are hoping that McConnell\u2019s members can dissuade him from using reconciliation to exclude them from the process, a tactic that backfired with Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve heard lots of my Republican colleagues say consistently that, after the health care experience, they\u2019d like to see us try to work bipartisan on tax reform,\u201d Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a fiscally moderate Democrat on the tax-writing Finance panel.\u000a\u000aAsked whether Republicans could win Democratic votes for a tax bill using a fast-track procedure to pass the bill on 51-votes, Warner scoffed: \u201cNo. No.\u201d\u000a\u000aGoing the bipartisan route is hardly a guarantee of success, given the disincentive for leaders on both sides of the aisle to work together ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u000a\u000aRepublicans and Democrats also fundamentally disagree on whose taxes to cut and how any plan would affect the middle class. Republicans prefer reductions for top earners and business owners, which they believe will grow the economy and promote job creation. Democrats, on the other hand, have dubbed that kind of supply-side approach \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d and are more interested in ensuring that wealthier Americans carry a heavier tax burden than the poor and the middle class.\u000a\u000aIn the House, centrist Democrats have asked the White House that any bipartisan tax agreement include an infrastructure package. While Trump and Cohn are said to be receptive to that idea, it's on the back-burner for now. Senior Hill Republicans are wary of pairing the two, and some administration officials worry it's too heavy a lift to clear by year's end.\u000a\u000aEven so, some White House and congressional sources fear that a GOP tax bill could get muddled in the ongoing intra-conference war between conservatives and moderates. Should that happen, Republicans will need to find more votes \u2014 and centrist Democrats could be their only hope for passage.\u000a\u000aRecent precedent gives Republican some cause for optimism that Democrats will get behind tax cuts, even if they resort to reconciliation. President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts passed under reconciliation with Democratic votes in 2001 and 2003, with a dozen Senate Democrats supporting the individual rate reductions and two backing corporate cuts.\u000a\u000aThat's why Senate Republicans like Hatch aren't giving up on red-state Democrats, who are more inclined to work across the aisle. Hatch reminded Democrats last week that \u201cnothing in the rules requires reconciliation to be partisan.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, more administration and Capitol Hill officials are starting to express that sentiment. A repeat of the Bush-era scenario, in which Republicans win the support of just a handful of Democrats, could make all the difference in whether a tax bill becomes law.\u000a\u000aIn the Senate \u2014 the chamber known for more bipartisanship \u2014 talks between the two parties on tax reform have been all but nonexistent so far. McConnell's early embrace of a tax bill that needs 50 rather than 60 votes alienated some moderate Democrats who might have been inclined to engage, such as Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.\u000a\u000aTester, a top target for Republicans in next year's midterms, dismissed McConnell\u2019s claim that Democrats drove him to employ reconciliation as \u201cso much crap.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe did the same thing with health care,\u201d Tester said in an interview. \u201cWe offered to help and he said, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to run it down your throat.' He\u2019s going to do the same thing with taxes, and it\u2019s bad public policy when you don\u2019t bring people together to have a debate.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVAllegations against Germany\u2019s mighty car industry have flown thick and fast this week, but regulators are still asking themselves whether the carmakers really operated a hardcore cartel that scammed consumers for decades.\u000a\u000aBrussels and Bonn are investigating whether Germany\u2019s top five auto companies \u2014 Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche and Volkswagen \u2014 colluded at regular, and secret, meetings held to discuss technical standards, suppliers, costs and other issues. The meetings, revealed by Der Spiegel, spanned more than two decades.\u000a\u000aWhat looks like a cartel to outsiders may not be so obvious to regulators. Despite the stunning allegations, antitrust enforcers in Brussels are proceeding with caution. Automakers are quietly mounting a defense. And BMW, one of the five supposed members, said it has been neither raided by antitrust enforcers in connection to this inquiry nor questioned about the concerns.\u000a\u000aWhy would Volkswagen and Daimler formally confess to a cartel if there wasn\u2019t one? The prospect of gaining immunity from fines by blowing the whistle is an enticing one \u2014 too much so, say critics, who argue the immunity system encourages companies to portray their conduct in the worst possible light. After all, it\u2019s the others that will have to foot the bill before regulators.\u000a\u000aWhat first appears to be collusion can look different when new facts emerge, or when those facts don\u2019t mean a breach of EU laws. The Commission dropped a cartel probe into bioethanol producers earlier this year. And some 18 months ago it dropped charges that the world\u2019s largest investment banks colluded to carve up the market for credit default swaps.\u000a\u000a\u201cExcept in classical cartel cases, the mere fact that competitors would collaborate and exchange information is not in and of itself sufficient to find a violation,\u201d said Paul Lugard, a partner at law firm Baker Botts in Brussels. Whether it is illegal or not depends on how they cooperated and why, what sort of information was exchanged and what effect the collaboration had, he explained.\u000a\u000aThere are suggestions from Brussels that at least some of the carmakers\u2019 conduct falls into a gray zone.\u000a\u000aCompetitors can and do work together on developing new technologies or rolling out essential infrastructure. Joint purchasing, which seems to have been part of what was discussed, can foster competition.\u000a\u000aDaimler has already picked up a record \u20ac1 billion cartel fine for colluding with rival truckmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is quite common for car manufacturers all over the world to engage in an exchange on technical issues in order to accelerate the pace and quality of innovations,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement Wednesday that didn\u2019t directly address the allegations. It added that cooperation between competitors can cut costs for consumers.\u000a\u000aA Daimler spokesperson declined to comment on \u201cspeculations\u201d but said the company has a \u201ccomprehensive antitrust compliance program.\u201d A spokesperson for BMW said it was assessing the situation. Earlier this week it said that certain discussions reported by Der Spiegel aimed to increase the availability of diesel exhaust fluid in Europe.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s car industry is widely considered the ultimate symbol of the country\u2019s economic prowess, and its influence stretches deep into politics and the administration.\u000a\u000aThe Commission says it\u2019s not giving anyone preferential treatment. \u201cOur track record of busting cartels, especially in the car sector, speaks for itself,\u201d said Ricardo Cardoso, the Commission spokesperson for competition. The Commission notes it has uncovered nine cartels in the automotive sector over the past 10 years and fined companies almost \u20ac6 billion \u2014 including a \u20ac2.9 billion sanction for a cartel of truckmakers that included Daimler and two Volkswagen subsidiaries.\u000a\u000aThe Commission confirmed it is assessing information about the exchanges between carmaker engineers, adding it was \u201cpremature at this stage to speculate further.\u201d\u000a\u000aDer Spiegel, which published a detailed and damning investigation into \u201cdas Kartell\u201d late last week, said Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, confessed to German and European enforcers in July 2016 in a bid to secure immunity from fines. The Süddeutsche Zeitung says Daimler submitted information to regulators in 2014, or even earlier.\u000a\u000aOne crucial element makes it nearly impossible for the Commission, as well as the carmakers, to defend themselves in public: The omertà imposed around cartel probes.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you mention [the case], you lose any benefit,\u201d said one antitrust lawyer, who declined to comment on the record because his firm does work for the German car sector.\u000a\u000aDefendants are stripped of their immunity or any leniency if they reveal their talks with the Commission, as that might prompt others to destroy evidence. The Commission keeps its communications to the bare minimum, for fear of tipping off potential defendants and to respect the presumption of innocence.\u000a\u000aThat seems a strange position to maintain when almost all of Europe now knows the Commission is looking at this issue. But it explains the short and sometimes cryptic remarks from all sides.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible that these are arrangements between competitors that have some benefits, but this might have slipped into a cartel\u201d \u2014 antitrust lawyer\u000a\u000aDaimler has already picked up a record \u20ac1 billion cartel fine for colluding with rival truckmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think more likely is that Daimler was severely hit by [the investigation into the trucks cartel] and they wanted to be on the safe side,\u201d said one seasoned observer who requested anonymity as his firm is seeking a mandate in the probe. The same would apply to Volkswagen, which has paid out $20 billion over Dieselgate and has two subsidiaries caught up in the trucks cartel.\u000a\u000aAnalyzing whether exchanges between competitors actually qualify for an exemption under EU competition law can take time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is possible that these are arrangements between competitors that have some benefits, but this might have slipped into a cartel,\u201d the antitrust lawyer said.\u000a\u000aCardoso, the Commission spokesperson, said: \u201cThe length of cartel investigations is case-specific and depends on a number factors, including the complexity of the case and the cooperation of the companies with the Commission and the exercise of the rights of defense.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the trucks cartel, Volkswagen\u2019s subsidiary MAN first contacted the Commission with information in September 2010, prompting dawn raids across the sector that January.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s reaction is not always so prompt.\u000a\u000aIn a decision sanctioning a cartel rigging the sale of thermal systems of cars, which led to fines of \u20ac155 million in March 2017, Panasonic went to regulators in December 2010, leading enforcers to request information from rivals in July 2011 and some raids in May 2012.\u000a\u000aIn the alternators and starters cartel, which led to fines of \u20ac137 million in 2016, a request for immunity by Denso in February 2011 prompted regulators to quiz rivals in July of that year.\u000a\u000aClick on the image to enlarge.

aVThe endless saga to repeal and replace Obamacare now playing out in Congress is causing deep anxiety among an overwhelming majority of America\u2019s mayors, 86 percent of whom say they are \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d that doing away with the insurance program would leave their citizens more vulnerable to health crises like opioid addiction and obesity.\u000a\u000aAnd a majority doubt that President Trump, who made dismantling the signature policy of the previous administration one of his top campaign promises, has a clear plan to replace Obamacare if Congress manages to repeal it. If they had their way, most say they would prefer a single-payer plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt seems unlikely that the President has any significant understanding of, or interest in health policy,\u201d said Democratic Mayor Noam Bramson of New Rochelle, NY. \u201cHe will support whatever plan (if any) emerges from the Republican Congress and declare it a \u2018win.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aChief among the mayors\u2019 concerns are potential cuts to Medicaid, which, under most of the proposed, but so far unsuccessful replacement plans circulating on Capitol Hill, would cut the deficit by $473 billion and leave more than 20 million people uninsured within a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Sixty percent of mayors said Medicaid expansion under Obamacare has been \u201cvery important\u201d to their cities. And mayors were nearly unanimous in their concern (95 percent said they were either \u201cvery or moderately concerned\u201d) that any cuts to Medicaid would exacerbate the opioid crisis that plagues so much of America.\u000a\u000aFifty-seven mayors participated in the anonymous and non-scientific survey, the tenth in POLITICO Magazine\u2019s award-winning What Works series. Just under 80 percent of mayors who responded to the survey in the 10 days after the July 4 holiday, were Democrats, a response that matches the generally liberal tilt of city halls across the country. Six of the 57 surveyed are Republican, while four identified as non-partisan or independent.\u000a\u000aThough the outcome of the Congressional maneuvering remains in doubt, mayors aren\u2019t sitting idle in their executive suites waiting for the hatchet to drop. Mayors on average estimated that between 75 and 80 percent of their residents have health insurance; they expect that a repeal of the ACA would cut that number by over 10 percentage points. That\u2019s not a prospect they take lightly.\u000a\u000aMost mayors are trying to stave off disaster by lobbying their congressional delegation. Many are mobilizing either constituents or local non-profits. A few are taking more creative approaches. One city has already created a small fund in case of federal cuts. Another city has proposed a $50 million reserve in its budget to soften the impact of more uninsured citizens.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aA majority of mayors believe the real solution to the nation\u2019s health care mess is one that Congress isn\u2019t even contemplating: a single-payer system. Nearly two-thirds said a single-payer plan offered in their state \u201csounds better than the current system.\u201d A handful would only support adopting single-payer if Congress repeals Obamacare. Eleven of the 57 mayors surveyed said they didn\u2019t think an entirely government-funded plan \u201cwould work in my city.\u201d\u000a\u000aSingle-payer is an issue that unites Democrats from the most progressive to the most conservative. In California, state lawmakers are pushing a $400-billion-per-year single-payer bill for the state\u2019s 40 million residents that relies predominantly on state and federal funds currently dedicated to Medicare and Medicaid services. Trump said publicly Wednesday that a nationwide single-payer program would \u201cbankrupt\u201d the U.S. and force citizens to \u201cwait in line for weeks to see a doctor.\u201d On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated that single-payer could be a centerpiece of a bolder economic fairness message from the Democrats.\u000a\u000aGenerally, the mayors surveyed were not placated by the Senate GOP\u2019s attempt to compensate for Medicaid cuts by sending $45 billion to states especially plagued by the opioid epidemic. In fact, two-thirds of mayors also said the most helpful thing to tackle to opioid crisis would be more funding for treatment programs not less. A dozen mayors want more regulations to prevent over-prescription by doctors.\u000a\u000aThe Kaiser Foundation estimates that over 90 Americans die per day from overdosing on opioids such as heroin and prescription painkillers. The ubiquity of opioid use and dependency costs the U.S. an estimated $78.5 billion per year and has prompted action in cities across the country. For example, residents of Baltimore (whose mayor did not participate in the survey) were issued a blanket prescription for the overdose antidote by the city health department in 2015.\u000a\u000aWhile mayors are predominantly worried about opioids, mayors also said obesity and gun violence (roughly a fifth of those surveyed for each) were the major health concerns in their cities. A few named viruses such as HIV and Zika as his or her city\u2019s biggest health epidemic.\u000a\u000aApproximately one-third of adults and one-sixth of children in the U.S. are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Under Obamacare, insurers are banned from charging people more or denying coverage because of existing medical conditions, including obesity. Under the latest Senate GOP proposal, that would remain law. But the latest Senate bill would change the Obamacare mandate to now allow states to waive insurance rules, such as minimum contributions insurers must pay toward medical bills.\u000a\u000aSix months ago, Trump\u2019s Obamacare repeal rhetoric had mayors openly fearing catastrophe. Since then, the position of city bosses doesn\u2019t seem to have shifted. The vast majority of mayors are skeptical of the president\u2019s promise of a \u201cgreat\u201d Obamacare alternative that will \u201cend in a beautiful picture.\u201d Mayor Walter Campbell of Coral Springs, Florida believes the administration is dangerously \u201cwinging it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump promised Wednesday that any GOP healthcare replacement would give coverage to low-income citizens and maintain coverage for pre-existing conditions. He claimed the latest draft of the bill would allow insurance purchases across state lines. He also said that he wanted to let Obamacare fail and that he didn\u2019t want to \u201cown it\u201d when it did.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt appears that the current leadership did not expect to be in a situation where they would actually have to vote on a \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 bill,\u201d said Democratic Mayor Helene Schneider of Santa Barbara, California. \u201cNow they are acting like the dog who finally caught the bus and don't know what to do with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublican Mayor Acquanetta Warren of Fontana, California was one of the few surveyed who believe there is a plan. She said the president wants to move federal government \u201cout of the way\u201d and let states tackle health care based on their own needs\u2014something Trump has explicitly pushed for. \u201cIf [you are] in California that's scary based on our legislative climate,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe biggest mistake Trump made was promising to \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 Obamacare instead of simply \u2018fixing\u2019 it,\u201d said Mayor Paul Dyster, a Democrat, of Niagara Falls. \u201cIf he had done that instead, there would still have been fierce debate on both philosophical and technical issues, but he would have found many Dems eager to help \u2018make improvements.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile most mayors think Trump\u2019s biggest healthcare priority should be either keeping Obamacare in place, further expanding Medicaid or making healthcare more accessible and affordable, a handful want him to prioritize the fight against the opioid crisis. Others suggested infrastructure spending to include parks and walking or biking paths. Some said the administration should allow insurance purchases across state lines, make Medicaid reimbursement rates competitive with neighboring states, or adopt universal or single-payer coverage. Some prioritized increasing preventative care, housing and behavioral health services. One mayor simply suggested the administration should prioritize bipartisanship. "All factions should have a voice in the creation of a comprehensive health care plan," he said.\u000a\u000aOver a third of mayors think they should help their residents individually adopt healthier lifestyles, especially to combat obesity. Youth access to sports, smoking cessation, cleaner diets and expanding pedestrian forms of transportation were all repeatedly listed. More affordable and accessible healthcare was second on the list. Tackling gun violence and the opioid epidemic were each mentioned by several mayors as top priorities in their cities. So was combatting lead poisoning. One red-state mayor said shutting down their city\u2019s coal plant would foremost improve residents\u2019 health.\u000a\u000aAnxiety over health care is tempered somewhat by a generally rosier outlook on the economy. Mayors said they feel better about their city\u2019s economy now than they did six months ago: 88 percent feel either more or equally optimistic about their city compared to the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Unemployment has dropped several tenths of a percent to 4.4 percent since late January \u2013 the lowest it\u2019s been in a decade. This optimism is a notable increase from the most recent survey in April, when less than 70 percent of surveyed mayors reported equal or increased optimism. In January, that number was about three-quarters.\u000a\u000aMost attribute their city\u2019s economic state to either normal factors beyond presidential control or work by the previous administration. Only two believe measures enacted by the Trump administration account for the change.\u000a\u000aMayors who participated include: Denny Doyle, Beaverton, OR; John Marchione, Redmond, WA; Paul Soglin, Madison, WI; Mike T.

aVRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz fired Imran Awan last week after being arrested on one count of bank fraud . | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Watchdog wants investigation into Wasserman Schultz over IT staffer\u000a\u000aA right-leaning ethics group is pushing for a congressional probe into Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz because she continued to employ an IT staffer for months after he became the focus of a criminal investigation.\u000a\u000aThe Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative accountability group, is requesting the Office of Congressional Ethics launch an investigation into what the nonprofit says is Wasserman Schultz\u2019s \u201capparent breach\u201d of House rules for continuing to employ Imran Awan, even after he was blocked from accessing the House IT system earlier this year.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAwan was fired by Wasserman Schultz last week after being arrested on one count of bank fraud while attempting to leave the U.S. for Pakistan. But Awan and several of his family members, also previous House staffers, have been the center of a criminal investigation for months involving an equipment and data scam on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000aAwan and his relatives worked as shared employees for more than two dozen House Democrats in the past several years. After the Capitol Hill investigation came to light in early February, most lawmakers fired the other staffers in question.\u000a\u000aBut Wasserman Schultz retained Awan, even though he has been barred from accessing the House IT network since February. FACT maintains there\u2019s no way Awan could have performed IT duties for Wasserman Schultz over the past six months, despite staying on the Florida Democrat\u2019s payroll.\u000a\u000a\u201cHouse staff are compensated with taxpayer funds, and members are directly responsible for ensuring their staff are only paid for official public work, work that has actually [been] performed and at a rate commensurate with the work performed,\u201d Matthew Whitaker, FACT executive director, wrote in a letter to the OCE.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was, therefore, contrary to the House ethics rule for Wasserman Schultz to continue to pay Awan with taxpayer funds even after he was barred from the House computer system and could not perform his duties, and was also under criminal investigation.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavid Damron, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz, called the complaint "entirely baseless" and intended to undermine a fierce Trump critic.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

"Those services included consulting on a variety of office needs, such as on our website and printers, trouble-shooting, and other issues."\u000a\u000aConservative news outlets have seized on the Awan story, floating unsubstantiated claims that as an IT staffer, he may have had access to and then leaked Democratic National Committee emails when Wasserman Schultz was running the organization. Federal intelligence agencies have said Russia was behind the DNC leak that ultimately led to Wasserman Schultz\u2019s resignation and there has been no evidence tying Awan to the hack.\u000a\u000aBoth Awan\u2019s lawyer and Wasserman Schultz have previously questioned whether Awan was being targeted because he is Muslim.\u000a\u000a"After details of the investigation were reviewed with us, my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling," Wasserman Schultz said in a statement.

aVThe chatter about a House leadership post is gone. So is talk of statewide office. After Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, there\u2019s no prospect of an administration job for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000aOne year after the Florida congresswoman\u2019s resignation as national party chair at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 where activists booed and shouted \u201cshame!\u201d at her during a Florida delegation breakfast speech \u2014 the once-rising star's political fortunes continue to fade, beset by critics on all sides.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz is again on defense after steadfastly refusing to explain why she continued to employ Imran Awan, an IT staffer who was under a federal investigation for an alleged equipment and data scam in the U.S. House since February. She finally fired him on July 25, one day after authorities arrested him on a seemingly unrelated mortgage fraud charge. He was at the airport leaving for Pakistan, after wiring $283,000 there.\u000a\u000aThe firing came a full six months after about two dozen House Democrats dismissed four of Awan\u2019s relatives and a friend, all of whom were under investigation with him.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz broke her public silence on Awan last week, portraying herself as the victim of "right wing media" attacks rooted in anti-Muslim bigotry aimed at Awan and the IT group.\u000a\u000aBut fellow Democrats are as confounded and disbelieving as ever by her penchant for making puzzling and stubborn political missteps.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe wish she would go away and stop being so public by doubling down on negative stories,\u201d said Nikki Barnes, a progressive DNC member from Florida, who believes Wasserman Schultz left the national party \u201cin shambles\u201d while chair, culminating with the hack of DNC servers and the release of embarrassing internal emails by WikiLeaks in the 2016 campaign. As for Wasserman Schultz's defense, Barnes said \u201cnone of this makes sense. It doesn't sound like racial profiling \u2026 there must have been something for her.\u201d\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe problem with the Awan case, Barnes said, is that it\u2019s not just hurting the congresswoman. It\u2019s drawing negative attention to a party still healing after last year\u2019s shocking losses and the divisive Democratic primary in which Wasserman Schultz appeared to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis adds to Debbie being rebranded as the Democrats\u2019 disastrous destruction,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThose of us on the DNC know we have to rebrand ourselves and earn the people\u2019s trust. And unfortunately Debbie\u2019s name does not scream trust. It screams power. It screams limited access. It screams WikiLeaks now. DNC lawsuit. It screams a lot of negative things to the public. That\u2019s not how we want to rebrand ourselves.\u201d\u000a\u000aBarnes said she couldn\u2019t understand why Wasserman Schultz made herself a target of attention by becoming the lone Democrat to employ Awan. Wasserman Schultz then drew even more negative attention to herself by publicly threatening the U.S. Capitol Police chief with \u201cconsequences\u201d in a dispute over an office laptop under examination from investigators.\u000a\u000aThe drama ensured Wasserman Schultz would play a central role in a murky congressional summer \u201cscandal\u201d story playing out from Washington to Weston, her South Florida congressional district\u2019s base.\u000a\u000a\u201cDebbie Wasserman Schultz is still a national figure, but unfortunately for her it\u2019s because so many people around the country see her as playing a devastatingly bad role in the last election,\u201d said R.T. Rybak, the former mayor of Minneapolis and former DNC vice -chair who clashed with Wasserman Schultz. \u201cI can mention her name in Minneapolis and it gets a viscerally negative reaction, and I\u2019ve found that to be the case in other parts of the country, too. Sadly, I think she deserves the negative reputation.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans have seized the opportunity to pound an unpopular rival who resigned as party chair after WikiLeaks released embarrassing hacked DNC emails just before the election. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s office said Awan wasn\u2019t a DNC employee and didn\u2019t have access to its internal system but some conservative commentators and media have advanced unsubstantiated claims that Awan may have had access to and then leaked the DNC emails.\u000a\u000aRepublican Rep. Ron DeSantis, a fellow Floridian in Congress who might run for governor, has called for a Justice Department investigation and suggested Wasserman Schultz might have to testify. A conservative group has filed an ethics complaint against her. A Senate committee is examining the Awan group\u2019s immigration history.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump himself last week weighed in by retweeting an article from conservative news site Townhall with the headline: \u201cABC, NBC, And CBS Pretty Much Bury IT Scandal Engulfing Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Office.\u201d On Saturday, he retweeted a clip of a Fox commentator asking \u201cWhat's a high-priced Clinton attorney doing representing a low-level IT staffer for the Democrats?"\u000a\u000aAfter Wasserman Schultz finally spoke publicly about Awan\u2019s case last week in her hometown South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper, its editorial board called the controversy a \u201cnon-case against Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u201d and a columnist followed up Tuesday with an opinion piece headlined: \u201cGOP can't handle truth about Wasserman Schultz.\u201d\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz also made a point to bring up the unproven conspiracy theories that accused her of a link to the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich. Her comments came after Trump\u2019s on-again-off-again adviser Roger Stone tweeted about the alleged conspiracy, without offering evidence, that it was a \u201cFACT - Wasserman-Schulz \u2018IT consultant\u2019 Awan was partying with Seth Rich the night of his murder!\u201d Wasserman Schultz called the rumors about the murder \u201cvile and disgusting.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for Awan\u2019s case, Wasserman Schultz told the Sun-Sentinel that she thought he was being initially investigated on an overblown technicality for \u201ctransferring data outside the secure network, which I think amounted to use of apps that the House didn\u2019t find compliant with our security requirements.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said she thought other House IT employees haven\u2019t been investigated for similar activities, such as the use of the storage service Dropbox, which isn\u2019t approved for use under House IT rules. She pointed out that neither Awan nor anyone else in his group have been arrested for their work in the House.\u000a\u000aNot only did Awan and the other suspected staffers not have approved access to classified information, she said, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to access it on other House members\u2019 equipment because they\u2019re not allowed to store it on office computers.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz, however, didn\u2019t address the numerous stories broken by the conservative Daily Caller that called into question the qualifications of and paychecks for Awan\u2019s group. Why she kept Awan on after the FBI raided his home and seized smashed hard drives is also unanswered. Nor has Wasserman Schultz explained in detail what Awan specifically did to earn the $7,800 she paid him this year after his IT privileges were suspended in the investigation.\u000a\u000aA written statement from the congresswoman, who hails from Florida\u2019s most Democratic county, attributed her actions to her commitment to protecting minorities.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a mother, a Jew, and a Member of Congress, if there is one thing I know for sure, it's this: my commitment to doing what's right and just \u2014 even if it isn't what's easy and simple \u2014 is unyielding,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cUndoubtedly, the easier path would have been to terminate Mr. Awan, despite the fact that I had not received any evidence of his alleged wrongdoing. Over time, the investigation raised troubling concerns for me about fair treatment, due process, and potential ethnic and religious profiling.\u201d\u000a\u000aJodi Davidson, a former Wasserman Schultz staffer, said Wasserman Schultz\u2019s statement was consistent with how she treated everyone in the office \u2014 with loyalty and respect.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not surprised she did this,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t charged with anything so to let him go without due process \u2014 the Debbie Wasserman Schultz I know wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAwan had worked for Wasserman Schultz for at least a decade, had witnessed her internal party rise and fall and had earned her trust, according to current and former staffers who said they were acquainted with him.\u000a\u000aOver the years, as her circle of trust shrank, loyalty became an ever-more precious commodity to Wasserman Schultz, according to former staffers and top Democrats in Florida and Washington. Now, Wasserman Schultz has become such a polarizing figure in her own party that some longtime Democratic allies, when contacted by POLITICO, struggled to say kind words about her or explain how and why she got into this latest jam. They describe a hard-working politician with a sharp mind but an equally sharp tongue and hot temper that leads her into otherwise avoidable dustups and troubles.\u000a\u000aThough admired by Democrats for her fierce advocacy of progressive causes, she nevertheless turned natural allies to enemies at the DNC, in the Obama White House and even in Florida, where she picked an explosive fight with top Democratic donor and trial lawyer John Morgan after she trashed his popular medical-marijuana initiative, seemingly without cause.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn politics, you\u2019re as strong as your friends. And she doesn\u2019t have as many as she used to. And that\u2019s her fault,\u201d Morgan said.\u000a\u000aMorgan and those who have known and observed Wasserman Schultz for decades say her demeanor began to change when she was DNC chair; power went to her head, they say, and mounting criticism then made her paranoid.\u000a\u000aAfter President Barack Obama won reelection in 2012, Wasserman Schultz resisted entreaties from the White House to quit on a high note and make way for fresh leadership. Months later, the congresswoman signaled that she\u2019d use her post to raise more money for Democrats and hinted it would help her elect loyal House and Senate Democrats who could aid a run for statewide office or a top leadership position in the House.\u000a\u000aBy the summer of the 2014 midterms, when Democrats were destroyed nationwide and in her home state, Wasserman Schultz was engaged in a behind-the-scenes cold war with White House advisers and Obama allies who said her personal ambition conflicted with her role as chair.\u000a\u000aOut of real party power in Washington in the summer of 2016, Wasserman Schultz had to head home to defend her congressional seat, from Democrat Tim Canova \u2014 her first primary challenger she ever faced as an incumbent since her first election to a Florida state House seat in 1992.\u000a\u000aBacked by Sanders, Canova spent big but lost to Wasserman Schultz. Still, her relatively anemic primary election winning margin \u2014 57 percent to 43 percent, the smallest of any Florida incumbent \u2014 revealed the damage to her brand.\u000a\u000aCanova is challenging her again in 2018.\u000a\u000aFlorida\u2019s first Jewish woman to serve in Congress, Wasserman Schultz remains relatively popular in her heavily Jewish district. Rep. Lois Frankel, a West Palm Beach Democrat who has known Wasserman Schultz for two decades, credited her work ethic and \u201cbrilliance.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut unlike Wasserman Schultz, Frankel saw trouble when news broke of the House investigation and stopped using IT support from Awan\u2019s group.\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe if I had known him for a lot of years and worked with him, he could\u2019ve convinced me. I just said no,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any kind of relationship with this guy other than he fixed my computers once in a while. There was no reason for me to risk anything for him.\u201d\u000a\u000aRep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), who praised Wasserman Schultz for doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d by sticking by Awan, had used Awan\u2019s wife as an IT staffer but said he let her go amid the investigation because \u201cI was told that the person that was on my staff could not access my database or anything of that nature, it would have had a negative effect on my office. And I was not in a position to pay when there was no work to be done.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot only were Democrats at pains to explain why they fired the staffers while Wasserman Schultz stood by Awan, they were bewildered by her decision to call out the Capitol Police chief at a May 18 budget hearing where she demanded the return of a laptop recovered in the investigation that she suggested was hers.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you\u2019re violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and should expect that there would be consequences,\u201d she said during a caught-on-camera exchange highlighted by Republicans.\u000a\u000aTo Democrats like the DNC\u2019s Barnes, it\u2019s a distraction the party can ill afford.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverything that\u2019s going on right now is taking away from what success we\u2019re seeing in the grass-roots movement. No one\u2019s talking about the people\u2019s platform or hearing our good news because the headlines are focused on Debbie, her misplaced laptop and consequences,\u201d Barnes said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVROME \u2014 When the migration dossier landed on his desk back in December, newly arrived Interior Minister Marco Minniti was sure of one thing \u2014 to stop migrants making the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, Italy and Europe had to invest in an unlikely partner: Libya.\u000a\u000aAt the time, his EU counterparts considered this a risky and unrealistic strategy because of the political chaos in Libya since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Seven months later, the latest figures released by Minniti\u2019s ministry on Thursday suggest his vision was right.\u000a\u000aIn the first 10 days of August, the number of migrants making the crossing to Italian shores, mainly from Libya, fell 76 percent compared to the same period last year, meaning 1,572 migrants made the journey as opposed to 6,554 a year ago. Strong indications of a clear change in migration patterns had already emerged in July when the number of arrivals halved compared to the previous year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe had a strategy, a vision, which like every vision could be right or wrong, but at least we had one,\u201d Minniti told POLITICO in an interview at the Viminale, the interior ministry\u2019s palatial headquarters named after one of the seven hills of ancient Rome.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we said we had to relaunch the Libyan coast guard, it seemed like a daydream\u201d \u2014 Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti\u000a\u000aHaving spent over a decade in government, as state secretary for the security services during two administrations and as deputy interior minister under Romano Prodi before that, the 61-year-old Calabrian \u2014 a former communist \u2014 was convinced from the outset that Europe\u2019s real migration struggle was \u201cplaying out on the other side of the Mediterranean.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo one was really convinced that a real operation could be carried out in Libya. The idea was to intervene in neighboring countries, since the mainstream understanding was that Libya was structurally unstable, and so all efforts would end up wasted,\u201d Minniti said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we said we had to relaunch the Libyan coastguard, it seemed like a daydream. Last weekend they saved 1,180 migrants while the whole international apparatus only saved 130. In the past four years that had never occurred,\u201d Minniti said.\u000a\u000aNow, he wants to capitalize on Italy\u2019s success and ask Brussels to foot the bill, after the summer break.\u000a\u000aSustainability\u000a\u000aThe Italian minister has three requests to Europe. The first: to allocate to Africa \u2014 and especially Libya, which currently accounts for 97 percent of departures \u2014 the same amount of \u201ceffort and resources\u201d that it devoted last year to stemming migration flows through the Balkans.\u000a\u000aMinniti does not expect \u20ac3 billion overnight \u2014 but he wants Europe to consider stumping up \u201ca similar amount,\u201d and he wants it \u201cto happen rapidly since the mechanism is working in Libya and needs to be sustained.\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch resources should mainly be committed to the protection of borders, both on the coast and along Libya\u2019s southern frontier, including providing funding and training for the country\u2019s coast guard and border guard services.\u000a\u000aMinniti\u2019s second request is for help tackling the problem of migrant reception centers in Libya, where he envisages increased cooperation between the EU and the United Nations. Last week, a report drafted by EU officials detailed severe shortcomings in sanitary conditions in the refugee centers in Libya.\u000a\u000aIn April the European Union allocated \u20ac90 million to Libya, with more than half the amount devoted to improving reception centers and the rest designed to boost local government and socio-economic development. Minniti wants \u201cmore money,\u201d but most importantly he wants to see new projects launched as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aHis final request \u2014 and perhaps the biggest one \u2014 is for Europe to make a five-year commitment to invest in the mayors of the 14 main Libyan cities where migrant smuggling takes place. The best way to stabilize the country, the minister said, is to create viable economic alternatives to the business of human trafficking, which currently constitutes \u201cthe only functioning enterprises in Libya.\u201d

aVJohn Oliver -- and a giant squirrel -- made the king of coal seriously angry.\u000a\u000aRobert Murray, the CEO of one of America's largest coal companies, filed a defamation lawsuit against Oliver on Wednesday. The lawsuit claims the HBO comedian executed a "meticulously planned" and "ruthless character assassination" designed to boost TV ratings and hurt his mining company.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit named Oliver, the show's production company, his senior news producer Charles Wilson, HBO and Time Warner (TWX) (which owns CNN). The complaint alleges that Oliver's "Last Week Tonight" episode on Sunday "incited" viewers to "do harm to Mr. Murray and his companies." It also claims the miner's website was hacked as a result of the segment, and that Oliver's statements constitute "false light invasion of privacy" and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u000a\u000aDuring his June 18 show, Oliver lambasted President Trump over his promises to bring back thousands of coal mining jobs, a pledge the comedian says is a false promise to an industry that's been in a steep decline for decades.\u000a\u000aThe segment, which has been viewed 4.5 million times on YouTube, devoted several minutes to Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, and a vocal champion of the coal industry. Oliver told the audience that Murray had warned him he would sue and bring the case all the way to the Supreme Court if he failed to "cease and desist" any effort to "defame, harass, or otherwise injure Mr. Murray or Murray Energy."\u000a\u000aOliver said on air that he would "proceed with caution," and then he launched into a monologue comparing the 77-year-old coal exec to a "geriatric Dr. Evil." The segment chronicled Murray's career in mining and his handling of a 2007 mine collapse in Utah that left six miners and three rescuers dead.\u000a\u000a"An honest conversation about coal and its miners needs to be had," Oliver said, "and we should neither cease nor desist from having it."\u000a\u000aBut the complaint alleges that Oliver and the show "intentionally, falsely, and outrageously" suggested that Murray had no evidence to support statements that the mine collapse was caused by an earthquake. The lawsuit claims Oliver ignored studies supporting Murray and quoted others out of context.\u000a\u000aRelated: Coal king: It's 'wonderful' Trump ditched Paris deal\u000a\u000aOliver later recounted a story -- that Murray has denied happened -- that the CEO told workers the idea for starting a mine company came to him from a squirrel.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the show, the HBO host trotted a man dressed in a giant squirrel costume onto stage to address Murray directly. "Bob, I just wanted to say if you plan on suing, I do not have a billion dollars, but I do have a check for three acorns and 18 cents," the squirrel said.\u000a\u000a"It's made out to 'Eat sh*t Bob!," the squirrel said, while holding up a giant fake check with "kiss my ass!" scrawled in the memo field.\u000a\u000aOliver acknowledged during the show that Murray is "probably going to sue me." He added, "You know what? I stand by everything I said."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, HBO said: "We have confidence in the staff of Last Week Tonight and do not believe anything in the show this week violated Mr. Murray's or Murray Energy's rights."\u000a\u000aRelated: Coal country's message to Trump: We want jobs of the future\u000a\u000aMurray Energy's complaint referred to Oliver, who is British, as a "foreign national residing in New York." The company, in a separate statement, called Murray a "patriotic American."\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit also described Murray as seriously ill, saying he depends on an oxygen tank, needs a lung transplant and "does not expect to live to see the end of this case."\u000a\u000a"Nothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack," the complaint said, adding it has caused "significant emotional and physical distress."\u000a\u000aMurray Energy said that after the Oliver show, its website was attacked three different times by hackers who attempted to crash it. On the third attempt, Murray Energy said it had to take down its website to implement new security measures.\u000a\u000aMurray Energy also said it received "numerous harassing telephone calls," including from callers who simply said: "Eat Sh*t, Bob."\u000a\u000aThe coal magnate has spoken out publicly to criticize environmental restrictions on the coal industry and has described former President Barack Obama's agenda as "evil."\u000a\u000aMurray also filed a libel suit against the New York Times earlier this year for statements it made about the Utah mine collapse. The Times said it has moved to dismiss the suit.

aVPPP's newest national poll continues to find that health care is a mine field for the GOP, while most Trump voters are just choosing not to acknowledge the Russia story.\u000a\u000aOnly 20% of voters support the health care bill that was being considered by Congress until last night, to 57% who are opposed to it. Even among Republicans there's only very narrow support for it- 35% in favor, 34% opposed, and 31% not sure. Democrats (10/72) and independents (17/61) are each strongly opposed to it. 58% of voters say they want Congress to keep the Affordable Care Act in place and make changes to it as necessary, to just 35% who think the best path forward is repealing the ACA and starting over.\u000a\u000aHealth care could have big electoral implications in 2018. 53% of voters said they were less likely to vote for a member of Congress if they supported the health care bill being considered, to only 21% who said they'd be more likely to support a member who voted yes. One thing that's particularly notable is the division even within the Republican base on that front. Only 36% of GOP voters would be more likely to support a member of Congress if they voted for that health care bill, to 32% who would be less likely to. That suggests bucking the party on health care isn't the kind of thing that's so unpopular it would have much chance of leading to a successful primary challenge from the right.\u000a\u000aThe current political climate is already looking dicey for Republicans as the 2018 midterms loom. Democrats have a 50/40 lead on the generic Congressional ballot. Much gets made of Donald Trump's unpopularity and certainly it's true voters don't care for him- only 41% approve of the job he's doing to 55% who disapprove. But Trump comes out looking positively popular compared to Paul Ryan (24/57 approval) and Mitch McConnell (18/58). Congress overall has an 11% approval rating, to 75% of voters who disapprove of it. Democrats should have the opportunity next year to turn them into bogeymen much as Republicans have with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in recent years.\u000a\u000aHealth care is turning a lot more Republican leaning voters against their own party's leadership than Russia is. On Russia related issues we find a certain degree of willful ignorance among Trump voters that can possibly best be summarized by this finding: only 45% of Trump voters believe Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with Russians about information that might be harmful to Hillary Clinton...even though Trump Jr. admitted it. 32% say the meeting didn't happen and 24% say they're not sure.\u000a\u000aThat finding is in keeping with the general attitude of Trump voters toward the Russia story which is 'don't know, don't care':\u000a\u000a-72% of Trump voters consider the Russia story overall to be 'fake news,' only 14% disagree.\u000a\u000a-Only 24% of Trump voters even want an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, 64% are opposed to an investigation.\u000a\u000a-Even if there was an investigation, and it found that the Trump campaign did collude with Russia to aid his campaign, 77% of his supporters think he should still stay in office to just 16% who believe he should resign.\u000a\u000a-Only 26% of Trump voters admit that Russia wanted Trump to win the election, 44% claim Russia wanted Hillary Clinton to win, and 31% say they're not sure one way or the other.\u000a\u000a-Just 13% of Trump voters believe that members of Trump's campaign team did work with the Russians to help his campaign, to 81% who say they didn't. On a related note only 9% believe that either Donald Trump Jr. or Jared Kushner engaged in illegal activity to help Trump get elected, to 77% who say Kushner didn't and 79% who say Trump Jr. didn't.\u000a\u000aNone of that is to say Trump's overall position isn't bad. Only 41% of voters approve of the job he's doing, to 55% who disapprove. Just 37% of voters consider Trump to be honest, to 57% who say he isn't. And 52% outright call him a liar, with only 40% disagreeing with that characterization.\u000a\u000aTrump does a lot of losing in our poll. Voters wish that either Barack Obama (53/40) or Hillary Clinton (49/42) was President instead of Trump. Trump loses by wide margins in hypothetical matches against Joe Biden (54/39) or Bernie Sanders (52/39) for reelection. Trump loses 12-13% of the folks who voted for him last fall to either Biden or Sanders. Trump also trails in hypothetical contests against Elizabeth Warren (49/42), Cory Booker (45/40), and Kamala Harris (41/40). The one Democrat Trump manages a tie against is Mark Zuckerberg, at 40/40. Zuckerberg is actually not a particularly well known figure nationally- 47% of voters say they have no opinion about him to 24% with a positive one and 29% with a negative one.

aVIt's a devastating psychological blow for a party to spend over $30 million on a House special election and still lose. For Democrats, Jon Ossoff's defeat to Karen Handel stings, and the blame game is already raging: "Why did Ossoff run such a bland campaign? Why didn't he take a sledgehammer to Trump and the AHCA? Don't Democrats need to recruit little league coaches with deeper ties to their communities?"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis kind of second-guessing is a bit misguided. Last night's results were far from a disaster for Democrats, and Republicans shouldn't be tempted to believe their House majority is safe. In fact, their majority is still very much at risk.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, just one state over, unheralded Democratic tax expert Archie Parnell - who ran on a similarly conciliatory, post-partisan message but generated a tiny fraction of the hype Ossoff did\u2014shockingly came within three points of Republican Ralph Norman in a district President Trump carried by 18 points last November (Ossoff came within four points in a district Trump carried by one).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aParnell's near-miss has prompted outrage from activists on the left who believe he got short shrift from the DNC, DCCC and party hierarchy. If only the DCCC had parachuted into Sumter instead of Atlanta, the thinking goes, Democrats might have actually gained a House seat by now. But the reality is Parnell\u2014much like Democrat James Thompson in KS-04\u2014outperformed polls and expectations precisely because the race flew under the radar, not despite it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe divergent results in GA-06 and SC-05 prove saturation-level campaigns can backfire on the party with a baseline enthusiasm advantage\u2014in this case, Democrats. The GA-06 election drew over 259,000 voters\u2014an all-time turnout record for a stand-alone special election and an amazing 49,000 more than participated in the 2014 midterm in GA-06. The crush of attention motivated GOP voters who might have otherwise stayed home, helping Handel to victory.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCredit must be given to the NRCC and the House GOP leadership-allied Congressional Leadership Fund, who did more with less and ran straightforward, but effective ads to buttress Handel's imperfect campaign and neutralize Ossoff's enormous advantage on the airwaves. Trump's approval rating in GA-06 was still mired in the low 40s by this week, but the GOP was still able to compound and capitalize on serious Ossoff fatigue.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy contrast, SC-05 drew fewer than 88,000 voters despite its similar population. Norman, the Republican nominee, had just emerged from a tight runoff with critical backing from the Club for Growth, but had alienated some of the district's chamber of commerce types. Meanwhile, Parnell benefited from a base of highly motivated Democrats, including a modest and low-profile DCCC effort to turn out African-American voters.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe good news for Republicans is that swarms of national media and images of Nancy Pelosi still motivate their base. The bad news for Republicans is that they can't count on this type of high turnout across the board in November 2018. In fact, it would be shocking if any House race drew a third of the $55 million spent on the GA-06 special election. And that means Democrats' enthusiasm edge should be wider in most places than it was in GA-06.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSecond, overhyped special elections can often be lagging\u2014rather than leading\u2014indicators. In June 2006, Republicans retained a San Diego seat in a very expensive special election five months before losing the House. In May 2010, Democrats held an ancestrally Democratic seat in southwestern Pennsylvania six months before losing their majority. For a moment, tradition held. Today, both those seats are represented by the opposite party.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThird, believe it or not, GA-06 wasn't the only special election held this year. Although it's true Democrats have agonizingly yet to capture a red district, they have outperformed their "generic" share of the vote significantly in every contest. Measured against the Cook Political Report's Partisan Voter Index (PVI), Democrats have outperformed the partisan lean of their districts by an average of eight points in the past five elections:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf Democrats were to outperform their "generic" share by eight points across the board in November 2018, they would pick up 80 seats. Of course, that won't happen because Republican incumbents will be tougher to dislodge than special election nominees. But these results fit a pattern that should still worry GOP incumbents everywhere, regardless of Trump's national approval rating and the outcome of the healthcare debate in Congress.Put another way, Democratic candidates in these elections have won an average of 68 percent of the votes Hillary Clinton won in their districts, while Republican candidates have won an average of 54 percent of Trump's votes. That's an enthusiasm gap that big enough to gravely imperil the Republican majority next November\u2014even if it didn't show up in "the special election to end all special elections."

A lawyer for Yohai didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aA Manafort spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller also declined to comment.\u000a\u000aManafort\u2019s team has repeatedly pushed back on suggestions he\u2019s cooperating with federal investigators. \u201cPaul\u2019s been forthcoming, but he\u2019s not a cooperating witness and any suggestion to that effect is silly,\u201d Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said in a July interview when asked about concerns from former colleagues that Manafort had turned against the Trump team.\u000a\u000aPeople close to Manafort reiterated Wednesday that he has no plans to become a cooperating witness.\u000a\u000aAnother high profile Trump associate touched by the Russia probe has suggested he'd be willing to talk with federal investigators. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, asked for an immunity deal in March in which he\u2019d testify to Congress. A lawyer for Flynn declined to comment on the Mueller probe.\u000a\u000aMueller\u2019s targeting of both Manafort and his son-in-law over potential criminal wrongdoing is a familiar tactic in white-collar cases, commonly called \u201cclimbing the ladder.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cManafort is \u2014 on many levels \u2014 a key subject of the investigation and someone who might be leveraged to share information about others,\u201d said one Washington-based white-collar attorney with a client involved in the Russia probe.\u000a\u000aThe approach involves finding a suspected crime \u2014 false statements on tax returns or loan applications, for example \u2014 and then offering leniency on prosecution in exchange for cooperation. \u201cThey always start with the people on the low end of the ladder and try to get information on someone high up on the ladder,\u201d said William Jeffress, a white-collar attorney who represented Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, in the President George W. Bush-era Valerie Plame leak investigation.\u000a\u000aMueller would clearly have jurisdiction over any real estate dealings between Yohai, Manafort and Russians, Jeffress said. In addition, he could press Yohai for details on what he knows about Manafort\u2019s role in the campaign.\u000a\u000aRenato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, said cooperating witnesses are \u201coften very significant to make your case\u201d when it gets to trial.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey can provide direct evidence of what the defendant said or did,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s usually far more compelling to a jury than just looking at documents.\u201d\u000a\u000aMariotti also brushed aside comments by Manafort associates who insist the former Trump campaign manager has nothing about Trump that would matter to investigators. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take much from it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d take it with a grain of salt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe noted a number of potential politicians under investigation who have been less than candid with their public statements: perhaps most notably President Bill Clinton, who insisted that he didn\u2019t carry on a sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s very often the case that people involved in wrongdoing aren\u2019t candid with even their closest friends and associates and family because they don\u2019t want to disappoint the people they\u2019re closest to,\u201d Mariotti said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re not even candid to their own lawyers.\u201d\u000a\u000aDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVEAGLE GROVE, Iowa\u2014On a cloud-swept landscape dotted with grain elevators, a meat producer called Prestage Farms is building a 700,000-square-foot processing plant. The gleaming new factory is both the great hope of Wright County, which voted by a 2-1 margin for Donald Trump, and the victim of one of Trump\u2019s first policy moves, his decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u000a\u000aFor much of industrial America, the TPP was a suspect deal, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some argue led to a massive offshoring of U.S. jobs to Mexico. But for the already struggling agricultural sector, the sprawling 12-nation TPP, covering 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy, was a lifeline. It was a chance to erase punishing tariffs that restricted the United States\u2014the onetime \u201cbreadbasket of the world\u201d\u2014from selling its meats, grains and dairy products to massive importers of foodstuffs such as Japan and Vietnam.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe decision to pull out of the trade deal has become a double hit on places like Eagle Grove. The promised bump of $10 billion in agricultural output over 15 years, based on estimates by the U.S. International Trade Commission, won\u2019t materialize. But Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact also cleared the way for rival exporters such as Australia, New Zealand and the European Union to negotiate even lower tariffs with importing nations, creating potentially greater competitive advantages over U.S. exports.\u000a\u000aA POLITICO analysis found that the 11 other TPP countries are now involved in a whopping 27 separate trade negotiations with each other, other major trading powers in the region like China and massive blocs like the EU. Those efforts range from exploratory conversations to deals already signed and awaiting ratification. Seven of the most significant deals for U.S. farmers were either launched or concluded in the five months since the United States withdrew from the TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, whose North Carolina-based family pork and poultry business made its huge investment in the plant near Eagle Grove in part to reap expected gains from the TPP. \u201cI don\u2019t guess I\u2019ve gone beyond the point of no return on the new plant, but we did already start digging our wells and started moving dirt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and other agricultural businesspeople and workers have reason for concern.\u000a\u000aContrasting sharply with Eagle Grove\u2019s sleepy main thoroughfares, Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing is considered to be one of the busiest intersections in the world. While slow and small, Iowa towns such as Eagle Grove help supply much of the pork Japan imports. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aOn July 6, the EU, which already exports as much pork to Japan as the United States does, announced political agreement on a new deal that would give European pork farmers an advantage of up to $2 per pound over U.S. exporters under certain circumstances\u2014a move which, if unchecked, is all but certain to create a widening gap between EU exports and those from the United States.\u000a\u000aEuropean wine producers, who sold more than $1 billion to Japan between 2014 and 2016, would also see a 15 percent tariff on exports to Japan disappear while U.S. exporters would continue to face that duty at the border. For other products, the deal essentially mirrors the rates negotiated under the TPP, which the United States has surrendered, giving the EU a clear advantage over U.S. farmers.\u000a\u000aThe EU\u2019s deal is all the more noteworthy because American farmers were relying on the TPP\u2014to which the EU was not a member\u2014to give them an advantage over European competitors. But in a further rebuke to the United States, Tokyo decided within a matter of weeks to offer the European nations virtually the same agricultural access to its market that United States trade officials had spent two excruciating years extracting through near-monthly meetings with their Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the broader TPP negotiations; the United States is now left out.\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Without the TPP, Australian ranchers eventually will enjoy a 19 percent tariff advantage over U.S. competitors. Australia is also prioritizing the conclusion of trade talks with Indonesia, the largest nation in Southeast Asia by gross domestic product.\u000a\u000aThe remaining 11 TPP countries have already met two times, with a third meeting planned, to move ahead with the revival of the deal without the United States. The so-called TPP-11 would be in direct response to Trump\u2019s trade policy. Economic forecasts already show projected gains for countries involved. Canada, according to one estimate, could permanently gain an annual market share of $412 million in beef and $111 million in pork sales to Japan by 2035, because lower tariffs would enable it to eclipse America\u2019s position in the market.\u000a\u000aAs China, which was never a part of the TPP, senses blood in the water, it is moving quickly to assert itself, rather than the United States, as the region\u2019s trade arbiter. China is aiming to close talks by the end of this year on its behemoth Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\u2014a trade agreement involving 15 other Asia-Pacific countries.\u000a\u000aNone of these deals are yet in effect. But already there are signs that competitors are gaining market share over U.S. producers in the post-TPP landscape, as Pacific nations take a closer look at alternatives to U.S. exporters.\u000a\u000aOver the first five months of 2017, U.S. exports to Japan of chilled pork, which is preferable to frozen meat, are up 2 percent over the previous year. But exports of chilled pork from Canada, a prime competitor, are up 19 percent. Likewise, in frozen pork, U.S. exports are up 28 percent. But exports from the EU, the leading competitor, are up 44 percent.\u000a\u000aJapan, which saw the TPP not only as a source of economic growth but a counterweight to China, is now taking the lead in salvaging the deal. Its goal is to have some sort of agreement between the 11 other countries in place for the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in November. Trump is expected to attend, creating the awkward possibility that he will witness all the handshakes and back slaps as his fellow leaders congratulate themselves on a deal.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Trump once promised a slew of \u201cbeautiful\u201d deals to replace the TPP, but his administration has yet to lay out a detailed strategy. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that an analysis is underway to determine where it makes most sense to pursue negotiations.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Lighthizer, a trade attorney who pressured Japan to voluntarily restrain its steel exports when he was a trade official in the 1980s, said Tokyo should just go ahead and lower their tariffs without expecting anything in return.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think in the areas like beef and the others, they ought to be making some unilateral concessions, at least temporary concessions,\u201d he told lawmakers in June. \u201cAnd I don't quite understand why that doesn't happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aLighthizer said the administration still hopes to strike bilateral trade deals\u2014that is, separate agreements with individual countries\u2014but he conceded that "some of the TPP countries don't want to do bilaterals." The value of the TPP for many countries was that they could justify giving up protective tariffs in exchange for their own access to the markets of a wide pool of countries; many are unwilling to make such concessions for the smaller gains of a bilateral deal.\u000a\u000aLighthizer acknowledged that even Japan, at least for the time being, may not be interested in one-on-one negotiations with the U.S.\u000a\u000aLighthizer declined to comment for this report, and the White House directed questions to the Agriculture Department. But Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, which is more overtly pro-trade than other pockets of the administration, said in a statement that \u201cSecretary [Sonny] Perdue is committed to expanding our playing field for American agricultural exports,\u201d and has met with his counterparts in Canada, Mexico and China.\u000a\u000aMurtaugh cited administration gains in \u201cgetting beef into the Chinese market\u201d and securing access for American rice growers to China, \u201cthe largest rice market in the world.\u201d Both moves came out of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, though they had been worked on intensively during the Obama administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt goes right along with the secretary\u2019s new motto for USDA, \u2018Do right and feed everyone,\u2019\u201d Murtaugh wrote.\u000a\u000aHe made no mention of efforts to fill in the gaps left by the country\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, which are more in Lighthizer\u2019s purview.\u000a\u000aThat leaves workers in 13,000-person Wright County, whose survival depends largely on agriculture, with relatively few signs of optimism. Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from the TPP has stoked uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and, more notably, the president\u2019s commitment to rural America.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe fooled a lot of people,\u201d said Sandy McGrath, mayor of Eagle Grove, who is not affiliated with any party and did not support Trump.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn Wright County, a trainload of corn can be in Mexico in three days, tens of thousands of hogs are being raised just for export to Japan and farmers routinely travel to far-flung places like Indonesia and the Philippines to market their goods.\u000a\u000aThis community roughly 100 miles north of Des Moines, checker boarded with corn and soybean fields and dotted with silos, may seem far from the raging debate over globalism sparked by Trump\u2019s presidency, but it\u2019s actually right at the center.\u000a\u000aSandy McGrath, the mayor of Eagle Grove, is shown at Rails Bar and Grill, which she owns and operates. The area\u2019s \u201cskyline\u201d is punctuated by soybean processing facilities like the one shown here. Farmer Jerry Maier, right, and Jim Christ chat inside Christ\u2019s furniture store. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe county\u2019s residents are grappling with life under a Trump presidency and all its unanswered questions: Will the president\u2019s next tweet about trade send commodity prices crashing? Will Trump ever follow through on his promise to create new opportunities through bilateral trade deals? And, even more pressing: Will the new plant that Prestage is building be able to hire a second shift of workers, helping families who have struggled through the recent agricultural downturn?\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not say I trust the president\u2019s judgment right now,\u201d said McGrath, a registered nurse who grew up on a nearby farm and owns one of the town\u2019s main watering holes\u2014Rails Bar and Grill, named for its proximity to the rail line that that carries cars loaded with grain and feed.\u000a\u000aEagle Grove\u2019s skyline is already punctuated by feed grain elevators and a soybean processing facility. Now it\u2019s further staking its future on Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant, roughly five miles south of town past the Dollar General, the Family Table restaurant and a Ford dealership.\u000a\u000aThe plant represents an opportunity not many Midwest towns the size of Eagle Grove are afforded given today's economic realities.\u000a\u000aMcGrath said the plant will bring much-needed jobs to the area, which has had a dwindling population for years. From its 1970 height of 4,489 people, the town suffered a 31 percent decline in population to 3,427 in 2016. Now Eagle Grove is expecting at least 200 of the 900 workers the plant will initially employ to find housing in the town. This would give a sorely needed boost to retailers and service providers, as well.\u000a\u000aBut the plant\u2019s success will depend largely on export opportunities. More than 26 percent of the pork produced in the U.S. in 2016 was exported to foreign markets. And more than $1.5 billion of the nearly $6 billion in U.S. pork exports in 2016 headed for Japan.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the time those investment decisions were made, the U.S. had never turned down a free trade opportunity,\u201d said Dermot Hayes, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University, referring to the Prestage plant and other pork-industry investments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, referring to Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the TPP. The family-owned Prestage Farms is building a pork processing facility outside Eagle Grove that depends on a robust export market. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aHayes said the livestock industry had in its sights a future of expansion amid soaring export growth. After Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, \u201cthat has pretty much disappeared,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMost in the industry expected a coming boom from exports as a result of TPP, with continued strong sales made possible by NAFTA. Vietnam, another growing market where U.S. producers were set to expand sales of organ meat and other items not easily sold domestically, was prepared to eliminate its tariffs altogether under TPP. Now, the tariffs remain and Prestage\u2014and all of Eagle Grove\u2014are holding their breath.\u000a\u000aPrestage said his company\u2019s plant should be operational by the fall of 2018, but any move to add a second shift or expand production will largely depend on new trade opportunities.\u000a\u000aExuding gentle defiance, Prestage said even if he had known the TPP would fail, he still would have gone ahead with the plant. His family\u2019s business raises, mainly through contract growers, more than 1.5 million hogs in Iowa alone. Consolidation in the meatpacking industry has forced companies like Prestage to sell hogs to a few major players like Tyson Foods and JBS.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was time for there to be some modernization in the U.S. packing industry,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWith future export opportunities in question, the success of the plant will now be tied to what business it can displace from less efficient and older processing facilities. It also will face competition. The Prestage plant is one of two new major pork processing plants being built in Iowa and one of five new facilities going up nationwide.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think that Trump is naïve enough to not recognize the value of trade deals to the U.S.,\u201d Prestage said in an interview at his Eagle Grove office, a nondescript former bank building on the town\u2019s main drag. \u201cI just think he has an unusual way of introducing what his policy is going to be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI sure hope I\u2019m right about that,\u201d he added after a pause.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAsk anyone involved in the county\u2019s agriculture sector their thoughts on Trump as president and his stance on trade, and you get a carefully thought-out response. Like many of those in Trump\u2019s rural base, they are distrustful of the coastal elites who are blocking his agenda, even as they wish that he would alter his own abrasive style and think more about those who got him elected.\u000a\u000a\u201cI still believe what he is saying he is going to follow through on, but his management style isn\u2019t quite how at least people in the Midwest do things,\u201d said Stu Swanson, who farms corn, soybeans and pork outside Galt, a tiny hamlet near the center of the county.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a Midwest style and there\u2019s his style,\u201d he said from his living room, where the panorama from the windows is dotted by the white-roofed livestock barns in the distance.\u000a\u000aGround is prepared to host Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant south of Eagle Grove, Iowa. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aSwanson acknowledged his own household is split over its support for Trump. Trump, he figured, would be the best positioned to tamp down the rising health care costs for his own family and his one farmhand that he believes to be connected to the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aBut on trade, Swanson was less sure where Trump drew the line between campaign-trail bluster and real action. There was, he thought, far too much at stake for his rural base to make any rash decisions. Then, three days after he was sworn in, Trump made good on a promise to drop U.S. support for TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was disappointed Trump kind of broadly wiped out TPP before there was even a discussion,\u201d Swanson said.\u000a\u000aJerry Maier, a Wright County corn and soybean farmer who supported Trump, said he feels the same way.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re at the table and nothing happens, that\u2019s one thing. But if you aren\u2019t even at that table, that\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe downward trend of commodity prices has been a lingering reality for the third-generation farmer who lives just outside Eagle Grove. The USDA\u2019s annual farm income report forecasts that net farm income will drop this year by 8.7 percent, compared with 2016. Incomes have been decreasing steadily since 2013 when they hit an all-time high of more than $120 billion. The forecast for this year projects net incomes down to little more than $62.3 billion.\u000a\u000aMaier, for one, has had to find new ways to earn extra income from grinding tree stumps to hauling gravel using trucks that usually carry grain. After a wet planting season this spring, he expects to once again barely break even on his crops.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are pretty resilient about making no money for a few years, but you gotta make money at some point,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMaier is as vigilant as any commodity trader, scrutinizing corn and soybean prices multiple times a day as alerts come in on the smartphone he carries on his belt.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s also aware that any extra margin on his crops, barring any unforeseen demand domestically, will largely depend on new overseas markets. He recently hosted a contingent of South Korean grain buyers on his farm and traveled to the Philippines and Indonesia last year to seek new contracts for Iowa farmers.\u000a\u000aIn April, when Trump was on the verge of withdrawing from NAFTA, Maier said he watched corn prices plummet in anticipation of the president\u2019s decision. Trump relented, at the request of Perdue, the agriculture secretary, who appealed to the president with colorful maps showing the president's base was largely concentrated in states that heavily rely on agriculture.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Trump agreed to renegotiations with Canada and Mexico instead. But Maier remains wary that, despite pledges by the administration to "do no harm" for agriculture, the mere act of reopening the deal with Canada and Mexico, the two largest destinations for U.S. agricultural exporters, could mess up what has been a very good thing for American farmers in the Midwest.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are willing to open up NAFTA, but if we open up NAFTA, there's the risk of going backwards,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aWright County produces 800,000 hogs per year and is one of the top 20 pork-producing counties in the country. Put those pigs next to the more than 6.5 million egg-laying hens (the county is first in the nation in egg production) and that creates a huge demand for corn and soybean for feed.\u000a\u000aStu Swanson farms corn, soybeans and pork near Galt, Iowa. While Swanson sells most of his pork to local processors, he is still concerned how Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of TPP could impact neighbors and corporate producers. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe supply chain from field, to feed, to animal has created a massive livestock industry that doesn\u2019t always find demand among American consumers. The dimming of any new trade opportunities or the disruption of existing ones creates a ripple effect not only vertically along the direct farm value chain but horizontally into the economic welfare of the surrounding community.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the farmers have a bad year, we all have a bad year. If the farmers have a good year, we all have a good year,\u201d said Melia Hansen, a hair stylist on Eagle Grove\u2019s main street.\u000a\u000aSuccessfully growing a business in today\u2019s agricultural economy has become more reliant on trade as farmers consolidate and massively scale up their production to better compete. In 1940, the Agriculture Department census found that the average Iowa farm was 160 acres. By 2012, when the last census was conducted, the average acreage in Wright County was 464.\u000a\u000aThe success of the community as a whole is growing more reliant on the fortunes of fewer farmers growing even more grain and livestock.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers spend a quarter- to a half-million dollars on a combine,\u201d said Ethan Bubeck, who runs a local meat processing business in Eagle Grove that buys hogs from farmers who also sell to the major meat processors. \u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018American Gothic\u2019 picture of the guy with a pitchfork. This is big business.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe economic outlook for Wright County would certainly be a lot less hopeful without the Prestage plant, but there is broad recognition that trade will largely drive any future growth, said Bryce Davis, director of the county\u2019s economic development department.\u000a\u000aCustomers have their beauty needs taken care of at Reflections Salon, a renovated bank building along Broadway Street in Eagle Grove. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aAs commodities like corn and soybeans continue to languish, Davis excitedly talks about the export potential of \u201cvalue-added agriculture\u201d beyond pork production.\u000a\u000aAfter an earlier proposal to build Prestage\u2019s plant about 70 miles away near Mason City was turned down, Davis sent an unsolicited email to the company to see whether they\u2019d be interested in scoping out Wright County as a possible location.\u000a\u000aNow, fresh off the major coup of reeling in Prestage, the young, energetic economic development professional sees more opportunity in everything from aquaculture to getting more farmers to grow hops to harness the new global fervor for craft beer.\u000a\u000aHe dreams of a time when the county could become a seafood exporter 1,000 miles away from the closest ocean. The concept is already bringing success to nearby Webster City where a company called VeroBlue is expanding its operations for raising barramundi, a flaky white fish native to Australia. The company, which already farms fish in old pork production facilities, acquired the building that once housed the town\u2019s primary employer, an Electrolux washing machine factory that shut down in 2011 and relocated in Juárez, Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know we need these trade agreements in place to provide an opportunity for Iowa farmers to sell their products,\u201d Davis said.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration, backed by a large cadre of free-trade Republicans, used that reality to grow support for the TPP among businesses and agricultural interests eager to grab a better foothold in a fast-growing area of the world where the U.S. has few formal trade deals.\u000a\u000aWorkers at Lewright Meats prepare hog products for sale at their Eagle Grove shop. The family-run business specializes in custom processing for beef and pork farmers while operating a popular deli up front. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut through the slow churn of negotiations, the dazzlingly complex deal among 12 countries soon fell victim to time and circumstance. After more than five years of talks, bleary-eyed trade negotiators were finally able to close the deal at an Atlanta hotel on October 5, 2015. But the agreement quickly became mired in election politics. Labor unions and blue-collar voters declared it to be a successor to NAFTA, which was blamed for the loss of factories. And while the U.S. trade commission predicted the deal would be broadly beneficial to the overall economy, some areas including food and agriculture were predicted to score more gains than others.\u000a\u000aEven as supporters of the deal insisted it would put U.S. manufacturers on a stronger footing versus overseas competitors by enforcing higher labor and environmental standards, Trump and Bernie Sanders used anti-TPP fervor as a key plank of their campaign platforms, declaring that it would cost America jobs. Even Hillary Clinton, normally a supporter of freer trade, turned on the deal, saying she wanted to negotiate better terms.\u000a\u000aTrump escalated his rhetoric on trade after the primaries and Congress, which has final say on trade deals, shied away from bringing TPP up for a vote. After Trump\u2019s victory, the fate of the deal in the GOP-controlled Congress was all but sealed as Republican lawmakers put it aside to concentrate on tax reform and a bid to roll back Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOn his first full day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing from the TPP, calling the action a \u201cgreat thing for the American worker.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country,\u201d Trump said during a campaign stop in Ohio. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, too. It\u2019s a harsh word: It\u2019s a rape of our country.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aBut even as Iowa was voting for Trump by 51 percent-42 percent, its farmers were looking to Asia as their savior.\u000a\u000aThroughout the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, an expanding middle class is demanding higher-quality protein\u2014causing enormous demand for meat. U.S. pork producers can find Asian buyers for just about everything cut out of a hog carcass\u2014from the highest-priced loin to the cheaper organ meats that are hard to sell to U.S. consumers.\u000a\u000aThe boom in Asia is so powerful that, even with the dim trade outlook stemming from its pullout from the TPP, U.S. pork exports continued to grow through April of this year. In the first four months of 2017, 27.5 percent of total U.S. pork production was exported, up from 24.4 percent last year. Exports to Japan in April were 5 percent higher than a year ago by volume and up 10 percent in value.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Meat Export Federation has pushed an aggressive marketing campaign for pork and beef, portraying American meats as premium products. In Japanese supermarkets, American pork is branded with a logo featuring Gochipo, a cute animated pig that sometimes even makes appearances in mascot form to encourage shoppers to buy premium, thick cuts of U.S.-produced pork.\u000a\u000aIn Japan, it\u2019s hard to promote products in a landscape cluttered with color. So the U.S. Meat Export Federation developed a lovable character, Gochipo, to serve as its ambassador for American pork. While domestic pork holds 51 percent of the market, the U.S. leads all import products at 15 percent, just ahead of Canada\u2019s 10 percent market share. USMEF regularly hosts pork tastings in grocery stores and offers special promotions in restaurants and malls throughout the Tokyo region. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut it could soon just be a matter of time until consumers in those countries will choose a lower-cost product.\u000a\u000aGrowth in Canadian chilled-pork exports to Japan is already outpacing those of the United States, as buyers in Japan have already been looking to diversify their sources after a disease outbreak spiked prices in 2014 and a West Coast ports shutdown further roiled the market in 2015. If Canada clinches a deal with Japan through a revived TPP where it would gain a price advantage, little would stop Canadian pork from overtaking U.S. share of the market, which has already dipped from 70 percent in 2012 to 55 percent this year.\u000a\u000aThe EU, a major pork exporter, is also closing in on both the Japanese market and fast-growing Vietnam. Japan ended up offering the EU the same deal on pork it did to the United States under the TPP after the EU gave Tokyo favorable access for its cars. In Vietnam, frozen pork imported from the EU will be duty-free seven years after the deal with Brussels goes into force.\u000a\u000aHayes, of Iowa State University, is deeply worried about the threat these deals represent. \u201cInstead of getting those 200 million customers we may be, in fact, at a disadvantage in those markets because these are preferential trade agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not part of it, you are on the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most immediate example of U.S. producers losing out is the case of Australian beef. In its lobbying drive on the TPP, the U.S. beef industry at one time even kept a website complete with a counter continuously ticking off the amount of sales to Japan it was losing to Australia. Now, Australia is speeding up the clock.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe count on a bigger market share,\u201d declared Michael Finucan, general manager for international markets for Meat and Livestock Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have a tariff advantage in that market for quite a number of years.\u201d\u000a\u000aAustralia's tariff advantage was boosted even more after Japan imposed an additional 11.5 percent tariff on imports of U.S. frozen beef on August 1. U.S. exports of the product had risen to a level of triggering a \u201csafeguard\u201d measure meant to protect domestic cattle producers. That tariff hike won't apply to Australia since it has a trade deal with Tokyo and wouldn't have applied to the United States if the TPP were in place.\u000a\u000aAustralian exports to Japan are expected to catch up with the United States, with Australia enjoying a tariff this year of 27.5 percent compared with the 50 percent the United States now faces with the safeguard in place. The TPP would have cut tariffs to 9 percent for both Australia and the United States.\u000a\u000aAfter years of drought, Australia\u2019s ranchers are rebuilding their herds. Although the scale of Australia\u2019s production may never match that of the United States, Finucan said there is increasing demand for the type of grass-fed beef Australia is best known for producing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment, there is a shift toward health as a lot of developed countries are in the same space,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are questioning the amount of marbling in beef and looking for a leaner product. It\u2019s obviously a place Australia can play well with our grass-fed beef.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aSitting comfortably on a couch overlooking the expanse of sea from the lobby of a beachfront hotel in Vina del Mar, Chile, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo has his gaze fixed across the Pacific.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s March 15 and, a few hours previously, the 11 current TPP countries were finally able to offer a unified response to Trump\u2019s announcement from January: Don\u2019t expect the trade agreement to fade away.\u000a\u000aThe meeting on Chile\u2019s coast represented a major turning point on trade for Asia-Pacific countries facing life in the Trump era. Not only did the remaining TPP countries reaffirm their commitment to retain the benefits of the deal, but Chile and its Latin American trade allies in the Pacific Alliance announced their own efforts to advance regional trade integration by pursuing trade deals with other countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe continue to engage with the world,\u201d Ciobo said matter-of-factly, while sipping a Coke.\u000a\u000aHe said his highest priority was completing negotiations for a trade deal with Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest country, where the United States has no agreement. Leaders from Australia and Indonesia agreed on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in July to reach a deal by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy job as Australia\u2019s trade and investment minister is to pursue Australia\u2019s national interests, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d Ciobo said, when asked whether Australia is actively seeking to take market share from the United States. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ll pursue our trade and investment agenda through multilateral, plurilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements.\u201d\u000a\u000aWorkers offload a shipment of pork from a Perry, Iowa processor as it arrives at a massive cold storage facility along the shipyards in Tokyo, Japan. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe same sentiment came from New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay when he was in Washington in June for his first one-on-one meeting with Lighthizer.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur experience is wherever a vacuum is created, it\u2019s filled very, very quickly,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t stay still.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven as senior trade officials from countries in the Pacific region waste no time acting on new opportunities created by America\u2019s absence, they recognize it\u2019s still early days for the Trump administration on trade.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the first few months of an administration and the first few weeks of a USTR being in place, we need to show the understanding and courtesy to allow that strategy and policy to develop,\u201d McClay said.\u000a\u000aBut despite Trump\u2019s intense personal interest in trade, the White House has been slow to build the dream team of negotiators the president promised on the campaign trail. Lighthizer, who once served as a deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed on May 11. The people tapped to serve in the agency\u2019s three deputy positions await confirmation, as does the administration\u2019s pick for chief agriculture negotiator.\u000a\u000aIowa\u2019s Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley says he thinks a trade deal with Japan would make up for much that was lost for agriculture by dropping TPP, but it will take \u201ca lot more personnel, a lot more time to get it done, a lot more separate actions by Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs far as the administration\u2019s strategy to get there, Grassley, who still owns his farm in Butler County, Iowa, said he hasn\u2019t gotten much direction.\u000a\u000a\u201cI asked Lighthizer maybe a month ago in a meeting, and I didn\u2019t get an answer,\u201d Grassley said in a recent interview. \u201cIn a sense he answered, but not very definitively because their policy isn\u2019t established.\u201d\u000a\u000aIowa farmer Grant Woodley inside his 4,800-head hog confinement facility near Clarion, Iowa. | M.

They made a major investment two years ago in a state-of-the-art livestock facility, knowing that the margin on soybeans and corn alone wouldn\u2019t provide a sustainable source of income to keep the farm, which has been in his family for more than 100 years.\u000a\u000aHis current contract has him raising hogs for the Japanese market. That involves feeding the animals a diet free from certain additives and following more restrictive guidelines on antibiotic use. He knows any profit he might get on futures contracts for any hogs raised for export will largely depend on whether the trading relationships tilt in favor of the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe world is going find it wherever it\u2019s cheapest,\u201d said Woodley, who made clear he did not support Trump in the election.\u000a\u000aStability and predictability were two key principles for Woodley. So far, he doesn\u2019t see any of that coming out of the Trump administration when it comes to his trade policy and ability to strike new deals.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreating instability is not good business practice when there are fierce and competitive producers around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cStability and predictability are tremendous to me as I seek out business partnerships, so why would it be any different for any other country we work with?\u201d

This is under an active criminal investigation, their capabilities are pretty strong but, they\u2019re also able to go and get the kind of help they need from other sources.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe brothers\u2019 stepmother independently filed court documents in Virginia accusing the brothers of wiretapping and extorting her.\u000a\u000aSoon after Imran began working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, his two brothers and two of their wives \u2014 plus Abbas and another friend \u2014 began appearing as IT staffers on the payrolls of other House Democrats. Collectively, the Awan group has been paid $4 million since 2009.\u000a\u000aFellow IT staffers TheDCNF interviewed said the Awans were often absent from weekly meetings and email exchanges. One of the fellow staffers said some of the computers the Awans managed were being used to transfer data to an off-site server.\u000a\u000aShortly after the criminal probe was revealed in February, Imran abruptly moved out of his longtime home on Hawkshead Drive in Lorton, Va., and listed it for rent on a website that connects landlords with military families.\u000a\u000aOne of the new tenants \u2014 a Marine Corps veteran married to a female Navy Officer \u2014 said he found \u201cwireless routers, hard drives that look like they tried to destroy, laptops, [and] a lot of brand new expensive toner.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe tenants called the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and, not long after, FBI agents arrived together with the Capitol Police to interview them and confiscate the equipment.

I don\u2019t know where they get off thinking they\u2019re going to sue us for items we have no obligation to hold onto,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aImran came to the house for the items \u201cthree to four times,\u201d but the Marine wouldn\u2019t let him enter.\u000a\u000a\u201cTheir lawyer contacted us today via email and said we owed $350 in late charges and the items he left in the house,\u201d the Marine said.\u000a\u000aThe Marine heard about the House investigation on the radio, and by that time, he had noticed other bizarre signs of desperation from his landlord.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we first moved in, a mailman came with certified mail from the House of Representatives. We were trying to be nice and signed for it.

And I get there, and I said where\u2019s the bill? I want to sign it.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcConnell has suggested that the GOP should move on from health care after falling just short of the 50 votes he needed to pass a "skinny" repeal bill, and instead focus on tax reform. And earlier this week, McConnell said Trump has \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d about how quickly Congress can pass legislation.\u000a\u000aBut Trump demanded that Republicans follow through on their agenda, suggesting further failure could cost McConnell his job atop the Senate GOP.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf he doesn't get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn't get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

All are suspects in the criminal investigation, which became public in February.\u000a\u000a\u201cAwan began working as an IT aide in 2004,\u201d Grassley said in the letter. \u201cLater, his wife, two brothers, and two friends began working as IT aides for nearly 30 congressmen. Over the span of 13 years, they collected more than $4 million\u2014 a sum that is reported to be three times higher than the norm for a government contractor.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll of the congressmen involved are House Democrats, including several on the intelligence, foreign affairs and homeland security committees. The IT aides had access to all of the emails and office files of the congressmen, who employed them on a shared basis.\u000a\u000aThe employment of all of the suspects was terminated in February, except Awan\u2019s wife, who was retained by Democratic Rep. Wasserman Schultz until March. Wasserman Schultz \u2014 the Florida Democrat who was Democratic National Committee Chairman until July 2016 \u2014 kept Awan on her payroll until July 25.\u000a\u000aAwan was arrested July 24 at Dulles International Airport by the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection before he could board the flight to Pakistan. His wife returned to Pakistan in March, along with their three children.\u000a\u000aAuthorities charged Awan with bank fraud in connection with a $165,000 mortgage loan from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union. Awan wire transferred $283,000 to Pakistan prior to his attempt to flee the country, according to a court document filed by the FBI.\u000a\u000aWithin hours of his arrest, Imran Awan retained Chris Gowen as his defense attorney. Gowen is a long-time associate of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aFollow Mark on Twitter\u000a\u000aContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

aVLONDON \u2014 Little by little, Euroskeptic Tories are softening their rhetoric.\u000a\u000aHaving given way on the Brexit timetable and with even the most ardent EU opponents acknowledging that Britain will be forced to pay a \u201cdivorce bill,\u201d Brexiteers now appear to have relaxed about the future of one of British politics\u2019 most iconic buildings.\u000a\u000aCalls in February for 32 Smith Square \u2014 once former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\u2019s headquarters and later sold to the EU, who moved in in 2010 and renamed it \u201cEurope House\u201d \u2014 to be returned to British ownership as part of Brexit talks have so far gone unheeded and officials on both sides of the negotiations now expect the building to remain the last EU stronghold in London when the U.K. leaves the bloc.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the scheme of Brexit it is hard to be excited about one building,\u201d said prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who in February attracted headlines by calling on the EU to return the building to the Brits, telling the FT that it \u201cwould be a wonderful gesture if [European Commission President Jean-Claude] Juncker got to keep the stocks of Château Lafite [in the EU\u2019s shared wine cellar] and in return the EU gave us back 32 Smith Square.\u201d Rees-Mogg said this week that he hoped the reference to Lafite made it clear he hadn\u2019t been making a serious point.\u000a\u000aFormer government minister and senior Euroskeptic Tory Norman Tebbit was similarly nonplussed. Despite saying earlier this year that it would be a \u201cnice idea\u201d for the Tories to move back into Europe House, he said this week that it was up to the European Union to do whatever they liked with the building. \u201cThey can buy it, sell it, do what they want with it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEmbassy in London\u000a\u000aThe building, located just a short walk from the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, was the headquarters of the Conservative Party for almost half a century, including during the Thatcher years. It was also the backdrop to some of the party\u2019s more troubled times and was nicknamed \u201cChateau Despair\u201d shortly before the Tories moved out after two landslide election defeats and plotting against two former party leaders, William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith.\u000a\u000aThe party moved into more modern offices on Victoria Street in 2004, and then to Matthew Parker Street before the 2015 general election.\u000a\u000aThe historic central London building was jointly bought by the European Parliament and European Commission for £20 million, and refurbished before Eurocrats moved into the building in 2010. It was purchased with the aim of cutting its multimillion pound rent bill in the \u201cmedium\u201d term. The building, with a 150 seat conference centre and information office, is currently jointly used by the two institutions. The European Commission has had premises in London since the early 1960s, which the European Parliament shared after 1973.\u000a\u000aOne senior Whitehall official said the ownership of the building had not come up in Brexit talks so far.\u000a\u000aWhen questioned about the future of Europe House, other individuals familiar with the matter on both the British government and EU side highlighted the need for an EU ambassadorial presence in safe, non-EU countries across the world. British officials say the U.K. will have a \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d with the European Union post Brexit.\u000a\u000aEurope House is seen by officials on both sides as a possible location for the EU External Action Service \u2014 the EU\u2019s diplomatic wing, something hinted at in a British government position paper, published in July, which mentions \u201cthe continued presence the EU expects to have in the UK, including for example an EU delegation.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne Tory MP, who is a member of the Brexit supporting European Research Group, said Brexit-backing MPs were now focused on making sure that Brexit happened following the shock general election result which saw Prime Minister Theresa May lose her majority.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly the EU had a lot more money to spend on it than the Conservative Party did\u201d \u2014 David Campbell-Bannerman\u000a\u000aDavid Campbell-Bannerman, a Tory MEP and another hard-line Brexiteer, said Europe House would actually become \u201cmore relevant\u201d after Britain left the European Union.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do want to continue friendly working relationships with the EU. In fact it probably becomes more important given there will not be MEPs or UKRep [the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the European Union], and obviously our presence over there through the Council will be different and diminished.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added it had been a \u201ctrue irony\u201d when 32 Smith Square was taken over by the European Union and became Europe House, but the Conservative Party had needed the money and the sale of the asset had helped.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly the EU had a lot more money to spend on it than the Conservative Party did. Those that knew the building it was pretty average and pretty run down. The EU splashed around a lot of our money on it and it is in a much better state,\u201d he said.

To see a democracy destroyed and an economy crater?\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSince 2014, American journalist Hannah Dreier has documented just that in Venezuela, once one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations and still home to what are believed to be the planet\u2019s largest oil reserves. She wrote for the Associated Press about what it was like to live in a place with the world\u2019s highest murder rate\u2014and the world\u2019s highest rate of inflation. About the breakdown of hospitals and schools, and how the obesity epidemic that plagued a rich country was quickly replaced with people so hungry they were rooting through the garbage on her doorstep.\u000a\u000aMost of the time, few paid attention, at least in part because Dreier was the last U.S. journalist even to get a work visa to live in Venezuela; when she moved there to cover the story, she says, \u201cI felt like I had walked across a bridge as it was burning behind me.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut over the past week, as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has declared victory in a fraud-plagued referendum and moved to seize control of the opposition-controlled legislature, the rest of the world has\u2014finally, belatedly\u2014come to see what is happening in Caracas for what it is: the birth of a dictatorship.\u000a\u000aIn Washington, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration imposed direct personal sanctions on Maduro\u2014an insult reserved for only a handful of the world\u2019s toughest tyrants, such as Syria\u2019s Bashir Assad, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe\u2014and his regime insiders. Maduro, Trump said in a statement, \u201cis not just a bad leader; he is now a dictator.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe United States, however, continues to be Venezuela\u2019s largest customer for the oil that provides more than 95 percent of the country\u2019s income, and has refrained from targeting the industry for sanctions despite Maduro\u2019s move to finally establish a socialist police state, a development set in motion more than a decade ago by his charismatic predecessor Hugo Chavez.\u000a\u000aDreier, who has just returned to the United States after completing her assignment in Venezuela, may well end up being the last American journalist to get that permanent visa for Caracas, at least for a while (though her colleagues at the AP emailed after this was posted to assure me they are still covering the story and intend to replace her). She is this week\u2019s guest on The Global Politico, our weekly podcast on world affairs, and we talked about why she thinks the new U.S. sanctions on Maduro might help him as much as hurt him, how the crisis has many in Venezuela pining not for their lost freedoms but for the rise of a mano dura\u2014a strong hand\u2014to restore lost order, and just what crazy things you can get used to living in a place that\u2019s falling apart.\u000a\u000aI found her account incredibly compelling\u2014filled with the absurdities of life as a society unravels. At first, it seems almost comic, as when Dreier spends the day reporting at a plastic surgeon\u2019s office and watches eager would-be beauty queens coming in with cut-rate Chinese bootleg breast implants once others became impossible to find. And Dreier tells me she spent her first year in Venezuela convinced the media narrative about the country falling apart was all wrong.\u000a\u000aThen, Dreier recounts, her life changed. First, her friends\u2014middle-class young professionals like herself\u2014started losing weight. She lost power and water. Crime became so rampant her colleagues congratulated her on a \u201cgood robbery\u201d when she was held up in broad daylight and all she lost were her belongings. By the time she was grabbed off the street after an interview one day earlier this year, she was overwhelmed with relief when she found out she\u2019d been snatched by the secret police and not far more vicious kidnappers.\u000a\u000aMoney became almost worthless, and she started carrying paper grocery bags full of 100-bolivar notes to pay for even small things. Her choices for food were empty supermarket shelves or $25 black-market Cheerios. She watched as ordinary people stood on line for bread, milk and toilet paper. One day the bakery around the corner started organizing a queue\u2014not to sell the bread they had already run out of, but for the privilege of allowing people to rummage through their trash. The screams she heard one morning were of neighbors savagely beating an accused thief; a \u201clynching,\u201d it was called.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou never had to go and try to figure out where the crisis was,\u201d she says. "It was on your doorstep.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe full transcript of our conversation is below, and I hope you\u2019ll take the time to read this sad, funny, infuriating and amazing story of what it was like to report in a country while democracy died there. Dreier\u2019s takeaway as she leaves Venezuela is a sobering one: \u201cthings can always get worse and worse and worse, and there\u2019s no rule that says that a miserable situation has to end, just because it\u2019s too miserable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aSusan Glasser: This is Susan Glasser. We have, I think, a really important and fascinating story to talk about this week and a great guest.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m here in New York with Hannah Dreier, who has just returned from being one of the very few American correspondents still left in Venezuela. As the country has imploded, she\u2019s had a unique window on what it\u2019s like to live in a democracy as it collapses, as it turns and morphs before your eyes into something else.\u000a\u000aHannah, what a unique journalistic experience you\u2019ve had. As you take up your new role here at ProPublica, I want you to reflect a little bit. How did you get into Venezuela?\u000a\u000aHannah Dreier: I had no idea that it was going to become the mess that it is today. I went down there in 2014 and I was kind of choosing between going to Venezuela or going to Mexico, and it looked like Venezuela might be kind of teetering on the brink of something, and I thought that maybe if I went there I would see something interesting. And if I had known how dramatic, and how bleak and dangerous it was going to get, I don\u2019t know if I really would have gone.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Sometimes foreknowledge is not a good thing if you\u2019re a journalist.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. Yes. It looks bad, but I wasn\u2019t a war correspondent. I\u2019d never lived abroad, really, I\u2019d never reported abroad, and if it was as dangerous as it is today, I don\u2019t think I could have handled it at the beginning.\u000a\u000aGlasser: You saw basically the transformation of one of the richest countries in the world into a complete\u2014not only a basket case, economically, I think it\u2019s one of the biggest and fastest collapses of a civilization, arguably, in recent modern times.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. I mean, Venezuela always has all the superlatives. It\u2019s the world\u2019s highest inflation by a lot. It\u2019s the world\u2019s highest murder rate. A lot of economists will tell you it\u2019s the most mismanaged economy in the world. And now, a lot of people are saying the world\u2019s most recently born dictatorship.\u000a\u000aBut when I went down there, it was a great place to live, which sounds crazy now, but it\u2019s beautiful. You walk around on the street and there are these wild parrots flying above you and these huge Andean mountains off in the distance. And I had a lot of friends who were my same age. They were young professionals and they traveled all over the world, and they were buying apartments, and we\u2019d go to the beach every weekend. We\u2019d go to these crazy clubs that were still left over from all the oil wells. And it just felt in some ways like a paradise.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, in a way, I think that\u2019s important context for you, that you saw what it was like before, because the collapse was so rapid and dramatic. By the end, people were eating garbage outside your window.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. I think a lot of people\u2014people think of Venezuela as a struggling Third World country, and I think it gets dismissed sometimes as a country that\u2019s always been poor and always had problems. But the truth is, it was one of the richest countries in the world in the \u201970s, and it was wealthy for a long time.\u000a\u000aUnder Chavez, the standard of living was rising. People there have very fancy tastes. They are very educated. And, so part of, to me, the tragedy of what\u2019s happened is that there is just no reason for this level of misery to ever come to Venezuela. It was a country that was making it.\u000a\u000aAnd now, like you say, those friends that I used to hang out with\u2014they\u2019ve all moved away. Those apartments are empty. When I came down, there were great restaurants. There was an obesity epidemic, and now as soon as you put a trash bag on the street there are people on that bag, going through to see what they can find.\u000a\u000aThe Global Politico Susan B. Glasser\u2019s new weekly podcast takes you backstage in a world disrupted. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, I want to talk about this evolution. But let\u2019s start first a little bit more in the headlines. Just this week you had the Trump administration in Washington\u2014not known for its democracy promotion; in fact, the same week that it was reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was taking democracy out of the State Department\u2019s mission statement\u2014you had Donald Trump, of all people, not only imposing personal sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s leader, Nicolas Maduro, but here\u2019s what Donald Trump had to say about Maduro.\u000a\u000aHe said, quote: \u201cMaduro is not just a bad leader, he is now a dictator,\u201d and as a result of that, we, the United States, imposed personal sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s leader, something we reserve for only several other, really, of the world\u2019s worst tough guys, Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe. However, dot-dot-dot, you pointed out, in a very smart piece, all of those leaders are still in power, and, in fact, these might be the kind of sanctions that have the least impact on Venezuela\u2019s crisis. What did you mean by that?\u000a\u000aDreier: Well, so, now that I\u2019m not working for the Associated Press, it\u2019s kind of fun to be able to point out these things that everybody covering Venezuela knows, but you can\u2019t usually just say outright.\u000a\u000aBut, basically, the U.S., with those sanctions, which are very important symbolically\u2014but, they said that they were going to freeze all of Maduro\u2019s assets, and all the headlines were: Maduro\u2019s Assets Frozen. There\u2019s no reason to think Maduro has any U.S. assets. This is a man who railed every day against the U.S. empire. Why would he put his money in Miami property, or anything here?\u000a\u000aSo, the sanctions will prevent him from buying things in the U.S. and from doing business with Americans, which he wasn\u2019t trying to do anyway, and Trump gets to say that this is a big, strong step. And Maduro, in Caracas, is also making hay with these sanctions and spending lots of time talking about them, and saying that they prove that the U.S. is a bully and that the U.S. is trying to ruin the Venezuelan economy\u2014so, kind of a gift.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And that was the response, as well, when Barack Obama imposed an earlier round of sanctions on certain regime leaders in 2015, right?\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. So, the time that I was in Venezuela, I just saw Maduro\u2019s approval ratings go lower and lower and lower, it was a steady downward decline, except for this one month in 2015, right after Obama imposed sanctions, and Maduro loved those. He talked about them every single day for a month, and put posters up all around the capital talking about how bad those sanctions were. And people really responded. People said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The U.S. is trying to interfere in our politics, just like they always do.\u201d And he got this total approval ratings bump. After that, I think the Obama administration backed off, because a lot of people seemed to realize that those sanctions were giving him a tool, not really hurting his administration.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, there is one thing that the United States could do, but it\u2019s never wanted to do. And what is that?\u000a\u000aDreier: That\u2019s oil sanctions. Ninety-five percent of Venezuela\u2019s revenue comes from oil. It\u2019s basically the only way the government is getting money right now. And the U.S. happens to be the biggest customer for that oil, and one of the very few governments still paying cash for oil. So, if the U.S. put an oil embargo in place, that would have a huge, dramatic effect, immediately, on Venezuela, and the government would probably default. There would be a reshuffling of alliances. But, it always seems to be that there are only bad options with Venezuela, because those oil sanctions would also probably lead to maybe famine-level hunger, to extreme suffering, and nobody really wants that either.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, we\u2019re locked in a terrible position of having declared Venezuela a dictatorship, and yet being the main customers propping up the government that we\u2019ve now declared a dictatorship.\u000a\u000aDreier: It\u2019s always struck me as a very strange thing. We\u2019ve declared Venezuela a dictatorship, and Venezuela has declared us as basically an evil empire, and yet this oil trade is so central to both countries. So, we\u2019re kind of locked in this rhetorical battle with each other, but also locked in this very important commercial relationship that neither side seems to want to disrupt.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Now, as a reporter there from 2014 on, as you said, for the Associated Press\u2014not always known for having vivid voice-filled, scenic descriptions, and yet that really was the trademark of your coverage there. And I think what made it stand out so much is that you were one of the few Americans to be lucky enough to get a visa to cover this important story. It hasn\u2019t gotten much attention here, but you also covered it in a very un-wire service-like way.\u000a\u000aYou weren\u2019t really writing the standard fare of politics, \u201cAnd Maduro said this today,\u201d were you? You were really chronicling the collapse of a society. Tell me, how quickly did you understand that was the story, and how did you feel you were able to do that in a way that was different from what a correspondent might have done 20 years ago, covering the collapse of the Soviet Union?\u000a\u000aDreier: Well, so, like you say, I was one of the very few reporters to have a visa there. I was actually the last U.S. reporter to get a permanent work visa, and it felt like I had walked across a bridge as it was burning behind me, and it made me feel a lot of responsibility to tell that story as vividly as I could because there were just so few reporters on the ground.\u000a\u000aAnd, I wish I could say that I went in and immediately started doing these character-driven stories, but the truth is, I went in and did kind of dry reporting about the shortages and about the general collapse. And I noticed that they weren\u2019t getting the pick-up that I felt they should.\u000a\u000aSo, for example, I saw that there were these shortages starting to creep into hospitals, and people weren\u2019t getting the care that they had been able to get even a few years before. And so I wrote a story saying that there were shortages in hospitals, and I don\u2019t think anybody read that story.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Nobody cared.\u000a\u000aDreier: And that was so upsetting to me, because I saw these people suffering, and it just felt like nobody cared about that. And so, the next time I wrote about hospitals, I followed one girl, who scraped her knee while she was playing, and I told the story of her parents\u2019 quest to try to get her the antibiotics that she needed to save this girl\u2019s life. And that story, which I think people could relate to, because every little kid scrapes their knee from time to time, got a huge response. And people donated money to help this family. The girl ended up in very bad shape, but as a result of reader donations, was able to get surgery.\u000a\u000aIt was just a completely different experience for me, and that showed me that without a human narrative kind of anchoring things, it\u2019s hard for people in another country to be able to imagine what\u2019s really happening.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, you had a real eye for the telling detail, too. One of your stories just blew me away, classic. You were talking about how wealthy Venezuela had been until so recently, and the sort of va-va-voom public culture, right? There was a lot of plastic surgery. Tell us about that story. The trade in boob enhancements.\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. Well, this is what\u2019s always so bizarre to me about Venezuela. There\u2019s so much suffering and poverty and misery; and at the same time, everybody is finding a way to still dye their hair and paint their nails. And so, one way I wanted to try to talk about that was by looking at plastic surgery, which is really central to Venezuelan culture. They have more beauty queens than any other country.\u000a\u000aAnd so, these women were coming in to get breast implants, but there were shortages of implants, and so they had set up this kind of Craigslist for implants, and they were trading these Chinese-made implants that are banned in the U.S., I\u2019m sure, are not allowed in most developed countries, but they\u2019d found them.\u000a\u000aAnd so, I sat in a plastic surgeon\u2019s office one day and just watched these women come in carrying their own implants that they had bought and had in little plastic bags, and they were just putting them in one after the other for $500.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, it strikes me that that is a common theme through a lot of the reporting that you did, which is the incredible resourcefulness and human ingenuity under stress as your world collapses around you. People had a never-ending ability to adapt. Their resilience, obviously, was extraordinary.\u000a\u000aYou know, how quickly did it become clear to you when, after you\u2019d moved there, that this was a society that was collapsing?\u000a\u000aDreier: I spent my first year there really trying to argue that it wasn\u2019t collapsing, because there was already this narrative that it was a dictatorship where people were starving. And that\u2019s not what I initially saw. Maduro had just won an election. It was a very polarized place, but half of the country supported him. And, people were on diets. There was a super-abundance of food.\u000a\u000aSo, I really thought that was a false narrative created by the media. I was almost like what Maduro says today; I was totally on board with that idea, that the media was whipping up a frenzy.\u000a\u000aAnd, I think it wasn\u2019t until the people in my life started to lose weight that I really realized that things had changed. And then, people that I knew started to be robbed regularly. Somebody was kidnapped. Somebody\u2019s mom was kidnapped. I was robbed. My friends were beaten up. Like, it just, it became obvious that something had really changed and we weren\u2019t in the same place anymore.\u000a\u000aGlasser: When was that? It was in 2015?\u000a\u000aDreier: This was 2015. I think that\u2019s really when the crisis started. Because when I came there, they were\u2014the government was using these high oil prices to mask a lot of the economic mismanagement that had been going on for years. And economists knew that; economists were saying, this is totally untenable, this is an economy built on price and currency distortions, but it just didn\u2019t matter, because they had more oil than anyone in the world, and oil was at $100 a barrel.\u000a\u000aAnd, when that price collapsed in 2014, it kind of sent the whole economy spinning. And since then, it\u2019s just been spinning downwards and downwards.\u000a\u000aGlasser: What\u2019s so interesting, though, is that it seems like such an outlier. You know, there are plenty of authoritarian societies in the world. There are plenty of oil-dependent authoritarian societies. Look at Russia. We were talking about Vladimir Putin and Hugo Chavez and their friendship going back all the way to the very beginning of Putin\u2019s tenure, when I actually saw, crazily enough, the two of them walking around together in Red Square\u2014not something, I must say, that\u2019s an everyday occurrence, that you run into Vladimir Putin, but this really did happen.\u000a\u000aYou know, look at how differently those two societies have ended up\u2014both authoritarian and much more authoritarian now than they were in 2001; both highly oil- and natural resource-dependent economies. Putin, if anything, has been as or more isolated politically than Venezuela, and yet, he\u2019s avoided the collapse that has occurred in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aIs Maduro just uniquely incompetent?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. I mean, it makes total sense that you saw Chavez and Putin together. Chavez in some ways has modeled himself after the same principles that hold Putin. And people in the slums in Caracas\u2014these are the people who supported Chavez, that supported Maduro\u2014they also see those parallels, and they look at places like Russia and like Cuba, and they see governments that are more in control.\u000a\u000aOne thing that people would sometimes say to me about Cuba is that they are at least, they have kind of a functioning authoritarian government. That, yes, people don\u2019t get to vote on their president, but there\u2019s no crime.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, this is more like anarchy. Is it just that the police state is not effective at being a police state?\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. One thing that people will say a lot in Venezuela is that they want mano dura, they want somebody to come\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: A strong hand.\u000a\u000aDreier: \u2014and crack down, and, yes, have a strong hand with both the criminals and with the corrupt officials.\u000a\u000aGlasser: I think this is something I\u2019ve heard a lot in Washington, as people have realized, belatedly, the scale of the crisis in Venezuela\u2014if it\u2019s a police state that doesn\u2019t work, then why is the elimination of democracy proceeding? Why aren\u2019t\u2014if these are not effective authoritarians, then why are the opposition not able to be stronger?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, because the only thing they can really crack down on well is the opposition, because they\u2019ve done a brilliant job of that. A lot of people right now in the opposition are saying all the sacrifices of the last two years were for nothing, and regret fighting so hard. They wish they\u2019d just left the country.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And we should say, they\u2019ve rounded up and arrested since this referendum the leading opposition figures and there\u2019s not really a sense that anyone is going to be able to stop Maduro from taking this next decisive step away from democratic rule.\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. Right. They\u2019ve been rounding people up. The day that Trump imposed sanctions, they took a prominent politician\u2014the person who\u2019d been the mayor of Caracas\u2014from house arrest and put him back into a military prison, as if to say, \u201cTrump, we don\u2019t care about your sanctions.\u201d And then today, for some reason, they took that same former mayor of Caracas and put him back in house arrest, just moving him around like a total political pawn to kind of flex their power.\u000a\u000aAnd that message is getting through to the opposition. These are people who\u2019ve been on the streets, really risking their lives for four months now, and they\u2019re exhausted. They get tear-gassed every day, and as far as anybody can tell, it\u2019s come to absolutely nothing. The country is more in the hands of Maduro today than it ever was.\u000a\u000aGlasser: This is an amazing story that you have to tell. So, OK, we were in 2015, and your friends were starting to lose weight, and you\u2019re realizing this is a different level of crisis now kicking in. Tell us about how you lived through it. Where did you live? How did you buy food in the store? People are carrying around literally backpacks full of cash. What was it like for you?\u000a\u000aDreier: The Venezuela story, I was living it. You never had to go and try to figure out where the crisis was. It was on your doorstep, literally. One day in 2015, I woke up to the sound of screaming outside, and I looked out and a group of men were kicking somebody who they accused of being a thief. They were doing what they call in Venezuela a \u201clynching,\u201d right outside my window. And this happened again and again.\u000a\u000aOne day this year I woke up and, again, there was screaming, and somebody had set up a barricade right outside my door, and the police were coming with tear gas.\u000a\u000aGlasser: But you were living in an apartment building in what was a middle-class neighborhood of Caracas?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. I was living in the most protected place I could find. I mean, I chose where I lived because I thought it was going to be really safe and comfortable and great. And it was for a year. And then, in 2015, I started coming home and there would be no electricity. That\u2019s when the water cuts started. And the water never came back, until the day I left I had three hours of water a day. And all of my mornings started with checking to see if there was water, and then kind of cursing under my breath when there was none.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, that\u2019s not even like, black market available, but at a price? Food was available to you at a higher price, but water you couldn\u2019t get?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. I mean, there was just no way to insulate yourself from the crisis when you were there. And the thing you really can\u2019t insulate yourself from is violence. So, I was robbed in broad daylight a couple of blocks from where I lived by two men on a motorcycle, and I kind of saw them coming and thought they might rob me, because that was happening to a lot of people at the time, and then they did. And when I told my friends about it, they were, like, \u201cOh, that was a good robbery. Nobody got hurt. That was good and simple.\u201d And so your standards just start to change.\u000a\u000aGlasser: But you adapt.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. And you don\u2019t tell the people at home what\u2019s happening because you don\u2019t want to worry your friends and family. So really, the people you\u2019re telling are other people going through the same thing, and it just becomes normalized.\u000a\u000aThe same thing happened when the secret police grabbed me one day. I was in detention for a few hours and they made all these threats\u2014like, they said they were going to slit my throat; they said they were going to keep me for weeks and weeks; they said I had to stay there until I married one of them\u2014and when I got out, I told my friends, and they thought it was super funny. So, I also started joking about it, and we got drinks, and it was just like another thing that happened.\u000a\u000aGlasser: You were relieved that they weren\u2019t kidnappers when they grabbed you off the streets?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. Well, they calculated it to be as scary as possible. They rolled up and took me right after I did an interview, and snatched my phone away, and wouldn\u2019t say where we were going or what was happening. So, I assumed it was a kidnapping, which would not have been funny. So when we passed through the gates of the secret police headquarters, I was just so relieved. It was just all uphill from there.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Yes, you know you\u2019ve lost a little perspective when it\u2019s a good thing to be detained by the secret police, right? Thank God!\u000a\u000aDreier: But, I mean, the one thing, like you say, that was very different is that I was never hungry. I mean, for me that was one of the most troubling parts of living there, because my life was so insulated from that kind of real suffering. And it\u2019s right outside the door, so I could always, if I wanted to, go and spend $25 and buy a box of Cheerios on the black market.\u000a\u000aGlasser: How did that work, the black market? Where did you go? Was there a sign?\u000a\u000aDreier: So, when I first got down to Venezuela, I was horrified because I couldn\u2019t find flour or sugar or eggs. I\u2019d wanted to make cupcakes my first day there to bring into the office, like an American treat, and I went to a bunch of supermarkets and couldn\u2019t find anything, and I started to really worry. But then, after I\u2019d been there about a month, I found the black market, and never had that problem again.\u000a\u000aThe black market operates in kind of a gray area. It\u2019s almost like a farmers market in the U.S. There are these outdoor markets where they sell produce, and then there will be kind a secret area where they\u2019re also selling a bunch of goods at illegal prices. Or, it\u2019ll be in the second floor of a market, and you have to know to go upstairs.\u000a\u000aAnd, occasionally the government will crack down and there will be a big raid and they\u2019ll confiscate all of the black-market goods and probably give them to the military to keep everyone happy. But usually it\u2019s not that hard to find things, and you can get food there, diapers, coffee, shampoo\u2014all of the things that are impossible to find in supermarkets you\u2019ll find kind of hidden beneath produce or in a little back area of the market.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Was that a dollar economy, or was everything still in\u2014\u000a\u000aDreier: It was definitely dollarized. Everybody in Venezuela has this application that tells you the black-market rate, but it\u2019s been banned so you can\u2019t get it.\u000a\u000aGlasser: It\u2019s an app?\u000a\u000aDreier: Well, we had to use an app because the government blocks the website, and Venezuelans, yeah, Venezuelans have phones, and occasionally, when the black market hits some new low, the app will send out an alert and you can see it. It\u2019s got\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: Text messaging enabled.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, yes. So, everybody will suddenly look down at their phones, and you\u2019ll know that the black-market rate just hit a thousand. And people will check it day-to-day because the inflation is moving that fast, that prices might change from the morning to night, based on that app.\u000a\u000aGlasser: That\u2019s one of the amazing things, actually, about this collapse of this modern economy in\u2014both, so quickly, but also in this technology-enhanced and enabled moment. I mean, when the Soviet Union fell apart and there were bread lines in 1991, there was no app to tell you where to go to get toilet paper or where to get bread.\u000a\u000aDid people know how to congregate at certain places because they were walking around with phones?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, that is such a unique part of this. And there\u2019s even an app for the black market in Venezuela. There\u2019s an app that will say, \u201cOh, there\u2019s milk at this one supermarket. Go get it right now.\u201d There\u2019s a few apps like that.\u000a\u000aAnd the app that matters most is Twitter. There\u2019s so little independent media in Venezuela, you can\u2019t really trust what you\u2019re reading in the newspaper or seeing on TV, and so Twitter has become incredibly important. People use it more than they use it here. And they use it as an organizing tool. So, there will be a hashtag for the day that you\u2019re supposed to go onto the street, and people will turn up based on just a Twitter invitation to go there.\u000a\u000aAnd people also circulate video on Twitter. That\u2019s how a lot of news breaks, like the political prisoners that we were talking about who were taken out of house arrest and put back into the military prison. That all broke on Twitter. Their wives took Twitter video of them being detained and posted it, and immediately the whole country knew, because that\u2019s how people are communicating now.\u000a\u000aPeople also use Twitter to try to find medicine, so you\u2019ll often see posts, like, \u201cMy son has epilepsy. He\u2019s been having seizures for five days. If we don\u2019t get this specific drug in this amount, he might die.\u201d And that will race around Twitter and people will often be able to find the medicine that they need.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And the government doesn\u2019t block Twitter?\u000a\u000aDreier: Twitter has sometimes gone down in a suspicious way. During a big protest, it\u2019ll be hard to get on social media.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Do they use it themselves, though? Do they also try to control the narrative?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. So, they use Twitter to issue almost every statement. They use Twitter kind of like Trump does, like that\u2019s where government news breaks, also. And they have a whole army of Twitter-bots, which are these fake accounts that they control that will generate hashtags. So, the leading hashtag in Venezuela is always some pro-government slogan, like Venezuela against imperialism. And if you do something on social media that the government doesn\u2019t like, they might sic their Twitter army on you.\u000a\u000aSo, this has happened to me, where you\u2019ve run a story that\u2019s not favorable to the government, and suddenly you\u2019re getting spammed by all of these different accounts saying the exact same thing.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, it\u2019s both sides, but for the opposition, Twitter is crucial, because without it, they couldn\u2019t organize. For the government, they already have the TV stations, the newspapers, they have everything, and they also have social media?\u000a\u000aDreier: Right.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And in fact, certainly Chavez was famous for his use of TV and, like, talking for literally like six hours at a time on his talk show, and things like that.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes. And when he does that\u2014Maduro now does that also\u2014they force every station to carry it. They call it\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: But he\u2019s not as good at it as Chavez, right? I wish our listeners could see the very funny smile on your face.\u000a\u000aDreier: I would never want to compete with Chavez either, as far as being fun to watch, but\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: He was more Trumpian, Chavez.\u000a\u000aDreier: I mean, the man knew how to entertain on TV, and would sometimes find myself just going down these YouTube rabbit holes watching his old TV shows, because he has a saying for everything. Any story you were writing, Chavez had talked about it, probably for five hours, on a TV show at some point. So, that was kind of our go-to.\u000a\u000aLike, the government would never give us any official comment on anything, but you could always count on something Chavez had said being there in the archives. And, people who are loyal to the government, they get their news from television.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, Maduro was playing from the same playbook, even though he wasn\u2019t quite at that same kind of communicator?\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. So, Maduro\u2019s main claim to legitimacy is that he\u2019s Chavez\u2019s handpicked successor, and people still love Chavez, despite everything that\u2019s happened. He was the first politician to really bring the poor into\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: Even now?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, yes. I mean, not as much. I think there was a point where almost everybody in the country was pro-Chavez, and in 2014, people would still cry when you asked about Chavez. They would say, \u201cI loved him like a father,\u201d and they would be crying.\u000a\u000aAt this point, people still have photos of him their homes. People are very reluctant to speak ill of him because he championed the poor in a way that had never happened before, in this very rich country. But nobody loves Maduro. And, to watch Maduro try to be Chavez is often very painful.\u000a\u000aA lot of people think that the country actually would have fared better had Chavez lived, because Maduro has never changed a policy that Chavez implemented, even when it seemed like he really had to, just to save the economy from spinning out. He\u2019s only ever doubled down on things that Chavez put in place.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Right. So, he doesn\u2019t have the legitimacy or the standing to have the flexibility to actually govern the country?\u000a\u000aDreier: Exactly. Chavez was very flexible. He changed ideology. He didn\u2019t start out as a socialist. And he also devalued the currency a few times, which is one of the main things economists say needs to happen. Maduro\u2019s never devalued the currency. So, when I first got down there, the official currency rate was 6.3, so you need 6.3 bolivars to buy a dollar, and the black-market rate was 63, so that was a distortion.\u000a\u000aBut now, the official rate is 10 and the black-market rate is 10,000. That\u2019s what happens, one of the things that happens when you never devalue your currency.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, that spiral, which took the form of out-of-control inflation and the black market rising and people not having enough to eat as a result of an economic policy that just couldn\u2019t keep pace with it\u2014it seems like it started to go bad in 2015, but it really was last year that this full-scale collapse, implosion of the Venezuelan economy took place.\u000a\u000aWhat was that like? What are key moments that you remember?\u000a\u000aDreier: I mean, you saw it even just with the currency. Last year, I went through four wallets because I had to carry around so much cash. I kept busting wallets. And finally I realized, no, I just have to carry around these huge bricks of cash, and I got a tote bag and started carrying them that way.\u000a\u000aBut, there were days where I would go to lunch and I would have a full bag, like a full paper bag that you would use to carry your groceries home, just filled with the highest denomination note, filled with hundreds, and nobody would count it. I would just hand over that big bag and somebody would take it as payment for lunch, because nobody wanted to deal with that. And how could you, anyway? It would take a half hour to count all that money.\u000a\u000aAnd then\u2014this is the most irresponsible thing I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014there was a day last year where the government invalidated that bank note, the hundred bolivar, which is all people were using at that point. There was no sense using anything lower than that because it was like a fraction of a fraction of a penny, so people were only using hundred bolivar notes, and we all had hoarded supplies.\u000a\u000aAnd the government said, \u201cYou know what? Today you can\u2019t use that anymore. It has no value.\u201d And they didn\u2019t issue a new note. So there were three days where you couldn\u2019t pay for anything, and that day I needed to take a taxi, but I couldn\u2019t. I needed to recharge my phone; I needed to put some more minutes on it\u2014I couldn\u2019t. Nobody could go out to eat. And there were riots. There was a riot in one city that destroyed more than a hundred stores, because people couldn\u2019t buy anything, and so they just went out and started taking things.\u000a\u000aAnd finally, after three days the government sent the military out to pacify the country, and said, "OK, fine. You can use your hundred bolivar notes again.\u201d But, I mean, the whole country just ground to a halt for no reason.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, that sort of tends to shore up your incompetence theory of the case. It\u2019s hard to see a more in-control police state or authoritarian making a move like that.\u000a\u000aDreier: Right. So, that\u2019s when people start to say, \u201cNo, just take control\u2014mano dura\u2014just please let me live in a semi-functional place,\u201d and people become OK with giving away a lot of freedom.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, what stories did you find it hardest to tell? What are the stories that you would tell your friends, but you couldn\u2019t really get into the AP?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll tell you that when we came out of Russia, for sure the persistence of corruption at all levels in society, I think, was something we felt like we had really failed to adequately capture for readers in the Washington Post. It sort of defied our norms of how do you report and write about something, and verify it? And yet, that\u2019s the thing that people themselves would tell stories about, you know, the cop at every street corner who demanded money; the commonality with which people accepted the role of the state itself in this corruption. But it was really hard for us, as journalists, to write about it.\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, I totally know what you\u2019re talking about. If I had a magic lamp and I would make three wishes, it would be to be able to expose the corruption that\u2019s rocked Venezuela. There\u2019s been so much money stolen, billions of dollars, and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m sure a lot of it is in Swiss bank accounts and in Panama.\u000a\u000aI did one story recently that tracked the way that the military is profiteering from food. So, the military controls the entire food chain, and we were able to report that generals\u2014really, from generals all the way down to cadets, people are stealing food or making false contracts and basically just skimming money that should be going to feed people.\u000a\u000aAnd, I was happy about that, because I think it helped show part of why there is so much hunger, and why the military is so loyal still to this government that nobody else seems to like, you know, because a lot of people are getting rich. But that\u2019s just a tiny part of the corruption, and I hope somebody, and somebody listening to this, somebody one day is going to figure out what happened. But nobody so far has been able to crack that.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, we\u2019ve talked a lot about what the incredible risks were for you of living there and telling this story. A lot of people also took risks in order to help you chronicle the story of this, and of course, they live there. They don\u2019t get to leave at the end of the day. How risky was it for people to cooperate with an American reporter as this was happening?\u000a\u000aDreier: Oh, it was so dangerous for them, and they were so incredibly brave to work with us. People really put everything on the line, especially the doctors, because journalists are banned from hospitals right now, and doctors would help me get into their hospitals. They would walk me past military guards, knowing that if those guards found out who I was, their careers would be over.\u000a\u000aAnd they would open up medical cabinets; they would take us around wards and show us all the people who were dying of\u2014you know, who were really not going to make it because of things like antibiotic shortages. And some of those people did face repercussions because of the work they did with us.\u000a\u000aOne young doctor who helped me on a story had to go into hiding in Colombia; one was beat up. It\u2019s hard enough to be working within an institution in Venezuela right now, to go that extra step and talk with a journalist is, for me, one of the bravest things you can do.\u000a\u000aAnd we saw it in hospitals; we saw it in schools. A principal let me shadow a teenager in her school for a week, and after that the secret police came and visited her and threatened her, and tried to get her to sabotage the story, and she refused.\u000a\u000aI think for Venezuelans it feels like there\u2019s not a lot they can do. Going to the streets hasn\u2019t helped. They voted for opposition lawmakers two years ago, and that didn\u2019t help. One thing I think a lot of people are doing is trying to help journalists, and it\u2019s so important.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, you were pretty brave yourself, too.\u000a\u000aNow, we have had a great conversation about this important work that you\u2019ve been doing. I have to ask you, because I have no idea what the answer is, but, now that you\u2019re back from Venezuela, your parents must have been just worried sick. Did you tell them these stories? Are they going to listen to our podcast and hear some of this for the first time?\u000a\u000aDreier: Yes, I think that a lot of people are having an impact, but also seem to be worrying about me more now. I feel like I also am in a similar position, where when I was in Venezuela I didn\u2019t really let myself feel how dangerous it was, and I was kind of just always ignoring my gut, and telling myself not to think about what could happen, and it became just this automatic thing for me.\u000a\u000aAnd, now that I\u2019m back, I feel like kind of horrified, and I think it\u2019s the same for people who were in my life who\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: You\u2019ll be processing this for a while.\u000a\u000aDreier: Maybe.\u000a\u000aGlasser: What is the biggest myth or thing that people get wrong, you find, now that you\u2019re back in the United States? What don\u2019t they get about what\u2019s happening in Venezuela?\u000a\u000aDreier: People keep saying things to me, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s the beginning of the end in Venezuela,\u201d or, \u201cWow, we\u2019re going to see a change in Venezuela soon.\u201d People seem to think that it can\u2019t go on like this because it\u2019s just so awful it can\u2019t possibly go on. And my experience down there has, if it\u2019s taught me one thing, it\u2019s taught me things can always get worse, and worse, and worse, and there\u2019s no rule that says that a miserable situation has to end, just because it\u2019s too miserable.\u000a\u000aSo, I mean, it\u2019s so hard to have an optimistic message about Venezuela, but I don\u2019t think that it just necessarily has to change now that it\u2019s become so undemocratic and people are starving. I mean, it can go on for a while like this.\u000a\u000aGlasser: This is Hannah Dreier, and I\u2019m Susan Glasser, and this has been a really powerful and important conversation about a story that we haven\u2019t paid enough attention to here in the United States.

aVJudges fear courts becoming a battleground on which Brexit will be fought | Oli Scarff/Getty Images Brexit Files Insight Courts fear return of \u2018Enemies of the people\u2019 hysteria Senior UK judge speaks out on the role of the ECJ after Brexit.\u000a\u000aRemember the British front pages back in November?\u000a\u000aThree High Court judges were branded \u201cEnemies of the People\u201d by the Daily Mail for interpreting British law and ruling that parliament, not the prime minister, had the authority to trigger Article 50 and officially start the Brexit process.\u000a\u000aIt seems a long time ago, a time when emotions were running extremely high over Brexit. The Mail\u2019s front page ended up being a high-water mark of post-referendum hysteria.\u000a\u000aIts attack on the independent judiciary, with its populist-authoritarian undertones, was widely condemned.\u000a\u000aBut it was with one eye on such sinister precedents that Lord Neuberger, president of the Supreme Court, spoke out about the role of the ECJ in British law after Brexit.\u000a\u000aHis chief criticism of the government is a lack of clarity. Despite all the sound and fury about ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit, the government\u2019s Repeal Bill actually allows for its past case law to still hold sway in British court judgements. The British courts will have the final say, so technically the U.K. is \u201ctaking back control,\u201d but the legislation is quite hazy about when and how European case law should be taken into account. A court may do so if it thinks it appropriate, but it doesn\u2019t have to.\u000a\u000aNeuberger\u2019s concern appears to be that the government is passing the buck \u2014 and in doing so, exposing judges to the same kind of furious attack that came their way over the Article 50 case.\u000a\u000aImagine the scenario: A group of workers take their company to court over a contentious issue of employment law. The Daily Mail and many Tory MPs think the company is well within its rights, but the judge, citing European case law, rules in favor of the workers. Imagine dozens of such cases, making the news month after month.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a scenario Neuberger seems eager to avoid \u2014 parliament is sovereign and should make a call, he said. \u201cIf the U.K. parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so. If it says we shouldn\u2019t then we won\u2019t. Basically we will do what the statute says.\u201d\u000a\u000aOtherwise, the courts risk becoming battlegrounds on which Brexit will continue to be fought, even after it has happened.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2018s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVSusan Rice wrote that President Donald Trump "is issuing an empty threat of nuclear war" or "actually intends war next time Mr. Kim behaves provocatively." | AP Photo Ex-national security adviser Rice: Trump's North Korea bombast is 'folly'\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that North Korea must not be allowed to obtain nuclear missiles capable of threatening the continental United States has the potential to lead the U.S. and its allies into a costly war that could leave millions dead, former national security adviser Susan Rice wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Thursday.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea reportedly already possesses such weapons, Rice wrote. \u201cThe challenge is to ensure that it would never try\u201d using them, she added.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBombastic, bellicose rhetoric from the North Korean regime of Kim Jong Un is nothing new, Rice noted, but she said the president\u2019s willingness to respond with bombast of his own has added a dangerous element to the equation. Trump said Tuesday that North Korea risked \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d if it continued its threatening behavior.\u000a\u000a\u201cEither Mr. Trump is issuing an empty threat of nuclear war, which will further erode American credibility and deterrence, or he actually intends war next time Mr. Kim behaves provocatively,\u201d Rice, who also served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, wrote in the Times. \u201cThe first scenario is folly, but a United States decision to start a pre-emptive war on the Korean Peninsula, in the absence of an imminent threat, would be lunacy.\u201d\u000a\u000aInsisting that North Korea never obtain nuclear weapons capable of threatening the U.S. mainland need not be a prerequisite for homeland security, Rice argued. Instead, she said, a strategy of preventing North Korea from ever using its weapons could avoid a military conflict that could put the lives millions of South Koreans, Japanese and U.S. service members stationed in the region at risk.\u000a\u000aSuch an approach was panned Thursday morning by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Trump's rhetoric was "probably necessary" and said of former government officials now critical of Trump, "when it was their turn to deal with North Korea, they failed miserably. There\u2019s no place for him to kick the can down the road.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWar is not necessary to achieve prevention, despite what some in the Trump administration seem to have concluded,\u201d Rice wrote. Instead, she prescribed a path that includes refusing to legitimize North Korea as a nuclear power, stopping bombastic rhetoric from the U.S., improving missile defense systems, tightening sanctions on the Kim regime even further and engaging in renewed negotiations with China and North Korea on ways to \u201cverifiably limit or eliminate North Korea\u2019s arsenal.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHistory shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea \u2014 the same way we tolerated the far greater threat of thousands of Soviet nuclear weapons during the Cold War,\u201d she wrote.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe independents are banding together.\u000a\u000aThat is, 13 independent candidates who feel they don\u2019t fit in the Republican Party in the age of Donald Trump are joining forces with a few registered Democrats, all looking at runs for governor and Senate in 2018. The plan is to create shared infrastructure and funding for a slate of campaigns around the country, in the hopes of making this more than the latest go-nowhere whining about how awful the two-party system is.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut with a historically unpopular Republican president in the White House and a Democratic Party in epic disarray, they think this is actually their moment.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, leaning hard into the symbolism of declaring their independence, the group\u2014put together by the Centrist Project, founded by Charles Wheelan, an academic at Dartmouth\u2014will meet at the Union League in downtown Philadelphia for a weekend-long mini-convention. They\u2019ll get briefings on campaign mechanics and polling. They\u2019ll get a rundown on potential staff hires and interested donors. A member of En Marche, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, will do a briefing on how a party that didn\u2019t exist a year ago won the presidency and now a majority in the National Assembly. Two prominent former Republican operatives\u2014Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign, and Reed Galen, who worked on both Bush campaigns and was John McCain\u2019s 2008 deputy campaign manager\u2014will weigh in with advice.\u000a\u000aThe model, they hope: Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, a lifelong Republican who quit the party two months before the 2014 election, picked a Democrat as his lieutenant governor/running mate, and squeaked out a win against the Republican incumbent. Walker recently announced he\u2019s running for reelection, and he says he never looked back at his decision to leave the GOP\u2014and that was before Trump split the party with a working-class message and heretical stances on entitlement programs, trade and basic decorum.\u000a\u000aBeing an independent has its advantages, Walker says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf a candidate comes up and says, \u2018I\u2019m a Republican' or \u2018I\u2019m a Democrat,\u2019 people know within probably 70 percent of where they stand. With an independent, it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, tell me about yourself,\u2019\u201d Walker told me during an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast. But, he allows, \u201cthose that are running as independent have to work a little harder. We have to be a little bit more creative and figure out how to get it done.\u201d\u000a\u000aTerry Hayes, Maine\u2019s state treasurer, who\u2019s already declared she\u2019s running for governor, will be in Philadelphia, getting tips. So will Greg Orman, who fell short in an independent bid against Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts in 2014 and is expected to run for governor next year, as well as Evan McMullin, the former Republican House aide who\u2019s expected to follow his independent run for president last year with a Senate run in Utah against Orrin Hatch.\u000a\u000aJoel Searby, the senior strategist for the Centrist Project, helped recruit several of the candidates. Others attending who are just shy of declaring, he says, include two former Navy SEALs, three potential self-funders coming out of financial services who\u2019ve floated spending a million each of their own money (one has floated spending up to $5 million, he says), a former state party chair, a former big-city mayor and a former congressman.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re committed to running as independents for the reasons of disrupting and changing the political system, not because they\u2019re on the fringe,\u201d Searby says. \u201cWhen they start to see that there is not only a viable plan\u2014a business plan, a fundraising plan, but also a serious network of people\u2014that\u2019s when you can see the light bulbs go off.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are plans for a centrist state-legislator slate in Colorado, to build off the handful of already affiliated state legislators, like Iowa state Sen. David Johnson, who represents the third most Republican district in the state, but after 17 years as a GOP official and endorsing Carly Fiorina last year, announced that Trump had chased him out of the party. Now, he rails against his old party for having no answers for why tax cuts don\u2019t actually do a better job of spurring economic growth, or for why the local rivers and lakes keep getting dirtier.\u000a\u000aClick here to subscribe to the full podcast, to hear Walker talk about the last time he saw Sarah Palin, standing in the middle of a river at age 12 when an earthquake destroyed his hometown and what his meetings during Energy Week at the White House were like.\u000a\u000aWalker has his own list of complaints with the Republican Party. He first ran for governor in 2010 as a Republican out of frustration, he says, with the constraints on energy development he was dealing with as a lawyer in private practice. But he likes what is coming out of the Trump White House on energy now, even as he\u2019s doing his own state-level work toward the Paris accord. And as for people who question climate change, from his perch in Alaska, he says, \u201cit\u2019s real because we\u2019re seeing it\u201d\u2014just look at the entire villages the state has had to pick up and move.\u000a\u000aThe independents are sensitive to becoming spoilers, throwing races without getting into office to make changes\u2014precisely what Dowd thinks might have happened if he\u2019d gotten into the race next year against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, as some wanted him to. \u201cThe greatest barrier right now to this is not money, not tactics. The greatest barrier is psychological,\u201d Dowd says. \u201cIf you can break that by winning some races, then I think the media starts covering it more.\u201d\u000a\u000aSearby has a memo he circulates to statewide recruits, pushing them on the size and wealth of their personal networks and hiring general consultants to help them build campaign plans. He has a growing Google spreadsheet of staffers who are ready to sign on as managers and finance directors, and another of national donors he thinks will be open to supporting individual campaigns, in addition to helping them meet their $10 million goal for the 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4), super PAC and corporation they\u2019ve already set up in their \u201cmothership model.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Centrist Project has already raised $750,000 for initial operating expenses, and it has started conversations with people like Michael Slaby, chief technology officer of the 2008 Obama campaign, about building digital resources.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re convinced technology is the answer, that it\u2019s enabled a different kind of politics to more easily puncture the public consciousness. But Macron\u2019s success in France was about the collapse of existing parties and the creation of a new one, not a loose affiliation of people who didn\u2019t like existing parties but were really good on social media and email. They like to talk about a \u201cFulcrum Strategy\u201d of having a few members in the Senate who could swing close votes\u2014a tantalizing possibility in the wake of Obamacare repeal failing by a single vote\u2014but some offer a confused vision that imagines Bernie Sanders joining with centrists just because he\u2019s an independent, rather than a perhaps more realistic scenario in which a centrist bloc attracts people like Maine\u2019s Angus King and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski to force compromises.\u000a\u000aGalen, who unregistered as a Republican after Trump won the nomination, argued that the chaos and the mess in Congress of the president\u2019s first six months have opened the window for independents even more widely than in November. \u201cThe American electorate keeps beating Washington over the head with a frying pan and saying, \u2018We don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing!\u2019 But they keep doing it anyway,\u201d Galen says.\u000a\u000aWalker, meanwhile, has been dealing with the reality of being in office. He\u2019s fought with the legislature in Juneau over the budget. He\u2019s struggled with plummeting oil prices. He\u2019s managed a contorted relationship with Sarah Palin\u2014she endorsed him over her former lieutenant governor, who\u2019d become governor when she quit abruptly, but they clearly don\u2019t get along (\u201cI was looking for results and not just attention,\u201d Walker says).\u000a\u000aEvery version of every argument over the viability of independents cites declining major-party registration among young people, the growing suspicion of institutions\u2014and, increasingly, Trump. But the results have been paltry. Last year, a dozen unaffiliated candidates ran in Alaska\u2014double the numbers in previous cycles\u2014but only two were elected to the state House of Representatives. Testament, perhaps, to the enduring power of the two major parties, however unpopular they might be.\u000a\u000aBut Walker thinks he\u2019s helped show other independents around the country how it can be done. \u201cI think they may have seen the path, perhaps that they don\u2019t have to necessarily fit into a particular box,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can just be themselves and get elected.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Politics\u000a\u000aOff Message

aVLONDON \u2014 Theresa May has ordered a Brexit charm offensive at home and abroad, coordinated by a new Whitehall team drawn from David Davis\u2019 Brexit department and Boris Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office.\u000a\u000aThe new \u201cengagement unit\u201d will exploit the U.K.\u2019s network of European ambassadors in an attempt to directly explain the U.K.\u2019s Brexit strategy to government officials, businesses and other \u201cstakeholders\u201d in EU capitals, while also engaging with key interest groups at home, government officials familiar with the strategy told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aIt follows a direct \u201cedict\u201d from the prime minister herself for the U.K. to redouble efforts to \u201cget the message out,\u201d one senior U.K. official said.\u000a\u000aLondon has become increasingly sensitive to accusations that Whitehall is underprepared for Brexit. The communications strategy, which hitherto saw the government keep many aspects of its Brexit plan a closely-guarded secret, has allowed the EU side to fill the void and frame the debate, senior officials now believe.\u000a\u000aThe change in approach is also symptomatic of an opening up of communications under the new team in No. 10 Downing Street following the June 8 election. Prior to the election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May lost her majority, the prime minster\u2019s two co-chiefs of staff ran a very tight operation which controlled communication across all government departments. Both were forced to resign in the wake of the election campaign and May\u2019s new team has made deliberate efforts to make government more open.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is about making the most effective use of specialist knowledge across both departments\u201d \u2014 DExEU spokesperson\u000a\u000aThe strategy will particularly focus on EU capitals, ahead of a crucial European Council summit in October that will decide whether negotiations can progress to the next stage and discussions of the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs we approach the next stage of negotiations \u2014 discussing our future relationship with the EU once we\u2019ve left \u2014 we want to ramp up the communications work, campaigns and stakeholder engagement that will enable the government to communicate its messages effectively in EU member states as well as at home,\u201d a spokesperson from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said.\u000a\u000a\u201cStaff from DExEU and FCO are working together to deliver this. This is about making the most effective use of specialist knowledge across both departments.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Special partnership\u2019 with EU\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s network of ambassadors in the EU27 capitals, who are coordinated from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) led by Johnson, had been underused in the Brexit process so far, the first official said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmbassadors know who to talk to and how to talk to them, but they have been a relatively untapped resource \u2026 They can have more influence than an opinion piece by a minister in a newspaper,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aWith the role of the EU member countries in the Brexit negotiations about to become critical when leaders of the EU27 and Theresa May meet for the October European summit, British officials are conscious of the need to reassure May\u2019s counterparts that the U.K. wants a good economic outcome for both sides and a close relationship with the EU after Brexit.\u000a\u000aMay\u2019s Article 50 letter from March called for a \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d with the EU and \u201ca fair settlement of the U.K.\u2019s rights and obligations as a departing member state.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe new Whitehall unit will ensure ambassadors and their teams are fully briefed on Brexit plans and empowered to reach out to their opposite numbers and other key influencers.\u000a\u000aTheir task will be made easier after the U.K. publishes up to 12 position papers, expected in the coming weeks, on crucial aspects of its EU strategy \u2014 part of what officials are calling a \u201cbig push\u201d to firm up and publicize the Brexit plan.\u000a\u000aRobin Niblett, director of the London-based foreign policy think tank Chatham House, said that the U.K. had neglected diplomacy in European capitals in recent years, and welcomed the move toward deeper engagement ahead of Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cDuring the last big push for \u2018Global Britain,\u2019 prior to Brexit, the government raised the number of British diplomats in India, China, the Gulf, while cutting back some of the human capacity in European capitals. Now the government is having to do some re-engineering to bring back that capability to prepare for the pointy end of the Brexit negotiation,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the government has to be clear that we are negotiating with Brussels and that we do have clear ideas on everything from fisheries to farming to air traffic control, and on the whole negotiating position with the EU, right down to granular details.\u201d\u000a\u000aVictory for Whitehall\u000a\u000aThe formation of the new unit is in part a victory for senior DExEU official Alex Ellis, a former ambassador to Brazil and European Commission staffer, who has long argued for greater openness and engagement over Brexit, according to the first official.\u000a\u000aEllis, who previously worked in the office of former European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, became a director general at DExEU in January. His push, supported by others within the Brexit department, for officials to have more contact with external parties such as foreign governments, businesses, and the media fell foul of No. 10\u2019s tight communications management prior to the June general election, the official said.\u000a\u000aA third former Whitehall official also said that the ambassador network had been under-used, and unable to feed into the Brexit strategy with political intelligence from EU27 capitals because of the closed-shop nature of Downing Street prior to June\u2019s general election.\u000a\u000aMay\u2019s civil service restructure following the June 2016 EU referendum result \u2014 which created DExEU and sidelined Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office \u2014 was seen as a mistake by many senior officials at the time, the ex-official said.

aVTrump says he will declare opioid crisis a \u2018national emergency\u2019 'We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis,' Trump said Thursday.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump said he\u2019s drafting paperwork to declare the opioid crisis a "national emergency" just days after administration officials downplayed the need for such a declaration.\u000a\u000aTrump made the announcement Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"I'm saying officially right now, it is an emergency. It is a national emergency," Trump said, according to a White House press pool report. "We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis."\u000a\u000aTrump was briefed on the epidemic Tuesday by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who told reporters at the time that the administration believed the crisis could be effectively addressed without the declaration of an emergency. Trump vowed his administration would beat the epidemic by beefing up law enforcement and strengthening security on the southern border to stop illegal drugs from entering the country.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, he seemed to change his mind.\u000a\u000aThe emergency declaration, first recommended last week by the White House Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, enables the federal government to quickly free up funds to respond to the epidemic. It also allows Trump to say he's fulfilling a promise to combat opioid misuse that he made as a presidential candidate.\u000a\u000aTrump handily won states like West Virginia and Kentucky that have been hit hard by the epidemic.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s announcement comes just as new federal data shows drug overdose deaths are on the rise, despite federal and state efforts to curb the crisis. In the first nine months of 2016, the National Center for Health Statistics estimates drug overdose death hit a record 19.9 per 100,000 people \u2014 up from 16.7 for the same time period in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe opioid commission also recommended loosening decade-old Medicaid restrictions to increase access to inpatient substance abuse treatment and helping states strengthen prescription drug monitoring programs intended to weed out doctor shopping and improper prescribing.\u000a\u000aIt's unclear whether Trump plans to accept those recommendations. The president's rhetoric on the opioid epidemic has largely focused on a law-and-order approach. He has not addressed increased access to treatment programs that health experts and some public officials, including those on his commission, say are necessary to get the drug epidemic under control.\u000a\u000aState health officials have also expressed concern about the president's emphasis on law enforcement.\u000a\u000a"We can\u2019t jail our way out of this,\u201d said Rahul Gupta, health commissioner for West Virginia, the state with the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the country. \u201cThis is a chronic public health disaster.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven law enforcement officials say they have told the president to focus not only on the criminal justice aspect of addressing the drug crisis, but to support a more comprehensive strategy involving public health and education departments as well.\u000a\u000a"We want to encourage the president to focus on an all-encompassing strategy instead of starting with law enforcement as the solution," National Sheriffs Association Executive Director Jonathan Thompson said.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVHalfway through Year One of the Trump presidency, the Democratic base is energized. Its voters are showing up at rallies, crowding town hall forums, self-organizing into local groups and scaring Republican incumbents: If Democrats turn out to vote in the 2018 midterms at the same levels they have in 2017\u2019s special elections, the party will pick up 80 seats in the U.S. House.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s one problem for the Democrats: The party has a serious fundraising crisis.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOver the first six months of 2017, the Republican National Committee pulled in $75 million\u2014nearly twice as much money as the Democratic National Committee, which raised $38 million. The predicament isn\u2019t simply that there is a funding gap between the parties; it\u2019s what kind of money they attract. Republicans have quietly taken a decisive edge over Democrats when it comes to small-dollar fundraising.\u000a\u000aDuring that same six-month time span, the RNC raised $33 million in small contributions\u2014money from people who donate $200 or less over an election cycle\u2014while that same class of donors gave the DNC just $21 million.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t just about money. Small-dollar donors are an important measure of how much grass-roots enthusiasm a campaign or organization has. They are the supporters who will show up to knock on doors, make phone calls and get out the vote. And since they don\u2019t donate enough to reach campaigns\u2019 individual contribution limits, you can return to ask them for money time and again\u2014which frees campaigns from continually being on the hunt for new, deep-pocketed donors who can max out. The lack of their support threatens to prevent major gains by the party in 2018 and beyond.\u000a\u000aHow did this happen?\u000a\u000aAs one of the people who led Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 fundraising operation during the 2016 primaries, I watched Donald Trump\u2019s campaign take many of our ideas and duplicate them, employing language and tactics nearly identical to those we used on the Sanders campaign. What we found to be most powerful wasn\u2019t just hiring the right people or using the right technology. What mattered more was figuring out an empowering message of hope and reaching people with it. In the Trump era, the Democratic Party has sputtered along with fundraising appeals focused on scare tactics\u2014understandable, but counterproductive. Meanwhile, Trump\u2014a billionaire who is already president\u2014is still winning grass-roots donors by offering his supporters an empowering message.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aFor years, Democrats were thought of as the standard-bearers of grass-roots fundraising, especially in the digital era. During the 2004 primaries, Howard Dean\u2019s campaign pioneered presidential campaigns\u2019 potential to both raise and rely on small-dollar online donations by focusing on a people-powered message and grass-roots campaign operation. In 2008, Barack Obama improved on that model, setting records for small contributions\u2014which he broke and reset time and again throughout his presidency. Even as recently as the 2016 primaries, Bernie Sanders led all opponents in both major parties in small-dollar fundraising, outpacing any other primary candidate in history.\u000a\u000aThen came Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, his campaign raised more than $281 million from grass-roots donors\u2014an amount surpassed only by President Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, which pulled in $329 million from small donations. But whereas donors who gave $200 or less comprised roughly 30 percent of the overall amount raised for Obama\u2019s campaigns, small donors provided more than 53 percent of Trump\u2019s campaign money, compared with just 21 percent for Hillary Clinton. Trump\u2019s success here is even more impressive than it might seem at first glance: He didn\u2019t start actively fundraising from grass-roots supporters until June 2016, giving him just five months to establish a small-dollar fundraising machine that went toe-to-toe with those that Obama, Clinton, and Sanders each took at least a year to build.\u000a\u000aMost small-dollar contributions for political campaigns come from online fundraising, with money donated in response to fundraising emails making up a near-majority of those totals. On Sanders\u2019 campaign, nearly half of the $218 million we raised online came directly from fundraising emails.\u000a\u000aSanders\u2019 supporters embraced the idea that the only path to success in the primary was if people came together to build the campaign themselves. Nearly 3 million people made more than 8 million contributions to the Sanders campaign because they correctly believed there were no millionaires, billionaires or super PACs behind the effort\u2014nobody who would step in to save the campaign in a rough patch. We would sink or swim together, at an average contribution of (as you know if you ever heard Bernie speak) $27 apiece.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a simple principle, one that Democratic candidates from Bernie to Elizabeth Warren to Obama understood, but which the institutional Democratic Party now seems incapable of grasping: People are motivated to act when they feel like part of something larger than themselves\u2014and when they understand that their participation in that larger something makes a real difference. The Democratic Party\u2019s woes are basic symptoms of the failure to understand that immutable reality.\u000a\u000aIn his own way, Trump has consistently embraced this same sentiment in messages to supporters. He\u2019s become a more prolific small-dollar fundraiser than any Democrat precisely because he\u2019s using empowering, movement-based language that specifically prioritizes small donations and treats online communications as relationships, not transactions. His campaign\u2019s emails specifically speak about the idea that Trump can\u2019t be successful on his own\u2014that success is only possible if his supporters are with him.\u000a\u000aTake his campaign\u2019s February 2017 email with the subject line, \u201cI can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d \u201cWe need to stay focused on getting the job done and accomplishing our shared goal to Make America Great Again!\u201d read the message from Trump. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do it alone. I need you by my side, supporting our message and doing your part to get the truth to the American voter.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump echoes the Sanders campaign\u2019s frequent tactic of talking about the number of contributions being as important as the amount of money raised by the campaign. \u201cThe strength of our political revolution is not about how much money we raise,\u201d read a Sanders campaign email ahead of the final fundraising deadline in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s about how many contributions our supporters have made to power this movement.\u201d Ahead of the June 2017 fundraising deadline, the RNC sent an email signed by Trump that had some familiar language. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how much our supporters give,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about how many patriots stepped up in solidarity with our movement.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome of the Sanders campaign\u2019s most effective fundraising emails were ones that highlighted specific small-dollar donors\u2014like, for instance, a note from a small-dollar donor explaining why they contributed. It gave our supporters a sense that they mattered to us and reminded them that working people formed the backbone of our efforts. Trump did the same, once writing to supporters that \u201cI want you to see this message I got from one of our strongest donors.\u201d Trump included a quote from a woman named Vonnie who contributed $6, and said that \u201cher $6 contribution was a BIG sacrifice.\u201d You feel motivated, part of something bigger than yourself.\u000a\u000aCompare that approach to the one the DNC has taken in the Trump era. Most of the party\u2019s recent emails to supporters focus on simply opposing the GOP health care bill, using subject lines like \u201cTell the GOP to back off!\u201d and \u201cTell Senate Republicans to show us the bill.\u201d Another significant portion of the party\u2019s emails are about Trump\u2019s Russia connections. \u201cBREAKING: Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s emails,\u201d reads one DNC fundraising email. Another asks readers to \u201cdemand answers\u201d about Trump\u2019s connections to Russia\u2014answers from no one in particular.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s nothing wrong with talking about issues in emails\u2014in fact, it can really motivate supporters. But without a positive context, the overall picture one gets from the DNC\u2019s emails is of a directionless, reflexive party that fails to ask Democratic supporters to do more than oppose Republicans, let alone work for a different vision for the future of the country.\u000a\u000aNowhere is this messaging problem more apparent than in the emails being sent out by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s arm that focuses on races for the U.S. House. The DCCC has perfected a relentless digital program that seeks to squeeze every cent out of its email list. It even outraised the DNC online. But the DCCC\u2019s email tactics can be described as dishonest at best and will almost certainly be unsustainable for the party\u2019s long-term grass-roots fundraising base.\u000a\u000aYou can set your watch to the worst of the DCCC\u2019s fundraising tactics. In the early afternoon of the last day of every month, the committee sends a fundraising email to its list that screams \u201cFINAL NOTICE\u201d in its subject line and content. The effect is to shock people into opening the message out of fear that they've missed a payment or that they might have their power shut off.\u000a\u000aOther DCCC emails cause messaging whiplash. In the week before the June special election in Georgia featuring Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff, the DCCC sent a fundraising email with the subject line \u201cJON OSSOFF LOSES!\u201d \u2026 followed by another email four hours later with the subject line \u201cOssoff DOMINATES!\u201d Ossoff\u2019s campaign used nearly identical tactics itself. Just two days before the election, it sent a fundraising email to supporters with the subject line, \u201cAccept defeat. Jon Ossoff lost. It\u2019s over.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe effect of these tactics is to shock, depress or shame people into action. It\u2019s the opposite of empowering. They use it because it works, at least initially\u2014the DCCC is beating its own fundraising records, and Ossoff raised an unprecedented amount of money for a House race, with two-thirds coming from small-dollar donors. But while this strategy raises money in the short term, a party can\u2019t build a future by telling supporters hour after hour that the sky is falling. It\u2019s bad for the candidates, bad for the party, and, most vitally, bad for the voters whose support they need to build up.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also harmful to the Democratic Party\u2019s allies. A 2014 experiment conducted between the DCCC and a left-leaning issue advocacy group sought to measure what effect the DCCC\u2019s messaging would have on supporters of the advocacy group. What they found should deeply concern Democrats: Email addresses exposed to the DCCC\u2019s program preformed 15 percent worse in both money raised and contributions made as compared to email addresses that weren\u2019t on the DCCC\u2019s list.\u000a\u000aTrump is even turning around emails from the DCCC back to his own fundraising list, \u201cforwarding\u201d the messages and highlighting the desperate language in them. A Trump campaign email sent early in July included images of recent Democratic fundraising email subject lines and contrasted them against his own. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a positive movement focused on the American people,\u201d Trump wrote.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was thanks to our movement of small-dollar donors that we were able to send shockwaves around the world on November 8, 2016,\u201d read a June 2017 RNC email signed by Trump. \u201cAnd it\u2019s that same grassroots movement that will power us for years and years to come.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeeing this kind of language from Trump and the Republicans, and the accompanying dominance in grass-roots fundraising, ought to make Democrats\u2019 heads spin.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not too late for Democrats to reclaim the mantle of the party that is powered by small-dollar donations from working people. But it won\u2019t be easy. Instead of tricking people into donating, it should give something people to believe in, and show how they can only win together. The Democratic Party needs ask supporters to invest not just money, but time and energy in the party and its campaigns. It should invite those supporters to help shape the alternatives the party offers.\u000a\u000aIf the party can honestly and authentically change its message and actions, Democratic activists would embrace it with incredible enthusiasm. Grass-roots donors would jump to help tilt the balance of financial power and to shape the party's vision for future elections.\u000a\u000aWithout such a change, the Democratic Party is going to keep losing to Donald Trump and the Republicans in the money race, big and small. It puts the party in a terrible financial position ahead of the 2018 midterms, and it sets up Trump\u2019s campaign to have an unprecedented small-dollar fundraising operation for his reelection.\u000a\u000aDNC Chair Tom Perez has acknowledged the party\u2019s problem with small-dollar donors, saying during his candidacy to lead the DNC that the party needs to \u201cgo to school\u201d to figure out how to raise money from grass-roots donors, like Senator Bernie Sanders did during his presidential campaign. He should enroll soon: Donald Trump and the Republicans are already several grades ahead.\u000a\u000aMichael Whitney is a fundraising expert-in-residence with the Centre for Australian Progress. He served as Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 digital fundraising manager during the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.

He said he would convey his concern about Trump\u2019s comments to the president should they continue.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am worried those comments are not helpful when the situation is so tense, and I think you are seeing reaction from North Korea that indicates that kind of comment is more likely to escalate than to settle things,\u201d English said.\u000a\u000aConcern regarding North Korea and its ever-advancing nuclear weapons program has returned to the forefront in recent weeks as the Kim regime has begun testing ballistic missiles capable of hitting the continental U.S. At the same time, The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm has concluded that Pyongyang has successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead to the size necessary to fit its ballistic missiles.\u000a\u000aAsked about North Korea and its nuclear program on Tuesday, Trump warned that the repressive regime \u201cbest not make anymore threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d Wednesday morning, the president retweeted posts from the account of Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning show linking to stories headlined \u201cU.S. Air Force jets take off from Guam for training, ensuring they can \u2018fight tonight\u2019\u201d and \u201cTrump vows U.S. \u2018power\u2019 will meet North Korean threat.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Guam, the Pacific island that would likely be among the most vulnerable U.S. territories to a strike from North Korea, Governor Eddie Baza Calvo told residents that there is no threat to his island or to the nearby Mariana Islands, according to the Associated Press. He said he would remain in contact with the admiral in charge of Joint Region Marianas, the military command that oversees the Guam and the Marianas, to ensure Guam is \u201cprepared for any eventuality.\u201d\u000a\u000aGuam was the target of renewed North Korean threats overnight Tuesday, with Pyongyang announcing it was examining operational plans to strike Guam, which plays host to a large U.S. military presence. In a statement, North Korea\u2019s army threatened to launch missiles and create an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d around Guam.\u000a\u000aMadeleine Bordallo, Guam\u2019s delegate to Congress, said she too was working with the Department of Defense to ensure the island\u2019s safety, recalling her efforts to encourage the military to permanently deploy a missile defense system on the island. She called on Trump to work with other nations, noting that China plays an especially large role in any issue involving North Korea, but expressed apprehension regarding the president\u2019s rhetoric.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe President\u2019s tweet earlier today is concerning and unhelpful and does not lay out a clear strategy on how he will address the growing threats from North Korea. Kim Jung Un\u2019s reckless behavior cannot be tolerated, and I strongly urge the President to explore every avenue to peacefully respond to it and avoid further escalating this situation,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aIn a statement released Wednesday headlined \u201cno change in threat level from recent North Korea events,\u201d Guam\u2019s offices of homeland security and civil defense said it was continuing to monitor, in conjunction with the U.S. military, the threat posed by the Kim regime. In the statement, Guam\u2019s homeland security adviser George Charfauros advised \u201cthe community to remain calm, remember that there are defenses in place for threats such as North Korea and to continue to remain prepared for all hazards.\u201d\u000a\u000aSenator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), whose state is also home to a large military presence and would be another potentially vulnerable target for North Korea, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cunwise\u201d in a post to Twitter. He followed that post with a series of others, calling on the White House to send nominations for key diplomatic posts, including for ambassador to South Korea, to the Senate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need vigorous diplomacy and to beef up missile defense. POTUS statement unwise in tone, substance. No gain from using such language,\u201d the Hawaii lawmaker wrote. \u201cIt would be excellent to have a President experienced in foreign policy and government leadership next time.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepresentative Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the House armed services committee, called Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d remark \u201cirresponsible and alarming\u201d in his own flurry of Twitter posts. \u201cInstead of threats & over-the-top rhetoric, we need to pursue a smart, long-term strategy to address these growing threats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmong the steps we should immediately consider are further economic sanctions aimed at those who continue to trade w/ North Korea.\u201d

Trump's statement was protected by the First Amendment because it could not be seen as advocating violence. | Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty Images Judge allows appeal, puts Trump rally suit on ice\u000a\u000aA federal judge has authorized an appeal that could scuttle a lawsuit over violence at a Trump campaign rally, putting the case on hold and averting the possibility that President Donald Trump could be forced into a deposition in the case in the near future.\u000a\u000aThe three protesters who brought the suit against Trump over their treatment at the March 2016 rally in Louisville were also seeking access to the president's tax returns, but that effort will now be stalled while a federal appeals court deals with broader legal issues in the case.\u000a\u000aU.S. District Court Judge David Hale issued an opinion Wednesday granting a request from Trump's legal team to appeal an earlier ruling by Hale declining to throw out the case.\u000a\u000aTrump's lawyers contend that when he responded to the protest by declaring, "Get 'em out of here!" Trump's statement was protected by the First Amendment because it could not be seen as advocating violence.\u000a\u000aHowever, the protesters' lawyers say Trump's proclamation from the stage has to be judged by his intent and by the circumstances at the time, which could influence how people in the crowd perceived it. (Trump later added : "\u2018Don\u2019t hurt \u2019em. If I say \u2018go get \u2019em,\u2019 I get in trouble with the press.\u201d)\u000a\u000aHale sided with the protesters on the point. In his ruling Wednesday, he stood by his position. "Context matters," he wrote. "The exclamation 'shoot!' might constitute incitement if directed to a crowd of angry armed individuals, but shouted by a basketball fan or muttered in disappointment, it has no violent connotations. In short, the mere absence of overtly violent language in Trump\u2019s statement does not appear fatal to Plaintiffs\u2019 incitement claim."\u000a\u000aBut, after further deliberation, the judge agreed to certify the issue for appeal to the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

aVLISBON \u2014 After the best part of a decade of recession and stagnation, Portugal finally looked to be getting back on its feet. Then it all went wrong.\u000a\u000aIn June, just one day after the country had been freed from eight years of EU-imposed austerity measures, forest fires swept through the country, killing 64 people.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Portuguese people have been shaken by the greatest catastrophe of recent decades,\u201d Prime Minister António Costa told parliament in his State of the Nation speech. \u201cIn less than 24 hours we passed from relief to turmoil, from satisfaction to consternation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe fires weren\u2019t the only crisis that Costa\u2019s government had to deal with over the summer as the mood turned somber in a country that had been on a roll after being crowned European football champions for the first time last summer, had crooned its way to victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, and got its man placed at the head of the United Nations.\u000a\u000aTwo weeks after the fires, the nation\u2019s self-confidence suffered another blow when thieves broke into a military base northeast of Lisbon.\u000a\u000aTheir haul reportedly included 44 rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons, 150 hand grenades, 264 blocks of plastic explosives, dozens of detonators and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears\u201d \u2014 Opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho\u000a\u000aAs rumors circulated that the weapons were destined for international terrorists or organized crime gangs, the heist was viewed as a national humiliation that undermined the trust of NATO allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis calls into question the prestige of Portugal, the prestige of the armed forces, the authority of the state and the security of the Portuguese people,\u201d Marcelo Rebel de Sousa, Portugal\u2019s figurehead president, said after the theft at the base at Tancos.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m demanding a full and complete investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be done no matter who it hurts, and nobody is immune.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta faced demands for cabinet resignations as his Socialist (PS) government and the center-right opposition traded accusations over who was to blame for defense cuts that left the army with unguarded perimeter fences and broken surveillance systems; greed-driven forestry regimes that made the countryside flammable; chaotic civil defense planning; and investments in dysfunctional communication systems that hindered warnings as walls of flame roared toward defenseless villages and crowded highways.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister himself was lambasted for vacationing in Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands as security concerns and political tensions rose amid the fallout from the arms heist.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the going gets tough, this government disappears,\u201d opposition leader Pedro Passos Coelho told supporters of his center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD). \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of leadership and a lack of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000aCosta resisted calls to fire his interior and defense ministers, but then faced a further blow when three junior ministers resigned as the state prosecutors\u2019 office was poised to formally name them in an investigation into all-expenses-paid trips to last year\u2019s European football championship in France, allegedly offered by Galp Energeia, a power company.\u000a\u000aPopularity persists\u000a\u000aMinisters acknowledge the government is facing its most difficult time since coming to power in November 2015.\u000a\u000aStill, the Socialists have hit back, claiming that problems behind the fires and the robbery lie with the austerity-driven policies of the previous government led by Passos Coelho. The center-right has also been embarrassed by reports that three of its elected officials accepted a junket paid for by Chinese tech company Huawei.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down\u201d \u2014 Political expert André Azevedo Alves\u000a\u000aSo far, the gloom appears to have done little to hurt the government\u2019s popularity.\u000a\u000aCosta remains by far the most popular party leader. He enjoys a 48.9 percent approval rating, according to a poll published Saturday in the weekly Expresso newspaper. With a drop of just 0.6 points over the past two months, he\u2019s way ahead of Passos Coelho on 39.2 percent.\u000a\u000aThe PS has even increased its lead. Saturday\u2019s poll had the party at 40.8 percent, up 0.4 percent on July. The PSD dropped back to 28.1 percent.\u000a\u000aNor is there any sign that voters disaffected by the summer crises are turning to the two far-left parties that shore up Costa\u2019s minority government.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) is on 7.6 percent and the Left Bloc (BE) on 8.4 percent. Both have been steadily losing support since the October 2015 general election that brought Costa to power.\u000a\u000aHowever, analysts say the summer events could still take their toll.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen any really substantial impact on the polls, but this could mark a turning point over the longer term,\u201d said André Azevedo Alves, a political expert at Lisbon\u2019s Catholic University of Portugal and St. Mary\u2019s University, London.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tragic scale of the fires and the manner of the robbery at Tancos reflects on the institutions of state and could have a corrosive effect,\u201d he said. \u201cUp until now everything appeared to be going well under this government, we\u2019d been exceeding expectations, now things are going worse than expected.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeftists flex their muscles\u000a\u000aCosta now faces two crucial mid-term tests: Nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October 1 and the opening on August 21 of negotiations with his far-left partners on next year\u2019s state budget.\u000a\u000aThe leftists are demanding concessions. After two years of waving through budget bills that have won EU plaudits and brought the deficit down to its lowest level since democracy was restored in 1974, they\u2019re demanding a faster roll back of austerity.\u000a\u000aLeft Bloc leader Catarina Martins has been addressing party rallies around the country, cranking up pressure over the budget. Her demands range from tax breaks for the low earners to lowering the retirement age and more money for civil servants, pensions and public services.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a country where a mother who works full time and earns the minimum wage lives in poverty because the wage is so low that she cannot support herself and her child,\u201d Martins told a rally Thursday in Monte Gordo, a popular vacation resort in the southern Algarve region. \u201cNobody should be left behind.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe very public demands of both far-left parties will make it harder to strike a deal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more complicated for Costa this time. The PCP and the Bloc won\u2019t want to lose face, but somebody is going to have to back down,\u201d said Azevedo Alves. \u201cThere are ways out of this, but it will be more of a challenge than in previous years.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the rosier economic climate, unions are also demanding more.\u000a\u000aWorkers at the Autoeuropa car plant \u2014 the country\u2019s third biggest exporter \u2014 are threatening a strike to interrupt production of Volkswagen\u2019s new T-ROC model. They voted to reject a deal on wages and working time which, the company said, included a 16 percent pay rise for some workers.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.\u000a\u000aVenezuela is another source of tension between the government and its hard-left backers.\u000a\u000aThe Portuguese Communists on Thursday issued a statement denouncing protests against Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro as \u201cdestabilizing, terrorist and putschist.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe PCP criticized Costa\u2019s government for signing up to the European Union position not recognizing the violence-marred elections that Maduro organized to boost his powers.\u000a\u000aDespite the strains, however, neither the PCP nor the Left Bloc have much interest in breaking up the governing partnership, which is popularly nicknamed the geringonça, or contraption.\u000a\u000aIf they rock the boat too much, they risk being shunted away from power in new elections, given that polls show the PS within reach of an absolute majority, and voters would likely penalize any party that provokes a crisis by pulling out of the governing deal.\u000a\u000aThat strengthens Costa\u2019s hand in the budget talks.\u000a\u000aThe local elections will choose mayors and councillors for the country\u2019s 308 municipalities and over 3,000 smaller parish councils. Races are often dominated by local issues and personalities, but the vote will be a barometer of national support for the parties and their leaders.\u000a\u000aCosta is hoping the Socialists will increase their current leadership of 150 municipalities, and most of all they want to hang on to Lisbon, where he served as a popular mayor before stepping down in 2015 to run for the premiership.\u000a\u000aFernando Medina, Costa\u2019s successor as mayor, has been riding on a tourism boom, investing in a spate of urban embellishment projects to give the capital a facelift. The party\u2019s national ratings have also been boosted by strong economic data.\u000a\u000aLatest Eurostat numbers released last week showed Portugal\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen below the eurozone average for the first time since the crisis; growth, which is predicted at over 2.5 percent this year, will be the \u201cbest this century,\u201d according to Costa; and 2017 is on course to be the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for tourist numbers.\u000a\u000aThe PSD\u2019s challenge hasn\u2019t started well. It\u2019s challenger in the Lisbon mayoral race, Teresa Leal Coelho, made a gaffe-plagued opening to her campaign \u2014 confusing Passos Coelho with a previous party leader; making promises to abolish taxes that are beyond the mayor\u2019s remit; and releasing campaign posters apparently missing their slogans.\u000a\u000aThe party has also suffered a high-profile spat over Passos Coelho\u2019s refusal to disown a candidate running in the commuter town of Loures who spouted pejorative remarks about the local Roma community.\u000a\u000aRivals within the PSD have been sharpening their knives for Passos Coelho ever since he lost the premiership in 2015. A poor showing in October could see the former prime minister ousted.\u000a\u000aDespite his difficult summer, Costa may have less to fear from the local elections than his opponents.

aVGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen | Lennart Preiss/Getty Images German minister says government not pandering to Trump \u2018Germany keeps its promise,\u2019 Ursula von der Leyen said after promising to increase defense spending.\u000a\u000aGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen dismissed claims that the government was pandering to U.S. President Donald Trump by agreeing to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, local media reported Monday.\u000a\u000aMartin Schulz, the head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Angela Merkel\u2019s challenger for the German chancellorship, and Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the SPD\u2019s parliamentary group, wrote an op-ed in Funke Mediengruppe newspapers Sunday in which they rejected the 2 percent of GDP defense-spending target backed by NATO members.\u000a\u000aBut Von der Leyen said increased defense spending was necessary for Europe\u2019s security and to help Berlin keep its word.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermany keeps its promise,\u201d the defense minister said, adding that its European neighbors would expect just that.\u000a\u000aVon der Leyen said the SPD\u2019s assertions were part of a \u201ctotally messed up election campaign\u201d and blindsided German soldiers and Germany\u2019s allies.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, the SPD chiefs accused Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of pandering to Trump, who has frequently blasted NATO countries that don\u2019t meet the 2 percent spending target.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe say a clear no to the 2 percent target of Trump,\u201d and to the CDU and its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, wrote Schulz and Oppermann. They said Merkel and the conservatives had responded to Trump\u2019s \u201cprovocations\u201d on defense spending \u201cwith an \u2018OK, then there\u2019s more money from us,\u2019 as if we had nothing better to do with our money.\u201d\u000a\u000aVon der Leyen said Germany currently contributes 1.26 percent of its GDP to defense, and she wants to reach the 2 percent target by 2024. But Schulz said that would require almost doubling the current spending level of \u20ac37 billion, making Germany the largest military force in Europe.\u000a\u000aThe defense minister said if the SPD opposes increased funding for the armed forces, they would also be opposing the modernization of the military and increases in personnel and resources.\u000a\u000aSchulz and Oppermann criticized Von der Leyen, saying she was responsible for equipment problems and accusing her of lacking leadership. They said military spending increases should be matched with increased funds for diplomacy, crisis prevention and humanitarian initiatives, but warned the world wouldn\u2019t want Germany to be the largest military power in Europe \u201cbecause of our past.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe SPD trails the CDU by double-digits in the polls, with the election on September 24.

aVRep. Duncan Hunter, who is under investigation by the Justice Department over alleged campaign finance violations, denied any wrongdoing. | Getty Hunter under criminal investigation for alleged campaign finance violations\u000a\u000aRep. Duncan Hunter is under criminal investigation by the Justice Department over alleged campaign finance violations, the House Ethics Committee announced Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe California Republican spent tens of thousands of dollars' worth of campaign funds on items that appear to be personal in nature during 2015 and 2016, according to records from Hunter's campaign \u2014 a potential violation of House rules and federal law. The funds were spent on groceries and outdoor equipment, a dentist, a nail salon and a utility company, as well as on a hotel in Italy and at the Arizona Grand Resort.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAlthough Hunter later repaid nearly $60,000 to his campaign following news reports detailing the questionable spending, the Office of Congressional Ethics began a probe into the case.\u000a\u000aIn August, OCE recommended that the Ethics Committee begin a full-scale investigation into Hunter. Only the Ethics Committee can sanction a member or staffer for rules violations.\u000a\u000aBut the Justice Department has now asked the Ethics Committee to hold off on any action against Hunter because of its own criminal probe into the lawmaker, according to a statement from Reps. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) and Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), the chairwoman and ranking member of the panel.\u000a\u000a"The Department of Justice has asked the Committee to defer consideration of this matter and the Committee, following precedent, unanimously voted on March 22, 2017, to defer consideration of this matter at this time," said the statement.\u000a\u000aHunter's attorney said the California Republican had done nothing wrong and that any improper use of campaign funds was "inadvertent and unintentional."\u000a\u000a\u201cLast year, Congressman Hunter became aware of expenditure issues confronting his campaign committee. Out of an abundance of caution, he took corrective action in consultation with the [Federal Election Commission] and, ultimately, he and his wife personally repaid the campaign approximately $60,000," said Elliot Berke and Gregory Vega, in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Congressman Hunter intends to cooperate fully with the government on this investigation, and maintains that to the extent any mistakes were made they were strictly inadvertent and unintentional.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe middle ground between President Trump\u2019s saber-rattling and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s diplomatic pleading would be a comprehensive policy toward the goal of regime change. | Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images Opinion The Gang that Couldn\u2019t Threaten Straight\u000a\u000aIt was inevitable. Eventually, President Donald Trump would treat a foreign adversary as harshly as Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.\u000a\u000aNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un was on the receiving end of the alliteration heard around the world, when Trump promised \u201cfire and fury\u201d if Pyongyang continued to threaten the United States.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIt was classic Trump\u2014a memorably pungent expression that dominated the news cycle and probably didn't reflect more than about 30 seconds of thought. See? It really is a working vacation.\u000a\u000aAn American president has said this kind of thing before, although, it must be noted, he was actually in the act of waging a nuclear war. Truman said of the Japanese after Hiroshima, "They may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this Earth." And no one could doubt that he meant it.\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

It was his boss and the president of the United States speaking.\u000a\u000aTillerson seemed to leave a little opening for the possibility that he didn't know what was happening within the government he serves, over a foreign crisis that should be directly in his purview: \u201cNothing I have seen and nothing I know of would indicate that situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours.\u201d\u000a\u000aSecretary of Defense James Mattis issued his own, much tougher statement. So the administration has something for everyone. You can choose the president\u2019s bellicosity, the secretary of defense\u2019s firmness, or the secretary of state\u2019s palaver. Which reflects the administration\u2019s true posture? Who knows? Does the Trump administration?\u000a\u000aIn his own mind, Trump\u2019s intention may really be to use military force to deny North Korea the capability to threaten the United States with a nuclear-armed ICBM. The goal is obviously a worthy one, but it wouldn't involve a no-fuss, no-muss exemplary strike of the sort the president launched against Syria.\u000a\u000aA raid against North Korea, even one conceived as quite limited, would have the potential to spin into something much broader.\u000a\u000aFor a military operation that sober-minded people believe could, at the outer bounds of its destructiveness, cause more than a million casualties, the president should probably get authorization from Congress\u2014when it's not obvious that Congress can even pass a budget.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d need to undertake extensive war and postwar planning, working through every possible permutation and mustering all relevant agencies of the U.S. government\u2014when it's still in doubt whether his new chief of staff can even succeed in keeping order within the confines of the Oval Office.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d need to get regional allies on board for a war that could bring untold destruction to their countries\u2014when South Korea just elected a dovish president and we don't even have an ambassador in Seoul.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d need to commit himself to an enterprise that would require all of his attention in high-stress conditions for an extended period of time\u2014when he couldn't stick with one position on the House-passed health care bill for more than a couple of weeks.\u000a\u000aSo it's hard to see the president cashing this particular rhetorical check.\u000a\u000aAt least Trump\u2019s words reflect a desire to do\u2014or at least say\u2014something different after three decades of bipartisan failure on North Korea. His is the rhetoric of strategic impatience, and given the history, the impulse is understandable.\u000a\u000aFor years, we have pursued desultory sanctions against Pyongyang with intermittent negotiations conducted through a prism of self-delusion. The strategy of negotiating over a nuclear capability that you develop while talks are ongoing is a North Korea invention, borrowed, with great success, by the Iranians.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019d be nice if Tillerson showed any awareness of this background as he mouths foreign-service talking points. What he is saying is completely absurd, but no one notices because it is couched in terms that the Beltway is conditioned to consider the height of thoughtfulness. According to Tillerson, we are not North Korea\u2019s enemy, we don't seek regime change, and we just want to sit down and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula like good, reasonable people.\u000a\u000aOne theory is that Trump and Tillerson are deliberately playing different roles. But there\u2019s good cop/bad cop, and then there's Keystone Kops. Some unpredictability at the top can be welcome, so long as it's calculated unpredictability, not random popping off that catches a president\u2019s own foreign-policy team off-guard.\u000a\u000aThe middle ground between Trump\u2019s saber-rattling and Tillerson\u2019s diplomatic pleading would be a comprehensive policy toward the goal of regime change. As former Bush administration official Robert Joseph argues, such a strategy would involve cutting off the North from the international financial system, interdicting its weapons trafficking, undertaking an intense information campaign publicizing its human-rights abuses, and perhaps shooting down its test missiles or instituting a blockade.\u000a\u000aSuch an approach would have its own risks\u2014it wouldn't be guaranteed to collapse the regime or to avoid military conflict. But at least it would be a strategy. If the Trump administration wants to really send a signal to Kim Jong Un, it should get itself together and pick one.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.

aVHouse and Senate Democrats have wondered for months whether Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters might choose to focus their energy on launching primary challenges to party moderates in 2018. They\u2019re about to get an answer.\u000a\u000aSanders has decided the moment is right to launch his proposal for the single-payer health insurance system that helped form the backbone of his presidential message. And Democrats who don\u2019t get behind it could find themselves on the wrong side of the most energetic wing of the party \u2014 as well as the once and possibly future presidential candidate who serves as its figurehead.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Vermont senator himself has not explicitly said he\u2019ll support primary challenges to those who won\u2019t support his push for a so-called Medicare-for-all health care plan. But there are plenty of signs that Sanders and his allies view the issue as a defining moment for Democratic lawmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur view is that within the Democratic Party, this is fast-emerging as a litmus test,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, the pollster for Sanders\u2019 White House run.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe single-payer concept is increasingly popular in the party \u2014 high-profile senators like Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have expressed some support, and, for the first time, a majority of House Democrats have now signed on to the single-payer bill that Rep. John Conyers has been introducing regularly for more than a decade.\u000a\u000aBut even as leading party figures have drifted toward supporting a single-payer system similar to the one proposed by Sanders, almost none of them expect anything like it to become law while Republicans control Washington.\u000a\u000aWith Sanders promising to play a major role in 2018 races, that\u2019s led many party officials to worry about the prospect of his involvement in primaries that could upend the Democratic establishment\u2019s plans to win crucial House, Senate and gubernatorial seats.\u000a\u000aThe fears are acute enough that when the Nevada chapter of Our Revolution \u2014 the political group spawned from the Sanders presidential campaign \u2014 endorsed long-shot candidate Jesse Sbaih in the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primary over party favorite Rep. Jacky Rosen, retired former Sen. Harry Reid felt the need to call Sanders directly.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t endorse Sbaih, and don\u2019t let the national Our Revolution group accept its Nevada chapter's recommendation to back him either, the former minority leader implored his friend. Sanders agreed, said a Democrat familiar with the interaction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that [Sanders allied] people will try to make a stir,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide working on a 2018 campaign. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be a liberal Democrat in a lot of these states and be elected. [So] the question is how we improve the lives of people instead of playing these political games."\u000a\u000aSanders allies don\u2019t find that argument convincing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny Democrat worth their salt that doesn\u2019t unequivocally say Medicare-for-all is the way to go? To me, there\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d said former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept no more hemming and hawing. No more game playing. Make your stand.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders himself has stood alongside Democrats in fights like the recent one against the GOP\u2019s health care plans. He\u2019s toured states with wavering Republican senators to pressure them on the issue and quickly condemned a recent single-payer measure pushed by Republican Sen. Steve Daines as a ploy designed to trick Democrats.\u000a\u000aHis team has been working with fellow progressive senators to enlist co-sponsors for his measure, said Democrats across Capitol Hill. Within Sanders circles, the increased popularity of single-payer arrangements is seen as a sign that his long-promised "political revolution\u201d is underway.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s been vindicated by the presidential campaign,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior Sanders 2016 campaign adviser.\u000a\u000aThe Vermont independent has signaled that he expects serious resistance even from Democrats, but he has yet to spell out how he'll fight back.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will be taking on the most powerful special interests in the country: Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the corporate media, the Republican Party and the establishment wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d he emailed supporters last Tuesday.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s clear is that Sanders\u2019 large and politically active following has stopped Democrats from confronting him directly \u2014 including when it comes to offering alternatives to his Medicare-for-all measure. Many still remember the swift and angry January response from grass-roots progressives including Sanders supporters toward Booker for a symbolic drug importation vote, and toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her procedural vote in favor of Ben Carson\u2019s nomination as Housing secretary.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

It\u2019s an issue that everyone is going to be watching to see how they respond,\u201d said Chuck Idelson, a senior operative for the National Nurses United union, which served as one of the most prominent backers of Sanders\u2019 campaign and has long been a needle in the side of establishment Democrats.\u000a\u000aLike many Democrats who are closely aligned with Sanders\u2019 political operation, Idelson stopped short of primary threats. But he refused to rule out the possibility that his group might consider backing challenges of sitting Democratic lawmakers who don\u2019t back the plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur organization, and plenty of other people out there, are going to be holding the Democrats accountable,\u201d Idelson said. \u201cWhat are we electing people for if they\u2019re not going to be fighting for getting people health care when they need it?\u201d\u000a\u000aOther Sanders-allied progressives have been equally adamant on the need to give his Medicare-for-all push a starring role in forthcoming primaries after the recent Capitol Hill health care fights and the stalling of a much-publicized California state legislative proposal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe should run on Medicare-for-all in the 2018 and 2020 elections,\u201d said Bay Area Congressman Ro Khanna, a Sanders backer who has encouraged primary challenges. \u201cThe Democrats that are activists are there, the Democratic voters are there, but now we just need enough of the elected officials to listen to where their constituents are.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe distrust between Sanders forces and the establishment is increasing the tension. Some Democratic senators privately bristled at the health care rallies that Sanders and others organized across the country in January: They were shocked to be greeted by angry Sanders backers in the crowds who loudly urged them to back a single-payer plan, according to several Democratic senators and aides. There is also longstanding grumbling over his refusal to share his campaign email list with other Democrats and, more recently, over his vote against a new round of sanctions against Russia and Iran.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the divide, Sanders allies insist the party seldom acknowledges the role of the senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid in shaping the party\u2019s new agenda, whether on health care, a $15 minimum wage, or free college. And they express frustration that Democratic gatekeepers are still slow to accept Sanders\u2019 likely front-runner role if he chooses to run for president in 2020.\u000a\u000aIn the words of one senior aide to Sanders\u2019 campaign, \u201cA special cloud of denial formed over the swamp when polls started coming out showing Bernie was the most popular politician in the country."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVAfter the full repeal of Obamacare stalled in the Senate last month, one of the sharpest and most-shared online rebukes of the Republican turncoats came from one unassuming woman who loves dogs, Texas and Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cTHESE 3 GOP Senators Just KILLED #RepealFirst Replace Later," wrote @ChristieC733, tagging the senators who stalled the push as well as the official accounts of the Republican National Committee and the Senate Republicans. Her tweet was shared hundreds of times within an hour, eclipsing many of the more famous pundits inside the Beltway.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aGiven her 238,000 followers\u2014100,000 more than Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s social media director, and more than three times as many as famed white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2014you might guess Christie is a prominent activist. But besides listing her membership in the National Rifle Association and ownership of a small business, Christie\u2019s profile offers little information about her offline life or any explanation for her impressive following.\u000a\u000aChristie\u2019s clout comes from her presence in some of the leading pro-Trump \u201crooms,\u201d private spaces on conservative Twitter that allow followers to coordinate messages and then retweet each other\u2014dramatically multiplying their impact. One of her fellow \u201cTwitter patriots,\u201d as they call themselves, tweeted and retweeted more than 4,100 times over a recent four-day period.\u000a\u000aTHESE 3 GOP Senators Just KILLED #RepealFirst Replace Later" @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2611\ufe0fhttps://t.co/G1EmSrujGm\u2026 pic.twitter.com/4BIpcK7ehg \u2014 ChristieC733 \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 (@ChristieC733) July 18, 2017\u000a\u000aThe pro-Trump rooms are an outgrowth of Twitter\u2019s group direct message function, which was introduced with little fanfare in January 2015, just as the presidential campaign was getting underway. At that time, Twitter was considered a decidedly liberal bastion. But the platform\u2014as well as its group direct message function\u2014proved to be especially useful for the type of populist outsider movement spurred by Trump, whose denunciations of elitist figures and institutions were easily conveyed in no more than 140 characters.\u000a\u000aIn the months surrounding Trump\u2019s surprise victory, mystery and conjecture shrouded his fiercely loyal social media network, a force that continues to lend a president who is highly unpopular by conventional polling metrics a unique kind of clout. Other political leaders fear his ability to shape the news cycle and flog his critics before millions of voters who may not receive news from any other source.\u000a\u000aMany dismissed their staggering output as inflated by automated \u201cbot\u201d accounts run by expert computer programmers, whether foreign agents or domestic trolls. But that may be an exaggerated theory: So many months after the election, tens of thousands of tweets per day continue to emanate from a very human, grass-roots organization.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy hypothesis was always that these accounts were organizing somewhere,\u201d said Gilad Lotan, a data scientist who monitored political activity on Twitter during the election and wrote about indications that pro-Trump users were working in coordination. He long suspected that bots alone could not account for Trump\u2019s social media dominance, but never identified a key mechanism unearthed in interviews with the Twitter patriots.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey were clearly organizing in some private space. It makes so much sense that it\u2019s within Twitter,\u201d Lotan said.\u000a\u000aBy design, the precise size and organization of the pro-Trump online network is difficult to discern. But POLITICO traced this corner of hard-right Twitter through interviews with Trump\u2019s most fervent online boosters\u2014a group that includes anonymous mothers in the Midwest, otherwise unremarkable Florida businessmen who amass thousands of followers through nonstop #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, and a younger cadre of meme provocateurs. As Trump\u2019s presidency barrels forward, this network continues to evolve and even splinter. But its infrastructure, largely invisible, remains a powerful tool for the administration and its supporters to broadcast their messages and help dictate media coverage.\u000a\u000a\u201cGreat to meet like-minded people,\u201d said Julie King Jackson, a Manhattan-based Trump supporter, when asked about the rooms.\u000a\u000aThe invite-only rooms have names like \u201cPatriots United\u201d and \u201cTrump Train,\u201d and many have accompanying hashtags to track members\u2019 tweets as they propagate. Each room can accommodate as many as 50 people.\u000a\u000aA screenshot from the \u201cTrumps WarRoom\u201d group message on Twitter. | Obtained by POLITICO\u000a\u000aTheir private nature makes it impossible to know how many rooms formed in the run-up to November 8, or when they first cropped up. One member said she\u2019s contributed to rooms since winter 2015, and several others said they joined the fray before the state primaries began.\u000a\u000aMost people in the rooms are not native internet users. Many joined Twitter or dusted off dormant accounts just to stump for Trump. These novices were coached by more experienced compatriots on tending their feeds and cultivating followers. Those who spoke with POLITICO were virtually all older than 35 and predominantly female.\u000a\u000aSome might have joined rooms to discuss news and to vent about Hillary Clinton or the Democrats. But their primary purpose is to amplify and coordinate messaging.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe whole idea is to share tweets and retweet people in the group\u2019s tweets,\u201d explained Brian Fraser, a central node in the network who manages one of the \u201cPatriots United\u201d rooms. Since last summer, Fraser\u2019s following has increased dramatically, from 13,000 followers to nearly 170,000 today.\u000a\u000aAnother room manager told members that mutual retweeting is \u201cthe cardinal rule.\u201d\u000a\u000aA single room can quickly disseminate a given post to its members. But the real strength of the pro-Trump rooms is in their interconnectedness, since one user can be in multiple rooms simultaneously.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Another said she contributed to two rooms as of November 8, and joined three more since Election Day. Even allowing for duplicates, that\u2019s hundreds of potential retweets with just a few clicks.\u000a\u000aMany experts were unaware of these rooms.\u000a\u000aLotan has researched the role of social media in politics and propaganda for years. He noted last September that Trump\u2019s followers were actively organizing to get particular hashtags trending.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey clearly had a sense for hubs in the network, the mechanics of attention and how information can propagate,\u201d said Lotan, who joined BuzzFeed as head of data science in December 2016.\u000a\u000aAlthough Lotan had never heard of anything like the rooms, he regularly observed \u201chighly organized networks of users who used the same term at the same time.\u201d\u000a\u000aScreenshots provided to POLITICO from inside one room illustrate how powerful a tool the pro-Trump rooms can be for this type of coordination and amplification.\u000a\u000aIn mid-May of this year, Debbie tweeted about Trump\u2019s patriotism.\u000a\u000aHe loves our Country & military and all the Veterans\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u27b0\U0001f499\u27b0\U0001f454\U0001f451\U0001f454 \u2014 \u2650Debbie\u2194Trump\u2650 (@debra_derienzo) May 19, 2017\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen he Salutes you...He means it. I never seen a President as Patriotic as Donald J. Trump! We Love him! I stand with my President!\u201d she wrote alongside a photo of Trump saluting the band at his inauguration. At the time, around 5,500 people were following her account, which was started in August 2016. That number has since swelled to nearly 11,000.\u000a\u000aEven the power of the #MAGA hashtag alone can\u2019t make every fawning Trump tweet get noticed. But after Debbie copied the tweet into the \u201cTrumps WarRoom\u201d [sic] thread, which she managed at the time, the post was shared nearly a thousand times.\u000a\u000aTwo other tweets that Debbie shared via \u201cTrumps WarRoom\u201d garnered more than 400 and 200 retweets, respectively.\u000a\u000aAnother user known as Eagle Wings posted to \u201cTrumps WarRoom,\u201d the shared screenshots show. Like many Twitter patriots, her profile is bare on biographical details, indicating only that she\u2019s a retired Air Force veteran. Just before July 4, Eagle Wings tweeted about Trump\u2019s love for America.\u000a\u000aWith great respect Patriotism is being restored Celebrating 4th of July knowing we have a POTUS who loves America\u000a\u000a& fights for We The Ppl pic.twitter.com/oJCWE1Clto \u2014 EAGLE WINGS (@NIVIsa4031) July 2, 2017\u000a\u000a\u201cWith great respect Patriotism is being restored Celebrating 4th of July knowing we have a POTUS who loves America & fights for We The Ppl,\u201d she wrote to her tens of thousands of followers. Her post included a meme of Trump\u2019s face etched over the stars and stripes.\u000a\u000aLacking any Trump-specific hashtags, this tweet might have been doomed. But Eagle Wings is a heavy hitter in the rooms, according to other users, and she got results: This rather garbled post racked up more than 1,000 retweets by Independence Day.\u000a\u000aAnother member of the same room, @VoteTrumpPics, is explicit in using Twitter to coordinate Trump supporters\u2019 online messaging, often to match the president\u2019s own tweets. After Trump used the hashtag #FraudNewsCNN in early, @VoteTrumpPics tweeted an urgent order.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe're changing it folks!\u201d the account wrote, directing that the network \u201cis to be referred to as #FraudNewsCNN. Effective immediately!\u201d The post was shared more than 2,500 times.\u000a\u000aThe rooms allow members to post, share and follow each other with machine-like efficiency and speed. On particularly prodigious days, it\u2019s common for a single user to tweet and retweet hundreds of times.\u000a\u000a\u201cI get called a Russian bot 50 times a day, it\u2019s so stupid,\u201d complained one woman in her late 40s.\u000a\u000aI get called a Russian bot 50 times a day, it\u2019s so stupid,\u201d complained one woman in her late forties.\u000a\u000aDr. Alan Rosenblatt, an expert in the history of online political campaigning, explained that the rooms are the latest iteration of people finding ways to leverage a small design feature like group messages for political advocacy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is clearly tapping into a group of people that are zealous, have a lot of time on their hands, and are tenacious as can be,\u201d said Rosenblatt, who is director for digital research at Lake Research Partners and senior vice president of digital strategy at Turner4D, both in Washington.\u000a\u000aThe room dwellers are true believers in the power of Twitter to promote politicians and their platforms. As one manager seeking to monetize his network of rooms sees it, he can offer candidates mass advertising and \u201cname recognition beyond anything other mediums can offer.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut there is a competing account of how the Twitter rooms benefit Trump.\u000a\u000aMicrochip, a Twitter user who uses several different accounts and is routinely banned from the site, told POLITICO the pro-Trump rooms help him spread racist and otherwise controversial material. His dual aims are to prod the left and entice the media into covering the latest online controversy he helped stoke.\u000a\u000aMicrochip said he started several rooms in November 2015. A handful of people in other rooms confirmed that he was an \u201cearly player.\u201d But he has been blocked from many rooms because of his \u201cwild claims,\u201d one said, as well as anti-Semitic and inflammatory remarks.\u000a\u000aScreenshots from one of the invite-only Twitter direct messaging rooms. Many have accompanying hashtags to track members\u2019 tweets as they propagate. Each room can accommodate up to 50 people. | Obtained by POLITICO\u000a\u000aIn April, Microchip told BuzzFeed about his skill at gaming Twitter algorithms using a combination of automated bot accounts and \u201cretweet groups\u201d of like-minded users, most of them younger people with ties to 4chan and other platforms, he explained.\u000a\u000aIn subsequent interviews with POLITICO, Microchip detailed how this was just the first step. After \u201cseeding\u201d a given hashtag with bots and his internal network, he ports messages and memes over to other nodes within the broader pro-Trump network of rooms, which is primarily populated by boomers.\u000a\u000a\u201cBots don\u2019t really count toward hashtag boosting that well, raw tweets do,\u201d he said. To accomplish his goals, then, Microchip needs individuals to consistently share the material he\u2019s pushing.\u000a\u000aBut Microchip, who described himself as an \u201catheist liberal that just hates immigration\u201d and transgender people, has open contempt for most of Trump\u2019s base.\u000a\u000a\u201cConservatives are generally morons,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like herding cats.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s just as frank about what he\u2019s peddling to Trump supporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know how I know they're spreading lies?\u201d Microchip asked one die-hard this week. \u201cBecause I do the same thing, it's fake news and spin.\u201d\u000a\u000aChaos is Microchip\u2019s metric of success, not voter turnout. His rooms put out a mix of outright vile and what he calls \u201cboomer approved\u201d messages without the gross-out element.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of this is contrived to force outrage and trigger new MSM journos to cover shit because they buy the meme,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have already figured this out and stopped covering us.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost of this is contrived to force outrage and trigger new MSM journos to cover shit because they buy the meme,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should have already figured this out and stopped covering us.\u201d\u000a\u000aMicrochip and his crew were giddy at hearing President Trump\u2019s declaration that the military would no longer accept transgender soldiers. In between mulling ideas for inflammatory messaging, Microchip marveled that Trump \u201cis going to force the Left to remain drenched in identity politics through 2018.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Left still hasn't learned to ignore this trigger game,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aLike the \u201cnormies,\u201d as he calls Trump supporters in the mainstream rooms, Microchip fears concentrated government power and shares frustration with leftward shifts he saw under Obama. But he sees the network of rooms as a vehicle to spread right-wing content that triggers \u201cextreme\u201d response from liberals, and Trump himself as but \u201ca tool in this purpose.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe hopes extreme actions from either end of the political spectrum will scare more people to the center.\u000a\u000aMicrochip said it would be impossible to corroborate many of his grandiose claims because of the extent to which he covers his tracks.\u000a\u000aLotan said Microchip\u2019s claims explain the link between the boomer generation in the mainstream rooms and the younger meme producers on 4chan and reddit.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe boomers are there, thirsty for ammunition. And 4chan is so good at generating ammunition,\u201d Lotan said. \u201cBut the boomers will not go to 4chan.\u201d\u000a\u000aPeople in the mainstream pro-Trump rooms said Microchip had not been active there for many months. In turn, Microchip said he maintains pseudonymous accounts to hide his identity from \u201cbrain dead\u201d Trump supporters.\u000a\u000aWhether their aim is earnest advocacy or to foment backlash, the rooms are now an entrenched part of conservative Twitter. New offshoots continue to spawn, additional members join daily, and their overseers are weighing next steps.\u000a\u000aEver volatile, Microchip suggested last week that he might shift his attention away from using the rooms, although he was characteristically cryptic.\u000a\u000a\u201cI'm dumping most groups, turning inward,\u201d he tweeted after decrying everything from globalism to the New Right in a missive comprised of hundreds of tweets.\u000a\u000aThe mainstream rooms, meanwhile, are scrambling to anoint sufficiently pro-Trump candidates nationwide while taking aim at the president\u2019s detractors, particularly moderate Republicans. When Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who is up for reelection in 2018, blasted Trump online last week, suggesting the GOP was in denial about the president\u2019s flaws and shortcomings, heavy hitters made their intentions clear.\u000a\u000aTweeted one \u201cTwitter patriot\u201d about Flake: \u201cHe doesn't know he now has ALL of #TrumpsArmy #TrumpTrain #TrumpNation who will work for opposing candidates!\u201d\u000a\u000aShawn Musgrave writes about social media and politics for Politico.\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Twitter\u000a\u000aMedia\u000a\u000aPolitics\u000a\u000aPresident Trump

aVFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharply opposed some of the ideas being promoted by top Republican presidential contenders Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz.\u000a\u000aWithout naming the top two GOP candidates, Zuckerberg blasted the ideas of building a wall, keeping out immigrants, and blocking global trade. Speaking at Facebook's F8 developer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg spent the first 10 minutes of his keynote talk addressing politics instead of programming.\u000a\u000a"I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others, for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, reducing trade and, in some cases around the world, even cutting access to the internet," said Zuckerberg.\u000a\u000aGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\u000a\u000a"You have to be optimistic to think that you can change the world," he continued.\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly said that if elected, he would construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and get Mexico to pay for it. Trump has also proposed imposing stiff tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico. Both Trump and Cruz have pledged to crack down on immigration and deport people already in the United States.\u000a\u000aFor more from Facebook F8, watch :\u000a\u000a"Our lives are connected and whether we're welcoming refugees fleeing wars or an immigrant seeking a new opportunity, whether we're coming together to fight global disease like Ebola or to address climate change, I hope that we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together, not push people apart, to connect more, not less." Zuckerberg concluded. "We are one global community."

Die Welt led with the news the premier of Germany\u2019s Lower Saxony region, Stephan Weil, denied allegations his close relationship with Volkswagen led him to soften a speech critical of the carmaker at VW\u2019s request. While Weil rejected the report, FAZ wrote the case has effectively triggered campaigning in the region for the September 24 federal election. The Greens, who supported Weil\u2019s election as premier in 2013, said the cozy relationship between politicians and the car industry have damaged Germany\u2019s reputation.\u000a\u000aFAZ also reported on deportations of refugees from Germany to Greece. A number of asylum seekers will be sent back under Dublin rules, which state people arriving in Europe have to claim asylum in the country in which they arrive.\u000a\u000aUK\u000a\u000aThe Guardian\u2019s front page featured a report on Google apologizing for a memo written by one of its employees, who argued the reason the tech giant has more male than female engineers is because men are better suited for the job. Google said the manifesto did not represent the company\u2019s views. The paper also featured a story on an \u201cIVF postcode lottery,\u201d citing Fertility Network U.K. figures, which indicated areas of England have restricted or halted IVF treatment this year for women struggling to conceive, and others are considering taking similar steps to cut costs.\u000a\u000aThe Times on its front page reported on the trial of convicted terrorists Tahir Aziz, Naweed Ali, Mohibur Rahman and Khobaib Hussain, who shared scores of extremist videos hosted by YouTube that featured Islamist propaganda. The revelations came amidst increasing pressure on technology companies over the accessibility of extremist content. The men were jailed for life last week.\u000a\u000aThe paper also featured a report on record levels of violence and abuse against patients at British mental health trusts. The incidents were reported last year, prompting accusations of \u201cendemic\u201d use of force in the National Health Service. More than 5,000 serious incidents were investigated, including hundreds of suicides, dozens of killings and more than 2,000 cases of self-harm.\u000a\u000aFrance\u000a\u000aLe Figaro\u2019s front page focused on President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s leadership style. Macron manages his cabinet as if it were a company, the paper noted, requiring total availability from his ministers and messaging them about policies in the middle of the night. The paper\u2019s other front page story focuses on the rising euro, which has gained nearly 10 cents against the dollar in three months. That has weakened less competitive economies in Europe such as France, the paper claimed.\u000a\u000aLibération on its front page features a story on the Young Socialist Movement\u2019s loss of trust in the Socialist Party (PS). If there was an internal vote, about \u201c40 percent of its young members would leave the PS,\u201d the paper claimed, citing internal documents. The party lacks a strategy after recent electoral defeats in the presidential and legislative elections, and young socialists aren\u2019t involved in rebuilding it, according to the report.\u000a\u000aSpain\u000a\u000aEl Mundo\u2019s top story focuses on the money-making Podemos. The left-wing party made \u20ac11.6 million profit in 2016, despite contesting national and regional elections. Podemos\u2019 budget surplus was just \u20ac2.2 million in 2015. Compared to established parties \u2014 the conservative Popular Party, the social-democratic Socialist Party, and the liberal Ciudadanos \u2014 Podemos made the most bank.\u000a\u000aEl Pais reported the Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 Party will request on August 16 a parliamentary investigation committee look into reforming the country\u2019s constitution when the Catalan parliament resumes. The debate starts just two months before a Catalan independence referendum on October 1. The committee will be tasked with considering reforms of the country\u2019s current territorial model.

aVThe uproar over Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and a now-fired information technology employee who faces a bank fraud charge appears to be much ado about not much.\u000a\u000aThe germ of truth in it is that the man was under investigation and Wasserman Schultz refused to dismiss him absent any evidence or charge of wrongdoing. After he was arrested for mortgage fraud for claiming a rental house as his permanent residence, she let him go.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s noteworthy that the charge against Imran Awan, a naturalized citizen from Pakistan, has nothing to do with the allegations leveled in February and repeatedly raised by right-wing media.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump also has seized on the case to attack the mainstream media for paying little attention to the story before the arrest. In fact, the media was watching, but there wasn't much of a story to report until then.\u000a\u000aLeaving aside the breathless coverage by Fox News, the Daily Caller and other right-wing media, these are the essential facts:\u000a\u000aAwan, his wife, two brothers and a friend are information technology experts whose services were shared by Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, and nine other Democratic members of Congress. In February, the Capitol Police advised House administrators that they were being investigated concerning missing inventory items and whether data had been transferred with an insecure application. Although no charges were filed, their access to the House computer system was revoked. The offices that employed them were notified and everyone but Wasserman Schultz fired them.\u000a\u000aShe says she redefined Imran Awan's duties so that he could continue to work for her office part-time, giving technical advice and servicing printers, computers, cell phones and other technology outside of the House network. The same House office that had terminated his access helped prepare the new job description, according to Wasserman Schultz.\u000a\u000aIn late July, she said, Awan took unpaid leave and bought a round-trip ticket to Pakistan, where his family had gone to be with relatives. At the airport, he was arrested by the FBI and Capitol Police on a charge that appears to have nothing to do with the original investigation. He's accused of bank fraud by obtaining a $165,000 home equity loan from the Congressional Federal Credit Union on property that he rents out and is not his primary residence. The money reportedly was wired to Pakistan. Informed of the charge, to which Awan has pleaded innocent, Wasserman Schultz fired him. There is still no other case against him.\u000a\u000aThe issue needs to be seen against the backdrop of the conspiracy theory floated several months ago over the death of Seth Rich, a young man who worked at the Democratic National Committee. Wasserman Schultz chaired the committee until stolen emails compelled her resignation during the 2016 campaign.\u000a\u000aAlthough Washington police believe Rich was killed in a robbery attempt, a Fox News report in May insinuated that it had to do with the damaging WikiLeaks dump of the DNC emails. U.S. intelligence agencies, however, had concluded that the email theft was the work of Russian agencies. Fox retracted the story a week later, saying that it had not met its standards.\u000a\u000aA pending lawsuit has alleged the White House was complicit with Fox News in hatching that story. Although that has not been proven, the lawsuit in turn has brought attention to a months-old allegation by Andrew Feinberg, a reporter who had worked in Washington for Sputnik, a Russian state-owned news organization. Feinberg says his superiors pressured him to bring up the Seth Rich story at a White House press briefing.\u000a\u000aAs Yahoo.com News quoted Feinberg on Tuesday, he was told, \u201cWe want you to ask about Seth Rich and if those revelations should put an end to the Russia hacking narrative and the investigation.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Feinberg said he refused and was fired.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz was plainly the target of that conspiracy theory. \u201cI\u2019m the person who supposedly murdered him,\u201d she told us. Now she's in the crosshairs of another.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am a very favorite target of Donald Trump\u2019s right-wing noise machine,\u201d she told us. They want to do anything they can to distract attention from the investigation of his campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Russians during the presidential campaign, she said.\u000a\u000aJudgment should be withheld pending the outcome of the investigation that led to the former staffer's arrest. But the possibility of political motives can't be dismissed out of hand.\u000a\u000aThe absence of any other charges hasn't inhibited right-wing media from insinuating that Awan, who didn't work for the DNC, was somehow involved in the email hacks, that FBI agents found smashed computers at his home, that Wasserman Schultz \u201cseemingly\u201d intended to keep paying him while he was in Pakistan, and that he couldn't have done any useful work for her without access to the House computer system. Based on all that, a conservative watchdog organization has filed a complaint against her with the Office of Congressional Ethics.\u000a\u000aThe campaign took a particularly vile turn when the website US Daily News 24 compiled news, blogs and tweets on the case July 28 under a headline, \u201cWasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest.\u201d There was nothing in the text to support the headline, which Politifact, finding no evidence for it, branded a \u201cpants on fire\u201d lie.\u000a\u000aTrump last week copied a tweet from the right-wing site Townhall accusing the major non-Fox networks of covering up the \u201cIT Scandal Engulfing Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere is still no \u201cscandal\u201d to be covered up. Awan has not been charged with a crime related to his congressional duties. The bank fraud charge, meanwhile, looks like something that was filed in a hurry to keep Awan in the country. It doesn't seem likely that the FBI would bother with a case in which a bank had not lost money.\u000a\u000aWhy did Wasserman Schultz, unlike her colleagues, continue to employ Awan when she knew he was under investigation? We asked her. She said it was a matter of simple fairness and due process.\u000a\u000a\u201cI'm not proclaiming the man's innocence,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the investigation should proceed however it proceeds, but these individuals had been charged with nothing based on the investigation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would have been much easier for me to just terminate him. Everyone else did,\u201d she said. \u201cI could not do that in good conscience.\u201d And if she had to do it over again, she said she would do the same thing.\u000a\u000aA political adviser might fault her for taking the risk, knowing she has a target painted on her back.

aVAbout 15 years ago, Sue McElroy, a psychiatrist in Mason, Ohio, started noticing a pattern. People came to see her because they were depressed, but they frequently had a more visible ailment as well: They were very overweight.\u000a\u000aMcElroy was convinced there had to be a connection. \u201cMany of my [depressed] patients were obese. And they were very upset by obesity,\u2019\u2019 McElroy recalled. \u201dI looked into the literature, and it said there was no relationship. It didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat disconnect has started to change, promising new avenues for treatment but also presenting a puzzle: Just how can you chart the relationship between the two? And how to link treatment of two disorders that exist in totally different parts of the health care system?\u000a\u000aIngrid Donato, a top official in the federal agency that promotes mental health treatment, says that both conditions are on the rise, heightening the need to unlock the connection and develop treatments that address both conditions simultaneously. "You can\u2019t address obesity in a person that\u2019s struggling with major depression without addressing that major depression," said Donato, chief of mental health promotion at SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\u000a\u000aBut how to address it? That's a puzzle\u2014one whose solution lies partly in policy, partly in research. The relationship between obesity and depression is what researchers call \u201cbidirectional\u201d: Being obese or overweight ups the odds of depression, and vice versa. For example, about 43 percent of people with depression are obese, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, compared with a third of the general population. People who are obese are 55 percent more likely to be depressed, and people with depression 58 percent more likely to develop obesity, according to one 2010 study. "This is a massive public health issue when you have numbers that large," Donato said.\u000a\u000aWhile on the surface the two conditions appear to be very different, they share some important similarities. Both are chronic diseases that are tricky to treat, requiring long-term physical and mental health interventions. When the two conditions occur at the same time, treatment becomes even more complex, with the best outcomes resulting from coordinated care from a range of professionals \u2013 doctors and nurses as well as dietitians, behavioral health specialists and physical therapists \u2013 all working together to address the full spectrum of a patient\u2019s needs.\u000a\u000aThat kind of coordinated care is still a rarity in many parts of the U.S. health care system.\u000a\u000aPeople who are obese are 55 percent more likely to also have depression, and people who depressed are 58 percent more likely to be obese, according to a 2010 study. | Getty\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to find synergistic therapies\u2014or it\u2019s going to be the same kind of messy system in which we spend a lot of money and don\u2019t get any return,\u201d said William Dietz, director of George Washington University\u2019s Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness, who researches obesity interventions.\u000a\u000aA growing body of evidence supports the idea that this kind of coordinated approach could help address both diseases in tandem. A 2011 paper by researchers from the University of Texas-Southwestern found that patients\u2019 depressive symptoms were reduced when physicians gave them prescriptions for weekly exercise sessions, which were supervised at the Cooper Institute in Dallas or at the patient\u2019s home. And in 2014, a study at Duke University found that simply helping obese women maintain their weight\u2014via small lifestyle changes and monthly dietitian check-ins\u2014cut their rates of depression in half.\u000a\u000aStill, this kind of care-syncing is not yet the norm. While the Affordable Care Act promoted coordinated care as part of its efforts to lower costs, those initiatives haven\u2019t yet been directed toward depression and obesity. But federally funded efforts to coordinate care for diabetes and depression could provide a template, said Madhukar Trivedi, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas-Southwestern who was involved in the 2011 study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is going to require a real mind-set change. We have to be thinking at a policy level,\u201d Trivedi said.\u000a\u000aOne reason is cost. Depression and obesity are among the largest drivers of health care cost increases. Obesity already costs the medical system almost $150 billion per year in direct costs, and the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that by 2030, obesity will sap the U.S. economy of an additional $390 billion to $520 billion in lost worker productivity.\u000a\u000aDepression makes the price tag worse. Its most severe variant, major depressive disorder, costs the country more than $200 billion per year in direct costs such as psych visits, medication and other treatments as well as the hours and days in which people afflicted aren\u2019t able to work.\u000a\u000aThe federal government foots a lot of this bill. About 13 million Medicare-eligible senior citizens are obese, according to CDC data from 2012, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Medicaid pays for about 30 percent of the total bill for U.S. mental health care.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are both incredibly burdensome on the health care system. \u2026 They\u2019re both on the rise, and there\u2019s a correlation,\u201d said Dori Steinberg, an assistant research professor at Duke\u2019s Global Health Institute.\u000a\u000aAnd resources to tend to patients with each condition, even individually, are limited.\u000a\u000aThe federal government has worked to expand mental health care access and insurance coverage, but in many parts of the country, few mental health specialists accept insurance, rendering that theoretical benefit useless.\u000a\u000aObesity interventions also fall short. The American Medical Association, a leading doctors\u2019 trade group, dubbed the condition a \u201cdisease\u201d four years ago, and the ACA limited cost sharing for some preventive obesity treatments. Some critics say, though, the benefit doesn\u2019t go far enough in terms of consultations with more specialized health care providers, such as dietitians and nutritionists, to make a meaningful impact. That means patients may get little help until they have gained enough weight or suffered sufficient health consequences that they qualify for more extreme measures, like bariatric surgery.\u000a\u000aSome anti-depressants cause patients to gain weight, which can complicate treatment for patients who have both depression and obesity. | Getty\u000a\u000aAnd there\u2019s the added challenge of finding a physician able to address both problems at once.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-shot thing. Both of these are chronic conditions. They don\u2019t lend themselves to episodic treatment,\u201d said Anita Everett, president of the American Psychiatric Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you take a course of treatment to [make it] go away.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlready, research suggests primary care physicians, who are on the front lines in providing care, aren\u2019t meeting clinical standards for treating depression. Most psychiatrists aren\u2019t trained in weight management.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an important area, and I don\u2019t think people are trained how to do it,\u201d said Dietz.\u000a\u000aProgress has been slow, in part, because of the stigma surrounding both conditions.\u000a\u000aHaving either is \u201clike having the scarlet letter,\u201d suggested Karen Coleman, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Southern California branch. Despite a now vast body of evidence to the contrary, even health professionals are more likely to place some blame on the patient. That makes patients more hesitant to seek care, and physicians don\u2019t necessarily make efforts to provide it.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a long, long way to go before we treat obesity like we do \u2026 heart failure,\u201d Coleman added.\u000a\u000aIn her Ohio practice, McElroy says she has seen the benefits of what she called a self-taught approach to treating obesity and depression together. She screens patients for weight and BMI. And, because some of the medications used to treat mental health conditions can cause weight gain, she tailors what anti-depressants she prescribes, so that they don\u2019t exacerbate comorbid obesity.\u000a\u000aHer patients vouch for her methods.\u000a\u000aSome researchers have found that weekly exercise sessions reduced symptoms of depression. | Getty\u000a\u000aAsk 26-year-old Michael Stewart, who has bipolar disorder.

aVWASHINGTON \u2014 Media bashing has become one of the organizing principles of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. But behind the scenes, the Trump machine is eagerly promoting the nuggets of positive press it receives from the very outlets the president seeks to discredit.\u000a\u000aThe White House director of rapid response, Andy Hemming, 31, spends his days immersed in cable television, Twitter, print and online media to suss out positive stories about Trump, which he blasts back out to his list of more than 1,000 influencers \u2014 mainly reporters, but also television talking heads \u2014 who together craft the overall story of Trump\u2019s presidency.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s nothing new about an administration trying to promote its wins. But in the Trump White House, where Hemming\u2019s job is not to discredit the mainstream media but to celebrate stories the administration likes, it can seem like he is trying to bail out a sinking boat with a teacup.\u000a\u000aAnd it\u2019s a role that feels out of sync with Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the press. Trump spent the first day of his summer break Monday tweetstorming about the country\u2019s major cable networks and newspapers. \u201cHard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is installed on his golf course for a two-week vacation.\u000a\u000aHe followed up later on a wet, unconducive-to-golfing afternoon, with a honed Twitter attack launched at his favorite target: \u201cHow much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat makes it so audacious and confusing is that no president has been so outspoken \u2014 and outrageous \u2014 about impeaching mainstream news outlets\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama\u000a\u000aA New York Times spokesperson said the business is actually growing in profit, income, revenues and paid subscriptions.\u000a\u000aIn July, Trump posted a video of himself wrestling to the ground a man with a CNN logo obscuring his face \u2014 a post that has since been retweeted more than 370,000 times. But Hemming that same month highlighted clips from the network, including one of California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein telling anchor Wolf Blitzer she saw no evidence of collusion between Russian operatives and the Trump campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey don\u2019t always get it wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of mainstream news outlets like The New York Times and CNN. \u201cBut for every one good story we push out, there are probably 150 really bad process stories, or hit pieces, on the administration. We think a lot of times, the stories that we push out have been given very little coverage.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn July 18, for instance, while Trump tweeted about the \u201cFake News story of secret dinner with Putin\u201d \u2014 he called the story \u201csick\u201d \u2014 Hemming was highlighting a story from the allegedly ailing Grey Lady.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe New York Times\u2019 Carl Hulse has a solid explainer on the Senate Democrats\u2019 unprecedented effort to block President Trump\u2019s nominees,\u201d Hemming wrote, with a link to the story. Earlier in July, Hemming emailed out a New York Times piece that he called \u201ca good article on how small businesses across the country are cheering President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris Accord.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s an important role,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign spokesman who worked closely with Hemming from the 2016 war room in Trump Tower. \u201cThere\u2019s so much good news that\u2019s coming out of this administration, that we have to continue pushing all of these positive messages ourselves to remind people there\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d (Miller is now a paid contributor on CNN.)\u000a\u000aHemming, who is paid $89,000 a year, is a career Republican campaign operative who until he entered Trump\u2019s orbit had worked for establishment GOP figures like Meg Whitman, during her failed run for governor in California; Mitt Romney, during his unsuccessful 2012 bid for president; and Greg Abbott, during his successful run for Texas governor. Last year, he worked for former Texas Governor Rick Perry\u2019s campaign before going to the Republican National Committee and being embedded in Trump Tower for the final 100 days of the general election.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s always been a behind-the-scenes operative, associates said, but for the first few weeks of the administration, Hemming was toiling, perhaps for the first time in his life, in total obscurity. Hemming would blast out his carefully curated clips, sometimes multiple times a day, with the goal of driving more positive news coverage.\u000a\u000aBut for weeks, sources inside the White House said, no one informed him that the White House IT system could not handle an email going out to such a big list, and all of his emails were being blocked by a firewall and reaching an audience of zero readers. That glitch has since been corrected, and the administration thinks Hemming is helping to slowly change the course of the coverage it gets.\u000a\u000a\u201cAndy does an incredible job of finding those hidden gems and trying to amplify those positive messages,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe\u2019s quick, and I would say he has a very good pulse on what\u2019s hot, but also on what wasn\u2019t hot but should be.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe declined to comment for this story.\u000a\u000aThe fact-checker column in the newspaper Trump now refers to disparagingly as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d has been highlighted by Hemming and the rapid response team on multiple occasions, for example, for knocking down misleading statements about Trump\u2019s policies made by lawmakers like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Kamala Harris, also a California Democrat.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat makes it so audacious and confusing is that no president has been so outspoken \u2014 and outrageous \u2014 about impeaching mainstream news outlets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, who is also a paid CNN analyst. \u201cIf these outlets are \u2018fake,\u2019 then why should we believe that their positive reporting about the president and the administration is real? It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment that, despite the president\u2019s calculated and persistent assaults, these news sources are very credible.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso undercutting Trump\u2019s constant assaults, Axelrod noted, is how Trump frequently participates in interviews with reporters representing the very news organization he rails against.\u000a\u000aOthers warned that to take Trump literally is to misunderstand the president. \u201cUnderstanding Trump means you have to have a healthy dose of humor and skepticism about the spoken word,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aOf the White House\u2019s efforts to promote stories from the same organizations the president discredits, Fleischer pointed to a moment last March, when former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that the monthly jobs numbers produced by the labor department that Trump had previously discredited \u201cmay have been phony in the past, but it\u2019s very real now.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHow do you square it?\u201d asked Fleischer. \u201cYou square it with a smile.\u201d
