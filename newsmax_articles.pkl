VOne of the fastest growing racial groups in the United States, Latinos will make up about a quarter of the population by 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.\u000a\u000aAfter Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in the 2012 presidential election, the Republican National Committee commissioned the Growth and Opportunity Project to ascertain what had gone wrong. Among its findings, it said that it was \u201cimperative that the RNC changes how it engages with Hispanic communities to welcome in new members of our party.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans have struggled to win a large minority of Latino voters. In 40 years, George W. Bush fared the best, winning 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004. Donald Trump won only 28 percent of Latinos in 2016, just one point better than Romney.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000aWith that in mind, it's obvious that the GOP still has work to do in winning over Latino Americans, especially with the group's sizable presence in several swing states, specifically Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.\u000a\u000aHowever, Republicans have a strong corps of Latino leaders in their ranks. Here, Newsmax has chosen the 50 most influential Latino Republicans based on two criteria: the importance of their positions and the prominence of their platforms.\u000a\u000aTed Cruz \u2014 A Cuban-American, Cruz is the firebrand junior senator from Texas, which has the second largest Latino population of any state. He served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department and made his own run for the Oval Office in 2016. While Cruz\u2019s presidential bid was cut short, he was Donald Trump\u2019s fiercest competition in the Republican primary.\u000a\u000aMarco Rubio \u2014 Florida, where Rubio is the junior senator, has the third largest Latino population of any state. The West Miami native\u2019s fast political ascent began as a city commissioner in 1998 and crested in 2011 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016 but was re-elected to his second term as senator. This son of Cuban immigrants is still one of the youngest senators with plenty of politics ahead of him.\u000a\u000aIleana Ros-Lehtinen \u2014 Born in Cuba, Ros-Lehtinen is the first Latina ever to be elected to Congress. She was also the first Republican woman elected to the House from Florida. She represents Florida\u2019s 27th District. Ros-Lehtinen serves as the chair emeritus of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa and serves on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, all committees that may figure prominently during the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aSusana Martinez \u2014 She is not only the first Latina governor in the U.S., but Martinez, from New Mexico, serves as chairwoman of the Republican Governors Association. Martinez, who is of Mexican descent, was named \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d by Hispanic Business Magazine for her efforts in reducing taxes and making her state more business friendly. Prior to becoming governor, Martinez was an effective district attorney of the 3rd Judicial District of Doña Ana County for 25 years.\u000a\u000aBrian Sandoval \u2014 Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who is of Mexican heritage, was the first Hispanic candidate elected to statewide office in the Silver State. Previously, he served as an attorney general and a judge on the U.S. District Court for Nevada. Sandoval has expressed skepticism regarding President Trump\u2019s initiative to build a wall along the southern U.S. border, and it will be an interesting issue on which to watch him as the popular Republican governor was considered a potential GOP presidential candidate in 2016. Sandoval\u2019s second and final term as Nevada\u2019s governor expires in 2018.\u000a\u000aLincoln Díaz-Balart \u2014 The older brother of U.S. Rep.

She continues to be President Trump's biggest Republican critic.\u000a\u000aGeorge P. Bush \u2014 Son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, George P. Bush serves as the land commissioner in his native state of Texas. His mother, Columba Bush, is originally from Mexico, but is now a U.S. citizen. For the sake of party unity, he endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump, the only Bush to publicly do so, although he admitted it was "a bitter pill," given the things Trump said about his family. Bush is also active in the Navy reserves and Hispanic Republicans of Texas, the latter of which works to promote outreach to Hispanic voters in the state.\u000a\u000aBill Flores \u2014 Ninth-generation Texan Flores\u2019 Spanish ancestors settled in what was then the country\u2019s territory of Mexico in 1725.

His newest initiative is a constitutional amendment to create congressional term limits of 12 years, which will be a real test of his influence.\u000a\u000aLinda Chavez \u2014 A prominent figure in Republican politics since her stint as White House director of public liaison during the Reagan administration, Chavez was honored as a Living Legend by the Library of Congress in April 2000. A year later, she was the first Latina nominated for a Cabinet appointment \u2014 under President George W. Bush for secretary of Labor.

Carlos Curbelo, a son of Cuban exiles, represents Florida\u2019s 26th District.

He previously served as a member of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Board; and before public service, Curbelo was a small-business owner and philanthropist in Miami.\u000a\u000aAlex Mooney \u2014 Representing West Virginia\u2019s 2nd District, Mooney is the first Hispanic elected to Congress from West Virginia.

Mooney has said his mother, a Cuban refugee that escaped imprisonment, and his father, a Vietnam veteran, inspires his American values.\u000a\u000aJohn Sanchez \u2014 The great, great grandson of a 19th-century territorial legislator before New Mexico became a state, Sanchez is the state's 29th lieutenant governor.

aVSoil management is an essential part of farming. The soil type helps farmers decide what crops will grow best because some crops do better with particular types of soil.\u000a\u000aTesting the soil helps determine what nutrients are available or unavailable for growing certain crops. Farmers usually have local agricultural experts test the soil on their land for information on how to proceed in growing crops.\u000a\u000aThe best soil has a balance of nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and others. Certain crops may need more of one nutrient, so farmers put back those ingredients into the soil for better crops.\u000a\u000aHere are six types of soil and what to grow in each:\u000a\u000a1. Loam \u2014 This type of soil helps grow the best possible crops because it provides the necessary elements. Loamy sand contains mostly sand plus clay and silt. It is good for root vegetables, such as carrots and beets, leafy vegetables, and tomatoes, according to SFGate.com.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack\u000a\u000a2. Clay \u2014 Cabbage and broccoli grow well in clay soil, but it may not be good for root vegetables because of its dense texture, writes D. Laverne O\u2019Neal in Hunker. Cherry, pear, maple, and black walnut trees also thrive in clay soil. Edible herbs, including yarrow and red valerian, also benefit from it.\u000a\u000a3. Sand \u2014 Root vegetables, including turnips, parsnips, and carrots, grow well in sandy soil as do pomegranate and fig trees. Bush clover, bayberry, creeping juniper, and thyme are among the herbs that do well in sandy soil.\u000a\u000a4. Silt \u2014 Silty soil is fertile and offers nutrients for development. Lettuce, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and many other vegetables flourish in silt. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, citrus trees, and pomegranate trees also develop well in silt.\u000a\u000aSpecial: World-Famous Cardiologist Reveals Proof: There Is Life After Death\u000a\u000a5. Peat \u2014 Peaty soil provides growth when mixed with rich organic matter, lime, and compost that reduces its acidity, according to Eartheasy. Legumes, root crops, cabbage, and spinach are easily grown in soil that\u2019s well-drained.\u000a\u000a6. Chalk \u2014 Sweet corn, beets, spinach, and cabbage are among the vegetables that benefit from more chalky soil. It is recommended that farmers use fertilizers and balance the pH levels to deal with the alkaline that can sometimes stunt growth.\u000a\u000aTip: Here's How to Never Run Out of Money During Retirement

aVSomething is up, or more likely down, with the U.S. housing market. And the reconstruction after Hurricane Harvey may not do much to help.\u000a\u000aHere's the evidence:\u000a\u000aThe latest take on home-builder sentiment showed that buyer traffic stubbornly remains in negative territory, despite some of the highest readings of the current cycle on builders\u2019 expectations for sales gains in the next six months.\u000a\u000aIn addition, recent mortgage rate declines have not led to an increase in applications to buy a home. Over the past few weeks, purchase activity has slumped to a six-month low, even though rates are at their lowest level since November. This defies a central tenet of the housing market that falling rates naturally lead to an uptick in sales.\u000a\u000aAs for actual sales volumes, both new and existing July home sales missed forecasts by wide margins. At an annualized rate of 571,000, new home sales dropped to a seven-month low, well off their long-term average pace of 727,000. The number of homes on the ground rose to 276,000 units, the highest since June 2009. At July\u2019s pace, it would take 5.8 months to clear the inventory.\u000a\u000aThe existing home sales report that followed was similarly weak, with closings sliding to the lowest since August 2016. Not only was the 5.44-million annualized pace 110,000 units below forecast, July\u2019s figures reveal the all-important spring selling season was something of a bust, given July\u2019s data captured contracts signed from April through June.\u000a\u000aPrices have been and remain the main impediment. The median new home sales price of $313,700 marked the highest July price on record and is up more than six percent over last year\u2019s level. At an annual gain of 6.2 percent, the best that can be said of the median sales price for previously occupied homes is that it\u2019s off the record pace it set in June. Corroborating the slowdown in sales, both the Federal Housing Finance Agency and S&P Case-Shiller home-price indexes have softened unexpectedly.\u000a\u000aAs has been the case since housing collapsed over a decade ago, the missing contingency in the current recovery is the first-time home-buyer. In a normal market, first-timers comprise 40 percent of buyers. In July, they made up a third of the market, which is one of the highest reads of the current cycle.\u000a\u000aWhat's certain is that the run-up in home prices has not been helpful for millennials aiming to stop renting or even move out of their parent\u2019s homes. The latest results from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Confidence Sentiment speak volumes. While all buyers have expressed dismay at home price gains, those between the ages of 18 and 34 have been particularly alarmed.\u000a\u000aThe survey also showed an expanding pool of those with a dour perception on housing. Thanks to high prices, both upper- and lower-income cohorts as well as those in the West and the South now say they\u2019re pessimistic about buying a home. Likewise, prime-age buyers (ages 35-54) are now echoing their younger counterparts\u2019 laments about prices.\u000a\u000aLooking ahead, pending home sales suggest the summer\u2019s data are anything but an aberration. The pending home sales index has fallen in four of the last five months, with July coming in particularly weak, down 0.8 percent compared to the consensus forecast, which called for a rise of 0.4 percent.\u000a\u000aFor years, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, has cited constrained inventories of homes as the main driver of any weakness in the sales figures. After the recent spate of disappointments on the pending home sales front, Yun added the following perspective on prices: Over the past five years, median home prices have risen 38 percent while hourly earnings have increased by just 12 percent. This yawning gap has pushed affordability to its lowest level since 2008.\u000a\u000aTellingly, the most recent data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas revealed a jump in construction worker layoffs. The mitigating factor will be the tremendous demand for workers to repair and eventually rebuild Houston and the surrounding region after the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aWhat is less of a certainty is the long-term effect of the storm. About 1.2 million homes in and around Houston were at moderate to high risk for flooding but aren't in a designated flood zone that would have required insurance. Many will qualify for federal disaster relief. Still, the government program comes in the form of low-interest rate loans to help shoulder the burden of repair costs at a time when many households are already buried in debt with precious little in savings; as the third quarter got underway, the saving rate fell to 3.5 percent, a fresh low for the current cycle.\u000a\u000aAlthough many have drawn comparisons to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Harvey will affect more than twice as many mortgaged properties. According to Black Knight Financial Services, of the 1 million or so mortgaged homeowners in the disaster area, more than 75,000 will become delinquent within two months, and 45,000 are at risk of becoming seriously delinquent or even face foreclosure inside a four-month period.\u000a\u000aAs per the Mortgage Bankers Association, homes in foreclosure nationwide totaled 502,437 in the second quarter, exemplifying the very real potential for Harvey to leave a huge scar on the housing market.\u000a\u000aIt is clear investors are banking on the rebuilding effort becoming its own macroeconomic engine of growth. With housing clearly peaking, the nearer-term risk is that Harvey\u2019s devastation solidifies broader market woes.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aDanielle DiMartino Booth, a former adviser to the president of the Dallas Fed, is the author of "Fed Up: An Insider's Take on Why the Federal Reserve Is Bad for America," and founder of Money Strong LLC.

aVNew research has found for the first time that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and are diagnosed at an earlier age with the condition.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Hormone Health Network, an estimated 5 million to 6 million women in the United States have PCOS, making it one of the most common endocrine conditions in women of childbearing age.\u000a\u000aWomen with the condition produce slightly higher than average amounts of testosterone and other androgen hormones, which can contribute to irregular or absent menstrual periods, infertility, weight gain, acne or excess hair on the face and body.\u000a\u000aWomen who have PCOS also face a higher risk of developing other health problems.\u000a\u000a"Many women with PCOS are obese, but the risk for the development of diabetes in PCOS is unknown," explained one of the study's authors, Dorte Glintborg, from the Odense University Hospital in Denmark.\u000a\u000aTo research a potential link between PCOS and the risk of type 2 diabetes development, the team studied two populations with PCOS. All subjects were pre-menopausal Danish women with a diagnosis of PCOS, with one group of data taken from the National Patient Register (18,477 women) and another from a local sub-group of 1,162 women who were examined at Odense University Hospital in Denmark.\u000a\u000aThe team tested the local participants for insulin and glucose levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and testosterone levels.\u000a\u000aThe women with PCOS were then compared with other females of a similar age who did not have PCOS, nor a previous diagnosis of T2D.\u000a\u000aThe team found that women with PCOS were four times more likely to develop T2D compared to their counterparts who did not have the condition.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the average age for women with PCOS to receive a diagnosis of T2D was 31 years. However, the average age for women without PCOS to receive a diagnosis of T2D was 35 years.\u000a\u000aResearchers also examined other factors related to the development of T2D in PCOS such as age, body mass index (BMI), number of pregnancies and prescriptions for oral contraceptives.\u000a\u000aThe results showed that body mass index, insulin and glucose levels, and triglycerides were also positively associated with development of T2D, however a higher number of births were negatively associated with development of T2D.\u000a\u000aThe authors noted further research is needed to look at the effect of different factors on the risk of T2D development in PCOS, however they added that increasing age should not be considered a risk factor because most cases of diabetes in this study were found before the age of 40.\u000a\u000aGlintborg also commented that, "The increased risk of developing T2D in PCOS is an important finding. Diabetes may develop at a young age and screening for diabetes is important, especially in women who are obese and have PCOS."\u000a\u000aThe findings can be found in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Jeff Flake in 2018, the recently pardoned Arpaio told Newsmax TV that is not his thinking.\u000a\u000aInstead, Arpaio told Monday's "Newsmax Now," his re-entry into politics will be focused on getting other "good Republicans" in office.\u000a\u000a"I don't know whether I want to run for any office," he told hosts Bill Tucker and Jonathan Gilliam. "I will be active trying to get Republicans elected, the good Republicans that is, or help them raise money, which I've been doing for 24 years."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Bush, Mitt Romney, and Rick Perry.\u000a\u000a"Every time they run they come to me for my endorsement," he said, pointing out that when he introduced then-candidate Donald Trump at his first Phoenix rally he predicted Trump would win the White House.\u000a\u000a"It all came true, so I don't forget that," Arpaio said.\u000a\u000aThe former sheriff said he would have great things to say about the president even if he had not pardoned him Friday for a conviction of criminal contempt. Prosecutors said Arpaio's office racially profiled suspects as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aTrump praised Arpaio in a White House press conference Monday where he defended his pardon.\u000a\u000a"He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration," Trump said. "I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started."\u000a\u000aTrump called Arpaio a "patriot" as he listed off several pardons and commutations issued by presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama for people involved in terrorist acts, tax evasion, and disclosing national secrets.\u000a\u000aTrump has faced intense criticism from Democrats and several Republicans, including both Arizona's senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake. Flake, a frequent Trump critic, is up for re-election next year.\u000a\u000aBut the 85-year-old Arpaio told Newsmax the reports of him challenging Flake are overblown.\u000a\u000a"There's a story out from a Washington newspaper, they interviewed me, that asks whether I'm back in politics again," Arpaio said. "So, I said, yeah I'm coming back."\u000a\u000aArpaio said he told his wife he was out of politics after his defeat in November, but then began to reconsider when he saw the relentless attacks on Trump and the divisions in the country.\u000a\u000a"I do still have a lot of support," he said. "So, I told that to the reporter, and he said, 'What office are you running for if you do run?' And I said, 'I don't know if I'm running for any office.' And then he says, 'Would you run against Flake?'"\u000a\u000aArpaio insisted he did not know he would ever run for office again, but then did mention Flake because he opposed Trump pardoning him.\u000a\u000aArpaio said both Flake and McCain should have looked into his case, since they actually are from Arizona.\u000a\u000a"Why didn't they come and ask me the real story about the abuse of the judicial system?" he said, adding Flake is "on a judiciary committee. Why doesn't he look into it? I wish he would look into this sort of affair by the courts."

aVElissa Wall, who was married to her cousin at age 14 in a ceremony overseen by polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs, has won a $16 million lawsuit against the group.\u000a\u000aWall\u2019s lawyer said Wednesday that the decision lets attorneys investigate the secretive group\u2019s bank accounts and property held in states all over the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is hopefully to continue the attack on illegal and criminal conduct so they\u2019ll comport their doctrines to what\u2019s permissible under the U.S. Constitution,\u201d said Wall\u2019s attorney Alan Mortensen.\u000a\u000aIn his ruling, Judge Keith Kelly said that he found the behavior of Jeffs and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \u201cwas so extreme that it went beyond all possible bound of decency and is regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\u201d\u000a\u000aWall plans to use the money to help people leaving the group, which is based along the Utah-Arizona border and has a compound in South Dakota.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can now close these chapters in my life and focus on building a better future for myself and my children,\u201d Wall said in a statement. The state of Utah is also entitled to half the punitive damages in the case, up to $6 million, under state law, Mortensen said.\u000a\u000aLast year, Wall agreed to a $2.75-million settlement with the group\u2019s communal property trust, but her case against Jeffs and the group continued until Tuesday. Neither Jeffs nor his group got a lawyer or defended themselves in the case.\u000a\u000aHer testimony about the 2001 marriage helped convict Jeffs in Utah of being an accomplice to rape, though the verdict was overturned on a technicality.

aVStress-free traveling is just one reason why cruises are the best type of vacation. Passengers can enjoy the sights, sounds, and offerings of different faraway places while leaving the travel logistics to the ship captain.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of activities onboard as well as the adventures that await when the ship reaches port. On top of that, there\u2019s usually not just one port but several destinations to visit. It\u2019s as if cruise passengers get several vacations in one.\u000a\u000aHere are six reasons why cruises are the best type of vacation:\u000a\u000a1. Great value \u2014 For one price, cruise travelers not only enjoy the sea, but they also have food service with meals and buffets throughout the day and night, according to ABC News. Accommodations are provided in comfy quarters and there\u2019s day and evening entertainment. Plus the cost includes travel to different destinations.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Family friendly \u2014 Parents can enjoy dining together while their children enjoy plenty of onboard activities. Many cruise ships offer age-related entertainment for young children or teens. Sit by the pool while the kids play video games or enjoy play areas.\u000a\u000a3. Unique itineraries \u2014 Some destinations are difficult to get to by land. Not with a cruise. Passengers can travel to faraway destinations such as Grenada, Anguilla, Hawaii, Europe, or even the Amazon, which would be more expensive when traveling by plane and staying in hotels, Cruise Critic explains.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Fun while learning \u2014 Many cruise lines include hosts who provide expertise on oceanographic or environmental issues, usually centered around the cruise. There are educational programs for kids on marine life. If the cruise includes faraway journeys to places like the Galapagos or other adventures, expert guides and equipment are available for nature lovers and photographers.\u000a\u000a5. Relaxation \u2014 As soon as the trip begins, there\u2019s no need for vacation planning. Cruise lines let passengers choose the itinerary, cabin, and tours available, Fodors notes. No stress about researching what to do. You only have to unpack once and you\u2019re off.\u000a\u000a6. See the world without hassle \u2014 Flying to Europe, Africa, or India might include frequent dealings with customs, transportation, visas, or language barriers. A cruise package, however, does all the work for you. You get transportation to places wherever you land. English-speaking tour guides are immediately available in foreign countries.\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aShould the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVAfter announcing millions of people were impacted by an unprecedented hack on its systems, Equifax Inc. faced a customer service nightmare as panicked masses turned to a website and customer service line set up to answer whether their most sensitive information had leaked.\u000a\u000aEquifax first learned of the breach in late July, but announced the issue affecting as many as 143 million people on Thursday evening. Some of the main ingredients for identity theft\u2014including Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and driver\u2019s license data\u2014were compromised in the hack. Some credit card information was also put at risk.\u000a\u000aIn revealing this 21st century catastrophe, the credit reporting service set up a website so users could quickly assess if their information had been made vulnerable. Users, however, were asked to enter the kind of information they\u2019re often warned not to reveal online, in this case a combination of their last name and the last six digits of their Social Security number. The request was met with skepticism, as many already shaken consumers felt unsafe giving up crucial identity data to a company that just admitted being penetrated. A malfunctioning \u201ccaptcha,\u201d a program used to distinguish humans from bots, added irony to insult.\u000a\u000aThree senior executives, Chief Financial Officer John Gamble, President of U.S. Information Solutions Joseph Loughran, and Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, sold stock worth almost $1.8 million in the days following the company\u2019s discovery of the hack, potentially the largest in history.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for Equifax said the men \u201chad no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time.\u201d After news of the hack broke, the company\u2019s shares fell 13 percent and \u201cEquifax\u201d became the number one trending topic on Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am unable to tell you whether you are impacted\u201d\u000a\u000aIf a user chose last night to enter their information on the Equifax website to see if they had been affected, one of three messages appeared: that the user had indeed been impacted by the cyberattack, that they hadn\u2019t been impacted, or an unclear message listing a date at which the user could enroll in Equifax\u2019s \u201cTrustedID Premier\u201d service without further information as to whether their identity had been stolen. The third option listed a date and said: \u201cPlease be sure to mark your calendar as you will not receive additional reminders. On or after your enrollment date, please return to faq.trustedidpremier.com and click the link to continue through the enrollment process.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot Equifax\u2019s finest hour, users complained. After receiving this message, one less-than-satisfied Twitter denizen wrote: \u201cGreat customer service: put all burden on me.\u201d Another criticized the company for only offering one year of their \u201cTrustedID\u201d service.\u000a\u000aCustomer service agents contacted by phone on the emergency telephone line said they couldn\u2019t provide further clarity on the matter. One agent, who identified himself as Kevin, said he worked for a third party customer service agency hired by Equifax.\u000a\u000aThough the telephone line was set up to help customers determine whether they had been put at risk by the breach, the operator said he had no access to such information.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt this time, we do not have a database of impacted individuals. I am unable to tell you whether you are impacted,\u201d Kevin explained. Another customer service agent, reached via phone according to an account in Fast Company, said they weren\u2019t familiar with the hack at all.\u000a\u000aEquifax didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment made outside normal business hours.

aVTarget Corp. said on Friday that it lowered prices on thousands of items, from cereal to baby formula, further hurting retail stocks already pressured by Kroger Co's disappointing quarterly results spurred by price cuts.\u000a\u000aTarget, which vowed earlier in the year to aggressively clamp down on prices to compete with rivals Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com, said it had spent months reassessing the prices of everyday items such as milk, eggs, razors and bath tissue.\u000a\u000aThe retailer, which said it would continue to offer discounts on some products in addition to the price-cuts, added that it had also eliminated more than two-thirds of its price and offer call-outs.\u000a\u000aThe retailer's shares were down as much as 4.7 percent in midday trading on Friday, in-line with a slump among retail stocks after Kroger reported price cuts hurting its bottom line.\u000a\u000aTarget wants to make it easier for customers to spot lower prices by removing the guesswork that comes with temporary deals, Mark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, said in a blog post.\u000a\u000aA-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said the move might initially cost Target in margins, but that lower prices and fewer temporary price cuts may also drive sales volumes that could eventually offset eroding margins.\u000a\u000a"At the end of the day people just want everyday lower prices and that is what Target is aiming to do."\u000a\u000aWhen Target first announced in February that it would cut prices and miss full-year profit estimates, its shares plunged to a 2-1/2-year low.\u000a\u000aLike Target, Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket company, has slashed prices on staples such as milk and eggs to fend off competition from Wal-Mart, discounters Lidl and Aldi, and the newly merged Amazon and Whole Foods Market.\u000a\u000aAmazon.com's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods has the grocery industry on edge, worried that the online retail giant could upend the fresh food business in the way it did with books and electronics.\u000a\u000aAmazon last month lowered prices on some Whole Foods groceries including avocados and beef.\u000a\u000a"I don't think this came out of nowhere. (Target) were clearly picking up on the signals and the consumer's response to Amazon and it is clear to me Amazon encroaching on their space," A-Line Partners analyst Gabriella Santaniello said.\u000a\u000aShares in Amazon were down 0.7 percent, while Wal-Mart was down about 2 percent and Kroger's stock tumbled nearly 10 percent, hitting a 3-1/2 year low.

Sanders responded in mock disbelief.\u000a\u000a"Does anyone really believe that?\u000a\u000a"The truth is, the real story is that the ideas we brought forth during that campaign, which was so 'crazy and radical,' have increasingly become mainstream. I talked about a $15 an hour minimum wage \u2014 Hillary did not. We've got 31 co-sponsors for $15 an hour minimum wage. We talked about a trillion-dollar infrastructure. We talked about making healthcare a right of all people through Medicare for All. It is becoming mainstream within the Democratic Party."\u000a\u000aSanders argued, unlike Clinton's shift to the left, his policies were long a part of his idea to change America through progressive populism, and his "political revolution" are beliefs he has "always" talked about.\u000a\u000aIn Clinton's book, the former secretary of state charges Sanders' White House bid caused "lasting damage" to her campaign.

aVSeeing the devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and of wildfires out West, one cannot help but think about the crucial role that government plays in our lives. But while we accept, even celebrate, the role of government in the wake of such disasters, we are largely blind to the need for government to mitigate these kinds of crises in the first place.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEver since Ronald Reagan, much of America has embraced an ideological framework claiming that government is the source of our problems. Reagan famously quipped, "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."\u000a\u000aReagan argued for a retreat from the vision of an activist state and advocated instead for a strictly limited role for government, one dedicated to core functions like national defense. Outside of these realms, he believed, government should simply encourage the private sector and market forces.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aReagan's worldview grew out of the 1970s \u2014 a period marked by fiscal mismanagement, government overreach and slowing growth. It might have been the right attitude for its time. But it has stayed in place for decades as a rigid ideology, even though we have entered a new age in which America has faced a very different set of challenges, often desperately requiring an activist government. This has been a bipartisan abdication of responsibility.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor decades now, we have watched as stagnant wage growth for 90 percent of Americans has been coupled with supercharged growth for the richest few, leading to widening inequality on a scale not seen since the Gilded Age. It has been assumed that the federal government could do nothing about this expanding gap, despite much evidence to the contrary.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe have watched China enter the global trade system and take advantage of its access to Western markets and capital, while still maintaining a massively controlled internal economy and pursuing predatory trade practices. And we have assumed that the American government can't do anything about it, because any action would be protectionist.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe watched as financial institutions took on more and more risk, with other people's money, effectively gambling in a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose system. Any talk of regulation was seen as socialist. Even after the system blew up, causing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the calls soon came to deregulate the financial sector once again because, after all, government regulation is obviously bad.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn this same period, technology companies have grown in size and scale, often using first-mover advantage to establish quasi-monopolies and quash competition. The digital economy was supposed to empower the individual entrepreneur, but it has instead become one in which four or five companies utterly dominate the global landscape. A new technology company today aspires simply to be bought by Google or Facebook. And we assume that the federal government should have had no role in shaping this vast new economy. That would be activist and bad. Better for government to simply observe the process, like a passive spectator watching a new Netflix drama.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd then there is climate. These hurricanes have not been caused by global warming, but their frequency and intensity have likely been magnified by climate change. Particularly calamitous hurricanes have their names retired, and in the last 20 years there have been about as many names retired as in the preceding 40 years. California has had more than 6,400 wildfires this year. The 17 hottest years on record have all taken place in the last two decades.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, we have been wary of too much government activism. This is true not just in tackling climate change but in other areas that have contributed to the storms' destructive power. Houston chose not to have any kind of zoning that limited development, even in flood-prone areas, paving over thousands of acres of wetlands that used to absorb rainwater and curb flooding. The chemical industry has been able to convince Washington to exercise a light regulatory touch, so there is limited protection against fires and contamination, something that was made abundantly clear in the last couple of weeks. And now, of course, low-tax and low-regulation Texas has come to the federal government, hat in hand, asking for more than $150 billion to rebuild its devastated state.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are living in an age of revolutions, natural and human, that are buffeting individuals and communities. We need government to be more than a passive observer of these trends and forces. It needs to actively shape and manage them. Otherwise, the ordinary individual will be powerless. I imagine that this week, most people in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico would be delighted to hear the words, "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFareed Zakaria hosts CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS," and makes regular appearances on shows such as ABC's "This Week" and NBC's "Meet The Press."

aVNew Hampshire's secretary of state says he won't step down from President Donald Trump's commission on election fraud despite calls from the state's congressional delegation to do so.\u000a\u000aAll four members of the delegation say fellow Democrat Bill Gardner should step down because the panel's vice chairman is using irrelevant data to rehash false claims.\u000a\u000aRepublican Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach on Thursday said data about how many people failed to get New Hampshire driver's licenses after using out-of-state licenses for voter registration is proof of fraud that likely led to Sen. Maggie Hassan's victory over Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in November.\u000a\u000aGardner told The Associated Press on Friday that he doesn't condone Kobach's claims, but will remain on the commission because it's important to figure out why Americans are losing trust in the election process.

aVPresident Donald Trump's decision to reach across the aisle to Democrats this week may eventually lead to conservative Republicans being blamed for a lack of progress on issues, commentator Erick Erickson wrote.\u000a\u000aIn a piece for The Resurgent, Erickson argued that the deal Trump struck with Democrats over a Hurricane Harvey aid package that included raising the debt ceiling has a familiar tone.\u000a\u000a"Remember when Donald Trump blamed the House Freedom Caucus members for the failure to repeal Obamacare? Good times. All they wanted to do was actually repeal Obamacare," Erickson wrote. "The House Republican leadership drafted legislation that did not repeal it, but claimed it did. They got Trump to savage the conservatives in the House to try to get them to cave.\u000a\u000a"It is going to happen again."\u000a\u000aErickson predicted that congressional leaders will try to work together this fall on legislation and will come to a stalemate, at which point they will tell Trump that the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 a far right group of lawmakers \u2014 was holding things up, just as they did with a healthcare bill earlier this year.\u000a\u000aLawmakers have a full plate for the fall, with issues such as healthcare, tax reform, and immigration all staring at them in the face.\u000a\u000aFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Thursday Trump's decision to work with Democrats occurred because he wants to "continue a momentum."

aVPresident Donald Trump made a deal with Democratic leaders on the debt ceiling as a way to keep up progress that can come from both Republicans and Democrats working together such as in the efforts to handle the effects of Hurricane Harvey, according to Newt Gingrich Thursday.\u000a\u000a"He was trying to continue a momentum of being together, of doing something together, and of showing that the American government can act quickly," the former House speaker said Thursday on Fox News' "Hannity."\u000a\u000a"I think that's another signal to the American people that maybe some things are coming together\u2026 maybe he (Trump) in fact is going to be able to pull the country together the way they came together in Texas."\u000a\u000aGingrich said he believed the founding fathers would be pleased with the work of federal, local, and state officials in the handling of the storm.\u000a\u000a"The founding fathers developed a Constitution for a limited, but effective government. They didn't want a sloppy government. They didn't want an incompetent government \u2026 I think they would look at what's happening in Texas and say the system is working at every level."\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the former speaker also addressed Trump's actions in working with Democrats during an interview on "Fox & Friends."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPresident Trump saw that action needed to be taken to handle the approaching storms, according to Gingrich. "I think Trump saw a situation, with everything he just saw in Houston, now looking at what's coming in Florida, and his thinking was, 'We've got to get some movement in Washington\u2026 I'm going to get some money to Houston, and to do that, I've got to get the debt ceiling taken care of.'"\u000a\u000a"I don't think this is some gigantic earthquake. I think it's an immediate tactical move by the president to get some momentum," the former speaker said.

aVA quick glance at media headlines might lead one to believe that the decision regarding so-called "Dreamers" and their immigration status is an easy one; that it can be made on the basis of what's right, what would be compassionate, and what the end result would be, without regard to process. But, as often happens, reality is more complex. It's the process as well as the end result that matters. Let's step back and review what's happened.\u000a\u000aIn the spring of 2011, at a Univision townhall, President Obama was asked about using executive order to change immigration policy. His answer, "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case . . . Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws . . . for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president."\u000a\u000aEighteen months later, Obama had determined that the end was more important than the means . . . at least temporarily. On September 15, 2012, he spoke about the "new actions my administration will take . . . specifically for certain young people sometimes called 'Dreamers' . . . you can one day earn your citizenship . . . this is not amnesty, this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure . . . Congress needs to act."\u000a\u000aOn July 29, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other state attorneys general sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting that "the Secretary of Homeland Security phase out the DACA program." It noted that "this request does not require the Executive Branch to immediately rescind DACA [nor does it] . . . require the federal government to remove any alien."\u000a\u000aThis request included the carrot that "If, by September 5, 2017, the Executive Branch agrees to rescind . . . then the plaintiffs . . . will voluntarily dismiss their lawsuit currently pending in the Southern District of Texas." And the stick, "otherwise, the complaint in that case will be amended to challenge both the DACA program and the remaining Expanded DACA permits."\u000a\u000aThis Tuesday, on the deadline, Sessions announced that the program "is being rescinded." He also noted that there was a six-month implementation period set up so Congress could fix this legislatively.\u000a\u000aA statement from President Donald Trump noted that he does not favor "punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents." Trump also reconfirmed Obama's stance in 2011 "that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang."\u000a\u000aBoth Sessions and Trump pushed the problem to the legislature. That's where, in 2011 and 2012, Obama thought it belonged.\u000a\u000aSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., echoed Obama's 2011 comments. "However well-intentioned, President Obama's DACA program was a clear abuse of executive authority, an attempt to create law out of thin air . . . Congress writes laws, not the president."\u000a\u000aRyan also recognized the human element. "At the heart of this issue are young people who came to this country through no fault of their own, and for many of them it's the only country they know," he said. "It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the president's leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country."\u000a\u000aSen. Lindsey Graham, R., S.C., has called on Congress to act this month, requesting that it pass the DREAM Act, a legislative solution to provide legal status to individuals currently covered by DACA.\u000a\u000aWhile this is one more issue to add to Congress' already busy schedule - it's their responsibility, not the president's, to make the laws. The reason that we have a Constitution with checks and balances and a slow process is to create a system that works slowly but deliberately. A dictator could move faster, but the process would be much more dangerous.\u000a\u000aBe wary of those who advocate the means as more important than the process, and those who fan the fires of publicity with false information and half-truths, stirring up controversy rather than working to create a real solution.\u000a\u000aIn 2018, the Democrats will need to win 24 seats to flip the House. On the Senate side, of the 33 seats up for election, 23 are Democratic, 2 independent and just 8 Republican. How the Congress handles the issues on its plate \u2014 aid for Hurricane Harvey, (and potentially Irma), the debt ceiling, government funding, and tax reform \u2014 will determine the path of the elections next year.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJackie Gingrich Cushman is the co-author, along with her father, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, of the book "5 Principles for a Successful Life: From Our Family to Yours."

aVMartin Shkreli may have gone too far posting a $5,000 bounty on Facebook for someone to "grab" hair from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors now say the former pharmaceutical executive once dubbed "the most hated man in America" should be locked up immediately.\u000a\u000aShkreli, who was found guilty by a jury last month of defrauding investors in two hedge funds, has been out on bail awaiting his sentencing hearing. He\u2019s engaged in a "pattern of threats and harassment\u201d and his bail should be revoked, prosecutors told a Brooklyn, New York, federal judge in a filing Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo on HRC\u2019s book tour, try to grab a hair from her," Shkreli posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 4. "I must confirm the sequencing I have. Will pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton. Payment after the sequence matches. Good luck patrollers."\u000a\u000aClinton is slated to appear at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Union Square in New York City on Sept. 12, according to the store. A hearing on Shkreli\u2019s bail is set for Sept. 14.\u000a\u000aClick Here to Read More: Shkreli Decries \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 Following His Fraud Conviction\u000a\u000aShkreli, notorious for raising the price of the potentially life-saving drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent, faces as long as 20 years in prison, although he\u2019s likely to serve much less. He was convicted of three of eight charges, including securities fraud. He was acquitted of fraud charges related to allegations that he looted his drug company to pay off his hedge-fund investors.\u000a\u000aProsecutors Jacquelyn Kasulis and Alixandra Smith argued Shkreli not only appears to have violated state and federal laws prohibiting threats against the immediate family members of former presidents, but that he also has a history of harassing specific women. They noted that in January he was banned from Twitter after he invited Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca to be his date for the inauguration of President Donald Trump and later doctored photos of himself with her.\u000a\u000a\u2018However Inappropriate\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cWe take the matter seriously and intend to address the issue responsibly,\u201d Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, said in an email Thursday night. \u201cHowever inappropriate some of Mr Shkreli\u2019s postings may have been, we do not believe that he intended harm and do not believe that he poses a danger to the community.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral hours after Shkreli\u2019s bounty offer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair was reported by the media, he edited the Facebook post, saying it was "satire, meant for humor."\u000a\u000aBut prosecutors said Shkreli\u2019s comments were viewed as a threat by the U.S. Secret Service, which launched an investigation and has since "expended significant additional resources to ensure Secretary Clinton\u2019s protection."\u000a\u000aKasulis and Smith said that the Secret Service has sought to interview Shkreli but he declined, saying on his Facebook page, "I am declining that interview -- schedule is full. I will be peacefully protesting the Hillary Clinton book signing in NYC, chanting \u2018Lock her up.\u2019"\u000a\u000aThe government said that Shkreli, who\u2019s been a long-time critic of Hillary Clinton, has gone beyond merely posting comments on social media. On Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton became physically ill during a memorial service at the World Trade Center site, he traveled to the Manhattan apartment of her daughter Chelsea Clinton, where the former secretary of state was taken to recuperate. Shkreli stood outside the building, heckled her and spent two hours live-streaming while making comments, prosecutors said.\u000a\u000a"Shkreli\u2019s own prior actions, and his influence over others who have previously acted in reliance of his statements, demonstrate why the government views his latest actions with concern," prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aTaxes, Expenses\u000a\u000aIn June, while Shkreli was awaiting trial, Brafman sought to have his bail reduced from $5 million to $3 million to allow him to pay his taxes and legal defense expenses. At the time, prosecutors said the ex-executive had plenty of cash, citing a recent series of postings he\u2019d made on social media.\u000a\u000aThe government said Shkreli told court officials that he was worth $70 million and owns a Picasso, an unreleased Lil Wayne album and one of the original "Enigma" machines, which was used to break German codes during World War II. He also recently promised a Princeton University student $40,000 for solving a mathematical proof, she said.\u000a\u000aIn a May 26 Facebook post, Shkreli offered a $100,000 bounty to find the killer of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, Smith said. In addition, he frittered away $2 million buying an unreleased double album by hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, the prosecutor said.\u000a\u000aShkreli recently put that album up for auction on Ebay, where by Thursday evening, the offer had reached more than $1 million after fierce bidding for the double-CD master recording.\u000a\u000aThe case is U.S. v. Shkreli, 15-cr-0637, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

aVWhile some in America complain about President Trump, in Israel he is a rock star.\u000a\u000aI just left Israel after meeting with top officials, media personalities, tech entrepreneurs, and many citizens from all walks of life.\u000a\u000aThe overwhelming view was that America was lucky to have a strong and resolute president like Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are well informed and especially clued in on U.S. media \u2013 many can catch CNN and Fox News on TV \u2013 and they expressed bafflement to me that the American media has been so hostile to President Trump.\u000a\u000aFor the Jewish state, Trump is a breath of fresh air. After eight years of Obama, who tilted U.S. policy toward Iran and gave Israel a cold shoulder, many are breathing a sigh of relief.\u000a\u000aA recent Jerusalem Post poll found that 61 percent of Israel's Jews believe Trump is "pro-Israel" and a Pew survey of all nations found Israel to be the second strongest supporter of Trump, with 56 percent saying they had full confidence in him. (The first was the Philippines with 69 percent expressing support.)\u000a\u000aSenior Israeli officials I spoke with say President Trump has been the most supportive of any U.S. president in recent memory, including George W. Bush, who also was quite popular.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are on the front line of freedom. They are surrounded by hostile states. In their mind, appeasement is dangerous and there is little margin for error when their security is at stake.\u000a\u000aOne high-ranking Israeli official told me that the equation for Israel has changed because of three key Trump officials: Jared Kushner, the president's special adviser, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aKushner, to whom the president has given the task of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, understands that Israel is the cornerstone of regional stability.\u000a\u000aPrevious administrations typically began their peace process by blaming Israel. Kushner took a different approach by affirming Israel as a U.S. ally.\u000a\u000aBoth Mattis and McMaster, the official said, grasp the strategic role Israel has played for U.S. security in the region and they have been stalwart in their support.\u000a\u000aToday, under Trump, ISIS is being crushed.\u000a\u000aQatar, a Gulf state that has "played both sides" but consistently helps fund the bad guys, including the Muslim Brotherhood, is being contained.\u000a\u000aTrump is also taking Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism as a great threat to the region. Trump has been praised for being willing to tackle the Iranian problem as he is tackling North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump's outreach to Putin could be crucial in dealing with Iran and North Korea, one official said.\u000a\u000aI first came to Israel at the age of 19 as a college student.\u000a\u000aIsrael was then just over three decades old, a scrawny teenager on the world stage. Now Israel is a muscular adult, not only the military power of the region, but a global hub for technology and culture.\u000a\u000aLife in Israel was challenging for its citizens back in those student days of mine. Today Israelis enjoy a first world standard of living.\u000a\u000aThrough the years the people haven't changed.

aVConservative icon President Ronald Reagan has a famous Eleventh Commandment that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) foolishly disregards to his \u2014 and the GOP's \u2014 political peril. It is thus: Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican. Yet, for the enticing glow of a TV camera \u2014 and the gotcha questions of a liberal interviewer \u2014 he will say just about anything:\u000a\u000a\u201c[Attorney General] Jeff Sessions is wrong. These kids are not taking jobs from American citizens, they're part of our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy any legal definition, citizens make up America; this is true of every sovereign nation on earth. As Sen. Graham received his J.D. from the University of South Carolina in 1981, one would assume he comprehends the distinction. After all, the law is unambiguous: either one resides stateside legitimately, or not.\u000a\u000aOnly one who slept through law school could possibly take the position that AG Sessions is incorrect regarding the \u201cDreamers.\u201d Specifically, Barack Obama's June 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was an overreaching executive order. Such rule breaking is the purvey of emperors or would-be kings: never any Constitution-respecting U.S. president (like Trump). In fact, Mr. Graham should be incensed that his lawmaking role had been so roguishly usurped by DACA: not defending the undeserving recipients of this ultra-constitutional farce.\u000a\u000aGiven Mr. Graham's inexplicable attitude, isn't it disconcerting that this senior senator has been a member of Congress for more than two decades? In all that time, why hasn't his ilk resolved the illegal migration problem? Moreover, rather then taking Mr. Obama to task for creating this immigration mess, Mr. Graham publicly criticizes a member of his own party for following the spirit, and the letter, of the law?\u000a\u000aWhy do so many prominent Republicans like he, John McCain (R-AZ) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) \u2014 indigenous Washington \u201cswamp\u201d creatures one and all \u2014 defend their do-nothing status quo? At every turn, it seems, they offer nothing more than full-throated excuses such as, laughably, McConnell's:\u000a\u000a\u201cOur new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before, and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the Democratic process.\u201d\u000a\u000aTherefore, one can understand why the can-do attitude of a results-driven, private sector capitalist would challenge the bureaucratic intricacies of government that lifelong politicians hide behind. Consequently, a main reason why President Trump was elected: to \u201cshake things up\u201d that badly need it! Insanely, these RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) undermine him and the agenda that he \u2014 and they \u2014 were elected upon! Why are they indistinguishable from their truth afflicted Democratic counterparts?\u000a\u000aOnce again, Mr. Graham is mistaken when he, as Democrats, blithely claims that \u201cDreamers\u201d are not siphoning resources \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 that should be reserved for U.S. citizens. Indeed, how can this \u201cleader\u201d ignore the negative impacts of the undocumented? One telling example is taxpayer funded public school education. Per the National Center for Educational Statistics:\u000a\u000a\u201cTotal expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States in 2013\u201314 amounted to $634 billion, or $12,509 per public school student enrolled in the fall (in constant 2015\u201316 dollars).\u201d\u000a\u000aFor context, per Pew Center statistics, some 11 million illegal immigrants reside in the United States. Of those, approximately 17 percent are under the age of 18. As a typical pre-college education is twelve years, at $12,509 per year for 1,870,000 illegals amounts to: $280,701,960,000! Furthermore, related to employment, Pew Hispanic Center puts the number of illegal aliens in the workforce at 8 million. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for full time workers in the United States in the final quarter of 2016 was $44,148 per year. That amounts to $353,184,000,000 in lost citizens' wages. How's that not taking from the fiscally abused taxpayers who also pay Lindsey Graham's yearly salary of $174,000? Is he just insulated or completely obtuse?\u000a\u000aAfter more than seven and a half months of GOP inaction and broken promises (read: Obamacare repeal) what's clear is that RINOs, as he, care nothing about their ill-used constituents. You know, the voters who elevated his kind to majorities in Congress. So, why the utter disconnect by the upper echelon of the Republican Party?\u000a\u000aIt turns out these folks have a political syndrome akin to Jan Brady's Marcia envy. For those unfamiliar with the sitcom \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d (1969-1974), Jan was her family's insecure loner, the often marginalized middle child to her popular paragon of an older sister. Beautiful and talented, Marcia naturally attracted attention overshadowing her inferior sibling. Like Jan, RINOs desperately want to be liked \u2014 above all else! Ironically by the Trump-hating liberal clique that is the MSM. However, the press is populated by propagandist \u201cmean girls\u201d unwilling to lavish the same slavish devotion they habitually bestow on Democrats. Hence, RINOs utter soft, milquetoast phrases, as exemplified above, mimicking progressive perspectives. Specifically, that Lindsey Graham wrongly sees the offspring of lawbreakers as part of our societal fabric is inconsistent with immigration law \u2014 and the will of American patriots. How then can he also support funding Trump's southern border wall?\u000a\u000aTo play both sides of an issue by subtly pandering \u2014 to go as the political winds dictate \u2014 typifies gelatinous RINOs, and polarizing liberals. Thanks to ongoing media spin, the electorate is likely to ignore Democrats' many untruths, but they will expose the GOP's lack of legislative accomplishments. At this rate, Mr. Graham will likely find himself, and his party, consigned to the minority after the 2018 midterm elections. Meanwhile, the debt keeps growing; the Obamacare repeal failed (by RINO John McCain's deciding vote); tax reform is uncertain; and the voters have lost faith in clearly feckless Congressional Republicans. Rather than embracing the daily opportunities to follow Trump's lead, this backbencher will find himself returned there.\u000a\u000aStill, a cushy office, a six-figure salary, and the trappings of power are nice booby prizes. That's certainly enough to build the flagging self-esteem of the Jan Bradys of the world, anyway. But, if Sen. Graham wants to truly be a winner \u2014 like Marcia Brady, Donald Trump, and Ronald Reagan \u2014 he needs to relentlessly champion conservatism via the priorities set forth by this president forthwith. To that end, focusing on the concerns of his fellow citizens \u2014 rather than parroting the bleeding heart narratives of the left \u2014 would be a vast improvement. In the final analysis, being an ineffectual RINO fosters scorn and mistrust from every corner. It guarantees failure: no matter which side Lindsey Graham finds himself on.\u000a\u000aDavid L.

aVIt\u2019s hard to know which is worse, the lying or the dying. A bacterial infection called C. diff is the No. 1 hospital-infection killer. It kills as many people as AIDS and more people than dreaded Staph infections.\u000a\u000aWhat about the lying? Well, hospital personnel tell patients and families that antibiotics are to blame. The real culprit is inadequate cleaning in hospitals.\u000a\u000aC. diff spreads through the hospital on nurses\u2019 uniforms, wheelchairs, bed rails, call buttons and other surfaces. It\u2019s invisible, and it can survive on these surfaces for months. Patients touch unclean objects near their own bed, picking up C. diff on their hands. Then they pick up food with their contaminated hands, and swallow the germ along with their sandwich or apple.\u000a\u000aOnce in the G.I. tract, C. diff raises havoc, overpowering other bacteria inside your body and causing severe diarrhea. True, you\u2019re especially vulnerable if you\u2019re on antibiotics, but those medicines don\u2019t cause C. diff. The germ you\u2019ve swallowed is to blame.\u000a\u000aHow virulent is this germ? A patient who goes into the hospital with one problem and then contracts C. diff is 4.5 times as likely to die as a patient hospitalized with the same diagnosis who doesn\u2019t get C. diff. A shocking 9 percent of patients with C. diff don\u2019t survive their hospital stay.\u000a\u000aMost patients pick up C. diff in the hospital, or they swallowed the germ during a nursing home stay before getting to the hospital, or they picked it up in a doctor\u2019s office. In all cases, dirty surfaces are to blame.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s an answer to this problem. The Mayo clinic reduced C. diff 79 percent in a pilot project by doing one thing: wiping the frequently touched surfaces around patients\u2019 beds once a day with a bleach wipe. Bleach kills C. diff.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019d think hospitals everywhere would be scrubbing surfaces to duplicate this success. The manpower used to mop floors could be redirected to cleaning surfaces patients actually touch. Rigorous cleaning is needed, because C. diff is encased in a hard shell, which makes it harder to kill on surfaces than the AIDS virus, for example.\u000a\u000aHarder to kill on surfaces, but easier to deal with in every other way. It\u2019s a matter of cleaning, not addressing drug addiction or unsafe sex. Keep the surfaces around a patient\u2019s bed meticulously clean, and C. diff can be nearly eradicated.\u000a\u000aThe Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths donates printed tray cards for hospitals to remind patients to wash their hands before eating and avoid putting their knife and fork on any surface except a clean plate.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re going to the hospital to visit someone, don\u2019t bring flowers or candy. Instead, bring a canister of bleach wipes and a pair of gloves. You could be saving a life.\u000a\u000aWhat else can you do? If you need to be hospitalized yourself, check to see which hospital in your area has the lowest infection rate. You can find out through Medicare\u2019s Hospital Compare website or your own state\u2019s health department website. Thirty-seven states now require hospitals to report their infection rates and disclose them. You can find out more about these reports at hospitalinfection.org.\u000a\u000aThe reports show that the risk of getting an infection in some hospitals is ten times higher than in others. Yet often people pick a hospital based on convenience, or a friends\u2019 recommendation, or where their doctor practices.\u000a\u000aThat can be a big mistake. In many hospitals these days, your own doctor is MIA. About three-quarters of hospitals now use hospitalists. Your own doctor won\u2019t be in charge. All the more reason to choose a hospital carefully.\u000a\u000aYour life could depend on it.\u000a\u000aBetsy McCaughey, Ph.D., is Chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.\u000a\u000aRID is a 501(c)3 nonprofit.

aVLivestock farms are for people who want to raise animals for business or pleasure. Not everyone is cut out to be a livestock farmer, so knowing about livestock farming helps before starting out.\u000a\u000aLivestock farming may include everything from beef and dairy cattle to pigs, goats, sheep, horses, and even birds. For farmers, it\u2019s a great way to get back into nature, but it also provides the community, the nation, and the world with the products of agriculture.\u000a\u000aHere are six things for farmers to know about livestock farms:\u000a\u000a1. Business plan \u2014 Like any other endeavor, starting a livestock farm means setting goals and developing a plan. This is necessary for hobby or commercial farming. Planning is a way to know how much it will cost for the farm and how much you can charge at a fair price to make it profitable, according to PennState Extension.\u000a\u000aUrgent: Are You Eating These Cancer-Causing Foods?\u000a\u000a2. Love the work \u2014 Raising livestock may be something you want to do, but you\u2019ll have to love it to succeed. Ask farmers about their experiences to learn more. You may have worked on a farm, but knowing all factors involved in livestock farming is essential before making an initial investment.\u000a\u000a3. Know the resources \u2014 The land purchased for a livestock farm can differ, depending on whether you\u2019re raising pigs or cattle. Certain breeds are raised better on certain pastures or land. Stock selection and where a farmer buys livestock also play a part in starting a farm.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Full-time responsibilities \u2014 No matter the size of the farm, a livestock farmer needs to be on hand 24 hours a day. The reasons include everything from feeding a baby animal to retrieving escaped cattle or repairing damage to fencing, Hobby Farms points out. Injured animals are also sometimes in need of round-the-clock care.\u000a\u000a5. Ups and downs \u2014 The agriculture business faces market downturns as with any other business. Aside from their own needs, farmers must be able to take care of their livestock even in bad economic times. Financial resources are needed for the unexpected.\u000a\u000a6. Family and community support \u2014 Some farmers succeed by doing most of the work themselves to curtail costs. Most beginning farmers benefit from family support for labor and advice, explains the University of Wisconsin. Building up credit and community relations also provide much-needed support.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Don\u2019t Make These Mistakes With Allergy Drugs

aVIt's rich that rule of law-scoffing Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Dick Durbin grilled one of President Trump's judicial nominees, law professor Amy Coney Barrett, for placing her religious beliefs above the law.\u000a\u000aDuring Barrett's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, Durbin asked her, "Do you consider yourself an orthodox Catholic?"\u000a\u000aApparently, Durbin thought he had Barrett dead to rights because of assertions she made in a law review article she co-wrote with her law professor in 1998 as a third-year student at Notre Dame Law School. In the article, "Catholic Judges in Capital Cases," the authors discussed the question of whether "orthodox" Catholic judges (and other judges morally opposed to the death penalty) should sit in death penalty cases.\u000a\u000aIn these cases, the judges are faced with the dilemma of being bound "by oath, professional commitment, and the demands of citizenship to enforce the death penalty" while "also (being) obliged to adhere to their church's teaching on moral matters."\u000a\u000aOn reviewing the Roman Catholic Church's teachings and the relevant federal statutes, the authors concluded that judges faced with such a dilemma should recuse themselves in applicable cases, thereby honoring their moral duty without violating their legal duty.\u000a\u000aIn an explanatory footnote, the authors explained they were using the term "orthodoxy" in a limited context to describe those following the church's teachings on this issue. They were careful to note that they weren't casting aspersions on the overall faith of Catholics who don't adhere to the church's teachings on the death penalty.\u000a\u000aSeizing on the term, Durbin thought he would corner Barrett into admitting that she is an "orthodox" Catholic, presumably to impugn her as some Roman Catholic fundamentalist whose religious extremism would lead her to flout the Constitution. Durbin's slimy distortion of Barrett's unambiguous words revealed that he either hadn't read her article or deliberately twisted her meaning. In this sleazy effort to entrap Barrett in a constitutional snare, Durbin landed himself in one of his own, because it is inappropriate for a senator to ask such a question of a judicial nominee, as the Constitution prohibits religious tests of any public officer.\u000a\u000aSen. Feinstein's questioning was just as odious, as she upbraided Barrett for her Catholic faith, saying, "The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern."\u000a\u000aIt's particularly reprehensible for these secular-virtue-signaling senators to invoke their pernicious little trick bag to discredit Barrett because in her law review article, she explicitly addressed this very question and left no doubt that the law must control.\u000a\u000aIndeed, the entire point of the article was to acknowledge and seek resolution for a judge's dilemma in this very situation. Shamefully, the scolding senatorial duo intentionally ignored Barrett's emphatic assertion that "judges cannot \u2014 nor should they try to \u2014 align our legal system with the Church's moral teaching whenever the two diverge."\u000a\u000aThat is, Barrett unequivocally affirmed judges' duty to the Constitution and the law and concluded that a judge may not superimpose her religious beliefs onto the legal system. The senators ignored that because it dispositively negates the impression they wanted to create with their questioning \u2014 that Barrett would subordinate the law to her religious beliefs.\u000a\u000aIsn't it comical that these two senators were feigning fealty to the rule of law when the Democratic Party advocates an activist judiciary, whereby judges make laws instead of merely interpreting them?\u000a\u000aThe senators are not concerned about the integrity of the law. They are just hostile to those with a decidedly Christian worldview, even if in this particular case the Catholic position happens to generally align with the politically liberal view on the death penalty.\u000a\u000aSadly, the modern liberal position concerning so-called church-and-state issues has become increasingly extreme. Liberals are no longer satisfied with their already bloated interpretation of the First Amendment's establishment clause, which was originally designed to prevent the federal government from establishing a national church or religion. They've long been trying to remove most symbols and expressions of Christianity from the public square \u2014 even sometimes when the connection with the federal, state, county or local government is merely tenuous.\u000a\u000aBut now they are going even further, suggesting that the personal religious beliefs of public officials in any branch or level of government \u2014 not just the judiciary \u2014 should in no way influence their policy preferences. The absurdity of this should be obvious to any fair and reasonable observer. The policy preferences of every human being \u2014 and thus every public officeholder \u2014 are necessarily informed by his or her worldview.\u000a\u000aLet's just ask the senators whether their own worldview leads them to oppose the death penalty and, if so, whether that worldview would prevent them from following the law in death penalty cases. Better yet, would their worldview \u2014 religious or not \u2014 lead them to ignore and rewrite the law in any other areas, such as abortion, immigration, health care and taxes?\u000a\u000aWe know the answer. Ends-justify-the-means leftists, almost to a man (or woman), have no hesitation in subordinating the law to their policy goals. It's only when a Republican officeholder or nominee is openly Christian that they get worked up about this. But as usual, their simulated concern is misplaced, because Christian constitutionalists are the last people they need to fear in such cases. As adherents to the rule of law, they will not, no matter how religious (or "orthodox") they are, ignore the law.\u000a\u000aDespite their posturing, Durbin and Feinstein know that most liberal senators wouldn't even face a dilemma in such cases. If the existing law doesn't suit them and they don't have the political clout to amend it through the proper legislative process, they'll just ignore it as a bygone relic. They are fooling no one.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author, and attorney. His latest book is, "The Emmaus Code: Finding Jesus in the Old Testament."

aVPresident Donald Trump has given military orders for U.S. forces to shoot down and destroy any missile launched from North Korea and moving toward the continental United States, Hawaii, and Guam.\u000a\u000aSources close to the president's national security team tell Newsmax the order was given to Pentagon brass in the wake of last month's threat by North Korea to fire a ballistic missile aimed at Guam, a U.S. territory.\u000a\u000a"The threat provoked the president," one source familiar with the decision told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aLast Sunday, North Korea detonated a thermonuclear weapon. The communist regime claims they can fit the new device on advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, known as ICBMs.\u000a\u000aThis week, South Korean intelligence sources said the North was moving an ICBM in an apparent preparation for another test launch over the northern Pacific and possibly Japan.\u000a\u000aThe president also is said to be considering a new "shoot down" order for any North Korean missile launched and moving toward Japan or South Korea, another national security source told Newsmax.\u000a\u000a"This is a clear exercise of self-defense, and there's no question we should do it," former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aBolton said U.S. allies South Korea and Japan "are in jeopardy" and said the United States must take steps to protect them under treaty obligations.\u000a\u000aThe presidential order came after a flurry of recent provocations from Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aIn August, President Trump ominously warned the North Koreans that continued threats "will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000aSoon after, North Korea answered Trump's warning by threatening a ballistic missile strike off the territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aThe president quickly responded, saying any attack against the U.S. would be met with a fierce response.\u000a\u000a"Things will happen to them like they never thought possible," the president said, adding U.S. forces were "locked and loaded."\u000a\u000aThe situation appeared to be de-escalating when North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un announced he had met with his military commanders and they would not fire the missile at Guam.\u000a\u000aIn a threatening move Aug. 29, North Korea launched from their capital Pyongyang what they said was an "ultramodern rocket system" \u2014 an intermediate range missile. The missile flew over Japanese territory and landed in the Pacific.\u000a\u000a"There is general consensus in the White House and the Pentagon that North Korea is quite close to the 'red zone' and that the U.S. must act soon or lose the upper hand," one official told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aBolton, who has advised the president informally on security matters, said the U.S. is being "driven in the direction of a preemptive strike because North Korea won't back down."\u000a\u000a"We are close to the finish line," Bolton said, referring to Pyongyang's recent missile and nuclear developments. "It highlights how little time we have here."\u000a\u000aJust days after North Korea's nuclear test detonation, Han Tae Song, the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told a disarmament conference the U.S. could expect more "more gift packages."\u000a\u000aIf the U.S. military does act on President Trump's orders to shoot down a missile, this would be achieved through different U.S. anti-ballistic programs under the aegis of the Missile Defense Agency.\u000a\u000aAmong these programs are the 26-year-old Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, (THAAD), whose "hit to kill" interceptors are designed to shoot down an incoming missile through kinetic energy that explodes the missile on impact.\u000a\u000a"It's called stopping a bullet with a bullet," one veteran intelligence expert told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aThe technology appears to be working.\u000a\u000aIn late August, a day after the North Korea missile flew over Japan, the U.S. Missile Agency conducted a test that successfully struck down a ballistic missile off the coast of Hawaii.\u000a\u000aThe White House press office and the Pentagon declined to comment on this report.\u000a\u000aAt Thursday's White House press conference held with the Emir of Kuwait, the president said while "military action would certainly be an option" in dealing with North Korea, he added "nothing's inevitable."\u000a\u000a"I would prefer not going the route of the military," he said.

aVSpecial:\u000a\u000aTop Doc Shares Simple Daily Habits for Healthy Prostate\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aThe One Thing Your Prostate Needs Every Morning\u000a\u000aAdvanced technology has improved prostate cancer surgery to reduce the risks of erectile dysfunction following the procedure. However, possible nerve damage during surgery can still cause impotence in some men. Urinary incontinence is another possible side effect.A man\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain an erection after prostate cancer surgery may depend on age, sexual function before the operation, and whether certain nerves are cut during the procedure, according to the American Cancer Society . The organization stated that all men may experience some decrease in the ability to have an erection. But the younger the man, the better chances there are of maintaining the ability to have an erection.Surgeons attempt to avoid injuring the nerves in the prostate gland that enable men to have sexual function. If the cancer has grown near the nerves, the nerves on one side or both sides of the prostate might have to be removed, causing possible erectile problems.Impotence might be prevented through new procedures such as robotic surgery, although there are no guarantees. Robotic surgery includes a high-definition visual technique, called the da Vinci system, that allows surgeons to operate with better precision, dexterity and control than with other methods, according to da Vinci Surgery The advanced surgical technique results in more precise removal of cancerous tissue with less risk of damaging surrounding tissue and nerves. This has shown a faster return to erectile function for patients who have not had problems with impotence before the surgery.Fewer complications occur with robotic surgery than with traditional methods of prostate cancer surgery. Research shows more patients returning to the erectile function they had before the surgery than with other surgeries during checkups a year later, da Vinci Surgery noted. However, sexual dysfunction due to nerve damage remains a potential risk from the surgery.Laparoscopic surgery uses a tiny video camera inserted into the abdomen, making it possible to make smaller incisions than in traditional prostate surgery methods. Robotic surgery is a type of laparoscopic surgery. Instead of operating directly themselves, the surgeons operate from a panel that controls robotic arms.There is less of a risk of scarring with robotic surgery than with other surgeries, according to Dr. David B. Samadi, chief of robotic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The build-up of scar tissue following surgery may cause complications in the proper function of the prostate gland. These complications are less likely with the minimal incisions used in robotic surgery.

aVA mostly vegetarian diet may provide relief similar to widely used medications for people with acid reflux, a new study suggests.\u000a\u000aThe study looked at close to 200 patients at one medical center who had been diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal reflux.\u000a\u000aIt's a condition where stomach acids habitually back up into the throat, and it's distinct from the much better-known gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) -- or what most people call heartburn.\u000a\u000aPeople with laryngopharyngeal reflux usually don't have heartburn, explained Dr. Craig Zalvan, the lead researcher on the new study.\u000a\u000aInstead, they have symptoms like hoarseness, chronic sore throat, persistent coughing, excessive throat clearing and a feeling of a lump in the throat.\u000a\u000aStill, the problem is often treated with GERD drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs include prescription and over-the-counter drugs like Prilosec, Prevacid and Nexium, and they rank among the top-selling medications in the United States.\u000a\u000aPPIs do help some people with laryngopharyngeal reflux, said Zalvan. He's chief of otolaryngology at Northwell Health System's Phelps Hospital, in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.\u000a\u000aAnd Zalvan, himself, used to prescribe them regularly.\u000a\u000aHowever, it became clear that the medications were not effective for many patients, Zalvan said. At the same time, he noted, studies began raising concerns that PPIs are not as safe as thought.\u000a\u000aResearch has linked prolonged PPI use to slightly increased risks of heart attack, kidney disease, dementia and bone fractures -- though it's not clear whether the drugs are the cause.\u000a\u000aFor Zalvan, it all led to a new direction: prescribing a "dietary approach."\u000a\u000aBased on research into diet and various chronic ills, Zalvan began advising patients to take up a mostly vegetarian diet that he describes as "Mediterranean style."\u000a\u000aHe encouraged patients to go 90-percent plant-based -- eating mainly vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and nuts. Meat and dairy were to be limited to two or three modest servings per week.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Zalvan gave his patients the standard reflux-soothing advice to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol and fried or fatty foods.\u000a\u000aFor the new study, Zalvan's team looked back at patient records to see how that diet approach compared with the old PPI way.\u000a\u000aThe investigators focused on 85 patients who'd been treated with PPIs and standard diet advice between 2010 and 2012, and 99 who'd been advised to go mostly vegetarian.\u000a\u000aWhen it came to treating the patients' symptoms, "the diet was as good, if not better than, PPIs," Zalvan said.\u000a\u000aAfter six weeks, 63 percent of patients on the diet were showing at least a 6-point drop on a scale called the reflux symptom index. That's considered a "clinically meaningful" improvement, Zalvan noted.\u000a\u000aThat compared with 54 percent of PPI patients, according to the report.\u000a\u000aThe findings were published online Sept. 7 in JAMA Otolaryngology--Head & Neck Surgery.\u000a\u000aAccording to Zalvan, patients in the diet group typically lost eight pounds -- which may help explain their symptom improvement. But it's not possible to tell how much credit goes to the weight loss, versus the diet itself.\u000a\u000aSonya Angelone is a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She also recommends a largely plant-based diet for managing acid reflux.\u000a\u000aWhat's critical is picking healthy plant foods, Angelone said -- creating a diet high in beans, vegetables and nuts, not pasta and bagels.\u000a\u000aHealthy plant foods tend to calm inflammation in the body, Angelone explained, whereas a diet heavy in processed foods does the opposite.\u000a\u000aAnd there's been a growing understanding of acid reflux as an inflammatory disorder, Angelone said. That is, the acid itself might not do the real damage; the body's inflammatory response may.\u000a\u000a"I think this study offers more evidence that you should aim to eat more plants and fewer processed foods," Angelone said.\u000a\u000aZalvan acknowledged the study's limitations. It was not a clinical trial that specifically tested the vegetarian diet against medication, which is considered the "gold standard" for proving a treatment works.\u000a\u000aPlus, it's not clear whether patients have to rigorously stick with the 90-percent vegetarian plan -- or whether more-moderate changes would do the trick.\u000a\u000aWhat's important, Angelone said, is that people make healthy changes they can live with for the long haul.\u000a\u000a"Your diet choices matter," she said. "They matter in your risk of chronic diseases down the road, and in more-immediate symptoms like acid reflux."

aVCivil defense programs include emergency, preparation, and operations to protect citizens from natural disasters or military attacks. Global terrorism has given rise to the greatest concerns about a major attack on the U.S. since the Cold War.\u000a\u000aFears of nuclear or chemical strikes have intensified not only because of terrorist possibilities, but also from the saber-rattling of North Korea with its recent missile launch tests. Smaller countries and terrorist groups might have the ability to acquire nuclear devices that could be planted at ports or in cities.\u000a\u000aThe Emergency Radio Every Family Must Have \u2014 Special FREE Offer\u000a\u000aThough the type of attack is difficult to predict, there are safety measures that can be taken before, during, and after with the following six civil defense tips for a major terror attack in the U.S.\u000a\u000a1. Planning ahead \u2014 An emergency supply kit should include non-perishable food, water, battery-powered radio, flashlights, and batteries. Have a family plan so you know where family members might be and where you can meet afterwards. Get to know your community\u2019s disaster plans and warning systems. Find out if any public buildings can be used as fallout shelters, suggests Ready.gov, the official website for the Department of Homeland Security.\u000a\u000a2. Fallout shelters \u2014 With terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, the devices could cause damage but may be survivable, according to Timothy J. Jorgensen of Georgetown University. The bombs would probably be \u201cthe size that were envisioned when fallout shelters were first proposed for civil defense,\u201d he wrote in The Conversation. Ready.gov has information on building a shelter.\u000a\u000a3. Stay inside \u2014 Scientific research suggests people have an increased chance of surviving a nuclear attack on a major city, if far enough away, by immediately shielding themselves, The New York Times reported. Government officials have recommended that if the unthinkable should happen and people are able to survive the initial blast, they should quickly get inside a stable building, coming out only when officials say it is safe. Even staying in a car or in a basement would help.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Terror Chatter High, Get Your FREE Emergency Radio Now\u000a\u000a4. Take cover if caught outside \u2014 People caught outside during a nuclear blast or chemical attack should take cover with any kind of protection possible to shield themselves. Lie flat on the ground and cover your head if there is no shelter nearby during a nuclear attack.\u000a\u000a5. Follow emergency instructions \u2014 Emergency response personnel will provide you with information on your area as far as taking shelter, evacuating, or leaving for a certain location if there is a threat of a major terror attack. Seek shelter inside or below ground if an attack warning is issued.\u000a\u000a6. Radiation protection \u2014 If exposed to radiation carried by the wind from a nuclear blast a few miles away, emergency and military personnel might be on hand with radiation detectors, or you can buy one yourself, according to Secrets of Survival, which also recommends gas masks made for nuclear or chemical emergencies. If outside and possibly exposed to radiation, get inside and immediately wash off debris from the entire body with soap and water. Remove clothing to avoid spreading of radioactive material.\u000a\u000aClick Here: Free Emergency Radio Is Yours, Get It Before It's Too Late! Just Pay S/H

aVGetting out of bed at the same time every morning (even if you've slept poorly) resets your body's internal sleep/wake cycle, helping you fall asleep faster and sleep throughout the night.\u000a\u000aIn addition, many nutritional and herbal supplements can help promote restful sleep. Look for sleep-inducing ingredients such as theanine, hops, wild lettuce, Jamaican dogwood, passionflower, and valerian.\u000a\u000aAll 6 of these can be found in combination in the Revitalizing Sleep Formula herbal mix. Magnesium, as well as ribose can also be helpful, as can melatonin in small doses (0.5 milligram).\u000a\u000aIf you find yourself especially wakeful at bedtime, it could be the result of adrenal cortisol stress hormone levels being too high \u2014 even if they are too low during the day.\u000a\u000aTo help manage occassional stress, I recommend the product Sleep Tonight. You will see the effect within the first few nights.\u000a\u000aIn this situation, adding a 1 ounce protein snack at bedtime, such as a handful of nuts, can help prevent waking too early in the morning. Many people find that the combination of the Revitalizing Sleep Formula and Sleep Tonight herbal mixes offer powerful sleep support.\u000a\u000aThese easy-to-form habits and natural sleep aids can be very helpful to maintaining normal, healthy sleep patterns.

The sector had some losers too, such as...\u000a\u000aAratana Therapeutics (PETX) -41.4%\u000a\u000aSpectrum Brands (SPB) -18.0%\u000a\u000aNormally, an ETF would be the right answer if you\u2019re bullish on a sector but not sure which stocks will perform best. Unfortunately, there is no pet care ETF available to US investors, as far as I can tell.\u000a\u000aWorse, private equity firms are snapping up some of the once-public stocks from this segment. The two big pet retailers, Petco and PetSmart, are both private now.\u000a\u000aSo, that\u2019s aggravating. Here we have a really attractive, long-term theme, but actually investing in it is hard. What can you do?\u000a\u000aYou can try to build your own ETF with a basket of stocks. You probably need at least 20 stocks to be well-diversified, and that will be tough. Some of the best performers are quite small.\u000a\u000aWill Robots Replace Pets? Not Likely\u000a\u000aBefore you enter any investment, you want to consider the risks.\u000a\u000aAmong other things, the pet care industry faces the same risk we discussed last week for bus drivers. What if robots replace our pets?\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not as nutty as it sounds. In fact, it\u2019s already happening.\u000a\u000aA Japanese company, Paro Therapeutics, makes a robotic baby seal that is apparently very lifelike. It reacts and moves much like a real animal. The company envisions it helping sick children and dementia patients.\u000a\u000aClever Japanese inventions don\u2019t always catch on in the West. Remember Tamagotchi?\u000a\u000aBut technology improves. Eventually, could robotic dogs or cats take the place of our real ones? Would we even know the difference?\u000a\u000aIn some ways, maybe not. Sufficiently advanced technology could probably make a robotic dog look, feel, and move like a real one. But that\u2019s not the same as being a real dog.\u000a\u000aDogs are a strange mix of predictability and randomness, and cats even more so. Half the time, I have no idea why my three cats do what they do, or what they\u2019ll do next.\u000a\u000aI am sure of one thing, though: whatever a cat does, makes perfect sense to the cat.\u000a\u000aHow do you duplicate that wonderful mixture in an artificial pet? Never say never, but to me it seems unlikely, at least in our lifetimes.\u000a\u000aThat means the pet care industry ought to keep doing well for several more decades. We will still have dogs and cats. They will still need food, toys, bedding, healthcare and in the future other luxuries we can\u2019t currently imagine.\u000a\u000aBest of all, our dogs, cats and other critters will keep making life better\u2014just by being there. That\u2019s what family does.\u000a\u000aFree Report: The New Asset Class Helping Investors Earn 7% Yields in a 2.5% World\u000a\u000aWhile the Fed may be raising interest rates, the reality is we still live in a low-yield world.

aVA cholesterol drug reduced by 28 percent the mortality rate among men who had high cholesterol but no heart disease, according to new research out Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIn the longest such trial to date, spanning 20 years, researchers at Imperial College London found that 40 miligrams daily of pravastatin reduced deaths from heart disease in participants by more than a quarter.\u000a\u000aThe patients, 5,529 men, had high cholesterol levels but not heart disease.\u000a\u000aSenior author Kausik Ray from Imperial's School of Public Health said that "for the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels. This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins."\u000a\u000aResearchers found that giving pravastatin to men with very high LDL levels reduced 20-year overall mortality rates by 18 per cent, the study published in Circulation found.\u000a\u000aStatins also reduced the overall risk of death by coronary heart disease by 28 per cent, and cut the risk of death by other cardiovascular disease by 25 percent among those with very high LDL cholesterol.\u000a\u000a"Our findings provide the first trial-based evidence to support the guidelines for treating patients with LDL above 190mg/dL and no signs of heart disease. They also suggest that we should consider prescribing statins more readily for those with elevated cholesterol levels above 155 mg/dl and who also appear otherwise healthy."

aVWhen federal policymakers killed banks\u2019 ability to make government-backed student loans, David Bergeron should have been celebrating. A career official at the U.S. Department of Education, he had favored the move for years; it would save the government money, he reasoned, and make it better able to help distressed student borrowers.\u000a\u000aBut when it actually happened in 2010, he wasn\u2019t so sure. With the move, his agency instantly became the nation\u2019s biggest lender to college students. And in his decades of federal service, he\u2019d arrived at the view that when the government gets the chance to profit from something, it takes maximum advantage. It was only a matter of time, he feared, before that happened to student loans.\u000a\u000aSeven years later\u2014with more than 1 million former students defaulting on government-backed loans every year and with his former agency pulling the plug on a partnership with the consumer bureau tasked with protecting them\u2014his fears could soon be realized.\u000a\u000aLast week, the Education Department quietly informed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that it would stop sharing critical information on $1.3 trillion of federal student loans, ending a partnership that has let the CFPB sue loan companies and force others to change their practices in the nation\u2019s second-largest household debt market. Several former high-ranking federal officials fear the directive signals a greater leniency toward loan companies trying to collect on debts, and perhaps a new effort by the Trump administration to undermine the bureau\u2019s enforcement authority.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe system is always going to work against the interest of borrowers and toward the interest of the government,\u201d said Bergeron, who retired as the Education Department\u2019s head of postsecondary education in 2013 after more than 30 years there. \u201cThe CFPB is a check on that, and a necessary one.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo many close observers, a move to cripple the bureau has seemed inevitable. Republican members of Congress for years have tried, without success, to restrict its authority and called for the firing of its director, Richard Cordray. \u201cThink about it: Director Cordray has served longer under Donald Trump than Steve Bannon has,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, referring to the president\u2019s former adviser. The latest move by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is simply \u201csome of the political appointees of the Trump administration fighting back accordingly.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongress and the Obama administration created the CFPB in 2010, after the financial crisis, in an effort to crack down on dodgy loan companies and to supervise businesses that had historically operated with little oversight, such as payday lenders and student loan servicers. Although polls suggest few Americans know about the CFPB, since 2013 they\u2019ve filed more than 15,000 complaints with it about their federal student loans, its public database shows, accusing companies of everything from abusive collection calls to trying to stop them from enrolling in government-promoted, income-based repayment plans.\u000a\u000aThe consumer bureau has tried to curb loan practices it thinks are hurting borrowers, including actions carried out on behalf of the federal government. It has issued public warnings about potentially deceptive acts and underused debt-relief programs, referred cases to the Department of Justice, and pushed companies to stop practices it says are unfair, such as steering troubled borrowers into short-term plans that postpone their payments but still let interest accrue. Along with two states\u2019 attorneys general, it has sued one of the Education Department\u2019s largest loan contractors, Navient Corp., accusing it of illegally cheating hundreds of thousands of student debtors out of their right to lower their payments. Navient has denied wrongdoing, saying it followed department guidelines.\u000a\u000aThe Education Department, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been penalizing its contracted loan servicers for engaging in the practices the CFPB has tried to change. The department has been consistently criticized over the years by government watchdogs\u2014both its own inspector general and the Government Accountability Office\u2014for what they\u2019ve called its lackluster oversight of its contractors. One audit found the agency didn\u2019t even keep track of borrowers\u2019 complaints.\u000a\u000aBut to DeVos\u2019s agency, the CFPB\u2019s involvement has only complicated the lives of borrowers and the government contractors paid to counsel them and collect on their debts. The two agencies\u2019 directives to loan companies sometimes conflict, which causes confusion, DeVos deputies Kathleen Smith and A. Wayne Johnson told Cordray in the letter last week terminating their partnership. The department, they wrote, is shutting out the bureau to \u201cenhance the efficiencies of our servicers.\u201d Elizabeth Hill, a department spokeswoman, didn\u2019t elaborate.\u000a\u000aAccording to Sarah Bloom Raskin, who worked on student loan policy as deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, the Education Department\u2019s move probably has more to do with protecting its contracted loan servicers from new costs than with helping student debtors.\u000a\u000aFor instance, student debtors for years have been able to make monthly payments based on what they earn rather than what they owe\u2014but the paperwork required to enroll them can be \u201cvery expensive\u201d for loan servicers, Navient\u2019s chief executive, Jack Remondi, said back in 2013, when the company was part of Sallie Mae. Millions of young Americans were eligible for those payment plans but didn\u2019t know about them. The Education Department and its Federal Student Aid office, which manages the government\u2019s student loan portfolio, were content with low enrollment\u2014until around 2012, when the White House and the CFPB began to prod them to direct their contractors to inform eligible borrowers. Since then, enrollment has soared.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Student Aid office, which Johnson now leads, was created by Congress in 1998 and directed to improve customer service for students. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what FSA is judged by is not customer service, but how much money is returned to the Treasury,\u201d Bergeron said. \u201cTheir default option is to think of servicers first and borrowers as an afterthought,\u201d Raskin said. And the government\u2019s loan contractors put its interests first; their ultimate customer, after all, is the agency that hired it to collect on debt. Navient told a federal court in March that \u201cthere is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aHill, the department spokeswoman, said her agency is \u201ccommitted to putting students\u2019 needs first, easing the burdens on student loan borrowers, and enhancing efficiencies for servicers.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow the department \u201chas made its position clear that there is no room for CFPB involvement here,\u201d said Brian Slagle, an attorney at Ballard Spahr LLP who represents financial firms before the bureau.\u000a\u000aWall Street has already taken notice. This week, Michael Tarkan, director of research at Compass Point, recommended that clients buy Navient stock. The agency\u2019s decision, he said, is an \u201cunambiguous signal\u201d that the Trump administration will take a more lenient approach to policing student loan companies.

aVCould a Cardiff, Wales-based wafer company be the next big thing for U.K. technology investors? Investors trying to sniff out hidden Apple Inc. suppliers are betting on it, sending the shares of IQE Plc up more than 300 percent this year.\u000a\u000aThe company is the second-best performer in the FTSE AIM 100 Index year-to-date and has also beaten every stock in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, including high-fliers Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. And even with the cautionary tale of companies who flew too close to Apple\u2019s sun still fresh in investors\u2019 minds, some analysts say IQE\u2019s run is just getting started.\u000a\u000aThe main reason for the excitement is familiar: speculation that IQE may be selling wafers needed by the technology giant for its new iPhone, expected to be introduced next week with sensors that use facial recognition to unlock the screen.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur thesis is that lurking in the Cardiff suburbs is U.K. tech\u2019s next large-cap tech company,\u201d Stifel analyst Lee Simpson wrote in a recent report as he started coverage of the billion-pound chip company with a buy rating. Despite the year-to-date rally, he still expects more gains as \u201cthe full extent of the future growth opportunities has yet to wholly emerge to the market.\u201d\u000a\u000a3D Sensing Technology\u000a\u000aIQE makes wafers that are needed for Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), used for 3D sensors and widely thought to be included in the new iPhone.\u000a\u000aWhile IQE\u2019s link to Apple likely funnels through several other companies along the supply chain, Stifel\u2019s Simpson estimates that IQE\u2019s 3D sensor revenue from Apple may increase to 38 million pounds ($50 million) by 2019 from an estimated about 2 million pounds last year. IQE reported 2016 sales of 133 million pounds.\u000a\u000aIQE Chief Executive Officer Andrew Nelson declined to comment directly on whether the company is a supplier to Apple, but said in an interview that IQE has about 80 percent of the VCSEL wafer market and supplies \u201cpretty much all of the main players in the end markets.\u201d\u000a\u000aVCSELs are part of IQE\u2019s so-called photonics -- or lasers and sensors -- business, which only accounted for 17 percent of the company\u2019s sales in 2016, but is expected to become increasingly important as other phone companies follow Apple. In the company\u2019s recent first-half results, photonics revenue grew 48 percent, while the larger wireless division rose just 9 percent. Nelson said that VCSEL technology could also be used in other applications, from driverless cars and industrial heating to hair removal.\u000a\u000aIQE\u2019s wireless division, which includes materials used for power amplifiers in smartphones and wireless base stations, probably also has ties to Apple. \u201cOur materials are in pretty much 100 percent of all smartphones through the various supply chains,\u201d Nelson said.\u000a\u000aShort Positions\u000a\u000aStill, while the four analysts who cover the stock are unanimous in their buy recommendations, some investors are more skeptical about IQE\u2019s rise. Short interest is now at about 4 percent of the float, near the highest in more than two years, and has been steadily climbing for the past few months, according to data from Markit. Hedge funds Marshall Wace LLP and Ennismore Fund Management Ltd hold 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent short positions on the stock, respectively. Both funds declined to comment.\u000a\u000aAnd investors who have followed the company for a long time might have doubts due to a couple of \u201cbig opportunities that haven\u2019t materialized\u201d in the past, according to N+1 Singer analyst Oliver Knott. The London-traded shares hit 762 pence in 2000 before crashing to a low of about 2.2 pence in 2003. Until this year\u2019s surge, the shares hadn\u2019t risen above 59 pence since then. Another sign of IQE\u2019s volatility: the shares initially fell 12 percent after results on Sept. 5, before ending the session 6.5 percent higher.\u000a\u000aIQE shares fell as much as 1.6 percent today, trimming the year\u2019s gains to 310 percent.\u000a\u000aKnott said that this time is different for IQE. He believes IQE is a supplier to Lumentum Holdings Inc., which has gained 49 percent this year on speculation that it is supplying lasers for the new iPhone.\u000a\u000aOther Apple-related European stocks have had mixed fortunes. Imagination Technologies Group lost nearly two-thirds of its value in a single day after Apple said it would stop using its graphics technology, and is now said to have drawn interest for parts of the business from parties including China-backed private equity firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners.\u000a\u000aDialog Semiconductor Plc has also been hit by concerns that Apple is seeking to increase in-house capabilities to make the chips that Dialog supplies. Still, AMS AG, which is also involved in 3D sensing components for the new iPhone, is up 168 percent this year.\u000a\u000aKnott said it was unlikely that IQE would face the same fate as Imagination, as \u201cit\u2019s a complex manufacturing process, not pure intellectual property design like Imagination was.\u201d IQE\u2019s Nelson said that no single customer accounts for more than 20 percent of company revenue, and that there are \u201chuge barriers to change\u201d in supply chains.

aVDAKAR, Senegal (AP) \u2014 Rebels in a volatile region of Central African Republic are raping women and killing their male relatives in a "horrific surge" of violence that is now clearly along sectarian lines, Amnesty International warned Friday.\u000a\u000aThe human rights organization interviewed dozens of survivors in Basse-Kotto prefecture in the country's east, where a rebel group known as the UPC has carried out waves of attacks. The rebels are considered an offshoot of the mostly Muslim rebel coalition known as Seleka that overthrew the longtime president in 2013.\u000a\u000aWhile a period of relative stability allowed for Pope Francis to visit and for elections to be held, international observers now warn that Central African Republic is approaching the levels of violence seen at the height of the conflict in 2014.\u000a\u000aOne woman interviewed by Amnesty described a horrific attack in May. She said UPC fighters shot her husband in the legs when he tried to flee and then told the couple: "We're going to do something to you Christians that won't be forgotten for many generations."\u000a\u000aOne of the men raped her, while another raped her husband \u2014 all in front of their five children, Amnesty said. Then they fatally shot her husband in the head.\u000a\u000aJoanne Mariner, senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty, said the U.N. peacekeeping force has proved ineffective in stopping such abuses.\u000a\u000a"Civilians are not accidental victims in this conflict; they are direct targets," she said. "If the U.N.'s mandate in the Central African Republic is to mean anything, civilians must be better protected."\u000a\u000aCentral African Republic's Muslims and Christians had lived in peace for generations, even intermarrying. However, the brutal reign of the Seleka rebel coalition fueled hatred that led to months of retaliatory attacks.\u000a\u000aDuring Seleka's rule, its fighters carried out scores of atrocities against Christian civilians. Seleka leaders disavowed the perpetrators as criminals. A new militia \u2014 Christian in name, though largely animist \u2014 soon arose to fight the Seleka.\u000a\u000aBrutal vengeance was enacted against Muslim civilians, many of whom hated the Seleka themselves. Nearly the entire Muslim population of the capital, Bangui, fled to the north or to neighboring Chad and Cameroon.\u000a\u000aThe latest violence has been particularly worrisome because it has engulfed parts of the country that were largely untouched during the worst of the earlier conflict.

aVDr. Phil McGraw wasn\u2019t overweight or struggling with any chronic health condition when he began experiencing unexplained fatigue, exhaustion, and other symptoms.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was sleeping well, I felt like I was eating okay, I had no reason that I was just like hitting a wall,\u201d he tells Newsmax Health. \u201cIt was like I just couldn\u2019t keep going, and I didn\u2019t understand why.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo get to the bottom of his low energy, McGraw \u2013 who would later become the host of television\u2019s No. 1 daytime talk show, Dr. Phil \u2013 decided to seek medical attention. To his surprise, he was told his fatigue was due to Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, which causes the body\u2019s glucose levels to rise higher than normal.\u000a\u000aUnlike people with Type 1 diabetes, whose bodies fail to produce enough insulin, Type 2 diabetics aren\u2019t able to process the hormone well, leading to what is called insulin resistance. Over time, the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal, leading to a dangerous buildup of glucose.\u000a\u000aThe effects are both immediate and long-term: Right away, cells become starved for energy, which explains the chronic fatigue McGraw experienced before his diagnosis. But in the long run, high glucose levels that remain unchecked may lead to serious and even life-threatening health risks, damaging the kidneys, nerves, heart, or eyes.\u000a\u000aAt the time of his diagnosis, nearly 25 years ago, McGraw couldn\u2019t merely search the Internet for information about his condition.\u000a\u000a\u201cI actually had to go to that big building with books in it. It\u2019s called a library, I think,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI got books and articles and started studying it, reading about [Type 2 diabetes], and sure enough, I started finding out there were things I could do to manage this better.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a result of his research, and consultation with medical specialists, McGraw came up with a six-point plan, which he calls the \u201cOn It!\u201d program, to manage his diabetes. He calls the program the next best thing to a cure for diabetes, but it requires a life-long commitment to managing your health in a proactive way.\u000a\u000a\u201cSticking with it is so important because we don\u2019t have a cure for this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be here for the rest of your life, and there\u2019s nothing you can do but manage it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTreatment for Type 2 diabetes varies, depending on individual factors and a person\u2019s constitution. Because the metabolic disorder is tied to obesity, lack of exercise, and poor eating habits, many diabetics can control their blood glucose levels by simply losing weight, improving their nutrition, and staying active.\u000a\u000aOthers may also need prescription medications, such as Metformin, or insulin in order to meet their target blood glucose levels.\u000a\u000aOften, diabetics can start out treating their condition without drugs, experts say. But Type 2 tends to get worse over time, meaning many people may eventually need medication to better manage their disease effectively, no matter how healthy their diet or activity levels. McGraw has been taking Bydureon \u2014 a form of Byetta \u2014 for instance, since 2012.\u000a\u000aDr. Pamela R. Kushner, a board-certified family physician who specializes in preventive medical care and diabetes management, tells Newsmax Health it\u2019s critical for diabetics to control their blood sugar so it doesn\u2019t lead to heart disease or other serious, life-threatening conditions.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnfortunately, [Type 2 diabetes] is progressive in a lot of people, and it is particularly risky when not managed appropriately,\u201d Kushner explains. \u201cIt can lead to cardiovascular complications, there can be vision changes, nerve damage, and even kidney disease; the quality of life of a person can tremendously deteriorate.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the good news is that this is a really unique possibility for patients to work with their healthcare professional in shared decision making. Patients really take an active role that will make a difference in how this condition is managed.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcGraw\u2019s experiences exemplify Kushner\u2019s advice for diabetics to take charge and manage their own health. Working with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, he is working to publicize his a six-point plan for managing diabetes, based on sound medical advice and the healthy habits he has adopted in his own life.\u000a\u000aThe program centers on the following six strategies:\u000a\u000aMove Forward: McGraw describes the first step in diabetes management as coming to terms with the diagnosis, and moving forward to combat it. \u201cThis is where you\u2019ve got to get your mind right. You\u2019ve got to accept the fact that this is a reality for you, and there\u2019s no sense denying it, no sense in pretending it\u2019s not there,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aGet Educated: Step two involves learning as much possible about the disease, and the various options \u2013 diet, exercise, and/or medication \u2013 to address and treat the disorder to keep it from progressing. A good place to start: the OnItMovement.com Website.\u000a\u000aBuild Your Team: It\u2019s critically important to consult a group of specialists and advocates \u2013 doctors, nutritionists, fitness experts, family members, friends, and perhaps others \u2013 to help you create a personalized diabetes management plan. McGraw tells Health Radar the quarterback of that team should be your primary care physician, but other players can also play critical supporting roles.\u000a\u000a\u201cBuilding a treatment team centers on your healthcare professional. Your physician is the core that gives you the information that you need so that you make informed decisions,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000a\u201c[He or she] might put you on medication, or give you an exercise physiologist, or maybe you have a nutritionist. But [your team] also involves your wife, your husband, your friends \u2014 all your people that support you and are around you.\u201d\u000a\u000aReplace Bad Habits: McGraw says it\u2019s not enough to simply break bad habits; you effectively maintain your health it\u2019s important to embrace new, good habits \u2013 whether you have diabetes or not. \u201cWe have this, this misnomer that we \u2018break habits.\u2019 You don\u2019t break habits \u2014 you replace a habit with a more constructive, new habit.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor McGraw, that meant significantly changing his daily eating habits.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor me, for example, it was feast or famine. I would go all day long, maybe seven or eight hours and not eat anything at all. And then I would just really gorge myself: I would eat anything that was either dead or seriously slowed down,\u201d he jokes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat's the worst thing in the world, for me as a Type 2 diabetic, as opposed to dividing up those same calories over small meals throughout the day: I had to replace that habit with a different habit of distributing those same calories throughout the day to keep myself more levelled.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaking a Plan and Sticking with It: The last two steps of McGraw\u2019s \u201cOn It\u201d program speak to the need to be mindful about managing your diabetes by crafting a workable plan of attack, and staying with it. \u201cWillpower is a myth,\u201d he says, noting it\u2019s important to create a plan that supports your goals and makes it easier to manage the disease through lasting lifestyle changes.\u000a\u000aHaving such a plan can help you cope with those days you feel down or overwhelmed.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to do this emotionally every single day. Some days you\u2019ll be gung-ho, fired up, thinking that you\u2019ve got the emotional energy and strength to deal with your diabetes,\u201d McGraw says. \u201cBut then you\u2019ll also have days where you just don\u2019t have it in you. Those days where you become distracted with work or family issues, those are the days you need to stick with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you have a bad day, tomorrow\u2019s a new day.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcGraw says the primary take-home message of the \u201cOn It!\u201d program is that a diabetes diagnosis does not mean you can\u2019t live a long and healthy life \u2013 as long as you take control of your health and be mindful about making good choices.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a message that applies not just diabetics, but to everyone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe advice that I have [for Type 2 diabetics] is that you\u2019ve got to be thoughtful about this,\u201d McGraw says. \u201cRecognize that this is going to be with you for years and years and years to come. So, make a plan, one that you can live with.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe full version of this article appeared in Health Radar newsletter. To read more, click here.

aVPlanting plants that attract butterflies may turn your garden into a sanctuary between their natural habitat and reserves.\u000a\u000aWith the right choice of nectar plants in sunny, sheltered spots, you could have a garden teeming with these beautiful winged creatures.\u000a\u000aAccording to Butterfly Conservation, the wider the variety of plant you add to your garden, the more species of butterflies you\u2019ll attract.\u000a\u000aHere are 10 choices to get you started:\u000a\u000a1. Butterfly Bush \u2014 As its name suggests, the Butterfly Bush does attract butterflies, but according to The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, they prefer lavenderpink (mauve) ones.\u000a\u000aThis fast-growing shrub produces masses of blossoms with long trusses that bloom from summer to autumn.\u000a\u000aThey fare best when planted in spring or fall, and they require lots of sun and fertile soil.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Blue Porterweed \u2014 According to the South Florida Plant Guide, the Blue Porterweed in the most popular butterfly-attracting plant in the area.\u000a\u000aWhile it flowers on and off all year round, you\u2019re more likely to see it bloom in warmer months. That said, the Blue Porterweed is quite hardy when it comes to withstanding cold.\u000a\u000aThe plants do well if planted in a partly shady spot and can grow up to three feet tall.\u000a\u000a3. Mexican flame vine \u2014 With its bright orange flowers, the Mexican Flame Vine is the only vine flower that attracts Monarch butterflies.\u000a\u000aAccording to Monarch Butterfly Garden, it may also bring hummingbirds, swallowtails, and bees to northern gardens.\u000a\u000aFolia suggests you give the vine three years of growing before it hits its stride, but it\u2019s a low maintenance plant and great for beginner gardeners.\u000a\u000a4. Joe-Pye Weed \u2014 Part wildflower, part herb, the Joe-Pyed Weed is native to the U.S. and prized as a late-season bloomer.\u000a\u000aThe Spruce reports that the plant is named after Native American herbalist Joe-Pye Weed, who used it to treat fevers. These days it\u2019s more commonly used to attract butterflies and birds.\u000a\u000aThey come in white and mauve and their leaves can sometimes give off a vanilla scent.\u000a\u000a5. Black-Eyed Susan \u2014 With its bright yellow petals and dark center, the Black-Eyed Susan makes a striking addition to any garden and, according to Birds & Blooms, they bring hummingbirds and butterflies too.\u000a\u000aGardening Know How says the Black-Eyed Susan is a robust flower that\u2019s both heat and drought resistant. They\u2019re also self-seeding and can grow in all types of soil.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a6. Chrysanthemum \u2014 Chrysanthemums are one of the world\u2019s most popular flowers. They come in a wide variety of colors and forms. Some look like daisies while others look like pompoms.\u000a\u000aAccording to The Flower Expert, Chrysanthemums aren\u2019t specific to any season, but they do best in sunny weather. They start flowering just three months after being planted and are said to keep their flowers for a long time.\u000a\u000a7. Cosmos \u2014 Cosmos comes in a rainbow of colors, but it\u2019s the chocolate ones that butterflies really like.\u000a\u000aThis Mexican perennial likes moist, well-drained soil and lots of sun but, according to Gardener\u2019s World, special care will be rewarded with deep red blooms and the smell of vanilla mixed with hot chocolate.\u000a\u000aThe site suggests keeping chocolate cosmos indoors in winter to help them survive the cold.\u000a\u000a8. Lavender \u2014 These hardy flowers are one of the butterfly-attracting plants suggested by Butterfly Conservation.\u000a\u000aTheir lilac-blue flowers bloom over the summer and they can easily be pruned to form a low hedge. Butterfly Conservation suggests planting in April or May and making sure your lavender is in a sunny spot where it can also get some shade.\u000a\u000a9. Oregano \u2014 Oregano is herb that grows up to 80 centimeters tall, but it also produces delicate blooms in white, pink, and purple in summer.\u000a\u000aThey\u2019re quite low maintenance, make a great ground cover and besides being good at attracting butterflies they also come with a host of health benefits and are often used in the kitchen for cooking.\u000a\u000a10. Aster \u2014 Asters are another popular flower for attracting butterflies.\u000a\u000aBirds & Blooms suggests planting them early in the season so they\u2019ll be well established by the time winter comes. They can grow up to six feet tall with each planting producing dozens of blooms.\u000a\u000aThe National Gardening Association adds that they are easy to grow, versatile, and come in all sorts of colors from blues and purples to even white.\u000a\u000aThey grow best in full sun and like fertile, well-drained soil.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat

aVAt least 32 people were killed after a massive 8.1 magnitude earthquake, one of the biggest recorded in Mexico, struck off the country's southern coast late on Thursday, causing cracks in buildings and triggering a small tsunami, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aThe quake was apparently stronger than a devastating 1985 temblor that flattened swathes of Mexico City and killed thousands, but this time, damage to the city was limited.\u000a\u000aA number of buildings suffered severe damage in parts of southern Mexico. Some of the worst initial reports came from the town of Juchitan in Oaxaca state, where sections of the town hall, a hotel, a bar and other buildings were reduced to rubble.\u000a\u000aAlejandro Murat, the state governor, said 23 deaths were registered in Oaxaca, 17 of them in Juchitan.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for emergency services said seven people were also confirmed dead in the neighboring state of Chiapas. Earlier, the governor of Tabasco, Arturo Nunez, said two children had died in his state.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Geological Survey said the 8.1 magnitude quake had its epicenter in the Pacific Ocean, 54 miles southwest of the town of Pijijiapan in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas, at a depth of 43 miles.\u000a\u000aRescue workers labored through the night in badly affected areas to check for people trapped in collapsed buildings.\u000a\u000aWindows were shattered at Mexico City airport and power went out in several neighborhoods of the capital, affecting more than one million people. The cornice of a hotel came down in the southern tourist city of Oaxaca, a witness said.\u000a\u000aThe tremor was felt as far away as neighboring Guatemala.\u000a\u000aThe quake triggered waves as high as 2.3 feet in Mexico, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Mexican television showed images of the sea retreating about 50 meters, and authorities evacuated some coastal areas.\u000a\u000aPresident Enrique Pena Nieto said the tsunami risk on the Chiapas coast was not major.\u000a\u000a"We are alert," he told local television.\u000a\u000aClasses were suspended in most of central and southern Mexico on Friday to allow authorities to review damage.\u000a\u000aThere was no tsunami threat for American Samoa and Hawaii, according to the U.S. Tsunami Warning System. The national disaster agency of the Philippines put the country's eastern seaboard on alert, but no evacuation was ordered.\u000a\u000aPeople in Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities, ran out into the streets in pajamas and alarms sounded after the quake struck just before midnight, a Reuters witness said.\u000a\u000aHelicopters buzzed overhead a few minutes later, apparently looking for damage to buildings in the city, which is built on a spongy, drained lake bed.\u000a\u000a"I had never been anywhere where the earth moved so much. At first I laughed, but when the lights went out, I didn't know what to do," said Luis Carlos Briceno, an architect, 31, who was visiting Mexico City. "I nearly fell over."\u000a\u000aIn one central neighborhood, dozens of people stood outside after the quake, some wrapped in blankets against the cool night air. Children were crying.\u000a\u000aLiliana Villa, 35, who was in her apartment when the quake struck, fled to the street in her nightclothes.\u000a\u000a"It felt horrible, and I thought, 'this (building) is going to fall.'"\u000a\u000aState oil company Pemex said it was still checking for damage at its installations.\u000a\u000aPena Nieto said operations at the Salina Cruz refinery in the same region as the epicenter were temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure.

aVThe women who made this year's list of 100 Most Influential Republican Women often have the word \u201cfirst\u201d next to their names: First female senator from their respective states, first Hispanic female governor, first woman combat pilot, first lady.\u000a\u000aIndeed, they are leading GOP voices at a time when the party is trying to reach women voters through a variety of channels \u2014 politics, media, business, and academics.\u000a\u000aThese women are self-styled pioneers who, despite their varied public roles, share a core set of conservative principles and beliefs.\u000a\u000a1. Betsy DeVos \u2014 A businesswoman and generous GOP donor, DeVos won confirmation as education secretary after a bruising and partisan Senate fight, which President Donald Trump called a "very tough trial and a very unfair trial." But, there\u2019s no disputing that the longtime school choice crusader has the opportunity now to remake the way American kids are taught.\u000a\u000a2. Sarah Palin \u2014 While she is unlikely to run for office again, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee remains influential with a small but active wing of the GOP \u2014 mostly evangelical women and Tea Party voters. She was an early supporter of Trump and remains close to him.\u000a\u000aEditor's Note: Trump Is #MAGA Rearming America. It\u2019s an Investing Opportunity!\u000a\u000a3.

Susan Collins \u2014 As dean of the Senate GOP moderates, Collins already has had a series of run-ins with Trump; she didn\u2019t vote for him last fall and has opposed his healthcare reform efforts this year. Still, she remains highly influential among centrists, from both parties, and women. Leaving Collins out of the Senate working group on healthcare turned out to have disastrous consequences for Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000a5. Nikki Haley \u2014 Trump tapped the former South Carolina governor to be his United Nations ambassador, making her the only Indian-American to serve in his administration. Haley has struck an aggressive and independent tone at the UN, frequently challenging Russia, Syria, and North Korea.\u000a\u000a6. Marsha Blackburn \u2014 The Tennessee congressman (she prefers to be identified that way) served on Trump\u2019s transition team and is now serving her eighth House term. Blackburn chairs the select committee investigating Planned Parenthood, which she has urged Congress to strip of federal funding.\u000a\u000a7. Lisa Murkowski \u2014 Appointed to her father\u2019s Senate seat by him when he was elected governor in 2002, Murkowski later became the first woman elected to Congress from Alaska. And, in 2010, she became only the second senator ever to win a write-in campaign, defeating a Palin-backed candidate. In the Senate, she frequently aligns with moderates and was one of two female senators, along with Collins, to oppose the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of Obamacare.\u000a\u000a8. Nancy Brinker \u2014 The founder of the breast cancer advocacy organization Susan G. Komen, Brinker also served as the ambassador to Hungary and U.S. chief of protocol under President George W. Bush. Spotted in the West Wing every so often, she\u2019s also an accomplished author, businesswoman, and host of the interview series "Conversations with Nancy Brinker" on Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000a9. Melania Trump \u2014 Though she has maintained a decidedly low profile this year, the first lady is still building a following among Trump loyalists who appreciate her style and grace.\u000a\u000a10. Ana Navarro \u2014 The Nicaraguan-born GOP strategist and TV pundit made a name for herself in 2016 when she became a staunch critic of Trump and his supporters. She has advised the presidential campaigns of Jeb Bush, Jon Huntsman, and John McCain.\u000a\u000a11. Peggy Noonan \u2014 The former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan has written for The Wall Street Journal for years, and she won a Pulitzer Prize this year for, the Pulitzer committee said, \u201crising to the moment with beautifully rendered columns that connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation\u2019s most divisive political campaigns.\u201d\u000a\u000a12. Cathy McMorris Rodgers \u2014 As the House GOP Conference chair, McMorris Rodgers is the party\u2019s highest-ranking woman in Congress. She maintains a staunchly conservative voting record, drawing high scores from the Family Research Council, Chamber of Commerce, and American Conservative Union.\u000a\u000a13. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen \u2014 The dean of the Florida delegation and most senior House GOP woman, Ros-Lehtinen is retiring in 2018. Over the past decade, she has carved out a decidedly moderate place in an increasingly conservative party. She opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy and his immigration platform, and she voted against her leadership\u2019s healthcare reform efforts this year.\u000a\u000a14. Dina Powell \u2014 A former Goldman Sachs executive and State Department aide under Bush, Powell serves as deputy national security adviser to Trump. She had no ties to the current president before getting an unsolicited, post-election call from Ivanka Trump, who was interested in Powell\u2019s work fostering women entrepreneurs at Goldman.\u000a\u000a15. Linda McMahon \u2014 A wealthy GOP donor and former head of World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, McMahon now runs the Small Business Administration. She twice ran unsuccessfully for Senate from Connecticut, but remains an influential GOP voice on business and finance issues.\u000a\u000a16. Joni Ernst \u2014 In 2014, the former lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard became the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate. Ernst is also the first woman ever elected to Congress from the state. Ernst, who grew up on a farm, won the primary after running a TV ad saying her experience castrating pigs shows she can cut \u201cpork-barrel spending.\u201d\u000a\u000a17. Pam Bondi \u2014 The Florida attorney general was the lead attorney in an unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn Obamacare. She became embroiled in controversy in 2016 when it was reported that she dropped an investigation into Trump University shortly after Trump\u2019s charitable foundation made a $25,000 contribution to a political group tied to her, however, Bondi was cleared of any wrongdoing by the state\u2019s ethics commission.\u000a\u000a18. Ronna McDaniel \u2014 The niece of Mitt Romney, McDaniel is the second woman ever to chair the Republican National Committee. As the Michigan GOP chair last year, she is credited with helping Trump score his upset win there \u2014 the first GOP victory since 1988.\u000a\u000a19. Kelly Ayotte \u2014 Even after narrowly losing her Senate seat in 2016, Ayotte has remained a Beltway player \u2014 most recently serving as then-Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s sherpa earlier this year.\u000a\u000a20. Martha McSally \u2014 The two-term Arizona congresswoman has an impressive military record. A retired Air Force colonel, McSally is first American woman to fly in combat following the 1991 lifting of the prohibition of women in combat. And she is the first woman to command a USAF fighter squadron.\u000a\u000a21. Shelley Moore Capito \u2014 The first woman elected to Congress from West Virginia, Capito is the daughter of the beloved late Gov. Arch Moore. Elected to the Senate in 2014 after 14 years in the House, she has been a prolific legislator and generally aligns herself with moderates.\u000a\u000a22. Deb Fischer \u2014 A family rancher in Nebraska, Fischer in 2012 became the first woman elected to the Senate from her state. She has had a love-hate relationship with Trump \u2014 calling on him to resign after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, then reversing that call a few days later.\u000a\u000a23. Kellyanne Conway \u2014 A ubiquitous GOP pollster, Conway led Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to a surprise win and now serves in the White House as a counselor to the president. Conway has had some missteps, including creating the widely-ridiculed phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d But amid widespread West Wing chaos, she has managed to hold onto power.\u000a\u000a24. Mary Fallin \u2014 In 2010, Fallin became the first woman elected governor of Oklahoma. During her second term, she was on Trump\u2019s short list for vice president.\u000a\u000a25. Cleta Mitchell \u2014 A longtime GOP activist and former Oklahoma legislator, Mitchell currently serves on the board of the American Conservative Union Foundation, which organizes the annual CPAC conference in Washington.\u000a\u000a26. Karen Pence \u2014 The second lady, who met her husband Mike Pence while she was playing guitar at church, is known in their native Indiana as a quiet force who has an unusually strong influence on the vice president\u2019s political agenda.\u000a\u000a27. Susana Martinez \u2014 The two-term New Mexico governor is the first Hispanic woman to serve as chief executive of any state. Since winning in 2010, she is often mentioned as a possible VP nominee, although her 2016 prospects dimmed after a public feud with Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a28. Laura Ingraham \u2014 A provocative conservative commentator, Ingraham is a popular radio talk-show host and author. She got her start in politics in the late 1980s as a speechwriter for President Reagan\u2019s domestic policy adviser and, during this election cycle, she was rumored to be in consideration for a gig as White House press secretary.\u000a\u000a29. Kristi Noem \u2014 This farmer-turned-congresswoman is running for governor in 2018, hoping to become South Dakota state\u2019s first female chief executive. But Noem says she wants to repeal and replace Obamacare and pass tax reform and a new farm bill before she leaves the House.\u000a\u000a30. Martha Roby\u2014 The conservative congresswoman is a lawyer and a staunch Trump ally who, in 2011, became one of the first two women elected to Congress from Alabama. She is touted as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2018 but would likely face a crowded primary in the wake of scandal-tarred Republican Gov. Robert Bentley\u2019s recent resignation.\u000a\u000a31. Barbara Comstock \u2014 Although Comstock worked for U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, she has adopted a more moderate voice in the House representing a Northern Virginia swing district. She has maintained her distance from Trump, pulling her support last fall and opposing the Obamacare repeal this year.\u000a\u000a32. Meg Whitman \u2014 A successful businesswoman prior to arriving in Silicon Valley, Whitman, as its CEO, grew eBay from a small startup to an e-commerce giant, and was then hired to lead Hewlett-Packard\u2019s turnaround in 2011. She ran unsuccessfully for governor of California in 2010 against former Gov. Jerry Brown after spending $144 million of her own money on the race; however, she is still maintains a national political profile.\u000a\u000a33. Condoleezza Rice \u2014 The former secretary of state and national security adviser under George W. Bush recently wrote a new book, \u201cDemocracy,\u201d which has thrust her back into the national spotlight. Since the end of the Bush era, she has been teaching at Stanford University and has declined pleas to run for public office.\u000a\u000a34. Dana Perino \u2014 As the first Republican woman to hold the post, Perino became a household name as White House press secretary under George W. Bush. Her career on camera continues today, with a co-hosting role on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Five.\u201d\u000a\u000a35. Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014 The daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders serves as White House press secretary. Sanders, who was on duty in the days following Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey, has proven to be an effective spokesman for the president during controversial times.\u000a\u000a36. Betsy McCaughey \u2014 A former New York lieutenant governor under Republican Gov. George Pataki, McCaughey last year served as a Trump campaign economic adviser. She\u2019s a prolific writer who for years has been a vocal critic of Obamacare. Her ex-husband is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\u000a\u000a37. S.E. Cupp \u2014 Sarah Elizabeth (or S.E. for short) is a TV commentator and author who is slated to host a new, primetime political panel show on HLN. While she leans right politically, she is critical of Trump and has distanced herself from CPAC because of the group\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights.\u000a\u000a38. Elise Stefanik \u2014 Elected to the House in 2014 at the age 30, the Harvard-educated Stefanik is the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress. But she spent her 20s honing her GOP bona fides, working in the Bush White House and for the Romney-Ryan campaign in 2012.\u000a\u000a39. Jean Hampton \u2014 Kentucky lieutenant governor Jean Hampton is the first African-American to hold statewide office in Kentucky and the third African-American woman to hold that office in any state. She is an Air Force captain who served in Operation Desert Storm.\u000a\u000a40. Christine Todd Whitman \u2014New Jersey\u2019s first and only female governor, Whitman went on to serve as George W.

aVThe most important question regarding the unfolding crisis in Venezuela is not whether U.S. sanctions and international pressures will force its populist regime to restore democracy. That will not happen anytime soon. Rather, it is whether the Venezuelan regime will be able to successfully transition power to a more rationally managed authoritarian government, backed by Russian and Chinese resources, that protects those who have systematically looted the country, while providing a sufficient façade of democratic process and compromise that a weary and distracted international community lends it legitimacy.\u000a\u000aAs the crisis in Venezuela has deepened, Russia and China have leveraged the Maduro regime\u2019s growing international isolation, financial needs, and political receptivity, to increasingly control the country\u2019s finances, oil, and markets. While Russian and Chinese companies in fact compete with each other in Venezuela in these areas, their strategic and business interests arguably coincide in the survival of an anti-U.S. regime in close proximity to the U.S., granting its benefactors privileged access to the country and its petroleum and mineral wealth.\u000a\u000aOf the two extra-hemispheric actors, it is the PRC which holds the greatest leverage over the fate of the Venezuelan regime, particularly as its access to conventional financial markets and oil sales are reduced by U.S. sanctions. The PRC has the money to lend, and indeed has already lent an estimated $60.2 billion to the regime during the past decade. In addition, the PRC controls the financial instruments in Venezuela key to the regime\u2019s survival. China\u2019s CITIC bank currently manages PdVSA\u2019s current accounts for its oil transactions, after the latter moved them from Portugal\u2019s Banco Espiritu Santo (BES), probably to protect those accounts from claimants in lawsuits against the company. More importantly, China Development Bank manages the principal lines of credit for Venezuela\u2019s \u201cloans-for-oil\u201d contracts, and thus controls the regime\u2019s main vehicle for obtaining consumer goods for its supporters, and resources for building the petroleum, electricity, and transport infrastructure that the regime requires to bring the considerable deposits of heavy oil in the Orinoco tar belt and bring it to market, so as to pay its bills. During a recent meeting of the China-Venezuela High-Level Mixed Commission, the two nations signed 22 agreements involving $2.7 billion in projects, including construction of the Jienyang refinery to process Venezuelan heavy oil in the PRC.\u000a\u000aWhile the PRC has been in talks with individual members of the Venezuelan opposition, China neither needs to turn against the current Venezuelan regime, and indeed, it is strongly in its interest not to do so. Because most Chinese loans to Venezuela over the past decade have been short-term and repaid on time, and because China has become stingier with credit as the Venezuelan crisis has deepened, its outstanding debt exposure in Venezuela may be as little as $10-20 billion, hardly worth risking its relationship with a strategically useful regime sitting on top of 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Moreover, the recent successful seating of the Venezuelan constituent assembly raises the possibility that the regime could reform the constitution, permitting it to hand over even greater portions of Venezuela\u2019s oilfields and other assets, in return for needed cash.\u000a\u000aLike China, Russia will also continue to support the Maduro regime or its replacement, for the same reasons as the PRC will, albeit with more limited resources and fewer financial and commercial instruments for doing so. In the oil sector, while the more commercially-oriented Russian oil firms such as Lukoil have long-since pulled out of Venezuela, the state-owned firm Rosneft, led by former Russian senior intelligence operative and sometimes Putin ally Igor Sechin, has sunk an estimated $6 billion into the country since 2010, including over $1 billion in 2017 alone.\u000a\u000aAs other companies have pulled out of Venezuela, Rosneft has negotiated to leverage Venezuela\u2019s need for cash to gain expanded stakes in oil joint ventures such as Petromonogas, Petrovictoria, and Petromiranda. Indeed, as the U.S. has signaled that it could block Rosneft\u2019s inheritance of the downstream petroleum company CITGO (in which it obtained a 49 percent stake in exchange for a $1.5 billion infusion of cash to PdVSA), Rosneft has been holding talks with PdVSA to swap the vulnerable asset for claims to yet more Venezuelan oil blocks.\u000a\u000aAs the situation in Venezuela deteriorates, both Russia and China are playing a delicate game. While both have a strong interest in providing resources to ensure the continuation of a friendly, anti-U.S. regime in Caracas, their resources are not infinite. In addition, each must move cautiously to avoid that the United States perceive hostile intent in their maneuverings in Venezuela, and attempt to block them. Moreover, both extra-hemispheric actors must use their leverage to advance a transition of power in the country toward a leadership at least minimally capable of managing the Venezuelan economy and oil sector in a sustainable fashion. Yet they must not pressure the regime so hard that it collapses, and the transition must give a sufficient appearance of legitimacy and legality so that the U.S. and international community accepts the domination over Venezuelan assets that Russia and China achieve.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. is right to impose escalating sanctions on Venezuela, yet as they do so, they must also deny Russia and China from leveraging their position as an alternative source of capital and support, to expand their own positions in the country. One of the few worse problems than a hostile, unstable Venezuelan regime flirting with Russia and China, is a hostile, stable one economically and politically dominated by them.\u000a\u000aDr. Evan Ellis is Senior Non-Resident Fellow at CSIS, and Professor of Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

aVSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team has approached the White House about interviewing staffers who were on Air Force One when a first statement about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer was crafted, CNN reported.\u000a\u000aTwo unnamed sources told CNN Mueller wants to know how the statement was put together, whether information was intentionally left out and who was involved.\u000a\u000aThe interviews with the White House staffers have not yet begun, and involve only a small number of people, CNN reported.\u000a\u000aAnd Mueller has not asked to interview President Donald Trump. His eldest son went before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\u000a\u000aTrump Jr. initially claimed in a statement he "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children" during his meeting with a Russian lawyer he believed to be connected to the Russian government in the summer of 2016.\u000a\u000aEmails later released by Trump Jr. revealed he believed the lawyer would provide him with incriminating information about his father's campaign rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on behalf of the Russian government.\u000a\u000a"Out of respect for the special counsel process, the White House doesn't comment on any individual special counsel request," White House special counsel Ty Cobb told CNN.\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed in August that Trump "weighed in as any father would" during the drafting of the statement but declined to characterize his involvement further.\u000a\u000aAccording to CNN, Mueller considers some of the aides aboard Air Force One who helped craft the statement to be witnesses \u2014 and the White House is trying to figure out legal defense funding for those who have had to hire lawyers.\u000a\u000aCNN previously reported Mueller sent a notice asking White House staff save "any subjects discussed in the course of the June 2016 meeting" and also "any decisions made regarding the recent disclosures about the June 2016 meeting."

aVHollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence seemed to suggest that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are due to Mother Nature showing her "rage" at President Donald Trump and others who do not believe that humans are causing climate change.\u000a\u000aLawrence spoke with the UK's Channel 4 about her new movie "Mother!" Near the end of the interview, the subject of American politics was broached.\u000a\u000a"It's scary. This new language that's forming, I don't even recognize it," Lawrence said regarding the state of affairs in the United States.\u000a\u000a"It's also scary to know, it's been proven through science that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.\u000a\u000a"And we voted and it was really startling."\u000a\u000aLawrence then got to the crux of her argument by suggesting Hurricane Harvey, which dumped more than four feet of rain on the Houston area last month, and Hurricane Irma, a deadly storm that's expected to hit South Florida this weekend, are nature's way of getting back at humans for denying climate change.\u000a\u000a"You know you're watching these hurricanes now, and it's really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature's rage and wrath," she said.\u000a\u000aLawrence also took some shots at Trump, saying with a smile, "I don't find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is."\u000a\u000aLawrence is an outspoken Trump critic. In May 2016, she relayed a story in which she hoped to find Trump at a concert they were both attending so she could swear at him on video.

aVChristian pastors and Jewish rabbis and leaders have initiated nearly every significant sociopolitical event in America. Their churches and synagogues were catalysts and hubs that made possible the American War of Independence, the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s suffrage, and civil rights. They founded schools and hospitals, created architectural wonders, and emphasized the preservation of nature.\u000a\u000aReligious landmarks in most of the original 13 states could easily fill their own top 50 lists, especially the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. However, these sites exemplify the diversity of America\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and commitment to religious freedom \u2014 the hallmark of American exceptionalism.\u000a\u000aWithout further adieu, here are Newsmax\u2019s Top 50 Religious Landmarks in America:\u000a\u000a1. \u201cGod\u2019s Square Mile;\u201d Ocean Grove, New Jersey; 1869 \u2014 This popular seaside retreat, concert, and vacation destination for millions is a lasting testament to the Victorian-era revivalist movement that followed the Second Great Awakening. Methodist ministers founded Ocean Grove believing \u201creligion and recreation should go hand in hand.\u201d Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this quaint town is crammed with picturesque Victorian homes, antiques, a historic Auditorium, chapel, and tent community, and offers numerous tours and activities on land, sea, and air. Methodists still gather here regularly as well as other Christian groups.\u000a\u000a2. Plymouth Rock and Plymouth Plantation; Plymouth, Massachusetts; 1620 \u2014 Especially at Thanksgiving, but all year round, millions come to learn what life was like in the first European settlement in New England. Three must-see sites include Plymouth Rock in Pilgrim Memorial State Park, which marks the arrival of the pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620. Nearby, visitors can board and tour a replica of the Mayflower, the ship the pilgrims sailed on to reach the New World. Spend at least a day to explore the living history museum of Plimouth Plantation (original spelling), taste 17th-century foods, and meet knowledgeable staff wearing period dress.\u000a\u000a3. San Antonio de Valero; San Antonio, Texas; 1720 \u2014 Better known as \u201cthe Alamo,\u201d this unassuming and uncompleted Spanish mission remains the quintessential symbol of freedom in the West. It is less known for its architectural style (akin to nearby Mission Concepción) or that it was the first European hospital in Texas. Instead, the Alamo is synonymous with the Mexican Army\u2019s brutal slaughter of everyone inside its walls and the vow of freedom fighters to keep fighting. \u201cRemember the Alamo\u201d became more than a rallying cry used to win the War of Texas Independence. Without Texas, the U.S. government\u2019s access to land west of the Mississippi was nearly impossible. But after statehood, Texas opened up access to the West, after which 10 states joined the Union.\u000a\u000a4. French Huguenot Church; Charleston, South Carolina; 1687 \u2014 After the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, French Huguenot Protestants fled to mostly British colonies, including the mostly eastern, coastal, pre-Colonial American towns. Called the \u201cChurch of the Tides,\u201d it was first built in 1687 in downtown Charleston by floods of French immigrants arriving in ships. By 1700, roughly 450 Huguenots had settled in this area of South Carolina. The church was rebuilt in 1844 after a fire and was nearly destroyed during the Civil War and later by an earthquake in 1866. Today, its services are no longer held in French, except once a year, but the church serves as a \u201cliving remnant and reminder of the Huguenot experience\u201d in South Carolina.\u000a\u000a5. St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral; New York City; 1879 \u2014 In 1785 there were only 200 Roman Catholics in New York City. But after a flood of Irish Catholics immigrated after surviving Ireland\u2019s potato famine, the Diocese of New York was created in 1808. By the early 1840s, the bishop of New York, John Hughes, proposed building \u201cthe most beautiful gothic cathedral in the New World,\u201d believing it would become \u201cthe heart of the city.\u201d Named after the Patron Saint of Ireland, the Cathedral idea was ridiculed as \u201cHughes\u2019 Folly.\u201d Today, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral is the most visited church in America, including a visit from a Roman Catholic Pope. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI was the first Pope to celebrate Mass at the cathedral.\u000a\u000a6. Touro Synagogue; Newport, Rhode Island; 1658 \u2014 Touro Synagogue is the oldest synagogue building still standing and only surviving Colonial synagogue building in America, and the oldest surviving synagogue building in North America. Founded by Spanish-Portuguese Jewish immigrants, its congregation dates to 1658 although construction of the synagogue did not begin until 1759 (completed 1763). Its most notable leaders include Isaac Touro, Aaron Lopez, Abraham Pereira Mendes, and Henry Samuel Morais. A 1790 letter President George Washington wrote to its congregation extolled the virtues of religious freedom and his commitment to protecting Jewish worship in America.\u000a\u000a7. Congregation Mikveh Israel; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1740 \u2014 Founded in the 1740 by Spanish-Portuguese Sephardic Jewish immigrants, it is the oldest continuous congregation in the United States. Called the \u201cSynagogue of the American Revolution,\u201d without its first members, the American Revolution might not have been possible. Instrumental to the cause were Haym Solomon, who helped finance the revolution, and the Gratz brothers who supplied the Continental Army with the bulk of its ammunition and supplies. Open to the public, tours (available in person and online in the virtual) and exhibits detail 270 years of American Jewish history.\u000a\u000a8. Plymouth Church; Brooklyn, New York; 1846 \u2014 A hidden gem in Brooklyn Heights, New York, is a National Historic Landmark whose first pastor was a powerful abolitionist. Henry Ward Beecher\u2019s fiery sermons and mock auctions of slaves created media frenzy and overflowing pews. Plymouth Church, Brooklyn\u2019s \u201cGrand Central Depot,\u201d was a primary hub along the Underground Railroad and influential even in Kansas (See No. 38.). Beecher also published the first hymnal in the world to have both music and words printed on the same page. His sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, authored one of the most significant works of literature in American history, \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d\u000a\u000a9. U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel; Colorado Springs, Colorado; 1962 \u2014 One of the most iconic landmarks in America is the place of worship for 4,000 U.S. Air Force cadets. The chapel\u2019s magnificent 17 spires constructed of steel, aluminum, and glass are shaped like fighter jets bursting towards the heavens. Inside are three chapels and two all-faith rooms, exemplifying its mission \u201cto facilitate the free exercise of religion.\u201d Visitors should plan a trip before summer of 2018 when major renovations are scheduled to begin. Open daily; groups can request guided tours.\u000a\u000a10. Harriet Tubman Thompson AME Zion Church; Auburn, New York; 1859; and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historic Park; Eastern Shore, Maryland; 2014 \u2014 The African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church was the stalwart defender of human rights for black Americans and strong opponent of slavery. Known as \u201cthe Freedom Church,\u201d it was home to the leader of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, and famous black American civil rights activists, Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. Before the Civil War roughly 500 former slaves traveled through Auburn in their escape north, finding respite at Harriet Tubman\u2019s home and the AME Zion Church. Tubman was a devout Christian, hunter, and a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army. Referred to as \u201cMoses,\u201d Tubman risked her life to save hundreds of slaves traversing land and water spanning more than 300 miles from Maryland to New York. The national park and the Harriet Tubman Byway provide information and a self-guided 125-mile driving tour of her route, which includes 36 historical sites.\u000a\u000a11. Third Haven Meeting House; Talbot, Maryland; 1684 \u2014 Although the Society of Friends (Quakers) had been in the area since 1640, the third meeting house they built in 1684 is believed to be the oldest Friends Meeting House still standing in the United States still in use. Third Haven Quakers were viewed by their neighbors as \u201cGood Samaritans\u201d because they were the first to take in sick or ill-treated indentured servants, and they began their efforts to free slaves as early as 1674. In 1766, one famous Quaker, John Woolman, traveled barefoot (wearing undyed clothes) throughout the Eastern Shore of Maryland pleading with every slave owner to free their slaves and no longer profit from slavery. They, like their Tuckahoe Neck neighbors, would become instrumental in the Underground Railroad.\u000a\u000a12. \u201cThe Nation\u2019s Church,\u201d Christ Church; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1695 \u2014 Christ Church is the birthplace of the American Episcopalian denomination. Prominent Revolutionary War leaders worshipped here and its cemetery holds the remains of some of the most important political and religious leaders of the Colonial and Revolutionary-era, including those of Benjamin Franklin and four signers of the Declaration of Independence. Tours of the church and cemetery are held daily.\u000a\u000a13. Mission Dolores Parish; San Francisco, California; 1776 \u2014 Comprised of the original Misión San Francisco de Asís and the Dolores Basilica, this parish was essentially the birthplace of \u201cThe City by the Bay\u201d and has served the community since the days of the original, native Californians. It\u2019s the oldest, intact mission in the state, even surviving the great 1906 earthquake that leveled and burned more than three-quarters of the city. During his 1987 visit at the height of the AIDS epidemic, Pope John Paul II blessed 62 AIDS patients, including a 4-year-old child, at Mission Dolores.\u000a\u000a14. Holy Trinity \u201cOld Swedes\u201d Church; Wilmington, Delaware; 1699 \u2014 Swedish immigrants initially settled in the Delaware Valley in the mid- to late 17th century and built Lutheran churches. Most significant are the three that share similar architecture called "Old Swedes": Holy Trinity, Gloria Dei Church in Philadelphia (founded 1677 and the oldest church in Pennsylvania), and Trinity Church in Swedesboro, New Jersey (founded 1703). All were significant catalysts during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars whose members were prominent political, medical, and military leaders. Holy Trinity Delaware is reportedly "the nation's oldest church building still used for worship as originally built." Its cemetery holds more than 15,000 burials, including many noteworthy influencers.\u000a\u000a15. Roger Williams National Park; Providence, Rhode Island; 1636 \u2014 One of the most influential leaders in England, America, and Europe, was Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island. His 1644 treatise on religious freedom, \u201cThe Bloody Tenent of Persecution,\u201d influenced political philosophy for centuries. In 1636, Williams purchased land from the Narragansett Indians, naming this new colony, Providence, establishing it as a haven for freedom of conscience. The national park offers tours and a range of information about Williams, 17th-century life, and portrays how Thomas Jefferson and James Madison incorporated William\u2019s beliefs as the bedrock of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\u000a\u000a16. Temple Square; Salt Lake City, Utah; 1853 \u2014 One of Utah\u2019s top tourist attractions is Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. Its 35 acres encompasses the world headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, free, guided tours of historic sites, special exhibits, art displays, and films about Mormon culture and heritage. It also features parks and gardens, and it boasts the largest genealogy library of its kind in the world.\u000a\u000a17. The St. Louis Cathedral; New Orleans, Louisiana; 1720 \u2014 Not far from the delights of Café du Monde sits the oldest cathedral in North America. Originally founded as a Roman Catholic parish in 1720, this cathedral\u2019s iconic and majestic triple steeples make it one of New Orleans\u2019 most remarkable landmarks. Its beauty is enhanced by the constant stream of jazz music flowing through its stained glass windows, enjoyed by visitors and parishioners alike.\u000a\u000a18. Old North Church; Boston, Massachusetts; 1729 \u2014 Although the church is Boston\u2019s oldest, it\u2019s most known because of Paul Revere\u2019s midnight ride on April 18, 1775. As he rode his horse through neighborhoods warning, \u201cThe British are coming! The British are coming!\u201d his destination was the Old North Church. It was the meeting place of the Revolution from which the famous signal, "One if by land, and two if by sea" was reportedly sent. The people who met here prepared for the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the American Revolution. Of Boston\u2019s numerous historic religious sites, this is part of the Freedom Trail.\u000a\u000a19. Old South Meeting House; Boston, Massachusetts; 1729\u2014 Built by congregants who broke from a church founded by John Winthrop in 1630, this church became central to public debate. Renowned for its protest meetings, it was called, the \u201cmouth-house\u201d before the American Revolution. It has always been a symbol and platform for the free expression of ideas. In 1773, 5,000 people gathered to debate British taxation, after which some dumped crates of tea off of three British ships into the Boston Harbor. It was from this church that Founding Father, Samuel Adams, gave the signal to the \u201cwar whoops,\u201d beginning the Boston Tea Party. Its first pastor published the state\u2019s first medical tract; notable congregants included Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin\u000a\u000aFranklin, Samuel Sewall, and African-American poet Phillis Wheatley.\u000a\u000a20. Christ Church; Savannah, Georgia; 1733 \u2014 Founded the same year as the colony of Georgia, its first church services were held in English, French, and Italian. Its most notable rector was the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, from 1736-1737. Wesley started the first Sunday school and published one of the first English hymnals in the colonies. Its bell was made by Revere and Son of Boston, which is still used today. One of its members, Juliette Gordon Low, founded the Girl Scouts of America. Wesley\u2019s successor was his friend and fellow evangelist and leader of the Great Awakening, George Whitefield, who served as the church\u2019s rector until 1740. He also founded the Bethesda Orphan House and Academy (Bethesda Academy), the oldest home and school for boys in America. His home for girls, Mercy House, is one of the oldest period homes in Savannah dating to 1740. Whitefield\u2019s message, fervor and oratory capabilities brought about the First Great Awakening in America between 1738 and 1770.\u000a\u000a21. Amish Heritage Sites of Pennsylvania; 1760 \u2014 One of the only unchanged communities in America can be found in the picturesque slopes and fields of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and its neighboring counties. Founded in 1760, America\u2019s oldest Amish community, and neighboring expansive Mennonite community, presents a popular year-round vacation and educational destination where traffic and time slow to the pace of horse-drawn buggies, and windmills, not cell phones, are prevalent. Old World attractions and events, handmade crafts, quaint bed-and-breakfasts, and homemade food abound from the Pennsylvania Dutch, who maintain a lifestyle made possible because of the religious freedom they enjoy.\u000a\u000a22. \u201cThe Little Chapel that Stood\u201d St. Paul\u2019s Chapel; New York City; 1766 \u2014 This chapel, which celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2016, is the oldest surviving church building, the only colonial-era building, and the oldest public building in continuous use in Manhattan. George Washington and the first members of Congress prayed there after Washington\u2019s inauguration at Federal Hall on April 30, 1789. The chapel not only survived the Great Fire of 1776 (after the British won the Battle of Long Island and burned one fourth of the city), but also miraculously survived 9/11. Located opposite of the World Trade Center, not one of its windows was broken. The church became and remains a respite for survivors and symbol of hope. Open to the public, visitors can view old and new monuments and memorials.\u000a\u000a23. Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcalá; San Diego, California; 1769 \u2014 Called the "Mother of the Missions" this National Historic Landmark was the first of 21 Spanish missions established by Franciscan priest Father Junípero Serra in modern-day California when it was the Spanish territory New Spain (Mexico). It fell under Mexican government control in 1821 and then under American control in 1848. Most notable of the mission\u2019s many achievements was the large-scale vineyard and farming operation it implemented, which by 1825 included more than 28,000 head of livestock and an olive harvest that helped source California\u2019s 1878 olive boom. It built a dam and a several-miles-long aqueduct, which was remarkable considering that the land was arid and no such farming existed prior to the Franciscans\u2019 arrival.\u000a\u000a24. The Billy Graham Library and Museum; Charlotte, North Carolina; 2007 \u2014 Perhaps one of the greatest American evangelists of all time, the Reverend Billy Graham reached several hundred million people in more than 185 countries in his lifetime, preaching the gospel and the freedom and liberty that comes with it. The impact of his ministry and information about his life and organizations\u2019 efforts are displayed through multimedia presentations, photos, memorabilia, and a tour of his childhood home. His ministries continue to provide disaster relief and humanitarian aid to people in need worldwide.\u000a\u000a25. Trinity Church; New York City; 1790 \u2014 Although it was first built facing Wall Street in 1697, the church was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1776 and rebuilt by 1790. The steeple of the church building \u2014 whether the first, second, or most recent, which was consecrated in 1846 \u2014 was for years the highest point in the city and a landmark for ships entering Hudson Bay. President George Washington and members of his government, including John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, attended services here for two years when New York City was America\u2019s first capitol. Its cemetery holds the remains of many notables, including Alexander Hamilton and his family members.\u000a\u000a26. Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church; Montgomery, Alabama; 1954 \u2014 From the pulpit of this church, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ignited the Civil Rights Movement. Serving as its pastor from 1954 to 1960, he and others led countless civil rights meetings and activism, supporting the 1955-56 Montgomery bus boycott.\u000a\u000a27. First Church of Christ Congregational; Farmington, Connecticut; 1771 \u2014 Built in 1771, one of the church\u2019s first pastors was the father of the founder of Yale University. But the church became famous in 1839 for sheltering the African slaves who revolted on the Spanish ship, La Amistad. It was already a significant hub on the Underground Railroad, and its leaders were active abolitionists. Their cause for righteousness gained even more momentum after the Amistad trial, which became a turning point for the abolitionist movement.\u000a\u000a28. St. Michael the Archangel Cathedral; Sitka, Alaska; 1808 \u2014 For those who make the trek to Alaska or whose cruise ship stops in Sitka, one interesting stop is a visit to the National Historic Landmark, St. Michael\u2019s, a reconstruction of the historic Russian Orthodox cathedral. (The original burned in 1966.) Sitka was the former seat of the Russian Orthodox Diocese that governed all of North America, and was under control of Russia until 1867. This cathedral was the \u201clargest and most imposing edifice in Alaska until the 20th century.\u201d Although Alaska did not become a state until 1959, the cathedral fell under the authority of the Orthodox Church of America Diocese of Alaska in 1872, which has maintained its unique Russian characteristics.\u000a\u000a29. St. John\u2019s Church; Washington, D.C.; 1816 \u2014 Located directly across the street from the White House, this historic Episcopalian Church is known as the \u201cChurch of the Presidents.\u201d Since 1815, every U.S. president has attended at least one service here. Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who rebuilt the White House and the U.S. Capitol after the War of 1812, built it.\u000a\u000a30. Old Ursuline Convent; New Orleans, Louisiana; 1752 \u2014 Built in 1752, the convent is the only remaining French colonial building in America, and one of the only buildings in the French Quarter that survived a devastating fire in the 18th century. But its legacy is more than its architecture. The Sisters of Ursula founded schools, orphanages, and the first asylum to treat the sick and poor in New Orleans, and in numerous cities throughout America. St. Mary\u2019s Church adjoins the old convent, which is open for guided tours.\u000a\u000a31. Baltimore Basilica; Baltimore, Maryland (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary); 1806-1821 \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Cathedral\u201d is the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in America after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. The archbishop of Baltimore\u2019s cousin, Charles Carroll, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Its architect, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, also designed the U.S. Capitol.\u000a\u000a32. St. Mary\u2019s Basilica; Natchez, Mississippi; 1843 \u2014 Like the Roman Catholics in the Southwest and West, the Catholic community in Natchez fell under the authority of several countries. Discovered in 1682 by Robert de la Salle, its first parish was established in 1722 by a French Catholic priest. After France lost the French and Indian War in 1762 it ceded the Louisiana territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain, which built a church in Natchez in 1788. In 1763 France ceded the land east of the Mississippi to England. After America gained its independence, Natchez was caught in-between Spain and America. Spain sold New Orleans to France in 1800 then France sold the Louisiana Territory to America in 1803. Needless to say the cathedral, which was established in 1843 and consecrated in 1886, reflects its multinational and ethnic heritage and is visited by people all over the globe because of its \u201cbreathtaking\u201d beauty.\u000a\u000a33. Mormon Trail Center; Omaha, Nebraska; 1846 \u2014 Unfortunately, after Joseph Smith\u2019s revelation in Palmyra, New York, he and his Mormon followers did not experience religious freedom in America. Run out of the East Coast as a heretic, he and his followers continued migrating west. The Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters depicts the experience of 90,000 Mormon pioneers who traveled west to the Rocky Mountains between 1846 and 1860. The museum displays a log cabin, covered wagon, and other aspects of their journey. Open daily; the center hosts guided tours and a yearly quilt show.\u000a\u000a34. Washington National Cathedral; Washington, D.C.; 1990 \u2014 Officially called the "Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington," the cathedral was completed in 1990 after 200 years of planning and construction. President George Washington had in 1792 sought to build "a church intended for national purposes." The gothic-style cathedral sits 400 feet above sea level on top of Mount Saint Albans in northwest Washington, D.C. Part of the National Park Service; it is the sixth largest in the world and second largest in America. The cathedral has held many significant funeral services including those of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Dwight Eisenhower. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from this pulpit before his assassination. Its cemetery holds the remains of many notable Americans including Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.\u000a\u000a35. Temple-Tifereth Israel; Cleveland, Ohio; 1850 \u2014 This 165-year-old Reform Jewish congregation\u2019s several sites include its gold-domed Byzantine-style temple, which is now part of the Maltz Performing Arts Center at Case Western Reserve University. Its Temple Museum of Jewish Art, Religion and Culture, is one of the oldest museums of Judaica in North America. Its gallery space at the Beachwood synagogue and Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage exhibit the history of Judaism and Jewish immigrant experiences in America.\u000a\u000a36. Race Street Meeting House; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1856 \u2014 The historic and still active Quaker meetinghouse was at the forefront of the women\u2019s rights movement. Its famous leaders include women\u2019s rights activist and abolitionist Lucretia Mott, peace activist Hannah Clothier Hull, and suffragette leader and author of the Equal Rights Amendment Alice Paul. A National Historic Landmark, this meetinghouse represents the achievements of women who tirelessly fought to end slavery and advance civil rights for women.\u000a\u000a37. Mission San Juan Capistrano; San Juan Capistrano, California; 1776 \u2014 Perhaps most famous as a destination for migratory swallows, the mission, dubbed the \u201cJewel of the California Missions,\u201d is a treasure trove of art, artifacts, architecture, and gardens to explore. Hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 and birds \u2014 visit the mission annually.\u000a\u000a38. Beecher Bible And Rifle Church; Wabaunsee, Kansas; 1856 \u2014 Following the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill in 1854, Kansans had to vote to become a free state or a slave state and choose which side of the Civil War it would support. East Coasters flooded into Kansas to influence the vote, including a group from Henry Ward Beecher\u2019s Plymouth Church, No. 26 on the list. To convince Kansans of the evil of slavery \u2014 they smuggled in Sharps rifles, widely known as \u201cBeecher Bibles,\u201d which Beecher maintained was a \u201cmoral agency\u201d necessary to fight the evils of slavery.\u000a\u000a39. Metropolitan AME Church; Washington, D.C.; 1872 \u2014 The oldest continuously operating black church in the District of Columbia was active in the abolitionist movement, sheltering slaves along the Underground Railroad. The first black U.S. senator to serve a full term, Sen. Blanche Kelso Bruce, of Missouri, was a church member. In 1894, he introduced fellow congregant and leading abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who delivered his last speech before he died, \u201cThe Lessons of the Hour,\u201d in which he admonished the U.S. to end racial prejudice so that the nation could \u201cflourish forever.\u201d Other leading figures who\u2019ve spoken at Metropolitan include Mary McLeod Bethune, the early 20th-century civil rights leader, Joel Elias Spingarn, a founder of the NAACP, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Vice President Hubert H.

The first Jewish European settlement in Galveston was founded in 1816. In 1907, New York financier Jacob Schiff and Reform Rabbi Henry Cohen of Galveston launched the Galveston Movement Plan, which helped bring more than 10,000 Jews to Galveston who escaped Russian and Eastern European pogroms.\u000a\u000a41. St. John the Divine; New York City; 1892 \u2014 The largest cathedral in the world is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Building began in 1892 but its construction remains only two-thirds completed. Continuing its Romanesque-Byzantine and French gothic style, its completion relies on European master stonecutters. Visitors can gaze at its colossal structure whose nave alone is the size of two football fields, and at its Great Rose Window, the largest glass window in America, made from more than 10,000 pieces of colored glass. Inside its 162-foot dome the Statue of Liberty could easily fit. Twice a year its three-ton bronze doors are opened \u2014 on Easter and during the Feast of St. Francis.\u000a\u000a42. Congregation Sherith Israel; San Francisco, California; 1851 \u2014 This Reform temple boasts a monumental Spanish revival era stained-glass window that depicts the story of Moses on Mount Sinai \u2014 with a twist. Established by Jewish pioneers during California\u2019s Gold Rush, the window shows the iconic El Capitan towering from the Yosemite Valley (replacing Mount Sinai), symbolizing the Jewish yearning for a promised land and their new life in America.\u000a\u000a43. Temple Emanu-El; New York City; 1847 \u2014 Temple Emanu-El is the world\u2019s largest temple and the first Reform congregation established in New York City.

Unity Temple; Oak Park, Illinois; 1905 \u2014 The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust describes Unity Temple as \u201cthe greatest public building of the architect\u2019s Chicago years.\u201d Included as one of the stops on the Frank Lloyd Wright tour, visitors continue to be intrigued by the building\u2019s invisible entrance while they learn about the Unitarian Universalists\u2019 roles in the abolition and civil rights movements.\u000a\u000a45. Twin Cathedral; Twin Cities, Minnesota; 1915 \u2014 Roman Catholicism was introduced into the territory that is now Minnesota in the 1830s. By the early 1900s, two cathedrals were designed by the same architect in the same classical revival style and were completed within a few years of each other. By 1915, the first liturgy was read at the Cathedral of St. Paul, which is the third-largest Roman Catholic church in America. Its \u201ctwin,\u201d the Basilica of St. Mary, claims the distinction of being the first church in America designated as a basilica. The Basilica School opened in 1913. Free tours are available during which visitors can learn of the churches\u2019 historic involvement with immigrant communities and its ongoing commitment to the arts.\u000a\u000a46. Riverside Church; New York City; 1930 \u2014 Inspired by a famous French cathedral, Riverside Church is the tallest church in America and the 24th tallest in the world. Its architectural feat is rivaled by its congregants\u2019 commitment to social activism and \u201cnondenominational inclusivism.\u201d In the west portal, its \u201cArch of Scientists\u201d includes sculptures of Archimedes, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Louis Pasteur, Isaac Newton \u2014 and Albert Einstein. When Einstein heard that as a Jew he was included in a Protestant church he said, \u201cThis could not happen in Europe. I am afraid it may never happen there.\u201d Fleeing Jewish persecution in Germany, he found respite in Princeton, New Jersey.\u000a\u000a47. Temple Beth Sholom; Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; 1959 \u2014 This futuristic, pyramidal synagogue is the only synagogue ever designed by the famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. A National Historic Landmark, its walls and ceilings are masterfully decorated with geometrical designs. It represents significant architectural history and the 20th-century suburbanization of Jews into middle- and upper-class America.\u000a\u000a48. Mason Temple Church of God in Christ; Memphis, Tennessee; 1968 \u2014 More than 3,000 people gathered at this temple to hear Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his prophetic "Mountaintop" speech on April 3, 1968 \u2014 the eve of his assassination. The temple was central to civil rights meetings and activism in Memphis during the 1950s and \u201960s, and today remains the headquarters of the Church of God in Christ, the second-largest black denomination after the AME.\u000a\u000a49. The Chapel in the Hills; Rapid City, South Dakota; 1969 \u2014 This wooden church transports visitors to a Scandinavian world of more than 800 years ago. On the western outskirts of Rapid City lies a full-scale replica of a 12th-century Norwegian Borgund stave church. Visitors can learn about Norwegian immigrant history at a small museum, which includes an original log cabin previously owned by Norwegian settlers, and attend daily summer worship services in the chapel.\u000a\u000a50. Saint Photios Greek Orthodox Chapel and National Shrine; St. Augustine, Florida; 1985 \u2014 The first Greek Orthodox community in North America was established in New Orleans by a small group of Greek merchants. They also settled in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1768. Although the first permanent Greek Orthodox community was established in New York City in 1892, this National Shrine serves as a monument and museum that tells the Greek immigrant story and pursuit of finding religious freedom in the New World.

aVA new blood test from Roche and Foundation Medicine has shown it can accurately measure the number of mutations within a tumor, potentially helping doctors predict which patients may respond best to some immunotherapies.\u000a\u000aInitial data on Roche's new test aimed at determining tumor mutational burden, or TMB, was released on Friday at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in Madrid. There are no TMB blood tests on the market now, Roche said.\u000a\u000aImmunotherapies like Roche's Tecentriq, Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo have offered fresh hope to people with deadly cancers, but they only work in a fraction of patients.\u000a\u000aAnd given immunotherapies' high costs and possible serious side effects, with British regulators having dubbed Tecentriq too pricey, doctors want better ways of figuring out which patients would benefit the most from such treatments.\u000a\u000aEvidence shows that tumors with more mutations are more likely to respond to immunotherapy, Roche said, adding that it hoped its and Foundation's new test would improve measuring TMB where invasive tumor biopsies that can be tough to evaluate are now required.\u000a\u000a"Biomarkers will not only improve our understanding of immune biology but will ultimately help match our therapies and combinations to the people most likely to benefit," said Sandra Horning, MD, Roche\u2019s chief medical officer.\u000a\u000a"This blood-based TMB assay is one example of how we and our partners are advancing the science towards personalization of cancer therapy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe biomarker data being presented at ESMO was gathered using nearly 800 plasma samples from patients in Roche's studies of its drug Tecentriq for treating lung cancer.\u000a\u000aThe Basel-based company also has a pair of prospective studies underway in lung cancer patients to evaluate and validate its TMB test.\u000a\u000aRoche, which owns 58 percent of Foundation, is developing 20 cancer immunotherapy medicines across nine types of cancer, both by themselves and in combination with dozens of other drugs.

aVA power outage for a few hours may be a minor inconvenience, but the situation gets a little scary when the lights go out for days or even weeks on end. But natural disasters have kept people without power for such long periods, and they\u2019ve managed to prevail.\u000a\u000aSome people worry about foreign or terrorist acts that could keep entire areas of the country off the power grid. State and local governments have emergency preparedness plans to help communities, but sometimes people are left on their own.\u000a\u000aThe Emergency Radio Every Family Must Have \u2014 Special FREE Offer\u000a\u000aThese seven ways to live if the lights go out can help you deal with an uncomfortable situation that lasts longer than usual:\u000a\u000a1. Don\u2019t panic \u2014 If the lights go out for a long period of time, remember that people not too long ago lived just fine without electrical power. Many people continue to do so for fun when camping or hiking. Friends and family in the same situation can help each other get through it.\u000a\u000a2. Protect food sources \u2014 Staying fed is essential, especially if the darkness lingers on. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible the day the power goes off, advises the American Red Cross. Use food from the refrigerator first, then from the freezer, which can keep foods for up to 48 hours. Afterwards, use non-perishable foods. Store food in a cooler with ice when it appears the power outage will last more than a day.\u000a\u000a3. Use candles carefully \u2014 Candles cause hundreds of fires a year when left unattended, according to Uxari. Keep lit candles away from flammable materials such as upholstered furniture and curtains.\u000a\u000a4. Stay safe inside \u2014 Avoid travel and wasting gas as much as possible, especially with the danger of no traffic lights and anxious drivers. Do not use outdoor grills, generators, or other devices that use gas, propane, and charcoal burning inside. They can release life-threatening carbon monoxide. Keep the devices outside, away from doors, windows, and vents that might bring carbon monoxide inside.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Terror Chatter High, Get Your FREE Emergency Radio Now\u000a\u000a5. Have alternative power sources \u2014 Battery-operated gadgets keep you in contact with the rest of the world. Prepare to use battery packs and plenty of AA and AAA batteries for radios, flashlights, and other necessities. A car battery can be a good source of power. A cigarette-lighter adapter can also charge up various gadgets, writes Eric Limer at Gizmodo.\u000a\u000a6. Keep hydrated \u2014 A gallon of drinking water is needed for each person each day. Fill up the tub or buckets when it appears the power may be off for a long time, affecting the water supply. Collect rain water if possible. Water is also needed for cleaning dishes and washing.\u000a\u000a7. Remain active \u2014 Exercise is important for body and mind. Turn to board games and cards to occupy the time with family and friends. Communicate with your neighbors. Cooking with outside grills connects neighbors with each other. Maintaining a strong relationship with neighbors at this time comes in handy to share thoughts and ideas on survival methods if the lights stay out for a very long time.\u000a\u000aClick Here: Free Emergency Radio Is Yours, Get It Before It's Too Late!

aVThe United States is one of the most charitable countries in the world with Americans donating more than $358 billion in 2014 alone, according to GivingUSA.org.

The Navy SEAL Foundation \u2014 Since 9/11, our Special Operations Forces have been tasked with monumental goals on battlefields around the world.

The Innocence Project \u2014 It is a sad fact that a nation that prides itself on equal justice for all has imprisoned many innocent people. This is due partly to the fact that, until recently, we lacked the technology to perform the DNA testing that could exonerate wrongfully imprisoned inmates.

Rebuilding Together \u2014 A safe and secure home is a vital part of the American dream.

aVWomen who consistently get the minimum recommended amount of exercise for a healthy heart may be less likely to have a stroke than their counterparts whose exercise habits shift over time, a recent U.S. study suggests.\u000a\u000aResearchers examined data on more than 61,000 women in the California Teachers Study who reported their exercise habits at two points in time, once from 1995 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. The women were current and retired teachers when the study began.\u000a\u000aOverall, 987 women had a stroke by the end of the study period.\u000a\u000aBut the women who got at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise at both points in time were 30 percent less likely to have what\u2019s known as an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, which occurs when a clot blocks an artery carrying blood to the brain.\u000a\u000a\u201cHow people exercise changes over time and some individuals exercise when they are a young adult but do not keep it up when they are older,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Joshua Willey of Columbia University Medical Center in New York.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn our study, we found that maintaining exercise levels was protective against stroke, and that taking up exercise when not being active while younger was also protective,\u201d Willey said by email. \u201cSimilarly, those who no longer exercised on the follow up assessment did not have a lower risk of stroke.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe American Heart Association recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous physical activity.\u000a\u000aMore than 22,000 women met these minimum recommendations at both points when they were assessed in the study, mostly with moderate exercise.\u000a\u000aAlmost 19,000 women failed to get enough exercise at either point in time.\u000a\u000aAnother 11,500 women fell short of this goal in the beginning but achieved it at the end, while about 8,600 women started out getting enough exercise but failed to do so by the end of the study.\u000a\u000aCompared to women who failed to meet exercise recommendations at either point in time, women who got enough moderate activity at both points were 38 percent less likely to have a fatal stroke and 12 percent less likely to have any kind of stroke, the study found.\u000a\u000aMeeting moderate exercise guidelines by the end of the study, but not at the start, was associated with 35 percent lower odds of a fatal stroke and 27 percent lower odds of any stroke.\u000a\u000aBut the chance of any stroke, including fatal ones, was similar for women who never got enough exercise and women who started out meeting the activity recommendations but didn\u2019t do so at the end of the study, researchers report in the journal Stroke.\u000a\u000aThe results were similar for women who did higher-intensity exercise.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how exercise habits might influence the odds of having a stroke or dying from it.\u000a\u000aOther limitations include the lack of data on other factors that could influence stroke risk such as blood pressure, obesity or diabetes, the authors note.\u000a\u000aEven so, the findings add to growing evidence for the benefits of moderate exercise, said Joe Northey of the University of Canberra in Australia.\u000a\u000a\u201cModerate intensity seems to be optimal for increasing blood flow to the brain,\u201d Northey, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cIncreasing cerebral blood flow through exercise improves the health and function of the brain.\u201d\u000a\u000aEnjoyment, rather than intensity, should be the focus, said Dr. James Burke, of the University of Michigan and the Ann Arbor VA.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe best exercise is the one a person enjoys doing because he/she is more likely to make it a habit,\u201d Burke, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000aInactivity, meanwhile, can take a toll on health, said Sandra Billinger of Kansas University Medical Center in Kansas City.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we don\u2019t exercise, our blood vessels become more stiff, we tend to gain weight, our lungs are not well used and our muscles become weak and lose size,\u201d Billinger, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.

aVLegislation or regulation may be needed to require Facebook Inc. and other social-media companies to prevent foreign adversaries from manipulating the feeds viewed by U.S. citizens, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m glad they came through with some information,\u201d Senator Mark Warner told reporters Thursday, a day after Facebook said it found about $100,000 in ad spending connected to fake accounts probably run from Russia. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more questions.\u201d\u000a\u000aWarner said the company had earlier \u201cpooh-poohed\u201d suspicions that Russians manipulated postings on Facebook and other sites as part of a campaign to meddle in last year\u2019s U.S. campaign for president. What Facebook found may be only \u201ca small piece of the election interference through social media,\u201d the senator from Virginia said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. presidential election has put the social-media company under increased scrutiny and forced it to consider its role in society, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s thinking has evolved. A day after the election, he played down the role fake news may have played in the election, calling the theory "pretty crazy." He soon reversed course, saying the issue was important for Facebook\u2019s community. Still, Facebook has struggled with exactly how transparent to be about its processes and how deeply to police its users.\u000a\u000aAccounts Deleted\u000a\u000aThe company deleted accounts and pages involved in buying the ads believed to be tied to Russia because they were fake users in violation of the network\u2019s policies. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed the nature of the more than 3,000 ads that ran, and a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say what U.S. states they ran in, what they promoted or how many people they reached. Facebook said it can\u2019t share the ads while the investigation continues.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are continuing to cooperate with appropriate authorities and have shared the results of our internal inquiries to this point,\u201d the company said Thursday in a statement. \u201cAnd of course, we will continue to review what Russians could have done to manipulate the platform.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe ad spending linked to Russia and disclosed by Facebook was relatively small. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google issued a statement Thursday saying that \u201cwe\u2019re always monitoring for abuse or violations of our policies, and we\u2019ve seen no evidence this type of ad campaign was run on our platforms.\u201d\u000a\u000aWarner said representatives of Twitter Inc. will be coming in to meet with the Senate panel soon. Emily Horne, a Twitter spokeswoman, declined to comment.\u000a\u000aDifferent Medium\u000a\u000aFacebook and other social-media companies aren\u2019t subject to the regulations on political advertising developed long ago for broadcasters.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s just not the case with digital,\u201d said Ken Goldstein, a professor at the University of San Francisco who studies political advertising. \u201cAll the laws were created before we had the digital world, and it\u2019s just harder to track.\u201d The companies may rush now to self-regulate to stave off government action, he said.\u000a\u000aWarner said the issue is \u201cobviously\u201d relevant to the Intelligence Committee\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference, which U.S. intelligence agencies found was intended to hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton and ultimately help Republican Donald Trump win the White House, and whether anyone close to Trump colluded in the effort.\u000a\u000aRepublican Senator Richard Burr, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman, declined to comment on whether the committee might hold a hearing about outside influence on Facebook or Twitter. But he rejected the idea of moving legislation through his panel and added that foreign interference in U.S. elections is already illegal.\u000a\u000aQuestion of Jurisdiction\u000a\u000a\u201cThat would not be the jurisdiction of our committee,\u201d the senator from North Carolina said. \u201cAnd if, in fact, there was foreign money that went into advertising in U.S. elections, that\u2019s a Justice Department thing to look at, it\u2019s an FEC question, because foreign money cannot be used on behalf of elections. The question is, is there a regulator of social media?\u201d\u000a\u000aWarner wasn\u2019t suggesting a legislative solution would go through the Intelligence Committee, according to Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for the senator. She noted that he serves other roles, including as a member of the Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over election spending and disclosure issues.\u000a\u000aOutside groups, including Common Cause, filed a complaint with the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission Thursday alleging that the Facebook disclosures mean unknown foreign nationals made campaign ad expenditures in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\u000a\u000aWarner, who became a multimillionaire in telecommunications, said he believes Americans would want to know if \u201cpop-up\u201d news they may rely on \u201ccame from a foreign source.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Kremlin had no connection to the Facebook ad campaign, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have never heard about it, we know nothing about it and -- even more -- we have no connection to these issues,\u201d Peskov said.

aVOne of the six Catholic cardinals in the United States took issue with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon's remark that the Catholic Church only supports immigrant-friendly legislation for economic reasons.\u000a\u000aThe saga began when Bannon sat down for an interview with CBS that is slated to air this weekend. During that interview, Bannon took a harsh view of the Catholic Church and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which will end in six months.\u000a\u000a"They need illegal aliens to fill the churches," Bannon said. "It's obvious on the face of it. . . . They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration."\u000a\u000aCardinal Timothy Dolan, who leads the Archdiocese of New York, fired back on Sirius XM's Catholic Channel on Thursday.\u000a\u000a"You might imagine I was rather befuddled to see [Bannon's comments]," Dolan said. "I don't care to go into it, but I think it's a preposterous and rather insulting statement that the only reason we bishops care for immigrants is for the economic [benefit] because we want to fill our churches and get more money. That's insulting, and that's just so ridiculous that it doesn't merit a comment."\u000a\u000aDolan went on to explain that showing compassion to immigrants is in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testament.\u000a\u000a"The Bible is so clear, so clear to treat the immigrant with dignity and respect," Dolan said. "To make sure that society is just in its treatment of the immigrant is biblical mandate. It's clear in the Old Testament, my Jewish neighbors remind me of that all the time, and it's clear from the lips of Jesus."\u000a\u000aThe Department of Justice announced plans this week to end DACA in March. The program allows people who illegally came to the United States as children with their parents to stay in America under certain conditions.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump said he took issue with the fact DACA was an executive order signed by former President Barack Obama in 2012, rather than lawful legislation put together by Congress. Members of both political parties are now tasked with writing and passing legislation that would serve as a permanent replacement for DACA.

aVPresident Donald Trump reportedly is continuing to push for dropping the corporate tax rate to 15 percent despite opposition within his party and the conclusion of most of his negotiators that it will end up between 20 and 25 percent.\u000a\u000aThe White House has said that a dramatic cut to the corporate rate from today's 35 percent level is essential to fostering the kind of economic growth Trump promised on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aSlashing the rate for corporations and so-called pass-through entities to 15 percent \u2014 the goal Trump has set \u2014 could cost more than $2 trillion over 10 years, according to the Washington-based Tax Foundation think tank.\u000a\u000aIf tax changes are to be permanent, any cuts have to be accompanied by offsets such as the elimination of loopholes. So far, White House officials and congressional leaders haven\u2019t provided many details about ways to offset cuts, aside from eliminating state and local tax deductions.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t get to 15 percent, and anyone who has a back of an envelope can make that calculation,\u201d a senior official working on tax reform told Politico. \u201cAnd he may not like that truth, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s just math.\u201d\u000a\u000aLawmakers are already facing a crowded legislative calendar, including efforts to fund the federal government, increase the nation\u2019s debt borrowing authority, and pay for recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aThat agenda got even fuller earlier Tuesday when the president announced his plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which offers protection to immigrants who were brought to the country as children without documentation. Administration officials say they now want Congress to act on DACA, Bloomberg reported.\u000a\u000aTrump has touted the tax cuts, sayign they will prompt businesses to invest and hire more workers while making it less attractive to open manufacturing facilities overseas and ship products back into the United States.\u000a\u000aPart of the challenge for the White House is crafting a major legislative package that can appeal to the fractured Republican Party in Congress, where hard-core conservatives and more moderate members often find themselves at odds, Politico explained.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe key hurdle is very simple. It\u2019s how to craft a package that can get 50 votes in the Senate and avoid the problems they had with Obamacare,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an informal economic adviser to Trump and distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cI still maintain they will end up with something really scaled back that can give the president a bill-signing ceremony,\u201d said Moore, also a Newsmax Finance Insider.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe politics of the issue keep changing as to what is attainable here, but it\u2019s time to get realistic about what we can pass,\u201d Moore added.\u000a\u000aThe White House has attempted a more traditional sales effort for the tax legislation, holding weekly strategy meetings within the administration as congressional and White House negotiators work to flesh out the tax code\u2019s overhaul. The administration has held weekly conference calls with outside conservative political advocacy and business groups, and on Tuesday Trump huddled with the advisers and congressional leaders shepherding his effort on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to cut taxes,\u201d Trump vowed Tuesday during a Roosevelt Room meeting with the so-called Big Six tax negotiators \u2014 National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the leaders of the congressional tax-writing committees.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re going to reduce taxes for people, for individuals, for middle-income families. We are going to reduce taxes for our companies. And those companies are going to produce jobs."\u000a\u000aAdministration officials said before the meeting that they didn\u2019t expect it to produce any major policy breakthroughs, but instead serve as a kickoff to congressional efforts to flesh out tax principles the leaders released in July. Details of a revamp remain scant, with basic questions like where corporate and individual rates will be set unanswered.\u000a\u000aTrump stuck to well-practiced talking points when reporters were invited in for a portion of the meeting, repeating admonitions that the tax code should be \u201cas simple as possible\u201d and that a tax cut would produce \u201cmillions of new jobs.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in a statement, described the meeting as "productive" and said the group "agreed that committee activity should continue so that Congress can move to mark-ups on legislation as expeditiously as possible."\u000a\u000aEven if lawmakers didn\u2019t face an incredibly busy and politically charged schedule, there remain a series of tough decisions to make on a tax overhaul, Bloomberg explained.\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady declined to go into specifics when asked what progress had been made toward agreement on tax changes in August. He also declined to say whether any specific decisions had been made by the tax leadership in Congress and the Trump administration over the recess.\u000a\u000a"Every day we work on driving the rates lower, both for middle-class families and for businesses of all sizes," he told reporters.\u000a\u000aMost of the Big Six negotiators have come to the conclusion that the corporate rate will end up somewhere between 20 percent and 25 percent, Politico explained.\u000a\u000aThe thinking is that lowering the rate to 15 percent is unattainable without introducing a major new tax, such as the border adjustment tax long favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Brady, R-Texas.\u000a\u000a"Negotiators now must decide how hard to push on limiting expensing for capital investments and cutting into other current deductions to get that rate close to 20 percent. More immediate expensing and continuing to allow deductions for corporate interest, for instance, would mean pushing the top corporate rate closer to 25 percent," Politico explained.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere the rubber meets the road is how much you are willing to cut into all this stuff to get the number closer to 20,\u201d the administration official told Politico\u000a\u000aWhile Trump continues to push to get as low on the top rate as possible, he is mainly sticking to the 15 percent figure so as not to be \u201cnegotiating with himself,\u201d said White House officials working on tax reform, and they expect the president eventually to endorse a plan that has a higher rate, probably closer to 20 percent or slightly higher.\u000a\u000aHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said Republicans still haven\u2019t received any guidance from leaders on what corporate, individual or capital-gains tax rates will be. He said it\u2019s important for "real specifics" to be decided by the end of September, "so that we\u2019re actually debating the legislative text so we can pass it out of the House."\u000a\u000aDemocrats are also likely to object to changes that would benefit the richest taxpayers, with 45 senators signing a letter earlier this year saying they wouldn\u2019t support a bill including tax cuts for the top 1 percent.\u000a\u000aTax policy experts have said the dozen bullet points the White House released in April outlining its principles would undoubtedly mean lower taxes for top earners, while the effect on middle incomes was less clear. The plan calls for cutting the top income-tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent; eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, which raises the tax bills of certain taxpayers on the higher side of the income scale; and repealing the estate tax, which applies to individuals with estates worth more than $5.49 million. However, it also would eliminate state and local tax deductions, which tend to benefit high-income filers in Democratic states.\u000a\u000aSupporters of the president\u2019s tax push say they expect additional details on the measure to be released soon, although Cohn declined to commit to a precise timetable during an interview with Bloomberg Television last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re now working with House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee to really finalize what that blueprint will look like,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get released in the next \u2014 whatever \u2014 weeks or months as those committees get together and finalize all of the details.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Trump is scheduled to bring his pitch to overhaul the tax code to North Dakota on Wednesday. Trump will appear along with the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp.\u000a\u000aHeitkamp, who is facing re-election next year, will join the rest of the state\u2019s congressional delegation aboard Air Force One as they travel to the capital of Bismark, where Trump is planning to argue that his proposed cuts are worthy of bipartisan support.\u000a\u000aTrump will point to North Dakota\u2019s history of cross-party support for reductions to the tax rate, according to speech excerpts provided by the White House.\u000a\u000a"I want all of America to be inspired by the North Dakota example," he will say. "This state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe inclusion of Heitkamp on the trip is intended as, at least, public outreach to Democrats to assist in the tax push after a series of legislative defeats, including the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, that came after some Republican lawmakers joined a unified Democratic opposition. But Republican leaders have rejected Democratic demands not to advance tax legislation through the reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass a Senate filibuster and pass a bill on a partisan basis.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Trump will ask voters to "deliver a clear message" if "Democrats continue their obstruction," according to the excerpts provided by the White House.\u000a\u000a"Do your job to deliver for America or find a new job," Trump will say.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aV\u201cWhat is the difference between Congress and a Boy Scout troop?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe answer: the Boy Scout troop has adult supervision.\u000a\u000aThis was the joke going around about the Democrat-controlled United States Congress in the 1980s and nothing has improved in the last three decades. When Democrat Harry Reid was running the Senate during the Obama years, the Congress rarely had a budget \u2014 the regular process of law-making ground to a halt. Anyone who believes the Democrats have all the answers to managing Congress should investigate in more detail; it is a record of mismanagement, corruption, and abuse of the public trust.\u000a\u000aYet, the Republican leaders in the Senate, with their narrow two-member margin of majority, appear hapless and unable to herd \u201cthe cats\u201d to a consensus.\u000a\u000aA part of the difficulty passing legislation is not the fault of the leaders or political party in charge. The Congress was designed to have a chamber, the Senate, which would put the brakes on the more popularly elected House of Representatives. Everett Ladd tells the following story. George Washington answers the question of Thomas Jefferson regarding why a second legislative chamber, the Senate, was created. \u201cWhy did you pour that coffee into your saucer?\u201d Washington asked Jefferson. \u201cTo cool it,\u201d said Jefferson. \u201cEven so we pour legislation into a senatorial saucer to cool it.\u201d\u000a\u000aCurrently, the bicameral structure of the Congress and the internal Senate rules of procedure, adopted in the years after the writing of the Constitution, are the obstacles to law-making. Under the rules, a narrow majority is not sufficient for one party to pass legislation, and because of the rules, action by the Senate may slow-down or stop. Nevertheless, the Senate may be serving the function that was intended when the Constitution was written.\u000a\u000aWhile the difficulty passing legislation is frustrating, both parties, on occasion, have benefited. Although President Trump complains about Senate rules blocking his legislation, the same rules slowed down President Obama\u2019s agenda. With different Senate rules there is no telling what Obama may have attempted or achieved. Republicans upon reflection should be happy with Senate rules.\u000a\u000aBut what might be done to reform Congress? One possibility is to reduce the number of committees and subcommittees; this would minimize the members of Congress running from committee to committee, and it would likely reduce the redundancy of witnesses and testimony given before congressional committees. Multiple hurdles to pass one law increases the possibility of special interest influence and the gumming up of the entire process.\u000a\u000aMy favorite reform is to reduce the size of the House of Representatives from 435 to 335 members, and there are several reasons. First, anyone who has been involved in large group decision-making is aware of how a smaller cadre of leaders are directing the actions and votes of the many. Large group meetings of political parties, church, or unions may prove the point that the regular members do not function democratically. Robert Michels, a century ago wrote about what he called \u201cthe Iron Law of Oligarchy.\u201d A large group, sooner or later, will be led by a smaller subgroup.\u000a\u000aCongress is an example of what Michels was talking about, and it is somewhat ironic. Members are democratically elected, and when they go to Congress, they are told what to do by committee chairs and their leaders; Congress is not a model of democracy. It is almost impossible to be a model of democracy because of its size.\u000a\u000aA second reason is that with fewer members the House could work more efficiently. There would be fewer members to accommodate and there would still be far more than enough to deal with the nation\u2019s business.\u000a\u000aA third reason to reduce the size of the House of Representatives is to save the money. The full cost of maintaining one representative appears to be about $2 million a year. If 100 representatives could be cut, this would save about $200 million a year. These days $200 million is not what it once was, yet it still is a lot of money \u2014 particularly when it seems the Congress may work better with fewer members.\u000a\u000aThus, the fourth reason: there is no clear justification to have a House of 435 members, and there are good reasons, such as greater efficiency, to believe the House may work better with fewer members. Why not streamline the Congress? It is not doing that well anyway.\u000a\u000aJohn Havick has a Ph.D. in political science.

"The problem is that the so-called Dreamers are here illegally, and you know President Obama didn't do them any favors by keeping their status illegal and just letting them go on and start their lives and do all that kind of thing when he had a deferred deportation program."\u000a\u000aGilmore echoed others by saying it is now up to Congress to write and pass legislation that would serve as a permanent solution to the issue. Roughly 800,000 people have benefitted from DACA, which allows people who illegally came to the United States as children with their parents to stay here under certain conditions.\u000a\u000a"I think we've got to get the law straight, and that, I think, is really what's bothering people, and it's something that we've got to do," Gilmore said. "You can define the Dreamers any way you want to by statute, but you can't just have an illegal situation."

aVFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi Thursday had a stern warning for people and businesses who already are driving prices high in her state while people are trying to flee in advance of Hurricane Irma: "If you're a bad business, we're coming after you."\u000a\u000a"You cannot inflate prices during the time of a hurricane for essential commodities, food, water, fuel, etc.," Bondi told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" program. "Generators. What I've been seeing is a lot of water complaints. I think initially we had 300 water complaints."\u000a\u000aThousands of calls have come in since Bondi's office set up a hotline, 1-866-9NO-SCAM [1-866-966-7226], and the attorney general had particular ire against Chevron gas stations in South Florida, noting that when staffers arrived in her office at 8 a.m. Thursday, there were 45 complaints against the company.\u000a\u000a"Chevron, if you're watching me now, you need to call us and tell us why your prices are inflated in South Florida because in Tallahassee they aren't," Bondi said. "In South Florida, they're high and there is no excuse for that ... if I'm wrong and Chevron is not doing this, call me and tell me or fix it."\u000a\u000aIn Florida, price gouging carries a $1,000 fine per instance, up to $25,000 for multiple violations committed in a single 24-hour period, but Bondi warned there will be further repercussions from her, personally.\u000a\u000a"I will be saying your name all over national television and telling people not to go to your business ever again, if you're stealing from Floridians and taking advantage of Floridians in a time of need," she insisted. "It is not just about the money, it's about commodities that are helping to keep people alive, keep their children safe."\u000a\u000aBondi said there also have been several reports about high prices with airlines, but they fall under the control of the FAA and the Department of Transportation.\u000a\u000aHowever, she said, many of the airlines are now coming together to help, and so are many companies.\u000a\u000a"Home Depot called me and said 'what do I need,'" said Bondi. "They ran out of plywood. They're having trucks coming in, delivering to Home Depot. In one day in Florida, 355,000 pieces of plywood were sold. Floridians are listening."\u000a\u000aAs of now, Bondi said, her immediate concern is making it possible to get people out of Florida.\u000a\u000a"We have so many students down here at the University of Miami trying to get flights out," she said. "We have to charge them a reasonable cost. People won't leave without their pets. The airlines for the most part have stepped up to the plate."\u000a\u000aShe also credited Wal-Mart, in addition to Home Depot, and said the EPA has helped, through a ruling under the Clean Air Act, that blended fuel can be sold to help keep gas prices down and to bring more fuel into the state.

aVPolitics is "deeply involved" in the case against New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., as both sides could benefit if he is convicted of corruption charges, Harvard Law Professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Friday.\u000a\u000a"The Republican National Committee is putting pressure on Menendez to resign if he is convicted," Dershowitz told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" program.\u000a\u000a"We know that the Republican National Committee is trying to turn this into a political advantage because if he does resign, immediately, his replacement is named by the Republican governor."\u000a\u000aHowever, if Menendez waits to resign depending on the outcome of an appeal, his replacement may be picked by a Democratic governor, if one replaces Gov. Chris Christie, who is in his last term of office, said Dershowitz.\u000a\u000a"One thing we know for sure, this case will not end with a trial," Dershowitz said. "It will go to appeal because many of these cases result in initial convictions and are then reversed on appeal because of the law regarding corruption. What you need to get in return for what you give is very unclear and in a state of flux."\u000a\u000aIf Menendez is found guilty, "this case is going all the way up, probably to the United States Supreme Court," said Dershowitz.\u000a\u000aThe law professor said he does not know if Menendez is guilty or innocent, as that is up to the jury in the case, but he still finds the case an example of the "criminalization of political differences."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, on Thursday, U.S. District Judge William Walls, who is presiding over the case, warned prosecutors not to wage a "tabloid trial" and that he will not let them "swish and swash nonsensical scenarios that really don\u2019t even make for a good pulp fiction story," according to wire reports.\u000a\u000aFurther, one of Menendez's attorneys claimed the trial was an attack on Hispanic Americans, and Dershowitz said it's a mistake to focus on ethnicity.\u000a\u000a"I think the better tactic for the defendant would be to focus on the political implications of this," said Dershowitz. "I think when you make a charge of it being ethnic discrimination, you really have to have a great deal to back it up. And I don't see the evidence to back that up."\u000a\u000aHe said he does think Menendez' attorney would be better to present a case arguing that senators get gifts all the time and help their friends, and it would be better to emphasize friendships, not a "quid pro quo."

aVThis is possibly the worst summer box office at the movies for Hollywood, perhaps in history.\u000a\u000aWith numbers down over 70 percent, The New York Times declared Al Gore, starring in \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel,\u201d \u201cone of the most compelling characters\u201d in this summer\u2019s movie lineup. The Independent Sentinel reported on August 7, \u201cAl Gore\u2019s Documentary Bombs! An Emoji Toon Movie Makes 25 Times More!\u201d The documentary grossed less than $1,000,000 the first week after initially opening in only four cities. After five weeks Box Office Mojo showed that it was playing on 127 screens, down 327 the previous week. Apparently, even the global warming fanatics are not going to see the movie. Can it be so terrible?\u000a\u000aThe Washington Times reported on August 22, \u201cIt was a tough weekend for Al Gore. Not only did \u2018An Inconvenient Sequel\u2019 continue its nosedive at the box office, but the climate change documentary also drew a scathing rebuttal from a leading climate scientist. As stated above, by the fifth week, it was not only down to 127 screens, but it was averaging only $661 per screen."\u000a\u000aThe critics came out and they were not just movie critics, but reputable scientists. Climatologist Roy W. Spencer, the principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, released an 81-page e-book on Amazon titled \u201cAn Inconvenient Deception: How Al Gore Distorts Climate Science and Energy Policy.\u201d Mr. Spencer went on to say, \u201cAfter viewing Gore\u2019s most recent movie, \u2018An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,\u2019 and after reading the book version of the movie, I was more than a little astounded.\u201d Mr. Spencer said on his blog, Global Warming, \u201cThe new movie and book are chock-full of bad science, bad policy, and factual errors.\u201d\u000a\u000aScience Daily reported as far back as April 19, 2011, that \u201cMost Americans now agree that climate change is occurring. But many still disagree on why, with opinions about the cause of climate change defined by political party, not scientific understanding.\u201d This was according to new research from the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire.\u000a\u000aWe were all manipulated about the melting of the polar ice caps and polar bears dying. Look at this image below from NASA of the polar ice caps between 2012 and 2014. Do you see something different rather than the rhetoric coming from the climate change crowd? Remember Mr. Gore\u2019s prediction that the polar ice would be gone by 2013? Look again and see if you can figure out the truth in size of the polar ice cap?\u000a\u000a(Photos from NASA)\u000a\u000aIt seems to me that just the opposite has happened and the Democrats can\u2019t explain why. More and more Americans have come to understand that climates have always changed. If you live north of the Mason-Dixon line, the southern border of the State of Pennsylvania, you know the weather changes every year, and it always has as long as you have lived. Your simple guess is that it will continue to change; some years will have more rain or snow or heat or cold. The lack of climate changes not meeting the degrading forecasts from people like Al Gore, who are sure man is causing the problem, are finding their followers dropping by the wayside. This story has run out of gas. There are people in America who are probably working on new technologies that may well eliminate all CO2 emissions. Don\u2019t look for climate change to be high on the Democratic list of issues for the 2018 mid-term elections. The global warming fanatics will be very angry with the party over its abandoning of the issue. But there is more to this hoax on the people of the world.\u000a\u000aThe part of the issue that is more damaging to the global warming cause is the polar bear and its possible extinction. Susan J. Crockford, of the Department of Anthropology, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, published a report on March 2, 2017, that said, \u201cBoth assessments predicted that significant population declines of polar bears would result by mid-century as a consequence of the summer sea ice extent rapidly reaching 3-5 m/km2 on a regular basis: the IUCN predicted a >30% decline in total population, while the USFWS predicted the global population would decline by 67 percent (including total extirpation of ten sub-populations within two vulnerable ecoregions.)\u201d She went on to say, \u201cAs a consequence, the hypothesis that repeated summer sea ice levels of below 5 m/km2 will cause significant population declines in polar bears is rejected, a result that indicates the ESA and IUCN judgments to list polar bears as threatened based on future risks of habitat loss were scientifically unfounded.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt least two generations of children in America and around the world have been falsely brainwashed to believe that the polar bear will disappear in their lifetime. The ostensible reason for the loss of the polar ice cap and in turn the eradication of the polar bears has been CO2 emissions. These children will spend the rest of their lives living with an ingrained lie that they will not be able to reject as false. Teachers will continue to spew this false science, because the falsehood that their parents are responsible for the death of the polar bear and so will they if we don\u2019t stop climate change now.\u000a\u000aI find it interesting that with the United States withdrawing from the Paris Accord and the global warming movement losing trillions of dollars in funding from the United States that concern in that area is waning no other nation has stepped up to take over the American funding. We have the responsibility to reverse these falsehoods by teaching our children, regardless of their age, the truth. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party will not do this and the lie continues. The Democratic Party owes the world an apology for its deception, but as the old saying goes, \u201cHell will have to freeze over first\u201d before the Climate Change people admit they were wrong.\u000a\u000aDan Perkins is an author of both thrillers and children\u2019s books.

aVPeople all over America want to give back to the veterans responsible for their freedoms. Perhaps no one knows better about how to help than fellow vets. Veterans also enjoy the connection to other vets when giving back.\u000a\u000aThere are many ways to help vets through such programs as the Disabled American Veterans and the Wounded Warrior Project. Vets are unique in that they know what other veterans may need at home.\u000a\u000aThey can help veterans just by being there or giving back in a variety of ways. Simply getting involved in certain programs or organizations for their own benefit can help other vets.\u000a\u000aTIP: The Secret Water Cure for Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aHere are six ways veterans can give back to their fellow vets:\u000a\u000a1. Online education programs \u2014 Many vets return home to advance their education. There are many online education programs that encourage connecting with other veterans and sharing experiences, according to U.S. News.

Support veterans\u2019 groups \u2014 Vets can join or support organizations that help returning veterans who may have suffered from traumatic injuries.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America \u2014 The nonprofit IAVA connects veterans for support. There are some 420,000 members who enjoy family-friendly events, education and employment programs, and get-togethers at communities across the country.\u000a\u000a5. Vets4Vets \u2014 Through groups around the country, Vets4Vets provides free weekend workshops so vets can discuss their experiences or trauma of war with other vets.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Start a vet program \u2014 U.S. Marine veterans Bob Adams and Dirk Enger opened the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Veterans in Wheaton, Illinois in 2007, CNN reported. The nonprofit grew into an organization that provides housing and counseling to some 400 vets a year. Adams, a clinical social worker, had noticed that many homeless people in Chicago were veterans and began envisioning such a program.\u000a\u000aALERT: Suzanne Somers Reveals 'Forbidden' Cancer Cures That Saved Her Life

aV"Game of Thrones" has been pirated more than a billion times, according to a report released this week by anti-piracy firm MUSO, which revealed that the latest season of the popular HBO series was illegally downloaded and streamed across piracy channels over 1 billion times.\u000a\u000a#GameOfThrones Season 7 Pirated Over 1 Billion Times https://t.co/wIpynOvVwb \u2014 MUSO (@MUSOdotcom) September 5, 2017\u000a\u000aMUSO said these figures far exceeded the number of legal viewings of the show, which averaged at around 31 million viewers per episode.\u000a\u000aThe report noted that, within the first 72 hours of broadcast, the Season 7 premiere was downloaded and streamed over 90 million times.\u000a\u000aThis figure was eclipsed by the season finale which drew over 120 million downloads and streams.\u000a\u000aAndy Chatterley, CEO of MUSO, said on the organization's website that "Game of Thrones" was one of the "biggest global entertainment phenomena of today," adding that "activity across piracy networks has been totally unprecedented."\u000a\u000aChatterly noted that HBO had experienced various security breaches throughout the latest season. As a result, some episodes had been leaked before official broadcast, adding to unlicensed activity.\u000a\u000a"In addition to the scale of piracy when it comes to popular shows, these numbers demonstrate that unlicensed streaming can be a far more significant type of piracy than torrent downloads," he said.\u000a\u000a"At MUSO, we look at all types of piracy, not just torrents, and that is why these numbers have been illuminated. It's time to acknowledge this audience; we should view this as an opportunity to understand the bigger picture."\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, TorrentFreak reported that HBO had attempted to control piracy of "Game of Thrones" by monitoring popular torrent swarms.\u000a\u000aInternet subscribers using their connections to share episodes of Season 7 issued warning notices from the network anti-piracy partner IP Echelon however, these copyright infringement reminders have evidently not deterred pirates.

aVU.S. investors\u2019 optimism in the stock market has pushed the Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index to its highest level since September 2000.\u000a\u000aThe index, after rising in every quarter since the start of 2016, leveled off in the second quarter at +124 before rising to its current +138 in the third quarter, Gallup reported.\u000a\u000aThe survey found that investor optimism about stock market matches the 1999-2000 record high.\u000a\u000aSixty-eight percent now say they are optimistic about the stock market's performance during the next year, matching the record high for the question from December 1999 and January 2000.\u000a\u000aAt least 61% have expressed optimism about the stock market in each of the three surveys this year, a percentage matched or exceeded only four other times in the 132 times the question has been asked since April 2000.\u000a\u000aTwenty-five percent say they are "very optimistic," topping the previous record high of 24% from the first quarter of this year. Only 11% were very optimistic a year ago.\u000a\u000aThe stock market has moved generally upward for the past eight years after bottoming out in the wake of the 2008 economic crash, but investors have been slow to shed their skepticism about stocks as a good investment. This year's continued climb of the market to record-setting heights, however, has given investors enough evidence that more than two-thirds are optimistic and one-fourth are now very optimistic about its near-term performance.\u000a\u000aAs the Dow and other key economic measures have continued to move in a positive direction over the past few months, retiree investors have grown more optimistic about meeting their financial goals. With the financial status of retirees becoming more and more important as baby boomers flood the retirement rolls, the growing confidence of retiree investors provides a welcome piece of evidence about their financial well-being.\u000a\u000aThe results come from a July 28-Aug. 6 Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey of U.S. investors with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The seven items that constitute the index include three on personal finances (meeting long-term investment goals, meeting short-term investment goals and maintaining income) and four on the economy (economic growth, the stock market, unemployment and inflation). The survey was in the field as the Dow Jones industrial average approached, then surpassed, the 22,000-point milestone for the first time.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the U.S. economy probably grew faster than reported in the second quarter, with data on Thursday suggesting stronger consumer spending than previously estimated.\u000a\u000aThe quarterly services survey, or QSS, from the Commerce Department implied consumer spending increased more briskly than the 3.3 percent annualized rate reported last week in its second estimate of gross domestic product, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aThe QSS report added to data on construction spending and factory orders in suggesting that second-quarter GDP growth could be revised higher from its 3.0 percent rate when the government publishes its third estimate later this month.\u000a\u000aConsidering the construction, factory orders and QSS data, JPMorgan is forecasting that GDP growth for the quarter would be raised to a 3.4 percent rate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe that the QSS points to an upward revision to the ... estimate of real consumption growth,\u201d said economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVLight to moderate drinkers may have a lower risk of heart disease than teetotalers, but a new study suggests this doesn\u2019t hold true for people with fatty liver disease.\u000a\u000aMost people have a little bit of fat in their liver, but fatty liver disease can be diagnosed when more than 5 percent of the liver by weight is made up of fat. If the condition isn\u2019t linked to liver damage from heavy drinking, it\u2019s known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is most often associated with obesity and certain eating habits.\u000a\u000aFor the current study, researchers examined data on 5,115 adults aged 18 to 30, following them for up to 25 years to assess their drinking habits and check for evidence of fatty liver disease, heart disease or risk factors for cardiac problems.\u000a\u000a\u201cHeart disease is actually the leading cause of death in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease so it is important to investigate possible dietary and lifestyle factors that might help prevent complications of heart disease,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Lisa VanWagner of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe failed to find any association between moderate alcohol use and multiple different markers of heart disease and heart disease risks, including blood pressure, cholesterol or calcium deposits in the arteries of the heart,\u201d VanWagner said by email.\u000a\u000aTo look for a connection between alcohol use and heart disease, researchers focused on 2,479 participants who remained in the study for 25 years and didn\u2019t already have a history of heart attack or heart failure, alcohol-related liver damage or other issues like being too obese to fit in CT scanners for liver imaging.\u000a\u000aIn the final analysis, 570 participants, or 23 percent had NAFLD, researchers report in Gastroenterology.\u000a\u000aRoughly 58 percent of the people with NAFLD were light or moderate drinkers, while the rest said they didn\u2019t drink at all.\u000a\u000aDrinking in moderation was defined as an average of one or two drinks a day for men and one a day for women, VanWagner said.\u000a\u000aDrinkers were more likely to be white, male and have more education than nondrinkers. People who used alcohol were also more likely to be obese and have diabetes.\u000a\u000aBut there wasn\u2019t any difference in heart disease or risk factors for heart disease based on whether people with NAFLD abstained or drank moderately.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how alcohol use might influence heart health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible at least some of the study participants weren\u2019t truthful about their drinking habits when they were surveyed, and some might have downplayed their alcohol use or actually had alcoholic fatty liver disease, the authors note.\u000a\u000a\u201cAlcohol abuse is a well known risk factor for liver disease, up to cirrhosis and end stage liver damage,\u201d said Dr. Valerio Nobili of University La Sapienza and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, Italy.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that the study didn\u2019t find a protective effect from alcohol for people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease because of other factors such as how much exercise people got or what they ate, Nobili, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday it\u2019s very well known that moderate alcohol use compared to abstinence is associated with lower mortality in the general population, decreasing the incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes and ischemic stroke,\u201d Nobili said. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t clear is whether that is also true in people affected by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\u201d

aVDutch researchers claimed Thursday to have discovered the maximum age "ceiling" for human lifespan, despite growing life expectancy because of better nutrition, living conditions and medical care.\u000a\u000aMining data from some 75,000 Dutch people whose exact ages were recorded at the time of death, statisticians at Tilburg and Rotterdam's Erasmus universities pinned the maximum ceiling for female lifespan at 115.7 years.\u000a\u000aMen came in slightly lower at 114.1 years in the samples taken from the data which spans the last 30 years, said Professor John Einmahl, one of three scientists conducting the study.\u000a\u000a"On average, people live longer, but the very oldest among us have not gotten older over the last thirty years," Einmahl told AFP.\u000a\u000a"There is certainly some kind of a wall here. Of course the average life expectancy has increased," he said, pointing out the number of people turning 95 in The Netherlands had almost tripled.\u000a\u000a"Nevertheless, the maximum ceiling itself hasn't changed," he said.\u000a\u000aLifespan is the term used to describe how long an individual lives, while life expectancy is the average duration of life that individuals in an age group can expect to have -- a measure of societal wellbeing.\u000a\u000aThe Dutch findings come in the wake of those by US-based researchers who last year claimed a similar age ceiling, but who added that exceptionally long-lived individuals were not getting as old as before.\u000a\u000aEinmahl and his researchers disputed the latter finding, saying their conclusions deduced by using a statistical brand called "Extreme Value Theory", showed almost no fluctuation in maximum lifespan.\u000a\u000aEinmahl said however there were still some people who had bent the norm, like Frenchwomen Jeanne Calment who died at the ripe old age of 122 years and 164 days.\u000a\u000aCalment remains the oldest verified woman to date.\u000a\u000aExtreme Value Theory is a brand of statistics that measures data and answers questions at extreme ends of events such as lifespan or disasters.\u000a\u000aEinmahl said his group's findings will be submitted for publication in a peer review magazine "within the next month or so."

aVSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea is closely watching North Korea over the possibility it may launch another intercontinental ballistic missile as soon as Saturday when it celebrates its founding anniversary.\u000a\u000aSeoul's Unification Ministry spokeswoman Eugene Lee said Friday that Pyongyang could potentially conduct its next ICBM tests this weekend or around Oct. 10, another North Korean holiday marking the founding of its ruling party.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has previously marked key dates with displays of military power, but now its tests appear to be driven by the need to improve missile capabilities.\u000a\u000aThe North is just coming off its sixth and the most powerful nuclear test to date on Sunday in what it claimed was a detonation of a thermonuclear weapon built for its ICBMs. The country tested its developmental Hwasong-14 ICBMs twice in July and analysts say the flight data from the launches indicate the missiles could cover a broad swath of the continental United States, including major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, when perfected.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea fired the ICBMs at highly lofted angles in July to reduce ranges and avoid other countries. But South Korean officials say the next launches could be conducted at angles close to operational as the North would seek to test whether the warheads survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry and detonate properly.\u000a\u000aIn Washington, President Donald Trump reiterated Thursday that military action is "certainly" an option against North Korea, as his administration tentatively concurred with the pariah nation's claim to have tested a hydrogen bomb. A senior administration official said the U.S. was still assessing last weekend's underground explosion but so far noted nothing inconsistent with Pyongyang's claim.\u000a\u000a"Military action would certainly be an option," Trump told a White House news conference. "I would prefer not going the route of the military, but it's something certainly that could happen."\u000a\u000aPressed on whether he could accept a scenario in which the isolated nation had nukes but was "contained and deterred," Trump demurred. "I don't put my negotiations on the table, unlike past administrations. I don't talk about them. But I can tell you North Korea is behaving badly and it's got to stop," he said.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea broke from its pattern of lofted launches last month when it fired a powerful new intermediate range missile, the Hwasong-12, over northern Japan. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un then called the launch a "meaningful prelude" to containing the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam and called for his military to conduct more ballistic missile launches targeting the Pacific Ocean.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Sweden urged its citizens Friday to refrain from unnecessary trips to North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe announcement by the Swedish Foreign Affairs Ministry came hours after Mexico's government said it declared North Korean Ambassador Kim Hyong Gil as persona non grata and ordered him to leave the country within 72 hours in response to Sunday's nuke test.\u000a\u000aThe United States has already banned Americans from traveling to North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student from Ohio who was released from North Korea in June in a coma after being detained there for more than a year.\u000a\u000aSweden has had diplomatic relations with North Korea since 1973. The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang also provides consular services for the United States, Australia and Canada.\u000a\u000aAlso Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed North Korea by phone. Macron called for more pressure on North Korea to bring the country back to the negotiating table, and China's official Xinhua News Agency described Xi as being "adamant" about the denuclearization of the peninsula while also expressing hope that France would play "a constructive role in easing the situation and restarting dialogue."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean experts say that the launch was Pyongyang's attempt to make missiles flying over Japan an accepted norm as it seeks to test new projectiles in conditions close to operational and win more military space in a region dominated by enemies.\u000a\u000aKim, a third-generation dictator in his 30s, has conducted four of North Korea's six nuclear tests since taking power in 2011. His military has maintained a torrid pace in testing weapons, which also include solid-fuel missiles built to be fired from road mobile launchers or submarines.\u000a\u000aIn accelerating his pursuit of nuclear weapons targeting the United States and allies South Korea and Japan, Kim is seen as seeking a real nuclear deterrent to help ensure the survival of his government and also the stronger bargaining power that would come from it.\u000a\u000aWashington, Seoul and Tokyo have been pushing for stronger sanctions to punish Pyongyang over its nuclear activities, such as denying the country oil supplies. China and Russia have been calling for talks, saying sanctions aren't working against North Korea.

aVFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush Friday said he's proud of how local and state officials in his state have prepared for the onset of Hurricane Irma, and he believes they have learned well from the lessons of past hurricanes.\u000a\u000a"It's a devastating storm," Bush told CNN's "New Day" anchor Chris Cuomo. "I think that a lot of people, while we're preparing, we focus on the line that you show, the track of the storm. I think that's really not relevant. The fact is, we'll have hurricane-force winds all across the state."\u000a\u000aGov. Rick Scott, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, and other state and municipal leaders have "done a really good job of keeping people informed," said Bush, and are preparing for what will be a "devastating storm."\u000a\u000aBush, who as governor from 1999-2007, has experience leading through several major hurricanes, and said that as Irma hits this weekend, "there will be the isolated examples of people trying to win the Darwin award, acting really stupid and making bad choices and decisions," but for the most part, "the great majority of people know exactly what they need to do."\u000a\u000aMost hurricane deaths, he continued, happen after the storm hits rather than during, as people want to check their property and to venture out.\u000a\u000a"People need to heed the advice of local officials, not go out before the waters have receded and make sure today they're fortifying their homes," said Bush. "If they're not going to evacuate, that they shelter in place, in a place that's safe."\u000a\u000aThere will be several challenges for state and local leaders following the storm, as there are "so many things that you don't think about."\u000a\u000a"Are all the generators in place for maintaining the water systems of every municipality that's going to be hit by this?" said Bush. "Can we get chlorine to make sure the water supply is safe when there's no power? How quickly can you get the ports open to get gasoline barged into the state since we don't have any refining capacity? How do you make sure people don't hoard after the storm when there's going to be real shortages of lots of things?"\u000a\u000aAll of those things are learned through trial and error, said Bush, and he knows Gov. Scott understands the challenge and has a good team around him.\u000a\u000a"The local folks are doing really well as well," said Bush. "There's literally hundreds of things that have to be dealt with post storm. Then you've got the long-term recovery issues where we rely on Washington more. President [Donald] Trump has done a good job showing his concern for the victims of Harvey, and I'm sure he'll do the same [for Florida]."\u000a\u000aThe key also is to make sure Washington is "here for the long haul, for the long-term recovery of our state," said Bush.\u000a\u000aThe former governor, a presidential candidate in 2016, later told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program that as a governor, Scott's focus will need to start shifting to saving lives after Irma's strike is over, and to get the state back on its feet as quickly as possible.\u000a\u000a\u200b\u000a\u000aMiami's metro area is expected to be hit particularly hard, and Bush said the overwhelming destruction of infrastructure during a storm with Irma's magnitude is one of the largest concerns, along with the fates of the people who will suffer.\u000a\u000a"It's generally the case that the most vulnerable are the ones to suffer the most," Bush said. "One of the things that I think is really important is to, once your own family is secure, to make sure your neighbors are okay. There are a lot of people that just live their lives in isolation of one another, and the post storm time is for all of us not to say it's the government job."\u000a\u000aMiami is a densely populated area, said Bush, and there are many people "that live in poverty that are one paycheck away from having real problems. We won't have power. It means you won't have food. All of these things come into play, particularly for people who have little resources. And so this is a time for all of us to step up."

aVThe U.S. Air Force "sniffer plane" was collecting air samples off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sept. 3, 1949, when it gathered evidence of radioactivity, confirming that the war-shattered Soviet Union had tested a nuclear device. The Soviets' Aug. 29, 1949, test had come faster than expected.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDating from the detonation at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, the basic science of nuclear explosions is more than 72 years old \u2014 three years older than the North Korean nation. Ballistic missile technology is more than 60 years old. The problems of miniaturizing warheads for mounting on missiles, and of ensuring the warheads' survival en route to targets, are not sufficient to stymie a nation \u2014 consider Pakistan, whose annual per capita income is less than $2,000 \u2014 that is determined to have a nuclear arsenal.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has one and is developing ICBMs faster than expected and with ostentatious indifference to U.S. proclamations. On Jan. 2, President-elect Donald Trump scampered up the rhetorical escalation ladder, unlimbering his heavy artillery \u2014 an exclamation point \u2014 to tweet about North Korea's promised ICBM test: "It won't happen!" It did. North Korea's most audacious act, firing a missile over Japan, came seven days after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson praised North Korea's "restraint."\u000a\u000aPyongyang's "signaling" does not involve abstruse semiotics: It wants a nuclear arsenal, and as The Economist magazine says, the world's unpalatable options are the improbable (productive negotiations), the feeble (more sanctions) and the terrifying (military pre-emption). Concerning the latter, there is no bright line, but there is a distinction to be drawn, however imprecisely, between pre-emptive war and preventive war. The former constitutes self-defense in response to a clear and present danger \u2014 repelling an act of aggression presumed with reasonable certainty to be imminent. The latter is an act of anticipation \u2014 and, to be candid, of aggression \u2014 to forestall the emergence of a clear and present danger.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump threatened North Korea with "fire and fury like the world has never seen," was he threatening to cross the nuclear weapons threshold? This has been contemplated before regarding North Korea. Former Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who had been fired by President Harry Truman for insubordination, handed President-elect Dwight Eisenhower a memorandum on how "to clear North Korea of enemy forces": "This could be accomplished through the atomic bombing of enemy military concentrations and installations in North Korea and the sowing of fields of suitable radio-active materials, the by-product of atomic manufacture, to close major lines of enemy supply and communication. . . . "\u000a\u000aMacArthur badly misjudged Eisenhower, whose biographer Jean Edward Smith says that during the Potsdam Conference (July 17-Aug. 2, 1945), when Eisenhower was told of the Alamogordo test \u2014 his first knowledge of the new weapon \u2014 "he was appalled" and "was the only one at Potsdam who opposed using the bomb." Smith says:\u000a\u000a"As president, Eisenhower would twice be presented with recommendations from his National Security Council and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the bomb be used; first, in Vietnam to protect the French at Dien Bien Phu, then against China at the time of the Formosa Strait crisis. Both times Eisenhower rejected the recommendations. As a former supreme commander, Eisenhower had the confidence to do so, where other presidents might not have. And by rejecting the use of the bomb, there is no question that Eisenhower raised the threshold at which atomic weaponry could be employed \u2014 a legacy we continue to enjoy."\u000a\u000aBut for how long? The non-proliferation regime has been remarkably successful. During the 1960 presidential campaign, John Kennedy cited "indications" that by 1964 there would be "10, 15 or 20" nuclear powers. As president, he said that by 1975 there might be 20. Now, however, North Korea, the ninth, might be joined by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, among others, unless U.S. leadership produces, regarding North Korea, conspicuously credible deterrence. The reservoir of presidential credibility is not brimful.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn Aug. 1, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that Trump had told him that "there will be a war with North Korea" if it continues to develop ICBMs capable of reaching the United States. "We'll see," said Trump on Sunday, responding to this shouted question: "Will you attack North Korea?" You?\u000a\u000aAre Congress' constitutional powers regarding war so atrophied that it supinely hopes for mere post facto notification? Ten months after Nov. 8, that day's costs, until now largely aesthetic, are suddenly, although not altogether unpredictably, more serious than were perhaps contemplated by his 62,984,825 voters.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGeorge F.

aVOne of the most influential Iowan pastors involved in politics, religious freedom, and pro-life advocacy, Pastor Terry Amann, met privately with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in April 2015. In less than one year from becoming President Trump, he successfully helped release one pastor who had been languishing in an Iranian prison, keeping his promise to a request Amann made when they first met. Last year, Amann described how President Trump kept his promise. This year, Amann is again asking for Trump\u2019s help, this time to find a missing U.S. missionary who was kidnapped in Africa in 2013. Below is Amann's open letter to President Trump. If the past is any indication, Trump is the most likely person able to answer his call for help.\u000a\u000aFrom Pastor Terry Amann:\u000a\u000aDear Mr. President,\u000a\u000aSince you\u2019ve become president, you\u2019ve strived to keep your promises to the American people. I want to thank you for keeping your promise to me, specifically by helping free Pastor Saeed Abedini. Now, I\u2019m calling on you again to help find a missing American missionary, Jerry Krause, who was kidnapped in Africa on April 7, 2013. His family is being denied access to information about his plight. They are seeking answers, resolution, and his safe return home.\u000a\u000aKraus, an American pilot, served the Mission Aviation Fellowship for roughly 22 years as a missionary in Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and later flew for the Sahel Aviation Service in Mali. His plight is posted on the Help Find Jerry Facebook page:\u000a\u000aJerry Krause, a U.S. citizen, was kidnapped on April 7th, 2013 while flying a Beechcraft 1900C from South Africa to Mali. All contact was lost on his approach to Sao Tome, a small island off of the coast of Africa. No concrete evidence of Jerry or his airplane were located during the first two months of investigations. Nevertheless, the South African Civil Aviation Authority (the governing authority over the aircraft incident) published their official report that Jerry Krause crashed and that Jerry Krause was dead. The Krause family did not believe that Jerry was dead, but they had no evidence to support their belief.\u000a\u000aHowever, this has changed. First, the South African Civil Aviation Authority has removed their official report, which is a public record, due to \u201cnew evidence\u201d being provided (via email with Albert Phuti Morudi, the Director of Investigations, April 5th, 2016). Although we have sought to learn what this new evidence is, we have been denied access to it. The airline incident was re-opened and has yet to be re-posted. Second, Jerry has been seen and found to be alive. The U.S. government knows Jerry\u2019s location. However, the Department of Defense has not had the correct authorization to act on this information. (Emphasis added.)\u000a\u000aIf this is truly the case, why has the United States government not acted to ensure his safe return home? Why has the family had little-to-no-news and (limited information about the investigation) for more than one year?\u000a\u000aHow does a plane go missing, and there also be no debris from its alleged crash? His family deserves answers, which I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll be able to provide. Please help bring him home, as you did with Pastor Saeed.\u000a\u000aMr. President, I am asking to you please intervene and authorize the Department of Defense to defend this American citizen and bring him home.\u000a\u000aThank you Mr. President. You and your family remain in my prayers. Keep up the great work.\u000a\u000aRespectfully,\u000a\u000aPastor Terry Amann\u000a\u000aDes Moines, Iowa

"The rains have stopped, the floods have started to recede and go back in their banks except in a couple of areas where we have the Brazos River.\u000a\u000a"People are getting out and taking stuff that has been damaged and putting it out in the front of their house. Other people are helping each other. It's very heartening to see how many people are helping people that they don't even know to get their houses in somewhat of a better shape and that people helped each other during the flood."\u000a\u000aHarvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the Houston area, which left thousands of people stranded and thousands of homes flooded. Some towns are still inaccessible by land because of high floodwaters.\u000a\u000a"That is an unbelievable amount of rain to go anywhere, especially in an area like Houston that is flat, that is at sea level, where water has no place to go so it stays for a while before it can go down the bayous to the Gulf of Mexico," Poe said.\u000a\u000aPoe added the storm left a trail of "massive destruction" from where it made landfall in Rockport, near Corpus Christi, all the way up to the Louisiana border.

aVHundreds of chief executives and business leaders in the U.S. have signed a letter urging President Donald Trump not to scrap a program known as \u201cDreamers\u201d that prevents the deportation of young people brought to the country illegally.\u000a\u000aThe White House said this week that it was still reviewing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was adopted when Barack Obama was in office. About 800,000 immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children have received renewable, two-year work permits under the program and are protected from deportation under its provisions.\u000a\u000a\u201cDreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy,\u201d Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos and other executives said in the letter, which was posted on a website late Thursday in the U.S. \u201cWith them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe open letter, signed by more than 350 executives, signals how top executives in the U.S. are feeling bolder about confronting the president. Trump last month disbanded two business advisory councils after CEOs from Intel Corp. to Merck & Co. stepped down in protest of his handling of the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aWarren Buffett, as well as General Motors Co.\u2019s Mary Barra, were among the executives who signed the letter, with many issuing separate statements on company websites and social media.\u000a\u000a\u2018Protect Dreamers\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cWe care deeply about the Dreamers who work at Microsoft and fully support them,\u201d Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Satya Nadella wrote in a message posted on LinkedIn. \u201cThere is no question in my mind that a priority must be to create more jobs and opportunity for every American citizen.

White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert told reporters on Thursday that the administration is still reviewing the policy and that no decision was ready to be announced. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump is giving the matter \u201ccareful consideration\u201d before making a decision.\u000a\u000aOn the campaign trail, Trump declared the program unconstitutional, but he softened his view considerably after taking office.

aVBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the developments in Syria's civil war (all times local):\u000a\u000a7:40 p.m.\u000a\u000aSyria has pushed back against the U.N. saying the report accusing its air force of using sarin gas to attack civilians is politically motivated and baseless.\u000a\u000aIn a statement published Friday on its official news agency, the Syrian government says it possesses no chemical weapons and considers using them "a moral crime that can only be condemned."\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria said it has "reasonable grounds" to believe the Syrian government is responsible for the April attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, which killed at least 83 civilians. The commission based its report on information collected from satellite images, video, photos, medical records, and over 300 interviews.\u000a\u000aThe government questioned the report's findings, saying they are based on information from "terrorists or their agents in the region." It said it rejects the commission's report.\u000a\u000a6:35 p.m.\u000a\u000aPhysicians for Human Rights says only one health facility remains operational in the Islamic State-held part of Raqqa, serving thousands of civilians trapped in the Syrian city with virtually no emergency services or rescue personnel as the intense U.S.-backed campaign to liberate the city continues,\u000a\u000aThe New York-based group on Friday described as "nightmarish" conditions in the ever-shrinking area controlled by IS militants amid an incessant bombing campaign. The wounded civilians are left under the rubble because civilians fear being struck by further airstrikes. The lone operating hospital is using salt water to sanitize wounds and treatment of traumatic injuries is limited to stopping the bleeding, the group said based on interviews it carried out with survivors, physicians and aid workers from the city.\u000a\u000aThe U.S.-led campaign, which began in earnest in June, left only the national hospital functioning at reduced capacity, as others were either bombed or closed, the group said according to witnesses it interviewed.\u000a\u000a9:45 a.m.\u000a\u000aRussia's Ministry of Defense says it has killed four IS leaders, including one it described as the group's war minister, in an airstrike outside the eastern Syria city of Deir el-Zour, south of Raqqa.\u000a\u000aRussia has been providing air cover for Syrian President Bashar Assad's offensive on IS since 2015.\u000a\u000aThe defense ministry said Friday its airstrike killed 40 militants, including four prominent warlords who gathered for a meeting of IS commanders in an underground bunker outside Deir el-Zour.\u000a\u000aThe Russian military named Abu Muhammad al-Shimali and Gulmurod Khalimov as two of the four IS leaders killed in the airstrike. The other two were not named in the statement.\u000a\u000aAl-Shimali reportedly headed the movement of foreign fighters into Syria and processed the group's new recruits.\u000a\u000aKhalimov, a colonel who received U.S. training while heading the riot police force in his native Tajikistan, has often been described as the IS's minister of war.

In 2016, 762 people were murdered there, compared with 472 so far in 2017, the analysis found.\u000a\u000a"The 2017 murder rate is expected to be on par with that of 2009, well at the bottom of the historic post-1990 decline, yet still higher than the lowest recorded rate in 2013," the researchers wrote.\u000a\u000aSome cities, however, are still experiencing sharp localized increases in crime, most notably in Charlotte, N.C., which has seen 63 murders so far in 2017, on course to beat last year's final total of 67, the analysis found.

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon said White House economic adviser Gary Cohn "absolutely" should resign along with any other aides who can\u2019t adequately stand by the president.\u000a\u000a"When you side with a man you side with him," Bannon, who left his post last month, told Charlie Rose in an interview, excerpts of which were released Thursday. The full interview is to be broadcast Sunday on the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\u000a\u000a"If you\u2019re going to break with him, resign," Bannon said. "If you find it unacceptable you should resign." He said Cohn, who was critical of Trump\u2019s message after the deadly aftermath of racially charged protests last month in Charlottesville, Virginia, "absolutely" had an obligation to resign.\u000a\u000aAs for his own relationship with Trump, Bannon downplayed the strains that grew during his time at the White House. "I\u2019m going to be his wingman outside for the entire time," he said of his plans going forward, pledging to make sure that "his enemies know there\u2019s no free shot on goal."\u000a\u000aIn the excerpts released Thursday, Bannon also accused the Catholic Church of promoting illegal immigration to fill the pews, saying the church\u2019s position is about economic reality, not doctrine.\u000a\u000aBannon, a Catholic, said the church hasn\u2019t come to grips with its own larger problems and as a result "they need illegal aliens to fill the churches. It\u2019s obvious on the face of it."\u000a\u000a\u2018Not About Doctrine\u2019\u000a\u000a"They have an economic interest in unlimited immigration, unlimited illegal immigration," Bannon said.\u000a\u000a"I totally respect the Pope and I totally respect the Catholic bishops and cardinals on doctrine, but this is not about doctrine,\u201d he added. "This is about the sovereignty of a nation."\u000a\u000aBannon said he disagreed with Trump\u2019s position on ending the Obama-era initiative called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or the \u201cDreamers\u201d program, which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, but "I understand how he struggled with it."\u000a\u000aTrump had campaigned on ending the program in 2016, but on Tuesday he announced he had delayed enforcement for six months to give Congress time to pass a replacement program, if it so desires. While polls show most Americans support letting these immigrants stay, Trump\u2019s backers say ending the program is necessary to protect rule of law.\u000a\u000a"Trust me the guys on far right, the guys on the conservative side are not happy with this."\u000a\u000aOn Charlottesville, Bannon said he backed Trump\u2019s response.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat he was trying to say is that people that support the monument staying there peacefully and people that oppose that, that\u2019s the normal course of -- of First Amendment,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s talking about the Neo-Nazis and Neo-Confederates and the Klan, who, by the way, are absolutely awful -- there\u2019s no room in American politics for that. There\u2019s no room in American society for that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd all Donald Trump was saying is, "Where does it end? Does it end in taking down the Washington Monument? Does it end in taking down Mount Rushmore? Does it end at taking Churchill\u2019s bust out of the Oval Office?"\u000a\u000aBannon said that while aides can disagree with the president in private, they should resign if if they were going to publicly break with him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m talking, obviously, about Gary Cohn and some other people,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cThat if you don\u2019t like what he\u2019s doing and you don\u2019t agree with it, you have an obligation to resign.

However, there may be certain circumstances in which withdrawing money from a 401(k) makes good sense.Here are five times it may to your advantage to withdrawal money from your 401(k).Every plan lists hardships slightly differently. It is best to read the fine print. However, the IRS defines it as a withdrawal that immediately meets the needs of the plan owner or their spouse. These include education, medical expenses, and certain expenses related to the primary residence of the 401(k) plan owner. A hardship deduction can be as much as the employee\u2019s total contribution.Some people could gain an advantage in taking money out of their 401(k) because they are not able to get credit at affordable rates, Bankrate said . It is best to carefully weigh how much you will save in interest on any potential loan against the loss in interest gained in the 401(k) before making that choice. There is also usually a limit on the time period in which you have to pay yourself back.Some medical bills can be paid with funds from a 401(k) without penalty. The unemployed can also avoid penalties if the money is going to help pay for insurance, CNBC reported First-time homebuyers can take up to $10,000 out of their 401(k) without penalty. This can make good financial sense, since a home is another type of investment, CNBC said.When you reach 59 ½, you can begin to take the money out of your retirement account without the 10 percent penalty. If you have not started taking money in regular distributions by the time you are 70 ½, you will be required to start.

From pasture-raised meats to completely GMO-free ingredients, Chipotle leads the way for sourcing quality ingredients. Most of the menu items contain only easily recognizable, whole-food ingredients prepared on-site daily.\u000a\u000aChipotle has a handy nutrition calculator that shows how your favorite fixings will affect the overall nutrition of your burrito, bowl, or salad. The salad topped with flavorful organic tofu (sofritas), fajita vegetables and black beans for extra fiber, fresh tomato salsa, and guacamole comes in at 550 calories. It has a whopping 24 grams of fiber, 19 grams of protein, and 46 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re watching carbohydrates, skip the black beans and cut the total in half. While the salad does contain almost an entire day\u2019s worth of sodium, the other nutritional attributes combined with the best ingredient quality in the fast-food business make Chipotle a top choice for healthy meals.\u000a\u000a2. Panera Bread Ancient Grain and Arugula Salad with Chicken \u2014 This upscale bakery-café chain, which includes St. Louis Bread Co., has recently marketed its commitment to eliminating many additives from its menu. This gradual shift to eliminate all artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, and preservatives was completed by the end of 2016. You can download a complete list of the ingredients that Panera Bread eliminated at its website.\u000a\u000aThe restaurants feature a number of relatively healthy options. This 410-calorie salad is featured because it is low in sodium, only 290 milligrams, and has a generous 25 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. Organic grains like farro, barley, and freekeh are combined with zesty arugula, sweet apple and cabbage slaw, and refreshing red grapes. Panera Bread tops the salad with antibiotic-free chicken to make it a complete and satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a3. Elevation Burger single burger with side salad \u2014 This small but growing burger chain began in 2005 with a mission to serve great burgers made of only 100 percent organic, grass-fed beef. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, grass-fed beef is a return to the way beef was traditionally raised, before large-scale beef producers began feeding cattle with low-quality corn. Not only is grass-fed beef naturally lower in calories, but it has a more favorable fat profile and a higher level of healthy omega-3 fatty acids compared to grain-fed beef.\u000a\u000aElevation Burger\u2019s single burger has just 330 calories. It has 23 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates, and about one-quarter of the recommended daily allowance of sodium, just 520 milligrams. Instead of fries, opt for the side salad to get a small dose of greens.\u000a\u000a4. Starbucks Classic Whole-Grain Oatmeal \u2014 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it is also the one most likely to get skipped if you are short on time. It is easy to find breakfast foods at most fast-food restaurants these days, but few of them are nutritious. Coffee giant Starbucks offers a hearty oatmeal that will keep you satisfied until lunch.\u000a\u000aUnlike other fast-food oatmeal, this one contains mostly just rolled and steel-cut oats without the long laundry list of additives and added sugar. When ordered plain, it contains 160 calories with 4 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, 28 grams of carbohydrates, and only 125 milligrams of sodium. For more flavor and some healthy fat, top it with Starbucks\u2019 nut medley and dried fruits toppings.\u000a\u000a5. McDonald's Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich \u2014 This fast-food giant is known for its classic burgers, but it has grown its menu substantially over the years to include many other foods based on changing consumer preferences.\u000a\u000aThe Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich is one of the healthiest options available at McDonald\u2019s in part because of its relatively simple ingredient list. The corporation says it has committed to sourcing only antibiotic-free chicken. The sandwich contains 380 calories, a hefty 37 grams of protein, 44 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, and 960 milligrams of sodium. For a fiber boost and to make it a complete meal, skip the fries but order a side salad instead.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Fix Your Blood Pressure (Do This Every Day)\u000a\u000a6. Subway Rotisserie-Style Chicken Salad \u2014 The Subway chain boasts nearly 45,000 restaurants in 112 countries worldwide, so its \u201csandwich artists\u201d can be found in cities and rural areas alike. While Subway has not taken the same clean food approach to its ingredients as the other chains topping our list, its franchises have plenty of meal options that won\u2019t ruin your diet.\u000a\u000aThis salad features grilled chicken and a customizable array of fresh vegetables. It has just 170 calories, only 4.5 grams of total fat, and 340 milligrams of sodium. It will keep you satisfied with 24 grams of protein and 10 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re adding a salad dressing, the Subway Vinaigrette is your best choice for healthiest salad dressing. Containing 35 calories, 3.5 grams of total fat, and 110 grams of sodium per serving, it is by far lightest option on the menu.\u000a\u000a7. Burger King Veggie Burger \u2014 This vegetarian burger is touted by WebMD as being \u201csurprisingly tasty,\u201d and the Morningstar patty doesn\u2019t taste like a beef substitute. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or not, this is a healthy option if you\u2019re dining at Burger King.\u000a\u000aThe veggie burger is 310 calories if ordered without mayonnaise and has a generous 22 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, 42 grams of carbohydrates but 990 milligrams of sodium. Skip the fries and order a side salad with just a drizzle of salad dressing to make a full meal.\u000a\u000a8. Wendy\u2019s Rich and Meaty Chili and Side Salad \u2014 Wendy\u2019s has made a commitment to providing options to fit the health concerns of all consumers. For example, Wendy\u2019s has an online Meal Builder resource that allows you to customize your meal and preview its nutrition information before you even order.\u000a\u000aOne of the best options for health-conscious eaters at Wendy\u2019s is its chili. A large cup of beef chili is high in protein and low in calories. With 250 calories, 23 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrates, and 5 grams of fiber, the chili is a meal in itself. As is hard to avoid with many fast-food restaurant items, the Rich and Meaty Chili is high in sodium at 1,170 milligrams, and that\u2019s without the crackers or toppings. Pair the chili with a side salad for extra fiber and to make a very satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a9. Taco Bell Fresco Bean Burrito \u2014 For some, this fast-Mexican chain conjures images of late-night taco binges, chalupas, and clever marketing. \u201cMaking a run for the border\u201d doesn\u2019t often come to mind when searching for a wholesome, healthy meal.\u000a\u000aAccording to Taco Bell, it has programs in place to improve the quality of its food ingredients. For example, it is trying to reduce artificial flavors and colors and high-fructose corn syrup in its foods but several items on its menu currently contain these items. If you are looking for a healthier alternative at Taco Bell, try an option from their Fresco menu, with all items containing fewer than 350 calories.\u000a\u000aThe Fresco Bean Burrito is a vegetarian option that has 350 calories, 56 grams of carbohydrates, 13 grams of protein, and 9 grams of fiber but 1,050 milligrams of sodium.\u000a\u000a10. Chick-fil-a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap \u2014 This popular fast-food chain is known for its Southern fried chicken sandwiches, which is not exactly the preferred fare for consumers who are concerned about healthy eating. However, Business Insider points out that the company has made an effort to add a few menu items, such as this light chicken wrap, to cater to this group.\u000a\u000aAccording to Chick-fil-a, the chicken that the company sources is conventionally raised, which means it is not free-range, pastured, or organic. The company\u2019s available information does not specifically mention any initiatives to reduce additives in its prepared foods. However, the Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap does have some favorable nutrition attributes if responsible food sourcing is not your top priority. It totals only 340 calories with a hefty 36 grams of protein, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 15 grams of fiber, and 900 milligrams of sodium. Because the Cool Wrap is relatively low in calories, you might want to add a side for a more substantial meal. Instead of the waffle fries, try the side salad or any of the restaurant\u2019s other healthier sides.\u000a\u000aSpecial: If You Collect Social Security, Please Read This Critical Information . . .\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy , to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVIf a gym visit elicits more grimaces than grins, you might be genetically predisposed to dislike exercise, Dutch researchers suggest.\u000a\u000aThe notion that at least part of a penchant for enjoying exercise -- or not -- may be inherited came from tracking the exercise habits and feelings of several hundred sets of identical twins, fraternal twins, and non-twin siblings between the ages of 12 and 25.\u000a\u000aThe study team further found that people who enjoyed working out spent more time doing so. And that raises the prospect that new interventions might eventually help boost exercise pleasure among those who've inherited a bias against it.\u000a\u000a"Despite the persistent general belief that exercise makes everyone feel better, this is not always the case," said study lead author Nienke Schutte.\u000a\u000a"There are large differences in how people feel during and after exercise," Schutte said. She's a postdoctoral researcher in the department of public and occupational health with the VU Medical Center in Amsterdam.\u000a\u000a"In our study," she added, "we submitted healthy adolescent twin pairs to a 20-minute exercise test on a cycle and a 20-minute exercise test on a treadmill. During and after the exercise tests, we asked them to indicate how they felt."\u000a\u000aAnd in the end, Schutte said, "we showed that up to 37 percent of the differences in the subjective experience of exercise was due to genetics."\u000a\u000aThe study included 115 pairs of identical twins, 111 pairs of fraternal twins and 35 of their non-twin siblings. All of the study volunteers completed a 20-minute stationary bike ride and a 20-minute treadmill run. Both were characterized as "non-vigorous," although an additional bike ride had participants (which also included six non-twin sibling pairs) ride until they were exhausted.\u000a\u000aDuring each ride and run participants were asked to describe how good or bad they felt, and whether the workout made them energetic, lively, jittery or tense. Lifestyle interviews were also conducted to gauge routine exercise habits.\u000a\u000aIn the end, the research team estimated that genetic predisposition accounted for anywhere between 12 to 37 percent of the variations seen in exercise enjoyment. And the more a person said they enjoyed exercising, the more often they routinely worked out.\u000a\u000aThat said, the study authors stressed that what they identified for now is simply an association between exercise pleasure and genetics, rather than a definitive case of cause and effect.\u000a\u000aBut "an important conclusion is that a one-size-fits-all approach to get people to exercise might not be very effective," Schutte said. "Now we know that how you feel during and shortly after an exercise bout is heritable, we can look for the actual genes that are involved."\u000a\u000aAnd successful identification of such genes could mean that "in the future, depending on your genetic profile, interventions [could] be tailored to set realistic person-specific exercise goals," she added.\u000a\u000aJames Maddux is an emeritus professor in psychology with George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. He said that "the findings make sense," in his opinion.\u000a\u000a"And given the accumulating research findings on the role of genes in individual differences among people on biological and psychological factors [such as] intelligence, personality [or] self-control, I'm not at all surprised," he added.\u000a\u000aMaddux also suggested that the mere acknowledgement of a genetic underpinning to exercise enjoyment could end up being of practical benefit, even without knowing which specific genes are involved.\u000a\u000a"You don't need to identify the genes that may be partly responsible for individual differences in the experience of pleasure and pain during exercise in order to use descriptions of those individual differences to design individualized exercise programs," he said.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, said Maddux, "knowing that there is a genetic contribution may help the high-exercise-discomfort person engage in less self-blame, which can be demoralizing and discouraging. In fact, this could be useful information for personal trainers to pass along to their high-discomfort clients. It could help both of them be a little more patient."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise.

aVSara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, could face potential criminal charges after allegedly using thousands of dollars of state money to fund personal expenses.\u000a\u000aIsrael's Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said in a statement that he is considering filing charges against Sara Netanyahu for fraudulently procuring items as well as for fraud and breach of trust after she reportedly spent over $100,000 in public funds for private catering services, according to The Guardian.\u000a\u000aMandelblit informed her on Friday that he had decided to move forward after consulting with relevant authorities and examining evidence surrounding the allegations.\u000a\u000aThis announcement marks the first procedural step in formally charging Sara Netanyahu, who is being given a final opportunity to state her case at an indictment hearing.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the accusations on Facebook, dismissing the allegations against his wife as "absurd."\u000a\u000aHe further stated that "Sara Netanyahu is a brave and honest woman and has never done anything wrong. Alongside her work as an expert educational psychologist treating children every week, she spends a lot of time helping children with cancer, Holocaust survivors and lone soldiers."\u000a\u000aSara Netanyahu is accused of using state funding to hire outside catering services by creating a misleading impression that the prime minister's official residence did not employ any cooks between 2010 and 2013, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000a"In this way, hundreds of meals from restaurants and chefs worth 359,000 shekels ($102,399) were received from the state fraudulently," a justice ministry statement said, according to Reuters.\u000a\u000aThe Associated Press reported that investigations that Sara Netanyahu bought furniture for their private beach house with government money, used state funds to cover her father's medical expenses and improperly hired an electrician who was a political supporter, were dropped.

aVThree cheers for the Fight for 15! No, not the left\u2019s demand for a $15 per hour minimum wage. (Why stop there? Why not $100 per hour?) That idea is a surefire job killer and exactly the wrong prescription from the same folks obsessed with an imminent invasion of robots.\u000a\u000aThe worthy Fight for 15 would slash U.S. corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. Donald J. Trump ran on this bold, Reaganesque idea. To his credit, he is pushing it as president. "We must restore our competitive edge, which we\u2019ve lost," President Trump said Tuesday at the White House. He added, "We can\u2019t be the jobs magnet of the world if we continue to tax our industries at rates 60 percent higher than companies in other countries."\u000a\u000aFor sky-high corporate levies in the First World, we're number one!\u000a\u000aKyle Pomerlau and Emily Potosky observed last month in an indispensable Tax Foundation paper, "The United States has the highest corporate income tax rate among the 35 industrialized nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development." The United Arab Emirates is the only country with a higher corporate rate \u2014 a mind-blowing 55 percent. Pomerlau and Potosky added, "In 2003, the worldwide average was approximately 30 percent. By 2016, the average rate had declined by roughly 7 percentage points to 22.5 percent."\u000a\u000aAmerica\u2019s 35 percent corporate rate equals those of tiny Malta, lovely but economically bipolar Argentina, and these African garden spots \u2014 Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, and Zambia.\u000a\u000aA 15 percent corporate rate would make America more attractive than every other OECD nation except Ireland. Its 12.5 percent corporate tax has catalyzed that former basket case into Europe\u2019s Silicon Valley and a powerful argument for supply-side defibrillation.\u000a\u000aSuch robust business-tax reduction \u2014 coupled with personal income-tax cuts, tax simplification, and repatriation of U.S. corporate profits stranded overseas \u2014 should unleash a 1980s-style economic boom.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has predicted, "If we achieve sustained 3 percent growth, that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion dollars of new economic activity over the next decade."\u000a\u000aSuch numbers would be impressive. But, more important, they would generate job offers for the unemployed, promotions for today\u2019s workers, and green lights for new-business proposals, rather than the "It\u2019s on hold" messages that have foiled entrepreneurs throughout the forgettable Bush-Obama years.\u000a\u000aRestored prosperity also could pacify a society on the verge of self-strangulation. When Americans can pay their bills and care for themselves and their loved ones, they spend much less time pointing fingers at "the blacks," "the Jews," "the Mexicans," "whitey," or even Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aAs Trump pumps up the volume on tax reform, he and his allies should promote a 15 percent corporate rate, not "15 to 20 percent." That soon becomes "20 to 25 percent." Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, recently told Reuters, "In fact, it would be kind of miraculous if we could get it down to 25 percent or less."\u000a\u000aBefore long, Trump will have to beg Democrats and Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, (but I repeat myself) for permission to nick today\u2019s 35 percent rate down to 30 percent.\u000a\u000aPerhaps, at 4:30 a.m. in a congressional conference committee, Republicans might prevent final legislation from collapsing by agreeing with Democrats to shift from 15 percent to 17.5 percent. But that concession should occur, if at all, at the last possible second, not before the bill even has been drafted. This is Negotiation 101 \u2014 a class that most Washington Republicans either flunked \u2014 or never took.\u000a\u000aEvery American should join Trump\u2019s Fight for 15 and embrace his tax-cutting vision.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump told a crowd in Springfield, Missouri, last week, "We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage," adding, "We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, create jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America \u2014 the America we love."\u000a\u000aDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor with National Review Online.

aVA New York official is pushing to rename Trump Park in honor of Heather Heyer, the woman who died in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month after a man drove a car into demonstrators protesting at a white supremacy rally, BuzzFeed reported Wednesday.\u000a\u000aAssembly Member Nily Rozic is planning to introduce a bill that directs the commissioner of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to change the name of Donald J. Trump State Park in Westchester County, New York, to "Heather D. Heyer State Park."\u000a\u000aRozic, a Queens Democrat, said, "the renaming would acknowledge that its current designation does not reflect the goals of uplifting and unifying New Yorkers."\u000a\u000aState parks, according to the commission's policy, "should foster and strengthen the sense of purpose, well-being and identity of the citizens of the state."\u000a\u000aTrump donated the park to New York State in 2006, but it has been closed to the public since 2010 because of budget cuts. Former New York State Sen. Daniel Squadron in 2015 tried to have the park's name changed by introducing an "Anything But Trump Act," after Trump proposed banning Muslim immigrants from the U.S.\u000a\u000aHeyer was among a group of protestors demonstrating at a rally of white nationalists.\u000a\u000a"Heather Heyer's life was taken away by white supremacists who have been emboldened ever since President Trump took office," Rozic said. "In New York, we continue standing by one another and calling out those who seek to divide us. This activism is not new \u2014 it is embedded in our state's history and re-naming Donald J. Trump State Park would serve as a reminder of the transformative power it holds to carry us forward."

aVRussian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test, but also warned against using military force against the country, calling it a "road to nowhere" that could lead to a "global catastrophe."\u000a\u000aRussia condemns North Korea's nuclear test as "provocative," Putin told a televised news conference in China. But he stopped short of expressing willingness to impose more sanctions on North Korea, saying Moscow viewed them as "useless and ineffective."\u000a\u000aPutin said North Korea's neighbors should engage with it, not whip up "military hysteria."\u000a\u000a"It's a road to nowhere. Whipping up military hysteria \u2014 this will lead to no good," he said. "It could cause a global catastrophe and an enormous loss of life."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea conducted its most powerful nuclear test to date on Sunday, triggering warnings from the United States of a "massive military response." Rattled by the test, South Korea on Tuesday conducted live-fire exercises at sea in its second straight day of military displays.\u000a\u000aThe Russian president, who was in China for a summit of leading emerging economies, told reporters that he had remarked to one of his counterparts at the talks that North Korea "will eat grass but will not give up the (nuclear) program, if they don't feel safe."\u000a\u000aPutin said it was important that all parties affected by the crisis, including North Korea, not face "threats of annihilation" and "step on the path of cooperation."\u000a\u000aRussia's United Nations ambassador echoed Putin's remarks later in the day. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia said sanctions against North Korea aren't working and Moscow wants a new U.N. resolution on North Korea to focus more on a political solution.\u000a\u000aNebenzia said the only initiative on paper is a Chinese-Russian suspension-for-suspension proposal that would halt North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the U.S. and South Korea halting their joint military exercises.\u000a\u000aHe told reporters at U.N. headquarters on Tuesday that Russia would welcome other initiatives, saying that the Swiss have offered mediation services and "if that works, I'll be happy."\u000a\u000aU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley told an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday that the United States wants a new U.N. resolution with tougher sanctions adopted by Sept. 11.\u000a\u000aNebenzia said he hasn't seen the draft resolution and told reporters Haley's deadline is "a little premature" especially since the Security Council was on a visit to Ethiopia and isn't scheduled to meet again until Sept. 11.\u000a\u000aHe stressed that a military option should be "ruled out of any discussions." Nebenzia also said the U.N. Security Council may need "a separate political resolution that stresses diplomacy rather than sanctions."\u000a\u000aAsked about a possible oil embargo or ban on North Koreans working abroad, he said: "We wouldn't like to see the ordinary people, the citizens of North Korea, suffering for what the leadership is doing."\u000a\u000a"And unfortunately, economic measures that might be adopted \u2014 they will definitely fall on the Korean people themselves, not on the Korean nuclear or ballistic (missile) problem," Nebenzia said.

aVIf you\u2019ve tried to lose weight over and over again, without success, it may not entirely be your fault. Your body is hard-wired to keep you from losing weight, a top expert says.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we try to lose fat, our body gets alarmed and tries to protect it,\u201d Dr. Sylvia Tara, Ph.D., tells Newsmax Health.\u000a\u000aTara understands this struggle well.\u000a\u000a\u201cI gain weight very easily, and I\u2019ve always tried to lose it, so it finally got to the point where I decided I\u2019m going to figure this out,\u201d says Tara, author of the new book, \u201cThe Secret Life of Fat.\u201d\u000a\u000aTara, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, spent five years researching all aspects of body fat. What she found is that fat, which is so often reviled, serves an important purpose, but that there are effective strategies to shed excess pounds.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur fat is actually an essentially and critically misunderstood organ, as vital to our health as our heart, lungs or stomach," she explains.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe hormones that fat secretes affect many of our vital functions, including our reproductive organs, as well as affecting brain size, bone strength, and even how well our wounds heal.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut what surprised her is the power fat has \u2013 not only over our health, but also our thought processes.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur fat produces the hormone leptin, which signals to our brain that we have enough fat and we don\u2019t need to eat in abundance," she explains. "But as we lose fat, the amount of leptin is reduced, so our brain goes into overdrive, and we get hungrier and want bigger portions.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to Tara, weight loss can actually boost our appetite and lower metabolism.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe leptin released from fat also affects muscle and our thyroid function. So less leptin causes less fat to burn. It\u2019s fat\u2019s own way of protecting itself against loss,\u201d she notes.\u000a\u000aSomeone who weighs 170 pounds and loses 20 will have to cut his or her calorie consumption by 22 percent just to stay at that 150 pounds due to the lowering of metabolism.\u000a\u000a"When people try to lose fat, the body tries to protect it, and has mechanisms to do this, and to make you gain the weight back," she explains. "You may think your failing on your diet, but it\u2019s just your fat fighting you back.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut losing weight can be done \u2013 you just have to know how, says Tara.\u000a\u000a\u201cFat is clever, and fat can fight back, but knowledge is power, so if you are aware of what\u2019s happening, you can fight back,\u201d she explains.\u000a\u000aHere are five key factors that drive obesity:\u000a\u000aGenetics: Obesity that runs in families has been tied to a genetic variation called FTO, which causes cravings for high-calorie foods.\u000a\u000aGender: If you\u2019ve ever observed that it\u2019s easier for men to lose weight than women, research bears this out. \u201cWomen store fat at two to three times the rate that men do, but when they exercise, they actually burn more fat than men. This may seem like an upside, but the downside is that women also get hungrier after exercise compared to men, so they may want to exercise a little less intensely,\u201d Tara says.\u000a\u000aHormones: Our fatty tissue produces leptin, which acts in opposite to the so-called \u201chunger\u201d hormone, \u201cghrelin.\u201d Leptin travels through the bloodstream, and binds to the brain\u2019s hypothalamus, to make us feel full. But when fat is lost, the production of this hormone goes down, which makes us feel hungrier.\u000a\u000aViruses: A virus, known as Ad-36 can causeobesity. You may be unaware that you\u2019ve caught it, but it can have lasting effects on your body .One study showed that 30 percent of obese subjects had been infected with it, versus 11 percent of those who were not obese \u2013 a 3-to-1 ratio.\u000a\u000aYour microbiome: Depending on the distribution of the bacteria in your intestine, you may be thinner or fatter, as some gut microbes are more efficient at extracting calories from food than are others.\u000a\u000aHere are Tara\u2019s top tips on how to outsmart your fat:\u000a\u000aChoose the right diet: Find a diet that includes foods you like and fits your lifestyle, because once you've lost the fat, you\u2019ll have to watch what you eat for life. Diets that are very restrictive that limit certain foods have high failure rates because dieters don\u2019t maintain that lifestyle for long.\u000a\u000aGet active: Exercise increases levels of brown fat, the fat that burns calories, and boosts levels of testosterone and growth hormone \u2013 both which burn fat.\u000a\u000aHigh intensity interval training: This is a form of cardiovascular exercise strategy that involves alternating short periods of intense exercise with more moderate bursts. It is the best way to get a vigorous workout in a short period of time. But if this isn\u2019t for you, don\u2019t worry; even people who engage in easier recreational activity or casual backyard sports lose more weight than those who don\u2019t do anything.\u000a\u000aTry intermittent fasting: This is an eating plan cycles between fasting and non-fasting. It can involve simply leaving a 16-hour fasting window between diner and breakfast. You can accomplish this by eating supper earlier and eating later after you awaken. Such fasting overnight increases levels of growth hormone, which helps burn fat, and curbs appetite.\u000a\u000aBuild up willpower: Willpower is like a muscle \u2013 it can be trained. Pick a non-food habit you want to build up, like making your bed every morning. You\u2019ll find that building up discipline will help you when you are sticking to a diet as well.\u000a\u000aPractice temptation bundling: Try pairing a pleasant task with an unpleasant chore, such as listening to music while you work out.\u000a\u000aBe forgiving: At some point, you are going to go off your diet, and by forgiving yourself, and going back on it, you\u2019ll help to ensure your long-term success.

aVThe repercussions of 9/11 continue to exact a toll on the health of Americans. An analysis by NYU Langone Health of blood tests from children who may have breathed in the toxic ashes and fumes from the collapse of the World Trade Center towers found that they have risk factors for future heart disease.\u000a\u000aResearchers examined blood tests of 308 children, 123 who may have come in direct contact with dust on 9/11. They found that children with higher blood levels of the chemicals known to be in the dust also had elevated levels of artery-hardening fats in their blood.\u000a\u000a"Since 9/11, we have focused a lot of attention on the psychological and mental fallout from witnessing the tragedy, but only now are the potential physical consequences of being within the disaster zone itself becoming clear," says Dr. Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor at NYU School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aTrasande says the long-term danger may stem from exposure to certain perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs \u2014 chemicals released into the air as electronics and furniture burned in the disaster.\u000a\u000aChemicals include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), widely used to make plastics more flexible until its health effects \u2014 including lower-than-normal birthweights and brain damage \u2014 led U.S. manufacturers to stop using it in 2014.\u000a\u000aOther results of the study showed that roughly every threefold increase in blood PFOA levels was tied to an average 9 percent to 15 percent increase in blood fats, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.\u000a\u000aAccording to Trasande, raised fat levels in the blood, especially LDL, are known risk factors for heart disease. If left untreated, it can lead to blood vessel blockages and heart attack.\u000a\u000aFortunately, he says, these very early signs of cardiovascular risk observed in the children can generally be addressed by diet, weight control, and exercise.\u000a\u000a"Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the health consequences from 9/11 in children exposed to the dust, and offers hope that early intervention can alleviate some of the dangers to health posed by the disaster," says Trasande.\u000a\u000aThe results appear in the journal Environment International.\u000a\u000aIn another study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in June, a different research team at NYU found raised blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in people who reported being exposed to WTC dust on 9/11.\u000a\u000aPrevious research has linked increases in CRP to inflammation and higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

aVFormer Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke Jr. said Friday that people should be allowed to use deadly force when protecting their property from looters during a state of emergency.\u000a\u000a"I have no sympathy whatsoever for looters. I can't think of anything more disgusting than to take advantage of people when they are in a vulnerable situation," Clarke, who recently joined the super PAC America First Action as a spokesperson, told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on "Mornings with Maria."\u000a\u000a"You are going to need the citizens that stayed behind to help you protect some of that property. I have no problem with using deadly force against looters. Look, we can sit up here and say, 'It's just a little property, it's just a little looting, so what?' Well, I don't feel that way in these situations and once order is restored and the state of emergency is lifted, then we go back to our normal situation, which will be that you can't use deadly force against property, but I think [in a] state of emergency, all bets are off," Clarke said.\u000a\u000aHe also addressed reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement called off raids across the country due to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, saying, "I'm tired of the crocodile tears about illegal immigrants and illegal aliens in the country and how we need to feel sorry for them and pity them. No, we need to feel bad for Americans who can't find work. We need to feel bad for Americans whose wages are depressed because of the issue of hiring illegal aliens for lower wage."

aVLeslie Van Houten was recommended for parole Wednesday after a state panel determined the former Charles Manson follower has radically changed her life during the more than 40 years she has been in prison for two brutal murders she helped commit 48 years ago and is no longer a threat to society.\u000a\u000aThe two-member panel's ruling must still be approved by the state Parole Board and Gov, Jerry Brown, who reversed another panel's ruling last year.\u000a\u000aIn blocking her release then, Brown said Van Houten had failed to adequately explain to the panel how a model teenager from a privileged Southern California family who had once been a homecoming princess could have turned into a ruthless killer by age 19.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the panel grilled her for two hours on how she could address those concerns.\u000a\u000a"I've had a lot of therapy trying to answer that question myself," she said.\u000a\u000a"To tell you the truth, the older I get the harder it is to deal with all of this, to know what I did, how it happened," added Van Houten, now a frail-looking 68-year-old who appeared before the panel on crutches, her gray hair pulled back in a bun.\u000a\u000aShe went on to say that she was devastated when her parents divorced when she was 14. Soon after, she said, she began hanging out with her school's outcast crowd in the Los Angeles suburb of Monrovia. She started smoking marijuana and graduated to LSD at 15. When she was 17, she and her boyfriend ran away to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury District during San Francisco's summer of love.\u000a\u000aWhen they returned, she said, she discovered she was pregnant. When her mother found out, she ordered her to have an abortion and bury her fetus in their backyard.\u000a\u000aSoon after, she was traveling up and down the California coast, trying to find peace within herself when acquaintances led her to Manson, who was holed up at an old abandoned movie ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles where he had recruited what he called a "family" to survive what he insisted would be a race war he would launch by committing a series of random, horrifying murders. His disaffected youthful followers became convinced that the small-time criminal and con man was actually a Christ-like figure and believed him.\u000a\u000aAs she did at her parole hearing last year, the soft-spoken Van Houten went on to candidly describe how she joined several other members of the "Manson Family" in killing Los Angeles grocer Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, in their home on Aug. 9, 1969, carving up La Bianca's body and smearing the couple's blood on the walls.\u000a\u000aShe was not with Manson followers the night before when they killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others during a similar bloody rampage.\u000a\u000aOn the night of the second attack she said she held Rosemary La Bianca down with a pillowcase over her head as others stabbed her dozens of times. Then, ordered by Manson disciple Tex Watson to "do something," she picked up a butcher knife and stabbed the woman more than a dozen times.\u000a\u000a"I feel absolutely horrible about it, and I have spent most of my life trying to find ways to live with it," she added quietly.\u000a\u000aRelatives of the La Biancas didn't believe her. They spoke emotionally as they pleaded with the commission to reject her parole bid.\u000a\u000a"No member of the Manson family deserves parole, ever," nephew Louis Smaldino said. "She is a total narcissist and only thinks of herself and not the damage she has done."\u000a\u000aThe voice of the La Biancas' oldest grandson, Tony LaMontagne, broke as he noted he's about to turn 44, the same age his grandfather was when he was killed.\u000a\u000a"Please see to it that this fight doesn't have to happen every year for the rest of our lives," he said of Van Houten's nearly two dozen parole hearings.\u000a\u000aFamily members left before the panel announced its decision.\u000a\u000aIn reaching it, Parole Commissioner Brian Roberts and Deputy Commissioner Dale Pomantz said they took into account Van Houten's entire time of incarceration. During those years she has earned bachelor's and master's degrees in counseling, been certified as a counselor and headed numerous programs to help inmates.\u000a\u000a"You've been a facilitator, you've been a tutor and you've been giving back for quite a number of years," Roberts said.\u000a\u000aStill, he warned her that if she is released that living in society again will not be easy. He noted parole officials have heard from "tens of thousands" of people who don't want her released. But others, he added, including many who have known her since childhood, spoke up for her, saying they've seen her mature in prison and become a different person.\u000a\u000a"So with that we'd like to wish you good luck," he said.\u000a\u000a"Thank you very much, I really appreciate it," replied Van Houten, who attended on crutches because of a knee injury suffered in a recent fall. She said her health is otherwise fine.\u000a\u000aAfterward, her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, said he believes Van Houten addressed the concerns the governor had when he denied her parole last year.\u000a\u000a"My hope is he's going to follow the law and let his commissioners do their job," he said.\u000a\u000aHe added his client was relieved by Wednesday's ruling, adding he believes she will be released eventually.\u000a\u000a"I'm getting her out of here. That's not an issue. The question is when," he said.\u000a\u000aNo one who took part in the Tate-La Bianca murders has been released from prison so far.\u000a\u000aAP reporters Don Thompson in Sacramento, California, and John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

"We had a chance to do a lot of good, the debt ceiling, it will have to be raised, but it ought to have some restraints to save future generations from our own indebtedness and our own immorality where we, for the first time in American history, decided that we don't want our children to live better than we do.\u000a\u000a"We're going to spend their money during our generation and leave them the debt."\u000a\u000aThe deal struck between Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was approved Thursday by the Senate and now must be passed in the House.\u000a\u000aGohmert said he trusts Trump's judgment since he is a skilled negotiator and knows how to get the right deal.\u000a\u000a"He's the master dealmaker, and I don't mean that sarcastically, I mean that for real," Gohmert said. "He's an amazing dealmaker. I know what he had in his mind. I've come to respect his judgment on making deals, so I can't really say he got rolled."

aVPresident Donald Trump wanted to "clear the decks" so that lawmakers can deal with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and tax reform, so it was a "great idea" to strike a deal with Democrats and move the debt ceiling issue to December, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Friday.\u000a\u000a"Let's not forget about what happened in Houston," Mulvaney told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" program. "We have a hurricane getting ready to hit Florida. Right after we deal with that we want to deal with tax reform. It has been and remains what the president wants as top domestic priority."\u000a\u000aThursday night, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan had dinner together, and Mulvaney said the two are getting along well.\u000a\u000a"I am always surprised when I read in the media how much everybody hates everybody in this town and how everybody backbites and fights," said Mulvaney. "Paul came over and had a nice chat with the president. I was only there five or 10 minutes."\u000a\u000aTrump will work with Ryan, and he'll be working with people in the Senate, as well as with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, insisted Mulvaney.\u000a\u000a"Keep in mind, most of what we want to do as part of this administration is going to require 60 votes in the Senate," Mulvaney said. "It requires the president to work with everyone. And he can do that. So, the dinner was fine. The gentlemen got along great. We look forward to push tax reform."\u000a\u000aHe said he does understand the frustrations being felt by Republican voters, or anybody concerned about the direction in which the country is moving.\u000a\u000a"We were told we would have Obamacare repeal and replace by now," said Mulvaney. "We were told we would probably be finished with tax reform right now and probably talking about infrastructure. Here we are in the early part of September and they haven't even repealed and replaced Obamacare yet. That frustration is real."\u000a\u000aTrump, he continued, "is a guy who is driven by results and driven by action. That's not always the way Washington works."\u000a\u000aShow co-host Ainsley Earhardt commented that there are reports Trump and Ryan did not discuss Obamacare or immigration, and asked if that meant the issues are on the backburner.\u000a\u000a"I wasn't there but it wouldn't surprise me if the priorities were what are we doing in Houston, what are we getting ready to do in Florida to help these folks and then when do we get tax reform?" said Mulvaney. "It wouldn't surprise me if that dominated the discussion last night."\u000a\u000aThere also has been talk that Trump would like to end the whole debt limit permanently, but Mulvaney said he doesn't think it's understood yet how that would work.\u000a\u000a"I think this is what is driving that discussion," said Mulvaney. "In fact, we did talk about this. How do we depoliticize it? How do we make it so it's not this precipice, this cliff every couple of months or years? How do you make it to where it's more of an ordinary course of business and is not yet just another divergent sort of leverage point in the process of Washington, D.C.? How do we deemphasize the politics?"\u000a\u000aTrump, by reaching his agreement with Democratic leaders earlier this week, also "proved that he can govern," said Mulvaney. "He proved that he can run the country and prioritize what's most important."

aVCongress has had plenty of time to do something about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and they have done nothing, so now is there chance, former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., said Tuesday.\u000a\u000aDuring an interview with J.D. Hayworth on Newsmax TV, Tancredo was asked about President Donald Trump's decision to end the DACA program six months from now \u2014 which gives lawmakers time to cobble together more permanent legislation on the matter.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"And of course, there are 10 governors I think now \u2013 at least \u2013 that are wanting to sue on that basis and say, 'this is illegal.' And it is \u2013 it's unconstitutional."\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday the DACA program will be rescinded, citing the need to follow the law. Obama signed executive orders five years ago to begin the policy, which allowed children who illegally came to the U.S. with their parents to stay under certain criteria.\u000a\u000aSomewhere around 800,000 people have benefitted from the program.\u000a\u000aTancredo said he doubts lawmakers in Washington will be able to come to an agreement on legislation that would potentially allow DACA recipients to stay in the U.S. permanently.\u000a\u000a"The Democrats are demanding a 'clean bill,'" Tancredo said. "What does that mean? Well you and I know what that means, it means amnesty.\u000a\u000a"The Republicans are left with an option and that is to essentially say, 'OK, they can stay, but no pathway to citizenship,' which they would consider to not be amnesty, right? But the Democrats will never accept that. It's why, I say, I think there's going to be a lot of talk, a lot of fist-banging on the table about this, but at the end, I don't think anything's going to happen."

aVThe Federal Reserve should continue gradually raising U.S. interest rates given low inflation should rebound, an influential Fed policymaker said in a Thursday speech that sounded slightly less confident than his previous hawkish comments in the face of weak price readings.\u000a\u000aNew York Fed President William Dudley did not repeat an assertion three weeks ago that he expects to raise rates once more this year, and he called the persistent shortfall in prices surprising. Yet he reinforced the U.S. central bank's general expectation that an inflation rebound is around the corner, allowing it to continue tightening monetary policy before too long.\u000a\u000aThe comments reflect intellectual divisions within the Fed and could whip-saw investor expectations since they come two days after a Fed governor, Lael Brainard, expressed deeper concern over the inflation data.\u000a\u000a"Even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually," said Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\u000a\u000aThe central bank has raised rates twice this year in a nod to decent economic growth, falling unemployment and solid job gains. Yet months of falling or flat inflation readings have flummoxed policymakers and caused investors to grow skeptical of a December rate hike, as implied in Fed forecasts from June.\u000a\u000aDudley, who also predicted the Fed's bond portfolio would shrink to $2.4 trillion to $3.5 trillion by early next decade, said the inflation weakness may hint at "structural factors" that would be positive for the economy and for workers.\u000a\u000aThe Fed's preferred inflation measure is now 1.4 percent. But Dudley said the falling dollar and "the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors" means that inflation will rise to the Fed's 2-percent goal "over the medium term."\u000a\u000a"I expect that the U.S. economy will continue to perform quite well," he added.\u000a\u000aDudley swatted away criticisms from doves in arguing it may be necessary to tighten with inflation below target, since monetary policy acts with a lag. He also largely dismissed worries over possible asset bubbles and criticisms that the Fed has contributed to price distortions and low market volatility.\u000a\u000aDudley said he hoped that the inflation puzzle would be clearer in "coming months." And he nodded to another favorite reason to expect to keep raising rates: financial conditions - from credit spreads to stocks to bond yields - remain quite loose despite past rate hikes.\u000a\u000aTraders currently give about a 23 percent probability to a December rate hike, down from 30 percent before Brainard spoke on Tuesday, reflecting the weak inflation readings and some more dovish comments from Fed policymakers. The central bank's forecasts imply roughly three rate hikes next year.\u000a\u000aIt is widely expected, however, that the Fed will announce at a Sept. 19-20 policy meeting the beginning of trimming its $4.5-trillion bond portfolio, likely starting in October.\u000a\u000aDudley, whose New York Fed manages the portfolio, said he expects the process to start this year. He added that the shedding of Treasury and mortgage bonds would exert only a "modest" policy tightening over the years.\u000a\u000aNodding to the effects in Texas of Hurricane Harvey, Dudley said that while the human toll was tragic, and there may be some gasoline-price inflation, they should not fundamentally alter the overall economy's momentum.

aVISTANBUL (AP) \u2014 Turkey's pro-Kurdish political party has announced the release from prison of one of their lawmakers pending a trial on terror charges.\u000a\u000aAyhan Bilgen, a former spokesman for the People's Democratic Party, or HDP, was released Friday, according to the party's current spokesman, Osman Baydemir.\u000a\u000aState-run Anadolu news agency said that Bilgen is facing up to 23 years in prison for three separate crimes after being detained in January for alleged membership of a terror organization.\u000a\u000aFollowing Bilgen's release, 11 HDP legislators, including the party's co-chairs Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksedag, remain in Turkish prisons, according to the HDP.\u000a\u000aThe Turkish government accuses the party of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The HDP denies the accusation.\u000a\u000aTurkey and its Western allies consider the PKK a terrorist organization.

aVHad Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, the legislative compromise that allowed Congress to weigh in on the Iran nuclear agreement without actually ratifying it as a treaty would have been an arcane footnote.\u000a\u000aBut Donald Trump won the election, and so an overlooked element of that legislation could provide a poison pill for at least the beginning of America's exit from the bargain that defines Barack Obama's foreign policy legacy.\u000a\u000aThe provision is found in the Iran Nuclear Deal Review Act's requirement for the secretary of state to inform Congress every 90 days about Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. So far the Trump administration has reluctantly certified Iranian compliance twice. But the president has also hinted that he would like to get out of the deal.\u000a\u000aOn Monday in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, outlined how Trump could do just that, even if Iran was technically meeting the requirements of the plan of action.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of the 90-day certification process, Haley said: "The law asks the president to certify several things, not just one. The first is that Iran has not materially breached the JCPOA. That's the one everyone focuses on." She went on to say that the law also "asks the president to certify that the suspension of sanctions against Iran is appropriate and proportionate to Iran's nuclear measures, and that it is vital to the national security interests of the United States."\u000a\u000aThat's important because it gives the president flexibility if he chooses to begin the process for getting out of the deal. Because of the way the law is written, Trump can decertify Iran even if the U.S. intelligence community determines that Iran is adhering to the deal's limits on stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and is still allowing monitors to its known nuclear sites.\u000a\u000aFor example, Trump could point to Iran's test of ballistic missiles as a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the nuclear bargain in 2015. The plan of action itself is not clear on the missile issue, whereas the resolution prohibits it.\u000a\u000aTrump could also determine that the deal itself is not in the national interest because of its structural flaws. Key provisions of the deal forged by the U.S., Iran and five other great powers expire between 2025 and 2030. By that final year, Iran will be able to install as many advanced centrifuges as it chooses and enrich as much low-enriched uranium as it chooses. Trump could say that is not worth the risk.\u000a\u000aHaley didn't say what Trump had told her about the nuclear deal or what she had advised Trump. But her speech Monday laid the groundwork for decertifying Iran if the president so chooses.\u000a\u000aShe focused on the major structural flaws in the nuclear bargain, noting that there are no intermediate steps for punishing Iranian cheating or other non-nuclear behavior that threatens U.S. interests and allies in the region.\u000a\u000a"They are counting on the world brushing off relatively minor infractions, or even relatively major ones," she said. "They are counting on the United States and the other parties to the agreement being so invested in its success that they overlook Iranian cheating." She ended this section of the speech with the observation: "The Iranian nuclear deal was designed to be too big to fail."\u000a\u000aHaley is correct about the many flaws of the nuclear deal. The latest one came to the surface last month when Haley traveled to Geneva to meet with the International Atomic Energy Agency to discuss inspections of Iranian military sites and suspected undeclared nuclear facilities. Iranian leaders responded to her request by asserting inspectors would not be allowed to visit military facilities.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, because the benefits of the Iran nuclear deal accrue over time, namely that it continues to allow transparency of its nuclear program and keeps its low-enriched uranium stockpiles low, many experts have concluded it's not worth blowing up the deal, as flawed as it is.\u000a\u000aSo far, Trump has signaled that he disagrees. As I reported in July, the president came close to overruling his top advisers the last time he had to certify Iranian compliance and relented only at the last minute.\u000a\u000aIf Iranian compliance is not certified, Trump may be able to have the best of both worlds. He could signal to his supporters that he is keeping his campaign promise by instructing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to rule against Iran. And yet he still would not have killed the nuclear deal; he would simply have punted to Congress. At that point lawmakers could vote whether or not to re-impose the crippling secondary sanctions that effectively cut Iran off from the global economy.\u000a\u000aBut they may end up not going that far either. If Congress brings back those sanctions, Iran is within its rights to kick out inspectors and restart its full industrial-size program. So far, Trump has not said what he would do in that circumstance. Neither has Congress.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEli Lake is a Bloomberg View columnist.

"Prices have not widely fluctuated in the last month. Lower priced offers are quickly selling out, leaving higher priced offers from third party sellers."\u000a\u000aAccording to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's website, during a state of emergency it is "unlawful to sell, lease, offer to sell, or offer for lease essential commodities, dwelling units, or self-storage facilities for an amount that grossly exceeds the average price for that commodity during the 30 days before the declaration of the state of emergency, unless the seller can justify the price by showing increases in its prices or market trends."\u000a\u000aLast week, electronics giant Best Buy was forced to apologize after a photo appeared online showing one of its suburban Houston stores selling a 24-pack of water for nearly $43 in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, sparking outrage on social media, USA Today reported.\u000a\u000aSocial media has been an outlet for angry customers who believe they have been price gouged during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\u000a\u000aJetBlue Airways, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines placed caps on Florida flights in week in the middle of online fare gouging complaints, USA Today said.

aVFEMA will continue to help in the event of natural disasters, even though reports state that its Disaster Relief Fund has just $1.01 billion left in its coffers and that the federal agency could run out of money by Friday, Director Brock Long said Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"The president, the Department of Homeland Security, we've all been working together to directly inform the Congress, so [they] know what they need to do to be able to give us the enduring authority to push forward," Long told the "CBS This Morning" program. "There's great lines of communication."\u000a\u000aHe insisted that FEMA is not out of money, and even if it was, "we're not going to let money get in the way of saving lives, either."\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported, quoting a FEMA spokeswoman who asked not to be identified by name, that FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which finances disaster response and recovery activity, had the $1.01 billion on hand, with $541 million "immediately available" for recovery efforts for Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aLast Thursday, the fund had $2.14 billion, but an estimated $9.3 billion has been spent every hour since then, notes Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump's administration has asked Congress to add $8 billion to the FEMA fund. On Wednesday, House members will vote on whether to extend funding for Harvey, but the Senate is considering if it should add a measure suspending the federal debt limit. If that happens, the legislation will return to the House for further work.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Long said more than 100 FEMA staffers have already been deployed to Florida to be ready to respond to Hurricane Irma, with several workers remaining in Texas to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000a"You know, my confidence is high," said Long. "Despite everything that's going on, this is what we test and train for."\u000a\u000aHe noted that FEMA has operations out of an office in Puerto Rico, and has staff in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u000a\u000a"The agency's staffing levels are coming up," said Long. "We have over 700 people right now prepositioned to be able to support our partners."\u000a\u000aAs Irma rolls in, Long said that he hopes that structures in Florida that were put up after 2001 were built to at least withstand the force of a Category 5 hurricane. Meanwhile, he's not yet making predictions about where Irma will land.\u000a\u000a"I've never put a lot of confidence in a five-day forecast," said Long. "What I mean by that is it's no disrespect to our partners down at the National Hurricane Center, with some of the very best meteorologists in the globe down there ... I never look at one singular forecast. I look at the past three to recognize trends and what the system is doing to make better decisions.

"I have a lot of name recognition, I have a lot of credibility, and I wanted to help this president. When I saw what was going on after he was sworn in on Jan. 20 . . . I knew this was going to be a fight, and I didn't want to be toward the back not being able to help."\u000a\u000aHe said that led him to a conclude, "this is not going to be a good fit."\u000a\u000a"I had a conversation with President Trump before making that decision," he revealed. "I said, 'Mr. President, I don't know if that's going to be a good fit. Here's how I want to help you \u2013 I want to do it from a different position.' And you know what? He agreed. So, he said, 'We're going to find you a different position.'"\u000a\u000aWorking with America First Action will have "fewer restrictions," Clarke said.\u000a\u000a"Your hands are not as tied in terms of when you're a spokesperson outside \u2013 you can say things kind of in the fashion, and you know I don't sugarcoat stuff," he said. "I say what I feel, I say things the way they are in my view . . . I'm going to have more flexibility doing it from the outside, but this is an integral part of helping Donald Trump and his administration."\u000a\u000aOne of his tasks in the super PAC will be holding GOP lawmakers' "feet to the fire," Clarke said.\u000a\u000a"Every GOP lawmaker in the last election cycle ran on an issue of repeal and replace Obamacare," he said. "They didn't do it. People are tired of that. So, this is a thing that we'll be doing as well, supporting people for Capitol Hill, for Congress, who are going to get behind this agenda because that's what they're going to run on. . . . If they run on it, and we're going to hold their feet to the fire and make them keep their word."

aVResearchers are tackling fresh questions about a degenerative brain disease now that it has been detected in the brains of nearly 200 football players after death. The suspected cause is repeated head blows, an almost unavoidable part of contact sports.\u000a\u000aAs a new NFL season gets underway, here's a look at what's known \u2014 and what still needs to be learned \u2014 about the condition:\u000a\u000aWHAT'S NEW?\u000a\u000aThe largest report to date on chronic traumatic encephalopathy included 202 brains from football players at the youth, college and professional level, all donated post-mortem to a Boston brain bank. CTE was detected in all but one of the 111 NFL players studied, 90 percent of the college players and 20 percent of the high school players. It was absent in two younger players' brains.\u000a\u000aA previous report had described the disease in an 18-year-old football player, but finding additional cases at the high school level raises new questions about the game's safety for young players.\u000a\u000aHOW COMMON IS CTE?\u000a\u000aThe high occurrence of CTE in donated brains surprised researchers at Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System, whose brain bank is billed as the world's largest focusing on traumatic brain injury and CTE.\u000a\u000aBut whether CTE is truly common in sports or the general population isn't known. Most brains studied for CTE have been donated by family members because of concerns about mental symptoms that might be related to the disease \u2014 they don't come from a random population of people. Some experts think it isn't common since many athletes get repeated head blows and never develop symptoms.\u000a\u000aWHAT CAUSES CTE?\u000a\u000aRepeated knocks to the head are the most likely cause of CTE. Scientists believe genes probably play a role and may explain why some people with repeated head blows never develop the disease. Lifestyle habits including diet, alcohol and drugs may also somehow contribute.\u000a\u000aHOW DO HEAD BLOWS AFFECT THE BRAIN?\u000a\u000aThough the brain is jello-like in texture and cushioned in cerebrospinal fluid, a powerful hit \u2014 from a hard tackle, a fist or bomb shock wave \u2014 can cause a concussion, forcing the brain to ricochet back and forth inside the skull. Besides bruising and swelling, researchers believe that force can cause the brain to elongate, stretching nerve cells and their axons \u2014 fiber-like parts that transmit messages between cells. With a mild blow, these cells may return to normal, but a forceful hit may cause them to die.\u000a\u000aCommon symptoms after a concussion include dizziness, confusion, headaches, nausea and sometimes temporary loss of consciousness.\u000a\u000aCTE has been linked with repeated concussions and some scientists believe it may occur after repeated head blows that don't cause any obvious symptoms. But they still don't know how many head hits is too many.\u000a\u000aWHAT HAPPENS IN CTE?\u000a\u000aThe disease involves progressive brain damage, particularly in the frontal region, which controls many functions including judgment, emotion, impulse control, social behavior and memory. A signature feature is abnormal deposits of tau protein that accumulate around small blood vessels in brain crevices. Tau occurs normally in brain cells, helping them maintain their shape and function.\u000a\u000aBut researchers believe that multiple head blows may dislodge tau protein from the cell structure and cause it to form clumps inside nerve cells. These tau clumps can damage and ultimately kill nerve cells, and can spread as the disease progresses. At advanced stages, brain shrinkage may occur.\u000a\u000aAbnormal tau deposits in different shapes, patterns and locations have been implicated in other brain diseases, including Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS.\u000a\u000aWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\u000a\u000aResearch suggests early stages of CTE may cause no obvious symptoms. Many players whose autopsies showed more advanced disease had experienced personality changes, aggressive behavior, paranoia, poor memory, attention problems, dementia and depression. Some died by suicide. Whether the tau changes associated with CTE cause those symptoms is unclear.\u000a\u000aIS IT JUST A FOOTBALL DISEASE?\u000a\u000aWhat's now called CTE was once thought to mainly affect boxers; the earliest known reference in the medical literature was a 1928 report by a New Jersey pathologist who referred to a "punch-drunk" syndrome.\u000a\u000aThe first published finding about CTE in a retired NFL player was a 2005 report on Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famer Mike Webster.\u000a\u000aCTE also has been found in other contact sports including soccer, baseball and ice hockey; in soldiers exposed to bomb blast waves; domestic violence victims; and in psychiatric patients who engaged in repeated head-banging.\u000a\u000aWHAT'S FOOTBALL'S RESPONSE?\u000a\u000aThousands of former players are due to get damage awards from a $1 billion settlement stemming from lawsuits claiming the league hid what it knew about a link between concussions and CTE.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year the NFL hired a Vanderbilt University sports concussion expert, neurosurgeon Dr. Allen Sills, as its first full-time chief medical officer.\u000a\u000aInjury risks are part of football, but the league is trying to make the game safer, Sills said.\u000a\u000aNew "no-go" criteria this season for when to keep injured players out of the game list confusion, amnesia and loss of consciousness after an on-field injury. Injured players will be evaluated in new portable sideline exam tents, for privacy and to reduce distractions for those with suspected concussions.\u000a\u000aThere also will be a ban on "leaper" block attempts, where a defender leaping over the offense to block a kick is tackled midair.\u000a\u000aWHAT'S NEXT?\u000a\u000aResearchers are seeking to refine brain scan techniques to identify CTE tau deposits in living brains. They're also looking for clues in blood or cerebrospinal fluid that would allow them to diagnose CTE before death. If such markers exist, they could be targets for drug treatment.\u000a\u000aSymptoms associated with CTE can sometimes be managed with drugs or other treatment, but there's no cure and the only way to prevent it is to avoid head blows.\u000a\u000aStudies are underway to identify if specific genes make certain athletes more vulnerable to brain damage from head blows, and researchers hope to pin down how many head blows it takes to develop CTE.

aVHurricane Irma lashed Cuba and the Bahamas as it drove toward Florida on Friday after hitting the eastern Caribbean with its devastatingly high winds, killing 21 people and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake.\u000a\u000aAs Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century, bore down on Florida, Governor Rick Scott starkly warned residents to get out if they were in evacuation zones.\u000a\u000a"We are running out of time. If you are in an evacuation zone, you need to go now. This is a catastrophic storm like our state has never seen," Scott told reporters, adding that the storm's effects would be felt from coast to coast in the state.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Donald Trump said in a videotaped statement that Irma was "a storm of absolutely historic destructive potential," and called on people to heed recommendations from government officials and law enforcement.\u000a\u000aIrma was about 225 miles (360 km) east of Caibarien on Cuba's central-north coast, and 380 miles (610 km) southeast of Miami, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in an advisory at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Friday. Hurricane conditions were spreading westward over parts of Cuba and the central Bahamas as the storm skirted near Cuba's northern coast.\u000a\u000aThe storm earlier pummeled the Turks and Caicos Islands after saturating the northern edges of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\u000a\u000aThe "extremely dangerous" storm was downgraded from a rare Category 5, the top of the scale of hurricane intensity, to a Category 4 early Friday but it was still carrying winds as strong as 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), the NHC said.\u000a\u000aIrma was forecast to bring dangerous storm surges of up to 20 feet (6 meters) to the southeastern and central Bahamas, and up to 10 feet (3 meters) on parts of Cuba's northern coast. It was predicted to slam southern Florida on Sunday.\u000a\u000aCuban television broadcast footage of the sea flooding coastal towns in the eastern provinces of Guantanamo and Holguin, with waves reaching 20 feet (6 meters). With the storm still well offshore, flooding from the storm surge and inland from rain and swollen streams and rivers were the main concerns.\u000a\u000aCuba's Communist government has traditionally made rigorous preparations when the island is threatened by storms and the country was at a near standstill as Irma began to drive up the northern coast from east to west.\u000a\u000aSchools and most businesses were closed, hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated, and train, bus and domestic air services around the island were canceled. Airports were closing to international flights as conditions warranted.\u000a\u000aIrma was forecast to move closer to land as it passed the center of Cuba later in the day and on Saturday, when it could seriously damage resorts on vulnerable keys. Tourists, and even the dolphins that entertain them, were evacuated. The storm was then predicted to veer north, sparing western Cuba and Havana.\u000a\u000aIn the Cuban fishing town of Caibarien, residents secured their roofs and moved belongings from low-lying coastal areas to houses higher up inland as the skies clouded over. Most said they were worried but well prepared.\u000a\u000aEsteban Reyes, 65, was pushing his bicycle taxi laden with a mattress, iron and DVD player. "We are used to storms but I'm still a bit scared. But the government has taught us to be prepared and help one another," he said.\u000a\u000aIn the Bahamas, the government evacuated most people from the southern islands before the storm hit, with some 1,200 people airlifted to the capital, Nassau.\u000a\u000a"DON'T BE COMPLACENT"\u000a\u000aIrma was set to hit the United States two weeks after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas, killing about 60 people and causing property damage estimated at as much as $180 billion in Texas and Louisiana. Officials were preparing a massive response, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said.\u000a\u000aIn several television interviews early Friday, Florida's governor pleaded with residents to leave areas designated for evacuation, although he acknowledged frustration with buying gas and handling bumper-to-bumper traffic on the roads.\u000a\u000aAmid the exodus, nearly one-third of all gas stations in Florida's metropolitan areas were out of gasoline, according to Gasbuddy.com, a retail fuel price tracking service.\u000a\u000aIn Miami-Dade County alone, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said authorities had asked about 660,000 residents to evacuate, adding this was the largest evacuation he could remember in the county.\u000a\u000aU.S. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said the state was far more prepared now than in 1992, when Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida.\u000a\u000aSupermarkets in Miami were full of shoppers picking up last-minute supplies and food, and long lines of cars wrapped around the few gas stations still open.\u000a\u000aKenneth Weipert, a stranded tourist from Scotland who was getting cash from an ATM at a boarded-up bank, said he had made multiple attempts to book a flight, with no luck.\u000a\u000a"We have never been through anything like this before and we are quite worried about it," said Weipert. "We are in the hotel and the hotel is hurricane-proof, allegedly," he added.\u000a\u000aIn Palm Beach, the waterfront Mar-a-Lago estate owned by Trump was ordered evacuated, news media reported. Trump also owns property on the French side of St. Martin, a French-Dutch island devastated by the storm.\u000a\u000aA mandatory evacuation on Georgia's Atlantic coast was due to begin on Saturday, Governor Nathan Deal said. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe added his state on Friday to those under a state of emergency.\u000a\u000aU.S. stocks were little changed on Friday as investors assessed the financial impact of Harvey and tracked Irma. The three major Wall Street indexes were on track to end the week lower, with many economists forecasting that third-quarter gross domestic product will take a hit due to the hurricanes.\u000a\u000aHURRICANE JOSE REACHES CATEGORY 4\u000a\u000aAs it roared in from the east, Irma ravaged small islands in the northeastern Caribbean, including Barbuda, St. Martin and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, flattening homes and hospitals and ripping down trees.\u000a\u000aA Reuters witness described the roof and walls of a solidly built house shaking hard as the storm rocked the island of Providenciales.\u000a\u000aEven as they came to grips with the massive destruction, residents of the islands hit hardest by Irma faced the threat of another major storm, Hurricane Jose.\u000a\u000aJose, expected to reach the northeastern Caribbean on Saturday, was an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm, with winds of up to 150 mph (240 kph), the NHC said on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe death toll from Irma has risen as emergency services gained access to remote areas.\u000a\u000aFrench Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on Friday nine people were killed, at least seven were missing, and 112 others were injured in St. Barthelemy and the French part of St. Martin.\u000a\u000aFrance said it was deploying hundreds more police and other emergency personnel to the islands as it ramped up its response to the devastation in its overseas territories.\u000a\u000aThe Dutch government on Friday raised its estimate of casualties on its part of St. Martin to two dead and 43 wounded.\u000a\u000aFour people died in the U.S. Virgin islands, a government spokesman said, and a major hospital was badly damaged.\u000a\u000aThe eastern Caribbean island of Barbuda was reduced to "rubble," and one person died, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said.\u000a\u000aOne person was killed in the British overseas territory of Anguilla, three people died in Puerto Rico and a surfer was reported killed in Barbados.\u000a\u000aThe storm passed just to the north of the island of Hispaniola, shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti, damaging roofs and causing flooding and power outages as it approached the Haitian side. One man was reported missing after trying to cross a river in Haiti's Central Plateau region, and the government said some 10,000 people were in emergency shelters.

aVAmerican consumers borrowed more heavily in July, increasing their debt primarily in a category that includes auto and student loans.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve said Friday that overall consumer credit rose $18.5 billion in July, up from the $11.9 billion increase in June.\u000a\u000aEconomists and financial markets watch the credit report closely for clues about the direction of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.\u000a\u000aNon-revolving credit, which includes auto and student loans, increased $15.8 billion. The category that includes credit cards advanced $2.6 billion.\u000a\u000aThe July increase brought consumer credit to a total of $3.75 trillion. The Fed's monthly credit report does not include mortgages or other debt secured by real estate, including home-equity loans.\u000a\u000aIncreased loan demand is often a sign of continued economic growth.\u000a\u000aThe economy expanded at 3 percent annual clip in the April-June quarter. The gains suggest that that overall growth is back on track after a lackluster start during the first three months of 2017. Hiring has occurred at a slightly slower pace than in 2016, but it remains healthy. Employers added 156,000 jobs in August as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent.\u000a\u000aThe recent growth has left consumers slightly more eager to spend. Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in July, the best showing since April, the Commerce Department recently reported. Incomes in June grew 0.4 percent, the best showing since February.

aVPope Francis appears to confirm in a book of interviews that he supports same-sex couples being legal as "civil unions," but not calling them married.\u000a\u000aThe pope's comment is in a 432-page book by Dominique Wolton, a French journalist, called "Politics and Society," a book of interviews with the pope, according to LifeSite News.\u000a\u000a"Let us call things by their names. Matrimony is between a man and a woman. This is the precise term. Let us call the same-sex union a 'civil union,'" the pope said in the book.\u000a\u000a"What can we think of marriage between people of the same sex? 'Matrimony' is a historical word. Always, in humanity, and not just in the church, it was a man and a woman \u2026 it's not possible to change it. It is part of nature," the pope added, according to excerpts in Aleteia.\u000a\u000aThe Catholic Church's teaching on homosexual marriage is that such unions cannot be approved because homosexual acts are "intrinsically disordered," according to LifeSite News.\u000a\u000aThat teaching was noted in a 2003 document authored by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would be elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.\u000a\u000a"The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behavior or to legal recognition of homosexual unions," the document reads.\u000a\u000aThe pope offered the civil union compromise on gay marriage as "the lesser of two evils," according to Sergio Rubin, his authorized biographer, in a New York Times report in 2013.

aVFBI special counsel Robert Mueller is focusing on President Donald Trump and his associates in the Russia investigation but is failing to look at the "corrupt" former FBI director James Comey, former federal prosecutor Larry Klayman told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on "Newsmax Now," Klayman was asked about Mueller's Russia probe that's been ongoing for several months as the Department of Justice tries to determine whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.\u000a\u000aComey "is corrupt 10 ways to Sunday and he's getting a free pass at the current time," said Klayman, the founder of Freedom Watch. "Mueller is looking at President Trump trying to bring him down. He's leaving Comey alone, his friend."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

". . . He had a stake in this matter and he knew that if Mrs. Clinton became president of the United States, and it seemed likely at that time, there could be retribution. He could be fired.\u000a\u000a"He was protecting himself and he was putting himself in front of the American people."\u000a\u000aRegarding Mueller himself, Klayman said he has been leaking information about his investigation as he probes whether any wrongdoing occurred.\u000a\u000a"He's been leaking information like a sieve, which is in violation of rule 6 (e) of the rules of criminal procedure grand jury matters," Klayman said.\u000a\u000aKlayman noted Mueller's investigation might reach as high as former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, but he will not touch Trump.\u000a\u000a"I think it'll probably reach Flynn for no good cause, but Trump, no, he's the president," Klayman said.

aVA newly fraying relationship between President Donald Trump and top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has raised questions about how long Cohn will stay in his job, say two people with close ties to the White House.\u000a\u000aSeveral sources said Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, had long planned to stay in his post for at least a year. But one source said concern had grown among Cohn\u2019s allies over the past 24 hours that he might be pressured to leave.\u000a\u000aThe recent concerns stem from a report in the Wall Street Journal \u2013 confirmed by other news media, including Reuters \u2013 that Cohn was unlikely to be nominated by Trump as a potential successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\u000a\u000aTrump had mentioned Cohn in July for the job. Cohn resigned as president of Goldman Sachs to join the new administration.\u000a\u000a"The calculus has shifted for Gary. He's gone, essentially, from untouchable to possibly being bounced out," the source said. "The message is clear that suddenly Cohn's job in the White House has real downside risk."\u000a\u000aCohn crossed Trump last month when he criticized the president in a Financial Times interview for his response to the violence at a rally organized by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one woman died.\u000a\u000aOne source close to the White House said Trump wanted to fire Cohn. "Hates him. But that could be ephemeral," the source said.\u000a\u000aCohn, who is Jewish, told the newspaper the administration "must do better" in condemning neo-Nazis and white supremacists.\u000a\u000aThe former investment banker gave the interview after his wife and daughters pushed him to speak out, if not quit, after Trump blamed "both sides" for the violence.\u000a\u000aTrump said there were "very fine people" among the white supremacist groups, a comment that disgusted Cohn and those close to him, people who know him said.\u000a\u000aWhile the interview was intended to signal that Cohn had no plans to leave the White House and planned to push ahead with his signature project, tax reform, sources said the comments upset Trump.\u000a\u000aTrump has gone hot and cold on other advisers, some of whom have stayed, while others have left.\u000a\u000a"Relationships change," said a third source with close ties to the White House. "If Gary sticks around, I fully expect that Gary's relationship with the president will improve."\u000a\u000aPeople who know Cohn say that when he does leave the White House, he wants it to be on his own terms.\u000a\u000aA White House official said Cohn was focused on his job, especially tax reform.\u000a\u000a"Gary is focused on his responsibilities as the director of the National Economic Council, including a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver meaningful tax reform that creates jobs and grows the economy," the official said.\u000a\u000aCohn said in a CNBC interview last week he had a "great relationship" with Trump and the two were working well together.

aVOutnumbered and outvoted in hubs of innovation like Silicon Valley and Seattle, conservatives in the overwhelmingly blue industry have faced a challenging political environment for years \u2014 especially during the Obama era when the White House had Google and Facebook chiefs on speed dial.\u000a\u000aBut several deep-pocketed Republicans have managed to carve out a niche for themselves in the tech world, including a few who even backed Donald Trump publicly last year over techie favorite Hillary Clinton. According to Wired, employees at tech firms overwhelmingly supported Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u000a\u000aAlert: Your Drugstore Doesn't Understand Your Thyroid\u000a\u000aNewsmax has selected these 25 high-tech heavyweights who run against the grain in Silicon Valley and beyond, wielding their influence, forward-thinking, and resources to promote Republican candidates and ideals.\u000a\u000a1. Peter Thiel \u2014 The billionaire co-founder of PayPal last year threw his support, and a big chunk of his money, behind Trump, earning him a speaking spot at the GOP convention. Thiel made headlines \u2014 not because of his Silicon Valley ZIP code, but because of his sexual orientation. \u201cI am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican,\u201d he has said. \u201cBut most of all, I am proud to be an American.\u201d Thiel isn\u2019t just a Trump Republican; he\u2019s donated almost $5 million to various GOP candidates and PACs over the past few years.\u000a\u000a2. Larry Ellison \u2014 Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Ellison has donated over the years to Democrats and Republicans, but hosted fundraisers for Sen. Rand Paul in 2014 and Marco Rubio in 2016. In addition to hosting the Rubio dinner, Ellison was reportedly the second-largest donor to the Florida senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid through Conservative Solutions PAC, giving the super PAC $4 million throughout the campaign. The billionaire has continued to support the GOP after the November election, hosting a Republican fundraiser in his Silicon Valley home in April 2017.\u000a\u000a3. Meg Whitman \u2014 The former Hewlett-Packard and eBay executive ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, losing badly after pouring $144 million of her own money into the race. She backed Chris Christie in 2016 but endorsed Clinton over Trump after Christie dropped out. Still, she said, she remains a staunch Republican.\u000a\u000a4. Marc Andreessen \u2014 While funding and supporting Democrats in the past, Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and a director of eBay, Facebook, and Hewlett-Packard made a political shift when he threw his considerable weight, and wallet, behind Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cYou do not get a high-end, professional CEO running for president very often,\u201d the co-founder and partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz told CNBC at the time.\u000a\u000a5. Michael Dell \u2014 The Dell Technologies founder and former CEO has a long history of backing Republicans, including many in his home state of Texas. While he regularly makes smaller donations to (mostly) GOP candidates, he made a whopping $250,000 contribution in 2002 to the Republican National Committee. Even though his company is headquartered near Austin, Texas, Dell has developed strong ties to Silicon Valley by establishing mentors and opening an R&D center there.\u000a\u000a6. Scott McNealy \u2014 The Sun Microsystems co-founder, who self-identifies as a \u201craging capitalist,\u201d is bullish on Trump. "I\u2019ve never seen anybody who actually is a developer and an entrepreneur in charge and understanding what really projects capability in our country,\u201d McNealy told Fox Business. In 2012, he also backed Mitt Romney, with whom he shares a secondary school alma mater in Michigan.\u000a\u000a7. Steve Ballmer \u2014 The former Microsoft CEO has given plenty of cash to Democrats, but he is a self-described Republican who worked on George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and has helped many other GOP candidates. He has offered tempered praise for Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying it\u2019s \u201cimportant to have reasonably secure borders.\u201d And he said Trump\u2019s message about business stimulating jobs inside the country \u201cis not a bad theme at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a8. Paul Otellini \u2014 The former Intel CEO and president tried to work closely with the Obama White House, despite once famously saying the Democrat did not understand \u201cwhat it takes to create jobs.\u201d But Otellini, an executive with Trident Capital Cybersecurity, has made no secret of his preference for Republicans. He publicly backed, and financially supported, both John McCain and Romney in their races against Obama.\u000a\u000a9. Sarah Pompei \u2014 Possessing a lengthy Republican résumé before making the jump to Silicon Valley: Pompei advised Meg Whitman\u2019s gubernatorial bid in 2010, ran Romney's regional press in 2012, and worked briefly in the House GOP leaderships. She then left politics for senior communications roles at Hewlett-Packard and, now, rideshare app Lyft.\u000a\u000a10. Garrett Johnson \u2014 Co-founder of tech startup SendHub, Johnson differs from most other influencers considered among \u201cNewsmax's 25 Most Influential Republicans in Tech\u201d as his impact is more felt at the grassroots level. As executive director and co-founder of the Lincoln Network, he\u2019s a leader in building up and organizing right-leaning thinkers in the tech community in an effort to affect public policy with technological solutions driven toward freedom.\u000a\u000a11. Scott Banister \u2014 A PayPal board member and tech mega-investor, Banister strongly backed Rand Paul last year and supported Paul\u2019s father Ron in 2012. When Rand Paul quit the race, Banister, a marijuana rights activist who describes himself as a Libertarian, threw his support to Ted Cruz. Banister\u2019s wife Cyan is also a Republican super-donor.\u000a\u000a12. Palmer Luckey \u2014 The 24-year-old founder of Oculus Rift took a bare-knuckled approach to the 2016 campaign, helping to finance a pro-Trump group that created harsh anti-Clinton memes. Specifically, the group, Nimble America, ran a billboard campaign featuring Clinton with the caption \u201cToo Big to Jail.\u201d Luckey self-describes as a Libertarian.\u000a\u000a13. Tim Armstrong \u2014 The current AOL Inc. chief executive\u2019s support for Republicans has caused headaches for one of AOL\u2019s big media properties, the left-leaning Huffington Post, which quoted a \u201csource\u201d in 2011 saying Armstrong \u201ccalls himself a libertarian,\u201d but is in fact \u201cone of the most conservative people around.\u201d\u000a\u000a14. Don Scifres \u2014 The president of the tech startup SmartFile, Scifres is a venture capitalist who co-founded the SDL Capital investment firm and Spectra Diode Laboratories. Scifres has been a go-to GOP donor for years; in 2016, he backed Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz.\u000a\u000a15. Aaron Ginn \u2013 An early founder of the growth hacking movement, Ginn specializes in data science and product development. He\u2019s also one of the co-founders of Lincoln Network, formerly Lincoln Labs, an incubator for conservative tech professionals who, according to its website, is \u201cdevoted to building alliance of liberty and technology.\u201d He also worked on Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012.\u000a\u000aTip: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a16. Chris Abrams \u2014 The co-founder and chief technology officer of Matters Media, which he describes as a \u201cdigital publishing holdings company with a tech twist.\u201d Abrams is a self-described technologist and entrepreneur who previously worked with large organizations such as NASA and the Department of Defense, but also worked with dozens of small startups. He also works with Ginn on Lincoln Network.\u000a\u000a17. Brian Krzanich \u2014 The CEO of Intel since 2013, Krzanich agreed to host a Trump fundraiser last year at his California home but canceled it. Amid uproar, he later said he was staying neutral in the 2016 election. But unlike many other tech leaders, he has decided to work very closely with Trump in the White House.\u000a\u000a18. Eric Jackson \u2014 Jackson, a former PayPal executive, is also the co-founder of CapLinked, a group focused on linking tech companies and investors. He has been active in conservative causes for decades and frequently appears as a conservative commentator on radio and TV.\u000a\u000a19. Keith Rabois \u2014 A technology entrepreneur, executive, and investor, Rabois is known for his early-stage startup investments and his executive roles at PayPal, LinkedIn, Slide, and Square. In response to Thiel\u2019s convention speech last year, he tweeted that the \u201ctech industry is primarily out of touch by being too far to the Left.\u201d\u000a\u000a20. Andrew Torba \u2014 According to TechCrunch, Torba \u201cdescribed himself as a lifelong \u2018conservative Republican Christian,\u2019\u201d but is also the co-founder and CEO of Automate Ads and more famously the founder and CEO of Gab, a free speech-minded alternative to Twitter.\u000a\u000a21. Scott Slinker \u2014 The CEO of analytics startup Paradata is a staunch supporter of Trump. Slinker told CNBC that the president is \u201cracist for the American employee . . . He wants to get America back to work, and I think that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d Upon reflection, he stuck by his controversial words. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t edit that out,\u201d he told the \u201cRaw Story\u201d host.\u000a\u000a22. Dr. Susan Amat \u2014 A self-described serial entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in strategic entrepreneurship, Amat is the CEO and founder of Venture Hive, which finances startups and other tech companies. She served as an adviser to Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000a23. John Rampton \u2014 The CEO of Due, a financial advice platform for small-business owners, backed Trump, he told USA Today, because \u201cI like when business people run for president.\u201d He's donated to the Trump campaign because Trump "speaks his mind and doesn't care what people think. That is how you effect change." It's not the most popular stance in the valley where, Rampton told the newspaper, "once a day, I'm asked to f*** myself for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap."\u000a\u000a24. Tim Draper \u2014 The Bitcoin CEO is not overtly partisan and once said he doesn\u2019t \u201cfit into either political party.\u201d Nonetheless, he has been a registered Republican who financed California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other GOP candidates and has spoken out strongly against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. In 2000, he spent $20 million of his own money on a failed effort to support school vouchers.\u000a\u000a25. Tom Siebel \u2014 From 2009 to 2014, the Siebel Systems founder gave almost $350,000 to political candidates. Most of this largesse went to independents, but a big chunk went to GOP candidates and none went to Democrats. He also planned to host a fundraiser for Sarah Palin at his Woodside home in 2008, but the event was canceled.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 2 Warning Signs of Sudden Cardiac Death

aVRep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said Friday she voted against the Hurricane Harvey relief bill because it contained a debt ceiling increase.\u000a\u000a"I was a no vote because we have a debt ceiling increase and a CR [continuing resolution], and we don't get those reforms that we need," Blackburn told Fox News. "I felt like the Harvey and Irma relief, all of these packages should stand alone and not be coupled and have a debt ceiling put on them or a CR put on them. I would have preferred to see these as stand-alone votes."\u000a\u000aBlackburn said she voted for the initial Harvey aid bill before it had a debt ceiling raise tacked onto it.\u000a\u000a"I voted for the initial hurricane relief package, which is what we should be doing," she said. "We put it up by itself, on the board, and call the vote."\u000a\u000aThe House passed the bill Friday morning. It now awaits President Donald Trump's signature.\u000a\u000aTrump struck a deal with Democrats this week to raise the debt ceiling and keep the government funded for three more months in exchange for passing the Harvey aid bill. Some Republicans were stunned by the move, while others applauded Trump's desire to reach across the aisle and be productive.

aVScientists are stepping up the hunt for better diagnostic tests to predict if cancer patients will benefit from costly modern immunotherapy drugs, which are transforming cancer care but remain a hit-and-miss affair.\u000a\u000aResearch presented at Europe's biggest oncology congress in Madrid adds to evidence that patients with an above average number of genetic mutations in their tumors have a better chance of responding to the new treatments, and drugmakers are racing to confirm the idea.\u000a\u000aImmuno-oncology (I-O) drugs such as Merck & Co.'s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo, which help the immune system attack tumors, can have dramatic effects and yet only around 20 to 30 percent of patients show a lasting improvement.\u000a\u000aAnalyzing the number of mutations within a tumor makes sense: the more there are, the more the patient's killer T-cells - whose action is enhanced by I-O medicines - will recognize the cancer as foreign to the body and therefore attack it.\u000a\u000aSuch analysis to measure what is known as tumor mutation burden (TMB) should lead to better targeting of medicines that have a typical list price of near $150,000 a year. It could also mean subgroups of patients with tumors where immunotherapy is not normally considered, like breast cancer, might get them.\u000a\u000aProgress is being made in applying the idea in practice, with Roche - a global leader in diagnostics as well as the top maker of cancer drugs - demonstrating for the first time on Friday that a blood-based test for TMB can accurately measure mutations.\u000a\u000aThe Swiss group, which developed the test with majority-owned Foundation Medicine, presented data linking high TMB to improved results for patients in two lung cancer trials at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress.\u000a\u000aDoctors welcomed the results but said more evidence was still needed.\u000a\u000aRoche is not alone in seeking to use TMB as a new measurable biological signature, or biomarker, with which to personalize I-O treatment.\u000a\u000aBristol-Myers also has a deal with Foundation Medicine and the U.S. drugmaker's head of medical oncology development, Fouad Namouni, sees TMB testing emerging as a powerful new tool.\u000a\u000a"We are moving the needle pretty fast and I am sure in the next few years patients will be tested for TMB and will be treated on the basis of that," he said. "We are looking at TMB in every major study we are doing."\u000a\u000aBLUNT INSTRUMENT\u000a\u000aAt present, the one established way of selecting patients for drugs like Keytruda, Opdivo and Roche's Tecentriq is to test for a protein called PDL-1 in their tumors.\u000a\u000aBut that involves scientists looking at cells through a microscope and making a qualitative assessment based on their judgment. Clinical trials suggest it is a relatively blunt instrument for predicting a patient's response to a given treatment.\u000a\u000aA quantitative blood test is a quicker and simpler option, doing away with the need to take a tissue biopsy, which until now has been the only reliable way to measure TMB levels.\u000a\u000aThomas Buechele, Roche's head of global medical affairs in haematology and oncology, believes this may eventually lead to patients with a high level of mutations needing only one I-O drug while those with lower levels get a combination therapy.\u000a\u000aOncologists in Madrid said prospective clinical trials still needed to prove the tests could accurately predict responses, rather than just correlating to outcomes after the event.\u000a\u000a"It's early days but this is clearly one way to go to address the shortcomings of PD-L1 testing," said Stefan Zimmermann, senior oncologist at Switzerland's HFR Fribourg-Cantonal Hospital.\u000a\u000aWhile a blood-based test would be a boon for convenience and affordability, the genetic detail it provides is inevitably less than with the more costly and time-consuming process of taking a tissue sample and sequencing tumor DNA.\u000a\u000a"It's clear it is a biomarker \u2013 the only question is how good a biomarker is it?" said Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the more researchers learn about the complexities of cancer immunotherapy, the more it becomes apparent that treatment needs to be customized according to the different profiles of individual patients.\u000a\u000aOne sign of that came last May when Keytruda became the first cancer treatment ever to win U.S. approval based on whether a patient's tumor carried a specific genetic glitch, irrespective of its location.\u000a\u000aSolange Peters of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne said an important issue would be establishing that TMB testing didn't miss patients who might benefit.\u000a\u000a"What we don't want is to have a test with a very low negative predictive value and thereby prevent patients getting immunotherapy because the biomarker wasn't good enough."

aVSPECIAL:\u000a\u000aFeeling Down? Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aAntidepressant drugs reportedly do a lot of good. Retired TV talk show host David Letterman said earlier this year that an antidepressant at one point saved his life, The New York Times reported . Still, the use of antidepressants comes with certain side effects and risks.While you probably won\u2019t experience all of these side effects, here are some things to watch if you start taking an antidepressant.People who start using an antidepressant often feel various initial side effects such as a headache, anxiety or upset stomach, with those usually subsiding within three weeks, said Drugs.com . That website recommended those feeling such symptoms talk to their physician before they stop taking their antidepressant.Among major warning signs that the medication isn\u2019t working effectively include the patient\u2019s feeling aggression and anger, having thoughts of suicide, experiencing worsened depression or anxiety or feeling dangerously impulsive, said All About Counseling Nausea can start fairly quickly after you start taking an antidepressant, though it may subside within a month, according to Drugs.com. That website suggested those who experience nausea or vomiting ask their physician or pharmacist if they can use an antacid or Pepto Bismol, or take their medication with food.Drowsiness can be a temporary side effect for someone who has started taking an antidepressant, and may subside after a few weeks, according to Drugs.com. That website recommended such patients ask their physician if they may take their medication before bed. Antidepressants can also cause insomnia, Drugs.com said. It suggested those experiencing that problem ask their physician if they may take their medication in the morning, \u201cor add a low dose of a sedating antidepressant (like trazodone) at bedtime.\u201dVarying factors could be responsible for why people often gain weight when they start taking antidepressants, according to Drugs.com. It said: \u201cWhen your mood improves, you may have a better appetite, and this can lead to unexpected weight gain. In addition, lack of physical activity or water retention can also lead to weight gain.\u201dMany antidepressants commonly bring about sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction or a decreased sex drive, according to Drugs.com. Potential strategies to cope with that include taking drugs to deal with erectile dysfunction or switching to another antidepressant that brings reduced sexual side effects.When women take antidepressants during pregnancy, they increase the risk of problems for their unborn baby, according to WebMd . That website recommended a pregnant woman consult with her physician as she decides whether to begin or continue taking antidepressants. WebMD said, \u201c\u2019It's important to consider your health, the health of your unborn child, and the well-being of your family, including your other children."Certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) can increase the patient's risk for stomach bleeding, \u201cso caution should be advised in patients with a history of ulcers or taking a blood thinner,\u201d said Drugs.com.The antidepressant Bupropion can help reverse sexual dysfunction and re-energize people who feel fatigued but should not be administered to patients who are at risk for seizures, according to Drugs.com.

aVMartin Shkreli may have gone too far posting a $5,000 bounty on Facebook for someone to "grab" hair from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors now say the former pharmaceutical executive once dubbed "the most hated man in America" should be locked up immediately.\u000a\u000aShkreli, who was found guilty by a jury last month of defrauding investors in two hedge funds, has been out on bail awaiting his sentencing hearing. He\u2019s engaged in a "pattern of threats and harassment\u201d and his bail should be revoked, prosecutors told a Brooklyn, New York, federal judge in a filing Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo on HRC\u2019s book tour, try to grab a hair from her," Shkreli posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 4. "I must confirm the sequencing I have. Will pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton. Payment after the sequence matches. Good luck patrollers."\u000a\u000aClinton is slated to appear at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Union Square in New York City on Sept. 12, according to the store. A hearing on Shkreli\u2019s bail is set for Sept. 14.\u000a\u000aClick Here to Read More: Shkreli Decries \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 Following His Fraud Conviction\u000a\u000aShkreli, notorious for raising the price of the potentially life-saving drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent, faces as long as 20 years in prison, although he\u2019s likely to serve much less. He was convicted of three of eight charges, including securities fraud. He was acquitted of fraud charges related to allegations that he looted his drug company to pay off his hedge-fund investors.\u000a\u000aProsecutors Jacquelyn Kasulis and Alixandra Smith argued Shkreli not only appears to have violated state and federal laws prohibiting threats against the immediate family members of former presidents, but that he also has a history of harassing specific women. They noted that in January he was banned from Twitter after he invited Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca to be his date for the inauguration of President Donald Trump and later doctored photos of himself with her.\u000a\u000a\u2018However Inappropriate\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cWe take the matter seriously and intend to address the issue responsibly,\u201d Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, said in an email Thursday night. \u201cHowever inappropriate some of Mr Shkreli\u2019s postings may have been, we do not believe that he intended harm and do not believe that he poses a danger to the community.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral hours after Shkreli\u2019s bounty offer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair was reported by the media, he edited the Facebook post, saying it was "satire, meant for humor."\u000a\u000aBut prosecutors said Shkreli\u2019s comments were viewed as a threat by the U.S. Secret Service, which launched an investigation and has since "expended significant additional resources to ensure Secretary Clinton\u2019s protection."\u000a\u000aKasulis and Smith said that the Secret Service has sought to interview Shkreli but he declined, saying on his Facebook page, "I am declining that interview -- schedule is full. I will be peacefully protesting the Hillary Clinton book signing in NYC, chanting \u2018Lock her up.\u2019"\u000a\u000aThe government said that Shkreli, who\u2019s been a long-time critic of Hillary Clinton, has gone beyond merely posting comments on social media. On Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton became physically ill during a memorial service at the World Trade Center site, he traveled to the Manhattan apartment of her daughter Chelsea Clinton, where the former secretary of state was taken to recuperate. Shkreli stood outside the building, heckled her and spent two hours live-streaming while making comments, prosecutors said.\u000a\u000a"Shkreli\u2019s own prior actions, and his influence over others who have previously acted in reliance of his statements, demonstrate why the government views his latest actions with concern," prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aTaxes, Expenses\u000a\u000aIn June, while Shkreli was awaiting trial, Brafman sought to have his bail reduced from $5 million to $3 million to allow him to pay his taxes and legal defense expenses. At the time, prosecutors said the ex-executive had plenty of cash, citing a recent series of postings he\u2019d made on social media.\u000a\u000aThe government said Shkreli told court officials that he was worth $70 million and owns a Picasso, an unreleased Lil Wayne album and one of the original "Enigma" machines, which was used to break German codes during World War II. He also recently promised a Princeton University student $40,000 for solving a mathematical proof, she said.\u000a\u000aIn a May 26 Facebook post, Shkreli offered a $100,000 bounty to find the killer of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, Smith said. In addition, he frittered away $2 million buying an unreleased double album by hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, the prosecutor said.\u000a\u000aShkreli recently put that album up for auction on Ebay, where by Thursday evening, the offer had reached more than $1 million after fierce bidding for the double-CD master recording.\u000a\u000aThe case is U.S. v. Shkreli, 15-cr-0637, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

aVHaving a real military option is what makes diplomacy work, and the United States must boost its ability to intercept intercontinental missiles and other weapons, Rep. Adam Kinzinger said Friday, noting officials are concerned that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may attempt another ICBM test Saturday.\u000a\u000a"We think tomorrow may be a day where they decide to have some new intercontinental ballistic missile because it's one of the thousand holidays in North Korea where they put a unicorn into heaven or something," the Illinois Republican told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" host Bill Hemmer. "Basically what it comes down to, the North Koreans have the technology together and what they need to perfect, which they will at some point, is technology."\u000a\u000aThe U.S., thanks to late President Ronald Reagan, started developing intercept methods in the 1980s and now has a "decent ability to do it," but still needs to have an "incredible military option," said Kinzinger. "Diplomacy doesn't work without a credible military option backing it up. I give a lot of credit to the administration for being clear that that is on the table. The hope is that diplomacy works."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea does not yet have the technology to keep its missiles from losing control and burning up as they come back through the atmosphere, but it does seem to have the ability to develop it, said Kinzinger.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, President Donald Trump commented that "military action would certainly be an option," against North Korea, but added that it would be "great if something else could be worked out," and Kinzinger said that means to him the president understands the threat.\u000a\u000a"It says we have a president that understands, as President Barack Obama told him when they were in his transition to the Oval Office, that this is the challenge of our generation, this is the challenge of the presidency even beyond terrorism," said Kinzinger. "We cannot allow the North Koreans to have its new weapon."\u000a\u000aThere are people taking issue with Trump's language, Kinzinger said, but he believes that for the first time, someone is talking tough and saying the U.S. is willing to use its military to ensure its security and that of its allies.\u000a\u000a"We hope we don't have to, but rest assured we will if we need to," said Kinzinger. That's what makes diplomacy way more likely to happen, because I can see there's an alternative on the table."

aVStephen Bannon, the former White House chief strategist who advocates a tougher U.S. stance toward China, has agreed to speak at an event hosted by a unit of the biggest state-owned Chinese brokerage.\u000a\u000aBannon, who left his White House role three weeks ago after a controversial tenure in Donald Trump\u2019s administration, will address an investor forum in Hong Kong organized by CLSA, an overseas unit of Citic Securities Co.\u000a\u000aThe Sept. 12 talk will focus on \u201cAmerican economic nationalism, the populist revolt and Asia,\u201d according to a CLSA spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aA Bannon representative was unsure whether he\u2019ll receive a speaking fee for the event, which will be his first company-sponsored appearance since leaving the government. He\u2019s unconcerned about CLSA\u2019s connections to the Chinese government, his representative said. The CBS Corp. show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d will broadcast an interview with Bannon on Sunday.\u000a\u000aBannon, who has called for direct confrontation with Beijing over trade, told The American Prospect magazine shortly before his White House departure that the U.S. and China are engaged in an \u201ceconomic war.\u201d He has since returned to his executive chairman role at Breitbart News, which said last month it will accelerate efforts to expand its populist and nationalist message globally.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s the man of the moment, and we believe our clients are interested in what he has to say,\u201d CLSA said in a response to questions from Bloomberg. \u201cHe is current and his opinion influences the markets.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here to read more about Bannon\u2019s time at the White House.\u000a\u000aGiven Bannon\u2019s stance on China, it\u2019s \u201cironic\u201d that he\u2019s participating in an event hosted by a company with ties to the Chinese government, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. Still, Citic Securities is \u201cpretty hands off\u201d when it comes to managing CLSA, Kuijs said. The firm was founded in Hong Kong by two former journalists in 1986 and purchased by Citic Securities in 2013, according to CLSA\u2019s website.\u000a\u000aTies between America and China, the world\u2019s largest economies, have become a growing focus for investors after Trump regularly bashed China for unfair trade practices on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aWhile the relationship appeared to warm after Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping during their first meeting in April, it has become more strained in recent weeks as the countries struggled to find common ground on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Trump, who has linked U.S. trade policy with China\u2019s efforts to restrain Pyongyang, asked his top trade official to investigate Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property last month.\u000a\u000aBannon, 63, wouldn\u2019t be the first controversial figure to address the CLSA forum, which is attended by hundreds of asset managers each year. Edward Snowden spoke via satellite in 2015 and Sarah Palin appeared eight years ago.\u000a\u000aThe event typically features speakers from all walks of life, including government, finance, Hollywood and sports. Past attendees have included George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Beckham. Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and U.S. Olympian Michael Phelps are among the speakers at this year\u2019s event.

aVA tiger in Atlanta that got loose in Henry County early Wednesday has been killed after escaping from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\u000a\u000aPolice received reports about a loose tiger on Interstate 75 Wednesday morning around 6 a.m., according to 11 Alive.\u000a\u000aHenry County officers responded to the reports and located the tiger. They then contacted animal professionals to inform them that the tiger was loose. However, police were forced to intervene after the tiger ran into a nearby residential area.\u000a\u000a"Henry County officers responded, locating the tiger and kept visual sight of it while animal professionals were contacted," police said in a statement. "The tiger began to run toward the Meadow Brook community off of Jodeco Road, to the back of a residence and began to attack a dog."\u000a\u000a"With the tiger in close proximity to a school bus route in a densely populated area, officers made the decision to put the animal down with gunfire fearing that occupants of the home could be in danger as well as others in the area," the statement continued.\u000a\u000aAllison Hegecoth, who works with Noah's Ark Wildlife Santuary, was close to the scene of the incident, but by the time she arrived the tiger was dead.\u000a\u000a"It's terrible," Hegecoth said, according to 11 Alive. "I know some people are angry that the animal was shot, they don't understand why."\u000a\u000aThe owner of the dog, Brittney Speck, said she woke up while the tiger was attacking her dog after hearing loud barking, 11 Alive reported. Despite the attack, Speck said her dog is OK.\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Post, the deceased tiger was a female who went by the name of Suzy.\u000a\u000aSuzy was a circus tiger for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The 6-year-old tiger reportedly escaped from a Feld Entertainment transport truck on its way from Florida to Tennessee after it had stopped in Georgia temporarily.\u000a\u000aThe truck was carrying 13 other tigers as well.\u000a\u000aThe tigers were headed to an airport in Tennessee to be taken back to Germany. The tigers are originally from Great Britain.\u000a\u000aFeld Entertainment spokesman Stephen Payne told the Post it's still unclear as to how Suzy escaped the truck.

aVPresident Donald Trump's deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling until December wasn't a great plan for taxpayers, House Freedom Caucus founder Rep. Jim Jordan said Friday, but then again, the president didn't have many choices.\u000a\u000a"Any time Nancy Pelosi likes something, it's probably not the best deal for the American taxpayers," the Ohio Republican told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" program.\u000a\u000a"Let's be clear here. He didn't have many choices. I learned a long time ago lack of preparation typically leads to poor results. When you don't prepare and you have \u2014 you are left with poor choices, poor options. The president had to do something."\u000a\u000aThe biggest problem was that lawmakers didn't stay in Washington in August to hammer out a debt ceiling plan that addressed the underlying $20 trillion debt burden the nation faces, said Jordan.\u000a\u000a"We took the longest August recess break in a non-election year, the longest break we have taken in over a decade," said Jordan. That's why the House Freedom Caucus called for, back in July, we said stay in August. Let's figure out the debt ceiling. Let's put together a tax reform plan and figure out Obamacare. Instead we went home almost six weeks."\u000a\u000aThere were bills passed in 2017, said Jordan, but there was a great deal of important things that did not get finished, and Americans were disappointed.\u000a\u000a"What does the American people want us to do?" said Jordan. "Build a border wall, cut their taxes, and fix Obamacare.\u000a\u000aFormer White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told CBS News this week that the Republican establishment is trying to "nullify the 2016 election," and Jordan agreed there are many people in Washington who are not on board with what Americans elected Trump and a Republican Congress to do.\u000a\u000a"We have got to overcome that and it starts by actually making some decisions, taking the time to prepare and put together good public policy and then go after the debate, then go have the debate with the American people," said Jordan. "If we had an option out there, we think you should cap spending and take the debt ceiling and raise the debt ceiling, but cut spending. Don't let government ever grow and grow and grow."\u000a\u000aFurther, lawmakers should put together a plan to offer the president to present to the American public, rather than take just taking what Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has offered, said Jordan.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, when asked if he would like to see House Speaker Paul Ryan replaced, Jordan said he just wants Republicans to do what they promised the American people they would do.\u000a\u000a"We make the job way too complicated," said Jordan. "What did the American people elect us to do? Let's do that despite what the establishment wants us to do and the obstacles we face."

aVConservative commentator Laura Ingraham said Friday that Republicans "are finished" unless they make short work of tax reform.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump "wants to be a popular president." Ingraham told Fox News host Sean Hannity. "He's a conservative populist. That means at times, if Republicans don't deliver legislation that he can sign on the critical matters that he campaigned on, he's going to look to move the ball down the field with another set of players."\u000a\u000aTrump recently struck a deal with Democratic leaders, much to the surprise of his party, to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government for three months. He tweeted on Friday that the GOP "must start" working on tax reform.\u000a\u000aRepublicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September.

They are finished. [House Speaker] Paul Ryan came out today and had an extra special spring in his step on tax reform. It's funny what Trump working with the Democrats will do to the Republicans."

aVPutting may seem simple, but it takes more than just a slight tap to sink the ball with expertise. Many golf pros consider putting just as important as driving the ball.\u000a\u000aJust as learning to correctly place your hands or position your body properly for the perfect swing, putting takes equal practice and concentration by determining your movements.\u000a\u000aWorking on power drives and strength certainly contributes to improving your game, but mastering your skills at putting can help you execute crucial shots.\u000a\u000aURGENT: Who's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000aThese are six putting tips that work every time:\u000a\u000a1. Feel the club with both hands \u2014 PGA Tour champion Brandt Snedeker advises placing the grip over the lifeline in your left palm, then setting the left thumb on top of the handle while squeezing the pinkie, ring, and middle fingers around the grip, according to Golf.com. Set the grip against the lifeline in the right palm, press the right thumb against the top of the handle, and wrap the four fingers around the grip.\u000a\u000a2. Place your eyes over the ball \u2014 Bending from the hips and not the waist, keep your eyes directly over the ball to make sure you don\u2019t stand too close or far away from the ball. The eyes stay aligned with the target line for a better aim.\u000a\u000a3. Level your weight \u2014 Your putts might be off because of the body\u2019s natural tendency to lean on the slope, noted swingOIL. Take notice of how your body is tilting for a more even putt. Proper heel wedges in golf shoes also help to avoid tilting.\u000a\u000aPOLL: Tiger or Jack? Who Is The Greatest Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a4. Take time to walk the line \u2014 When you walk along the line of sight, it gives you a better view of the landscape before you putt. This is important because you might notice breaks or illusions from a different angle, and you can avoid them when you putt.\u000a\u000a5. Watch the ball \u2014 Your putting will improve if you don\u2019t keep your head down through the stroke and, instead, watch the ball to get a feel for speed, distance, and direction, wrote Bobby Hinds for Golf Tips magazine. You\u2019ll see how the ball rolls and be able to make adjustments in your aim or stroke to improve your putting.\u000a\u000a6. Practice wherever you are \u2014 Get your putting down just right by focusing on it during practice rounds. Some golfers might practice putting in the middle of a game. Because putting is just as important to the game as anything else, try putting drills to master skills as a putter.\u000a\u000aVOTE: Who Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

I think the coordination between the state, local, and federal governments are all there."\u000a\u000aThere are also changes between the current situation and that following Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans, said Nelson, because the "U.S. military and the Louisiana National Guard were on separate pages."\u000a\u000a"I think that has been taken care of now with a coordinator between the guard as well as the U.S. military," said Nelson. "There seems to be the coordination in all the emergency operation centers which I've been over several, and I think Florida is prepared."\u000a\u000aHowever, he warned with Irma, "When you get 155 mile-an-hour winds, nobody is going to be prepared for that kind of destruction."\u000a\u000aNelson was Florida's insurance commissioner when Andrew hit in mid-August, 1992, causing insurance rates to climb not only in that state but nationwide, and he said Irma will also "definitely have an effect" on Americans' insurance rates.\u000a\u000a"The good news is that in Andrew 25 years ago, there was no insurance backup, or in other words, a real insurance fund," said Nelson. "As a result of Andrew when insurance companies went bust, when they fled the state, when the two big ones State Farm and Allstate were shedding policies right and left, there was such massive insurance losses that the entire state of Florida was paralyzed for homeowner's insurance."\u000a\u000aNow, a reinsurance fund is in place through the Florida Catastrophic Hurricane Fund, which has billions of dollars in reserves to keep the insurance companies going and from running out of money.\u000a\u000a"It's much better, but your point with Texas and now Florida, FEMA is really stretched in all of it resources," the senator said. "They've actually had to pull people out of Texas and preposition them for Florida, same with supplies. So whatever has improved since Andrew 25 years ago, we're really going to get a strain this time."\u000a\u000aA new set of building codes also have come into play since Andrew, said Nelson.\u000a\u000a"That was one of the biggest lessons learned from 25 years ago," he said. "I'll never forget being in a helicopter over ground zero, which was downtown Homestead, Florida. I saw only two buildings left. One was the bank building, and the other one was an old Florida cracker house which had been built back in the 20s to withstand the winds. Everything, I mean everything, was leveled. It was because there were no building codes."

aVJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israel's attorney general has taken a step toward indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife for alleged misuse of public funds.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Avichai Mandleblit announced Friday he is considering charging Sara Netanyahu with graft, fraud and breach of trust for alleged overspending of public funds on private meals at the prime minister's official residence.\u000a\u000aFriday's announcement is the procedural first step ahead of leveling formal charges against Sara Netanyahu.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Ministry said in a statement that she will have the opportunity to plead her case at a hearing before charges are filed.\u000a\u000aAn indictment of Sara Netanyahu would not pose a direct threat to Netanyahu. But it is an embarrassing blow to the prime minister, who is facing a series of criminal investigations into his personal and financial dealings.

aVBank of England rate setters won't shock markets with any policy moves when they meet next week as a struggling economy and Brexit fears offset any concerns over inflation sailing well above target.\u000a\u000aBritain's economy initially withstood the shock of last year's decision to quit the European Union but slowed sharply in early 2017 and is expected to grow by just 0.3 percent this quarter, half the rate of the euro zone.\u000a\u000aThat poses a challenge for the central bank as, rather than targeting growth, its main remit is to keep inflation -- currently running at 2.6 percent -- at 2 percent.\u000a\u000a"We expect the Bank of England to leave monetary policy unchanged, given the subdued growth story and ongoing Brexit uncertainty," said James Knightley at ING.\u000a\u000a"Nonetheless, there are going to be members who continue to vote for a rate hike, given that consumer price inflation is likely to move higher once again."\u000a\u000aAt the last meeting two members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase rock-bottom interest rates, but none of their seven colleagues are expected to join them on Thursday in calling for higher borrowing costs.\u000a\u000a"Our own view is that rates won't rise this year or next. But that doesn't mean the rollercoaster ride for expectations is over," said Liz Martins at HSBC.\u000a\u000a"An unexpectedly hawkish tilt from the MPC in September could mean a kneejerk reaction which pushes sterling and rates higher -- if only temporarily."\u000a\u000aThe risk of a "bumpy Brexit" does not mean the Bank should keep interest rates at their record low, MPC member Michael Saunders said last week, as the central bank risked being rushed into sharper rate hikes in future, potentially hurting growth.\u000a\u000aInflation broke through target earlier this year, largely because sterling's plunge in value since Britons voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 has pushed up import prices.\u000a\u000aPolicymakers at the European Central Bank are facing the opposite problem -- they are struggling to get inflation up to their 2 percent target ceiling as a strengthening euro has kept price rises in check.\u000a\u000aThey left their own ultra-easy monetary policy alone on Thursday but will decide next month how to proceed with the Bank's massive stimulus programme in 2018.\u000a\u000aECB President Mario Draghi said the euro's exchange rate is "very important" and needs careful monitoring.\u000a\u000aHis cautious comments raise the chances the ECB will opt to phase out its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying scheme only very slowly next year, despite solid economic growth.\u000a\u000a"The current economic conditions warrant a slightly less accommodative monetary policy in the near future, provided the euro or any other disturbing element do not derail the euro zone's recovery," said Louis Harreau at Credit Agricole.\u000a\u000aIn the United States, the Federal Reserve has already started on a tightening cycle but appears to be getting more dovish in the face of weak economic data.\u000a\u000aRecent comments from Fed policymakers show a split on the outlook for inflation and how that will play out for future interest rate increases so August price data due on Thursday should give markets more of a steer.\u000a\u000aThe Swiss National Bank also meets on Thursday but is unlikely to move, with political tensions and low inflation keeping their hands tied.\u000a\u000aSwitzerland's franc is susceptible to appreciation during periods of increased geopolitical tension and the potential for conflict in the Korean peninsula will weigh on minds.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has stepped up the development of weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions and tested several missiles this year, including one that flew over Japan. Pyongyang conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test on Sept. 3.\u000a\u000aA survey on Friday showed most South Koreans doubt North Korea will start a war, although President Donald Trump again highlighted the possibility of a U.S. military response.

aVThe Trump administration said Friday it won't charge a key IRS figure in the mistreatment of conservative political groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections.\u000a\u000aIn a letter to members of Congress, the Justice Department said that "reopening the criminal investigation would not be appropriate based on the available evidence."\u000a\u000aRepublican leaders on the House Ways and Means Committee had hoped the Justice Department would reopen its case against ex-IRS official Lois Lerner now that Republican Donald Trump is in the White House and Attorney General Jeff Sessions runs the department.\u000a\u000aThey were disappointed in the department's response. "This is a terrible decision," said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman. "It sends the message that the same legal, ethical, and constitutional standards we all live by do not apply to Washington political appointees."\u000a\u000aLerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt groups. An inspector general's report in 2013 found that the IRS had singled out conservative and tea party groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. Many had their applications delayed for months and years. Some were asked improper questions about their donors and even their religious practices.\u000a\u000aMuch of the agency's leadership, including Lerner, resigned or retired over the scandal.\u000a\u000aBrady said appointees "will now have the green light to target Americans for their political beliefs and mislead investigators without ever being held accountable for their lawlessness."\u000a\u000aLerner and her attorney have long maintained she did nothing wrong.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the Ways and Means Committee voted to refer Lerner to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. Republicans on the committee said she may have violated the constitutional rights of conservative groups, misled investigators and risked exposing confidential taxpayer information.\u000a\u000aUnder President Barack Obama, the Justice Department announced in 2015 that no one at the IRS would be prosecuted in the scandal, saying investigators had "found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution."\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Brady asked the department to reopen the case.\u000a\u000a"I have the utmost respect for Attorney General Sessions, but I'm troubled by his department's lack of action to fully respond to our request and deliver accountability," Brady said.

aVA strong solar flare on Wednesday, the biggest in 12 years, caused hour-long radio blackouts in some places on Earth and may still damage satellites and power systems in the next two days.\u000a\u000aThe Space Weather Prediction Center said the sun emitted two high-intensity solar flares, the second one the most intense since 2005, London's Daily Mail reported on Thursday. It was strong enough to scramble radio communications on the side of the Earth facing the sun, along with low-frequency communications used in navigation.\u000a\u000aNASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly, captured images of both events.\u000a\u000aNASA said both flares erupted from an active sun region labeled AR 2673, which also produced a mid-level solar flare on Monday. The second flare was the sun's largest flare so far in the current solar cycle.\u000a\u000aSpace.com said the sun can release a cloud of energetic plasma from its body in an event called a coronal mass ejection, CME. According to the Daily Mail, experts said the coronal mass ejection could reach Earth within the next two days, and that this could damage satellites, communication and power systems.\u000a\u000a"(The flare) was accompanied by radio emissions that suggest there's a potential for a CME," Space Weather Prediction Center scientist Rob Steenburgh told Space.com. "However, we have to wait until we get some coronagraph imagery that would capture that event for a definitive answer."\u000a\u000aIf the CME reached Earth, it could also more "spectacular auroras," Space.com said.\u000a\u000aThe solar surge caught some experts off guard because the sun was approaching its solar minimum, its lowest level of activity in its 11-year cycle.\u000a\u000a"We are heading toward solar minimum, but the interesting thing about that is you can still have events, they're just not as frequent," Steenburgh said, per Space.com. "We're not having X-flares every day for a week, for instance \u2014 the activity is less frequent, but no less potentially strong. These kind of events are just part of living with a star."

aVVeterans may deal with difficulties when returning home. The problems facing disabled vets can complicate their transitioning process, but these men and women have many resources to turn to that offer assistance and even financial help.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a good place to find available services for vets who have a disability because of their military service. Vets can learn about the eligibility requirements and what types of benefits they can receive.\u000a\u000aVets can also contact the various organizations that offer vital services.\u000a\u000aHere are six resources for disabled veterans:\u000a\u000a1. Transportation \u2014 Vans operated by the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) take injured and ill veterans to VA medical facilities for free. The program is available around the country. DAV and the Ford Motor Company purchased more than 3,000 vehicles and donated them to the VA for free transportation to vets.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a2. Education on wheels \u2014 The DAV has a mobile service offices (MSO) program that travels to small towns and rural communities to counsel and educate vets and their families on available benefits and services. It helps with claims and bringing benefits to disabled veterans.\u000a\u000a3. Housing assistance \u2014 Many veterans experience homelessness because of their disabilities. The VA works with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the HUD-VASH program that provides rental assistance for vets eligible for VA healthcare services.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a4. Next Step Service Dogs \u2014 NSSD is a nonprofit organization that provides trained service dogs to vets with invisible disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. There is an application fee, but training programs for the dogs are at no charge for vets. The service dogs offer vets help, balance support, safety, and even things such as turning on lights.\u000a\u000a5. Wings for Warriors \u2014 The organization has resources for wounded vets to help them through the recovery process. Vets can find guidance and counseling to help secure healthcare and financial benefits. Family members may receive financial assistance to travel to medical facilities to visit their loved ones.\u000a\u000a6. Veterans Crisis Line \u2014 Disabled veterans going through emotional stress can talk on the phone or chat online with trained people, many of them vets themselves. They help vets and their families take on the challenges veterans face. There are even text-messaging services.\u000a\u000aImportant: Gingrich and Reagan Video Goes Viral. See It Now

aVU.S. Sen. Bob Menendez is a longtime friend of the Florida eye doctor with whom he's on trial, and the government's fraud and bribery case against them is built on assumptions, the doctor's attorney said Thursday in his opening statement.\u000a\u000aThe government alleges trips paid for by Salomon Melgen, and campaign contributions he made to Menendez, were to get the New Jersey Democrat to use his influence to help Melgen's business interests.\u000a\u000aBut attorney Kirk Ogrosky said that Melgen and Menendez spent time frequently at Melgen's homes in Florida and the Dominican Republic and that Menendez often paid for his own flights to visit Melgen with family members.\u000a\u000a"That's a heck of a bribe," he told jurors. "'I'll bribe you, pay your own way.' That's baloney."\u000a\u000aOgrosky also said Melgen didn't get any benefit from Menendez's alleged attempts to pressure government officials on his behalf.\u000a\u000aMenendez's attorney Abbe Lowell said Wednesday in his opening statement that the two men have been friends since the early 1990s and that "acting out of friendship is not a crime."\u000a\u000aHow a jury tackles the question of "why?" and not "what?" could hold the key to the trial.\u000a\u000aMenendez can't be found guilty, Lowell said, unless jurors conclude that his intent was corrupt and that there was a bribery arrangement. The evidence won't show that, he said.\u000a\u000a"This case isn't about what happened, it's about why it happened," Lowell said.\u000a\u000aThe government painted a different picture in its opening statement. Justice Department attorney Peter Koski described Menendez pressuring government officials to help Melgen with securing visas for his foreign girlfriends and intervening in a lucrative port security contract in the Dominican Republic and a multimillion-dollar Medicare dispute.\u000a\u000aAmong the gifts prosecutors say Melgen gave Menendez were flights on Melgen's private jet, vacations at Melgen's private villa in the Dominican Republic frequented by celebrities like Beyonce and Jay Z, and a three-night stay at a luxury Paris hotel valued at nearly $5,000. Melgen also contributed more than $700,000 to Menendez's legal defense fund and to entities that supported Menendez's campaigns.\u000a\u000a"He went to bat when Dr. Melgen asked, and Dr. Melgen asked frequently," Koski said. "There's no friendship exception to bribery. There's no friendship exception to breaking the law."\u000a\u000aMenendez and Melgen were indicted in 2015 and face multiple fraud and bribery charges in a case that could threaten Menendez's political career and potentially alter the makeup of a deeply divided U.S. Senate if he's convicted.\u000a\u000aIf he is expelled or steps down before Gov. Chris Christie leaves office Jan. 16, the Republican would pick Menendez's successor. A Democrat has a large polling and financial advantage in November's election to replace Christie.\u000a\u000aMenendez said before entering the courthouse on Wednesday: "Not once have I dishonored my public office."\u000a\u000aMenendez has kept up a busy public appearance schedule while under indictment, and that didn't change Wednesday. After court adjourned, Menendez attended a rally of about 100 people outside a federal immigration building next to the courthouse to protest President Donald Trump's decision to end deportation protection for young immigrants living in the country illegally.\u000a\u000a"We can keep the dream alive," he told the crowd through a megaphone. "You are not alone."

Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aVOTE NOW:\u000a\u000aDo You Support Prayer in Public Schools?\u000a\u000aWearing your faith on your sleeve right next to your team number might surprise sports fans when it comes to professional athletes and coaches.Especially today, when many sports stars' personal lives and antics are splashed across front pages around the world. From their legal and professional troubles \u2014 domestic violence, steroid use, or gambling \u2014 to their over-the-top consumerist lifestyles complete with high-priced luxury vehicles and plenty of bling, the public is privy to every detail.Because of that, we often don't hear about those athletes that make religion their focus. Many of America's top professional sports figures rank God as No. 1 in their lives, and they're not afraid to show their dedication and religious beliefs both on and off the field.Here, Newsmax has assembled a list of the top 50 athletes and coaches who have deep religious faiths and live out their religions as the major light of their lives.\u2014 The Heisman Trophy winner who went on to quarterback for the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, and New England Patriots made it a practice to kneel in prayer before games, so much so that it sparked a new trend \u2014 "Tebowing." But Tebow's deep Christian faith goes well beyond that, from his preaching and supporting Evangelists in the Philippines to maintaining his virginity until marriage. "I still honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, because at the end of the day, that's what's important, win or lose," he has said. "We need to get back to one nation under God and be role models for kids."\u2014 The USA World Cup soccer team captain and Texan is a devout Roman Catholic, who has said, "My faith in Christ is what gives me confidence for the future. I know that through both good times and bad, He is faithful and will watch over me."\u2014 The five-time Major League Baseball All-Star and Texas Rangers outfielder came clean about his struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol in his autobiography "Beyond Belief," and said he credits God for saving his life and career. "It's a God thing," he says.\u2014 The former Dallas Cowboys linebacker turned to God after serious injuries threatened his career. In a video for non-profit group "I Am Second," he said: "God just had a different plan. He blessed me to be the comeback player of the year in the NFL. You have to realize that there is a God and he does show up and do miracles. My faith in Jesus is everything. It is my life."\u2014 The mixed martial arts champion briefly turned to God at the age of 20 after a neck injury nearly halted his career in 2004, but he later backslid. After his sister was kidnapped in Brazil, raped, and murdered, he said, "My heart was hard and getting bitter. I wanted a solution to my pain. I started praying. God spoke to my heart. That was my biggest touch with a true relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Now I have a great family and a great relationship with God."\u2014 The former Brigham Young University star and player for the Sacramento Kings, the Chicago Bulls, the New Orleans Pelicans, and the Westchester Knicks is very open about his Mormon faith. He married his wife, Whitney, in a "sealing" ceremony at the LDS Temple in Denver and has said, "I definitely have grown closer to the Lord since I\u2019ve been in the NBA. I'm not doing all this to put on a show. I\u2019m doing it because I truly believe in the church and believe in the gospel and this is how I want to live my life."\u2014 The top women's tennis professionals and sisters are well known to be devout Jehovah's Witnesses. They were home-schooled by their equally devout mother and do not vote in elections, as their faith teaches them to remain neutral in politics.\u2014 The quarterback of the San Diego Chargers is a devout Roman Catholic and once told Life Teen, "Appreciate the faith. Appreciate what we have and what a great gift the sacraments are. If you're going to be a Catholic man, be it all the way." He often speaks to youth groups about abstaining from sex until marriage, as he did.\u2014 The Major League Baseball player has a Catholic mother and a Jewish father. The second baseman for the Detroit Tigers, Kinsler is a prominent member of the Jewish community and won the Jim Sundberg Community Achievement Award in 2008.\u2014 The San Francisco Giants pitcher, a Cy Young Award winner, has been a devout Christian since childhood. "I knew enough to understand I wanted to be saved and wanted Jesus to be Lord of my life," he once said.\u2014 The Ukrainian-born welterweight boxer is an orthodox Jew who will not fight on the Sabbath or Jewish holidays, keeps kosher, and even enters the ring to the strains of Yiddish rap music. "I have a personal relationship with God that I won\u2019t compromise," he has said.\u2014 The boxing champ was raised Catholic, but has been very public about his conversion to Evangelical Christianity. He credits his beliefs for turning him away from adultery, drinking, and gambling when he was spinning out of control.\u2014 The retired NFL coach is a devoutly religious Evangelical who once reportedly considered leaving football for a prison ministry . He has also supported the Indiana Family Institute, which opposes gay marriage.\u2014 The retired NBA player born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a devout Baptist and has devoted much of his life to humanitarian work with religious groups in his homeland.\u2014 The Ladies Professional Golf Association champ has stated publicly that her Jewish faith plays an important role in her career and life.\u2014 The current head coach of the Oakland Raiders NFL Team is a "cradle Catholic" who heads the Jack Del Rio Foundation to help underprivileged children. Jack's wife Linda serves as executive consultant for Varsity Catholic, part of the Catholic group FOCUS, or Fellowship of Catholic University Students. In 2014, she spoke at the Pontifical Council for Culture Conference in Rome. A former NFL linebacker, Del Rio received the Steinberg DeNicola Humanitarian Award, and has said, "I take pride in being a strong Catholic."\u2014 The superstar athlete turned to God after he found his wealth and fame did not bring him happiness. Today, he mentors young people at the Boys & Girls Club of America and says that when he was saved, "It was just a complete and total transformation that began to work inside of me.\u201d\u2014 The retired NBA player, born in Lagos, Nigeria, is a devout Muslim who, after retirement, moved to Jordan with his family to study his Muslim faith.\u2014 The legendary Dodgers pitcher takes his Jewish religion very seriously, so much so that he refused to play in a 1965 World Series game because it fell on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur\u2014 They called the Green Bay Packer the "Minister of Defense" when he played, largely because he is an ordained Evangelical minister. He often praised God during post-game interviews, and said, "God allowed me to use this game as a platform to proclaim the name of Jesus. I know some people don't like what I say sometimes, but God has called me to preach a message and I have to preach the message."\u2014 The heavyweight champ was known for non-stop aggression and beat downs on the football field and professional wrestling mat but, in his personal life, Goldberg takes his Jewish heritage and religion very seriously. He has called it an "honor" to represent the Jewish people in professional wrestling and football and says the "most important thing in life" is religion. He is a leading advocate for animal welfare and spokesman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\u2014 The NFL Hall of Fame member and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback comes by his Mormon faith righteously \u2014 he's the great-great-great-grandson of Mormon founder Brigham Young . He has said that during the tough times in his life, "I have always found a sense of home through my Savior Jesus Christ and the calming influence of the Holy Spirit."\u2014 The retired NFL coach and NASCAR team owner once spoke at the 2008 Republican Convention in support of Sen. John McCain and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, saying their election would bring about a "spiritual awakening" in America. He has authored the "Game Plan for Life NIV Bible" and "Game Plan For Life: Chalk Talks," a book of devotionals.\u2014 The retired NBA star's faith is so strong that he insists he was a virgin throughout his basketball career, despite stories about his teammates sending willing groupie to his hotel room. He now runs the A.C. Green Youth Foundation, which promotes abstinence until marriage.\u2014 The retired NFL quarterback and his wife Brenda both are devout Evangelicals, and Warner famously thanked Jesus when his team, the St. Louis Rams, won the Super Bowl and he was named most valuable player. Warner's foundation, First Things First, notes on its web page that it is "dedicated to impacting lives by promoting Christian values." He believes God healed him from a concussion in 2000.\u2014 The retired boxing legend controversially and very publicly changed his name from Cassius Clay and embraced Islam as a black Muslim in the 1960s, and later converted to more mainstream Sunni Islam. In 2005, he reportedly turned to Sufism.\u2014 The retired New York Yankees pitcher had his glove inscribed with Philippians 4:13 : "I can do all this through Christ who gives me strength." He established a church in New Rochelle, Refugio de Esperanza, where his wife, Clara, preaches.\u2014 The track and field superstar, who holds multiple Olympic gold medals, is the daughter of a preacher. "My faith inspires me so much. It is the very reason that I run. I feel that my running is completely a gift from God and it is my responsibility to use it to glorify him," she has said.\u2014 The top Olympic hurdler and bobsledder is a devout Christian who reads the Bible and plays Christian music before competition. She faced some public backlash for criticizing the book "Fifty Shades of Gray" for its sexual content and has said she intends to remain a virgin until marriage.\u2014 The retired Red Sox pitcher is also a committed and outspoken Evangelical who says he was led to Christianity during his wife's battle with skin cancer.\u2014 The New York Knicks and Miami Heat basketball star feels very strongly about his Jewish religion. He has a Star of David tattoo near his left thumb and has traveled to Israel to better understand his adopted culture , yet he still claims Jesus as the Messiah.\u2014 The former defensive end for the New York Jets spent 11 months in prison for domestic violence and drug possession, and says that, upon his release in 2001, he underwent a religious conversion to Christianity. He has since witnessed on religious shows like "The 700 Club."\u2014 The Denver Broncos quarterback says in his autobiography that he became a Christian at the age of 13 and, while he doesn't publicly discuss his religion, he has said that doesn't make him "any less a Christian" than more publicly demonstrative players.\u2014 The Seattle Seahawks quarterback says he became a Christian at the age of 14 when Jesus appeared to him in a dream. He has said, "I'm just grateful that God has given me the opportunity to play the great game of football. I'm so grateful."\u2014 The basketball great is Muslim, like his stepfather, and he has expressed an interest in taking the required Islamic pilgrimage known as the Hajj , to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, allowed only for Muslims. However, he also has stated, "I'm Muslim, I'm Jewish, I'm Buddhist , I'm everybody 'cause I'm a people person." Either way, he's a religious athlete.\u2014 The former heavyweight boxing champion is a practicing Muslim, who has said, "Allah doesn't need me; I need Allah." He converted while in prison.\u2014 The Olympic marathon runner is a committed Christian with strong beliefs, who said in 2010, "I believe that the Bible is the best sports psychology book out there and that Jesus would have been an amazing athlete."\u2014 The former New York Mets catcher, a Roman Catholic, has said, "I truly believe my whole professional career has been a blessing from God." He appeared in "Champions of Faith," a documentary on the intersection between religious faith and sports.\u2014 The former NBA basketball star, known as Lew Alcindor in his pre-religious days, is a dedicated Muslim who has said that Islam "gave me a moral anchor; it enabled me to not be materialistic; it enabled me to see more what was important in the world."\u2014 The Milwaukee Bucks basketball star is Mormon and very active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He attended LDS Seminary, is an LDS priest, and has performed baptisms.\u2014 When the golfing legend's life was falling apart after he was exposed as a serial adulterer, he repeatedly invoked his Buddhist faith and said, "I was raised a Buddhist and I actively practiced my faith from childhood until I drifted away from it in recent years."\u2014 The retired MLB player converted to Mormonism in 1989 and insists that it improved his life. The former Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman has supported those opposed to same-sex marriage in the past.\u2014 The former New York Jets running back, a devout Christian, took the number 28 as his jersey number when playing because of the Biblical passage Deuteronomy 28, which speaks about the benefits of obedience to God.\u2014 The Team USA goalie was diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome at age 11, and his grandmother led him to God as a source of strength.

aVMartin Shkreli may have gone too far posting a $5,000 bounty on Facebook for someone to "grab" hair from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors now say the former pharmaceutical executive once dubbed "the most hated man in America" should be locked up immediately.\u000a\u000aShkreli, who was found guilty by a jury last month of defrauding investors in two hedge funds, has been out on bail awaiting his sentencing hearing. He\u2019s engaged in a "pattern of threats and harassment\u201d and his bail should be revoked, prosecutors told a Brooklyn, New York, federal judge in a filing Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo on HRC\u2019s book tour, try to grab a hair from her," Shkreli posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 4. "I must confirm the sequencing I have. Will pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton. Payment after the sequence matches. Good luck patrollers."\u000a\u000aClinton is slated to appear at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Union Square in New York City on Sept. 12, according to the store. A hearing on Shkreli\u2019s bail is set for Sept. 14.\u000a\u000aClick Here to Read More: Shkreli Decries \u2018Witch Hunt\u2019 Following His Fraud Conviction\u000a\u000aShkreli, notorious for raising the price of the potentially life-saving drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent, faces as long as 20 years in prison, although he\u2019s likely to serve much less. He was convicted of three of eight charges, including securities fraud. He was acquitted of fraud charges related to allegations that he looted his drug company to pay off his hedge-fund investors.\u000a\u000aProsecutors Jacquelyn Kasulis and Alixandra Smith argued Shkreli not only appears to have violated state and federal laws prohibiting threats against the immediate family members of former presidents, but that he also has a history of harassing specific women. They noted that in January he was banned from Twitter after he invited Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca to be his date for the inauguration of President Donald Trump and later doctored photos of himself with her.\u000a\u000a\u2018However Inappropriate\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cWe take the matter seriously and intend to address the issue responsibly,\u201d Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, said in an email Thursday night. \u201cHowever inappropriate some of Mr Shkreli\u2019s postings may have been, we do not believe that he intended harm and do not believe that he poses a danger to the community.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral hours after Shkreli\u2019s bounty offer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair was reported by the media, he edited the Facebook post, saying it was "satire, meant for humor."\u000a\u000aBut prosecutors said Shkreli\u2019s comments were viewed as a threat by the U.S. Secret Service, which launched an investigation and has since "expended significant additional resources to ensure Secretary Clinton\u2019s protection."\u000a\u000aKasulis and Smith said that the Secret Service has sought to interview Shkreli but he declined, saying on his Facebook page, "I am declining that interview -- schedule is full. I will be peacefully protesting the Hillary Clinton book signing in NYC, chanting \u2018Lock her up.\u2019"\u000a\u000aThe government said that Shkreli, who\u2019s been a long-time critic of Hillary Clinton, has gone beyond merely posting comments on social media. On Sept. 11, 2016, when Clinton became physically ill during a memorial service at the World Trade Center site, he traveled to the Manhattan apartment of her daughter Chelsea Clinton, where the former secretary of state was taken to recuperate. Shkreli stood outside the building, heckled her and spent two hours live-streaming while making comments, prosecutors said.\u000a\u000a"Shkreli\u2019s own prior actions, and his influence over others who have previously acted in reliance of his statements, demonstrate why the government views his latest actions with concern," prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aTaxes, Expenses\u000a\u000aIn June, while Shkreli was awaiting trial, Brafman sought to have his bail reduced from $5 million to $3 million to allow him to pay his taxes and legal defense expenses. At the time, prosecutors said the ex-executive had plenty of cash, citing a recent series of postings he\u2019d made on social media.\u000a\u000aThe government said Shkreli told court officials that he was worth $70 million and owns a Picasso, an unreleased Lil Wayne album and one of the original "Enigma" machines, which was used to break German codes during World War II. He also recently promised a Princeton University student $40,000 for solving a mathematical proof, she said.\u000a\u000aIn a May 26 Facebook post, Shkreli offered a $100,000 bounty to find the killer of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, Smith said. In addition, he frittered away $2 million buying an unreleased double album by hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, the prosecutor said.\u000a\u000aShkreli recently put that album up for auction on Ebay, where by Thursday evening, the offer had reached more than $1 million after fierce bidding for the double-CD master recording.\u000a\u000aThe case is U.S. v. Shkreli, 15-cr-0637, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate was ordered evacuated along with the rest of the exclusive Town of Palm Beach as Hurricane Irma threatened South Florida with catastrophic winds, Bloomberg reported.\u000a\u000aAuthorities on the barrier island that\u2019s home to Trump\u2019s Winter White House ordered a mandatory evacuation Thursday, urging residents to get out of the town by 5 p.m. Friday, according to an alert posted on its website.\u000a\u000aThe alert said residents should relocate to a hotel or shelter on the mainland.\u000a\u000aIrma was headed for a direct hit on Florida Sunday, prompting some to estimate it could be the most expensive storm in U.S. history. In Miami-Dade County, the storm also spurred the start of that region\u2019s biggest-ever evacuation effort.

aVC. S. Lewis once wrote about the danger to a young mind posed by biased instruction at school and how it can distort the child\u2019s outlook for all time. "The very power of [textbook writers] depends on the fact that they are dealing with a boy: a boy who thinks he is 'doing' his 'English prep' and has no notion that ethics, theology, and politics are all at stake. It is not a theory they put into his mind, but an assumption, which 10 years hence, its origin forgotten and its presence unconscious, will condition him to take one side in a controversy which he has never recognized as a controversy at all."\u000a\u000aUnfortunately the leftists running schools of education know this, too. They are using pliable teachers to indoctrinate very young children with unscientific and patently false ideology regarding sex.\u000a\u000aOr, as one wag warned parents, "If you send your kids to Caesar for their education, don\u2019t be surprised when they return as Romans."\u000a\u000aParents in Rocklin, California learned this the hard way. A kindergarten teacher decided to introduce 5-year-olds to "transgenderism" by reading two books and holding a demonstration. She read "I am Jazz" and "The Red Crayon" two propaganda volumes designed to brainwash ages 5 through 8 regarding trendy "transgenderism."\u000a\u000aThen the teacher, and I use the word loosely, sprang the show-stopper. She introduced a 5-year-old boy to the class, took him into the bathroom, and had the child re-emerge as a girl.\u000a\u000aThe woman then re-introduced the boy as a girl and said "she" now had a girl\u2019s name and would be called that in the future. This is obscene.\u000a\u000aA 5-year-old can\u2019t enter into a binding contract, can\u2019t drive a car, and wouldn\u2019t be allowed to diagnose himself at the hospital, yet purported medical professionals and educators are willing to let this boy decide he\u2019s actually a girl and begin the "transition" to that sex.\u000a\u000aLifeSiteNews contacted Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, who firmly stated, "All children should be told the truth that sex does not ever change and cannot be changed." Cretella denounced, " . . . institutions that promote transition affirmation" as engaging in "nothing less than institutionalized child abuse" that can inflict "untold psychological damage."\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s just for this misguided boy. But the school\u2019s "lesson" damaged the normal children. Jonathan Keller, of the California Family Council, spoke to parents and learned, "There were several of the little girls that went to their parents and were crying and saying, 'mommy or daddy, am I going to turn into a boy?'" And a boy who hadn\u2019t given "gender" a single thought before is now asking his mother if he can dress as a girl for school.\u000a\u000aParents, naturally, are outraged and the school, equally naturally, is hiding behind a twisted interpretation of the law to justify indoctrinating children without informing parents.\u000a\u000aParents who don\u2019t want their children exposed to the twisted propaganda face a stark choice. They can either home-school their children. Make sure the children spend every Sunday in church and Sunday School, where God\u2019s natural order is taught \u2014 with major potential benefits for the parents, too.\u000a\u000aOr they can take their chances with indoctrination at school.\u000a\u000aMichael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

aVIn the span of just a few short years, Google has gone from a company whose unofficial motto was \u201cDo no evil,\u201d to a company whose new motto should be \u201ccommerce over humanity\u201d whatever the cost. How else can one explain Mountain View\u2019s behind the scenes legal support of Backpage \u2014 the loathsome classified advertising website that for years has allegedly been knowingly facilitating child sex trafficking on its platform.\u000a\u000aAs Nicholas Kristof reports today in the New York Times, Google has been working behind the scenes for several years to support Backpage in legal cases filed by its victims \u2014 some as young as 12 years old \u2014 who had been sold repeatedly for sex on the advertising site. The details are horrific, but for those with a strong stomach, Consumer Watchdog provides all of the gory details of Google\u2019s secret funding of groups supporting Backpage\u2019s legal defense against victims here.\u000a\u000aWhat makes Google\u2019s support of sex trafficking (and really there\u2019s no other way to categorize it) so brazenly hypocritical is that the company and its paid non-profit factotums use the flimsiest of \u201cfree speech\u201d arguments in their defense of Backpage. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, they insist, companies cannot be held liable for the activity of users posting material on or through their platforms, even if those companies know that the users are engaging in illegal activity.\u000a\u000aIn the Backpage cases, victims argued that the company knowingly facilitated underage girls being sold for sex by editing out code words in the advertisements such as \u201cLolita\u201d and \u201cAmber alert\u201d \u2014 words that clearly suggested they were underage \u2014 and then posting the ads anyway. According to these non-profits even then, Backpage should be protected under the so-called online \u201cfree speech\u201d provisions afforded under Section 230.\u000a\u000aIndeed, even as Nicolas Kristof\u2019s takedown of Google and Backpage went to print this morning, the Electronic Frontier Foundation \u2014 one of the organizations funded by Google to support Backpage\u2019s legal defense \u2014 published their own action alert arguing that legislation to hold Backpage accountable would \u201cgreatly weaken Section 230\u2019s protections for online free speech and innovation.\u201d\u000a\u000aGiven Google\u2019s recent censorship crusade, its commitment to \u201cfree speech\u201d is downright laughable. And there is a dynamite equivalency argument here that exposes their hypocrisy in a particularly striking fashion: Does Google believe that Diamond and Silk, two African American Trump supporters who post humorous videos on YouTube are worse than websites that facilitate the trafficking of 12 year old girls? Apparently so, because the company recently demonetized their videos, while moving legal heaven and earth to support Backpage\u2019s free speech claims in court.\u000a\u000aDo they believe that Canadian professor Jordan Peterson\u2019s biblical lecture on YouTube is more offensive than a company that facilitates the online sale of a 13-year old girl whose pimp tattooed his name on her eyelids? Apparently they do: Google recently locked Peterson\u2019s YouTube account without explanation during a biblical lecture series for a \u201cviolation of terms of service.\u201d Only two days later Google\u2019s lobbyists were begging Congress to support online free speech by opposing amendments to Section 230 that would hold facilitators of sex trafficking like Backpage accountable.\u000a\u000aWhat the world is quickly coming to realize is that Google\u2019s billions of users worldwide are captives to its monopoly platform. For all its talk of online freedom, the company no longer views us as customers (in point of fact it never did). No, in Google\u2019s world, we are \u201cproducts\u201d to be exploited and monetized for Google\u2019s benefit. Nowhere is the \u201cproduct\u201d analogy more evident than the company\u2019s indefensible support of Backpage, a company that has allegedly made millions treating helpless underage victims as \u201cproducts\u201d to be used, exploited, and ultimately discarded.\u000a\u000aChristie-Lee McNally is the founder of Free Our Internet.

aVGlobal interest in Kiwi-designed anti-aging antioxidant MitoQ has been encouraging, says MitoQ\u2019s chemist chief executive Greg Macpherson.\u000a\u000aGlobal interest in a Kiwi company's anti-ageing drug is ramping up, with three major clinical trials now under way to test it against a range of ailments.\u000a\u000aMitoquinol mesylate, marketed as MitoQ, is a New Zealand owned and developed super-antioxidant that works by penetrating and optimizing the cellular mitochondria, the so-called batteries within our cells.\u000a\u000aIts backers believe the drug holds the potential to increase lifespan by 10 to 15 per cent, while also improving health. Discovered by the University of Otago's Professor Rob Smith and global mitochondria expert Dr. Mike Murphy, of Cambridge University, the drug was launched as a skincare and supplement range in late 2013, and now sells into more than 100 countries.\u000a\u000aAgeing and its associated health issues and lower energy levels is linked to a decline in mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial dysfunction is now known to be associated with more than 200 diseases or conditions.\u000a\u000aVideo \u2013 The Secret behind Mitochondrial Science Revealed In NZ\u000a\u000a"This includes some of the biggest issues affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease and more," said Greg Macpherson, MitoQ's chief executive and the pharmacist who formulated the antioxidant to penetrate mitochondria.\u000a\u000aAs we age, Macpherson said, the levels of antioxidants in our mitochondria deplete reducing their ability to fend off damage caused by free radicals - highly reactive chemicals that have the potential to harm cells in our bodies.\u000a\u000a"Due to this damage our mitochondria decline in function at a rate of around 10 per cent a decade from our early thirties."\u000a\u000aThe MitoQ formulation worked by flooding the mitochondria with antioxidants, improving the level of energy available to a cell and reducing free radical-associated cell damage.\u000a\u000aGot a Health Challenge You Would Like To Beat? Take this quiz and find the solution\u000a\u000a"By improving their function while reducing cell damage, we can slow down the ageing process keeping all of our organs and body healthier and younger for longer."\u000a\u000aMitoQ is currently the subject of a collaborative study with Callaghan Innovation and the University of Auckland, which assesses its effects on blood sugar and cardiovascular health in 20 New Zealand patients.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in the US, University of Colorado researchers are investigating whether it improves physiological function in middle-aged and older adults, and a University of Delaware team is examining its effects on patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.\u000a\u000aInterest in the technology had been boosted by its recent selection for the US Government's National Institute of Aging's\u000a\u000aInterventions Testing Program.\u000a\u000aEach year, a global selection process by two expert panels invites a small number of compounds for testing, with applicants required to demonstrate "significant potential to delay or decelerate the ageing process and improve general health".\u000a\u000aMacpherson said the commercial benefits that came with being picked for the program were enormous.\u000a\u000aBillions of dollars were being poured into mitochondria-targeted anti-ageing therapeutic agents.\u000a\u000aAdvanced CoQ technology revolutionizes U.S. supplements industry\u000a\u000a"We were just lucky enough to be ahead of the curve - and the other big thing we've got is that what we do is quite broad.\u000a\u000a"Should we get proof of life-extension efficacy, then Mitoq.com has a multibillion-dollar market in the states ... so we will have a huge opportunity."\u000a\u000a- NZ Herald

aVInflammation isn\u2019t just a trendy buzzword in medical circles these days \u2013 it\u2019s a real threat to our health.\u000a\u000aThe inflammatory response is nature\u2019s way to help heal the body from illness or injury but chronic inflammation is at the root of many dreaded diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile inflammation can be healthy and a critical part of the body\u2019s monitoring and repair systems, the real problem occurs when it goes out of balance and starts attacking our own, healthy cells instead of outside invaders,\u201d says Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum, author of \u201cReal Cause, Real Cure,\u201d and a leading authority in the field of inflammation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe has become a major problem, with the inflammation process now contributing not only to heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s and arthritis but also to the rising epidemic of autoimmune disease. \u201c\u000a\u000aTeitelbaum tells Newsmax Health there are eight simple ways to fight inflammation and reduce your risk of these diseases:\u000a\u000aOmega-3 fatty acids. You\u2019ll find these well-known inflation fighters in foods like salmon, flax seed and walnuts. \u201cIncreasing your intake of fish can certainly help, but eating fried fish at McDonald\u2019s makes the problem worse,\u201d says Teitelbaum. \u201cSteam or bake the fish just until done.\u201dIf you choose to use fish oil supplements to get the maximum bang of omega-3 fatty acids for your buck, the expert advises buying vectorized forms of the nutrient. \u201cA small vectorized capsule replaces 8 large capsules of fish oil and there are no fish oil burps because it contains pure omega-3.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpice things up. Curcumin, the bioactive ingredient in the spice turmeric, has lots of science supporting its anti-inflammatory benefits. A 2015 study at the University of Arizona found that curcumin suppressed inflation and prevented tumor formation in mice with colitis-associated colon cancer. \u201cGinger is another good spice to take regularly,\u201d says Chris D\u2019Adamo, director of research at the Center for Integrative Medicine, University if Maryland. \u201cI personally take a capsule called CuraMed every day to beat inflammation because it is the most highly absorbed form,\u201d notes Teitelbaum.\u000a\u000aLose a few pounds. Fat tissue is biologically active and pumps out inflammatory chemicals. If you are overweight, your body may be in a constant state of inflammation, says Catherine Duggan, staff scientist in the Public Health Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\u000a\u000aAvoid cooking foods at high temperatures. According to the experts at the Dana Foundation, a philanthropic organization that supports brain research, these foods create compounds that promote inflammation leading to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In a study published in the medical journal Brain, scientists suggest that inflammation \u201cmay be the real cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease rather than the result of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget the sunshine. \u201cThe deadly advice to avoid sunshine contributes to a dramatic increase in vitamin D deficiency with secondary increased inflammation and cancer risk,\u201d says Teitelbaum. \u201cAvoid sunburn, not sunshine and get your vitamin D levels tested.\u201d\u000a\u000aEliminate sugar and refined carbs. When you consume sugar, your body releases insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps guide sugar molecules into your cells for energy. But when you have an excess of sugar in the body, your body produces excess insulin which causes insulin resistance and inflammation. \u201cThis can lead to accelerated aging, elevated cholesterol, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, osteoporosis and other metabolic syndromes, says Teitelbaum. \u201cSugar substitutes such as Stevia are good alternatives,\u201d he says. Use quinoa instead of grains because it is actually a seed and does not impact your blood sugar as negatively as grains do.\u000a\u000aEat less meat. A 2015 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that a sugar molecule derived from red meat promotes inflammation and cancer progression. Sow swapping your burger for a veggie version once in a while may keep inflammation at bay.\u000a\u000aSocialize. We already know that having a strong social network can keep your brain sharp but new research reveals it can also prevent inflammation. A 2015 study at the University of Chicago found that when people are feeling lonely, levels of norepinephrine, one of the fight or flight hormones, surged. This in turn increased the activity of inflammatory genes.

aVThe home loan process can be daunting \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a first-time home buyer who doesn\u2019t know what to expect.\u000a\u000aFear no more.\u000a\u000aWe took some time to discuss common mistakes that happen throughout the home loan and purchase process, to better prepare you on what not to do.\u000a\u000a1. Starting the home loan process too late\u000a\u000aAn American Financing assistant manager says, \u201cPeople tend to start the process backwards. We always suggest to get financing approved before the home search. This allows us to assess your needs and get you quickly pre-approved. Every now and then, customers call in and say that they want to put an offer in on a home, but are not approved.\u000a\u000aWhile it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to find a home first, there\u2019s only so much we can do in a short time before another buyer \u2014 with pre-approval \u2014 comes in and gets their offer accepted. This is especially true in hot, seller\u2019s markets like Denver. That\u2019s why we always recommend getting approval going 30-60 days prior to shopping.\u201d\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s consider the stumble across your dream home scenario. Say you\u2019re passively searching for homes and surprisingly come across everything you\u2019ve always wanted and more. Talk about a piqued interest level. The price point seems reasonable, so you begin actively researching mortgage lenders to see where you can find the best rate, hopefully in the shortest amount of time. Only now you find out, your spouse\u2019s less than perfect credit, or your rather high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio are limiting the amount to which you qualify. It can be heartbreaking. Why not avoid it altogether and learn upfront what you can afford.\u000a\u000aNot ready or committed to starting the home loan process? No worries. You can start slow by consulting a home affordability calculator.\u000a\u000a2. Focusing too much on the rate\u000a\u000aAn American Financing sales manager says \u201ca lot of home buyers \u2014 and even homeowners looking to refinance \u2014 spend too much time concentrating on the rate without regard to anything else. Don\u2019t be rate driven. In a lot of cases, a lower principal balance with less fees has a lower payment than a lower rate with higher fees.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot to mention the fact that interest rates generally don\u2019t move much. The right property comes along rarely enough that overemphasizing rates can cost you\u2014especially now, where home prices continue to rise around the country.\u000a\u000aTo put things in perspective, rate increases raise monthly mortgage payments but not as much as home buyers expect. A quarter-point change isn\u2019t likely to alter the monthly payment on your mortgage by more than $20-$30, at the most. For example: on a $200,000 home with a 30-year mortgage, the expected increase of a quarter of a point translates to paying roughly $30 more per month.\u000a\u000a3. Buying more house than necessary\u000a\u000aAn American Financing mortgage consultant says that \u201cbuyers find most long-term success when figuring out what they can afford, how much they can put into a down payment, and then sticking to the plan. Creating a budget and determining a comfortable monthly payment is key. Just because you are approved for a higher loan amount does not mean you have to overextend yourself. Live within your means, and you\u2019ll be better prepared to avoid financial losses. If something were to happen and you needed to quickly sell or rent the property \u2014 remember, markets change. If you bought the largest home in the neighborhood, that might not help when it comes to selling.\u201d\u000a\u000aBuying a home is likely the biggest purchase you\u2019ll make. And, a good rule of thumb is tospend 28 percent of gross income on housing. Regardless of pre-approved loan amount, take the following into consideration:\u000a\u000aDown payment. The more you can put down, the less likely your chances are of having to pay monthly mortgage insurance. And, the less you put down, the higher your monthly payment. Be sure to ask yourself if the monthly payment is worth accepting the higher loan amount. Should you find the home of your dreams, it just may be. But you\u2019ll want to strongly consider your financial situation and talk it through with an adviser or mortgage consultant before making a rash, emotional decision.\u000a\u000aThe more you can put down, the less likely your chances are of having to pay monthly mortgage insurance.

Don\u2019t become house poor by purchasing too much home. You\u2019re going to experience utility bills, potential issues (like water heater or roof replacement), and even home furnishing costs.

Can you put more money aside for your 401k or IRA? It may make more sense to invest in your future than to invest in a larger home or a home in a more expensive neighborhood. Still, do your research. A home itself makes for a great investment. If you choose the right property and location, the equity you\u2019re building may bring greater return than other financial investments.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t get caught up in the home buying market craziness. Take your time to prepare before committing to a home investment. And, always remember you have options. Options in mortgage lenders, properties, realtors, and loan programs.

aVWhen it comes to the holiday season, some towns pull out all the stops for Christmas celebrations. From parades to elaborate Nativity scenes to Old World shopping markets and visits with Santa Claus, these are the top 25 cities and towns across America to gas up the car and visit this December.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list of Newsmax\u2019s Top 25 Christmas Destinations in America, we specifically chose towns that celebrate the Nativity as part of their holiday celebrations, as well as places that offer a range of events and lodging options.\u000a\u000a1. Leavenworth, Washington \u2014 When winter arrives, the charming Bavarian village of Leavenworth, Washington, transforms into \u201cChristmas Town, USA.\u201d With more than a half-million LED lights strung throughout the town, Leavenworth sparkles during the first three weekends of December when more than 25,000 visitors descend upon the town (with a year-round population of just 1,900) for sleigh rides, sledding, caroling, chestnuts, and spiced wine. Don't leave before dark. The Christmas lights turn on at dusk after the town sings \u201cSilent Night\u201d together in the village center, followed by a live Nativity presentation. Leavenworth also celebrates with a weekend-long Christmas market.\u000a\u000aTell Us: What Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a2. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \u2014 Christened "Bethlehem" on Christmas Eve in 1741 when missionary Count Zinzendorf of Saxony, Germany, visited a two-room log home that housed both people and animals, today this eastern Pennsylvania town goes all out for the birth of Jesus. At the center of Bethlehem\u2019s holiday celebrations is Christkindlmarkt. In the style of a traditional German Christmas market, it is held over three weekends in December and features more than 125 artisans and craftspeople selling everything from handmade pottery to jewelry inside heated tents.

McAdenville, North Carolina \u2014 Discover more than 375 decorated trees, 200 lit lamppost wreaths, and 450,000 lights decorating this little town just 20 minutes outside of Charlotte.

Ogunquit, Maine \u2014 This quaint, coastal resort town in southern Maine fittingly calls its December holiday celebrations "Christmas by the Sea" and features a calendar packed with old-fashioned activities. Throughout the month, families participate in hayrides, bonfires, caroling, craft markets, and an opportunity to view a living manger Nativity scene. For brave souls, there is an even a Polar Bear plunge into the cold Atlantic water to benefit charity.\u000a\u000a14. Paradise, Pennsylvania \u2014 In the heart of Pennsylvania's Amish Country, about 60 miles west from Philadelphia, the aptly named Paradise is home to a 20,000-square-foot museum dedicated entirely to preserving and sharing Christmas memories from across the ages and the world.

Pine Mountain, Georgia \u2014 Pine Mountain is known regionally for going all out for Christmas, and the town's population grows exponentially during the holiday season when visitors pour in to experience Callaway Gardens\u2019 Fantasy In Lights \u2014 now in its 25th year. The drive-through holiday-light-and-sound extravaganza feels like Disney\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d ride and is quite impressive, using more than 8 million lights as well as narration to transport visitors into a number of different Christmas stories, each lasting about 10 minutes.

Zoar, Ohio \u2014 Take a road trip to Zoar, located around 40 miles south of Akron, to experience an old-fashioned Christmas complete with walking tours that trace the historic village's history back to 1817 when a group of 200 German separatists sought refuge from religious persecution in their homeland. Today, the tiny town (population 169) has been meticulously preserved or recreated, and visitors can shop for unique Christmas presents by local artisans in fully operating traditional blacksmith and tinsmith shops.\u000a\u000a17. Portland, Maine \u2014 For a classic New England Christmas town, head up to Portland, where holiday lights cast a festive glow on the snow-covered streets. The First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church here has been hosting a Nativity pageant continuously since 1926 and many of the participants are from multiple generations of families.\u000a\u000a18. Santa Claus, Indiana \u2014 Located in southern Indiana about three hours south of Indianapolis and one hour west of Louisville, Kentucky, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Christmas Hometown\u201d throws quite a party for the three weekends before Christmas. Visitors will want to take a drive through Christmas Lake Village, which features nine miles of decorated houses, and also hosts a live Nativity during its Festival of Lights. There are also Christmas-themed businesses to explore from Santa's Car Wash to Santa Claus Hardware and Frosty's Fun Center.\u000a\u000a19. Red Wing, Minnesota \u2014 Located on a bluff above the Mississippi River, Red Wing kicks off its holiday celebrations on the Saturday after Thanksgiving with an annual Holiday Stroll festival.

Natchitoches, Louisiana \u2014 For a Creole-style Christmas celebration, head to Natchitoches, which has been celebrating the birth of Christ along its river downtown since 1927. Drawing more than 100,000 people over the holiday season to the town of 18,000, it features more than 300,000 lights, fireworks, carriage rides, a Nativity, and live performances, among other displays.

Throughout the month of December, the historic foundation hosts tours of preserved homes decked out for the holidays. Also, Natchitoches is one of several cities on the Holiday Trail of Lights; the trail connects eight, merry-making Louisiana cities all within driving distance of one another.\u000a\u000a21. Skaneateles, New York \u2014 You'll be transported back to the world of Charles Dickens\u2019 beloved novel "A Christmas Carol" when paying a holiday season visit to Skaneateles in upstate New York. What's special about this celebration is that it includes a 70-person cast wandering the streets in character to create a live, interactive street-theater performance experience for the 20,000-plus visitors who visit on weekends from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve. The high point of the festivities is the Dickens and Friends Dinner at the Mirbeau Inn and Spa, where guests enjoy a performance of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d in their midst.\u000a\u000a22. Santa Fe, New Mexico \u2014 Santa Fe is a beautiful destination to spend the holiday season.

Another popular event in Santa Fe is \u201cLas Posadas,\u201d a centuries-old tradition stemming from the city\u2019s Spanish influence; the one-night event winds its way through downtown Santa Fe as a re-creation of Mary and Joseph\u2019s fateful search for accommodations.\u000a\u000a23.

aVGene Michael, who was a New York Yankees player and manager for nearly 50 years, died Thursday at his home in Florida at age 79.\u000a\u000aMichael played shortstop in the late 1960s and into the '70s during a time of decline for the team. During his playing days, he was known as a brawler who would often square off against an opposing player when something was said or done to offend him. He was given the nickname \u201cStick\u201d because he was 6-foot-1 and weighed only 180 pounds.\u000a\u000aWhen his playing career ended, George Steinbrenner hired Michael to manage the team. He was hired and fired several times by Steinbrenner, but served as general manager again for the first half of the 1990s and had a large part in assembling the team that would win the World Series in 1996, then again in 1998-2000, the Times reported.\u000a\u000aMichael recommended hiring Joe Torre to manage the team, and also had a part in hiring and recruiting Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, Paul O\u2019Neill, Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, David Cone and Joe Girardi \u2014 all of whom participated in one or more of the World Series teams.\u000a\u000aMichael also coached the team, handled scouting, and was a senior adviser in the front office during his later years.\u000a\u000a\u201cGene Michael was not only largely responsible for the success of the Yankees organization, but also for my development as a player,\u201d Derek Jeter said of Michael, ESPN reported.\u000a\u000aOther colleagues, former players, and fans on Twitter reacted to Michael's death with condolences.\u000a\u000aSo sorry to hear about Gene Michael Thank you for giving me the best opportunity of my life: playing for the Yankees...you will be missed!!! \u2014 Paul O'Neill (@PaulONeillYES) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aRIP Gene Michael.

aVOnce again, Americans and the world are reading about North Korea\u2019s gambit to intimidate its neighbors. The latest saber-rattling is the possible explosion of a hydrogen bomb, or at minimum, a tritium-enhanced "boosted" atomic bomb. The latter is cold comfort, especially when it is believed that another imminent missile is in the offing. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un particularly likes to conduct tests when the U.S. is distracted \u2014 as she is likely to be due to Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aVery troubling is that these events are a reminder of how North Korea is an intelligence black hole. The U.S. intelligence community has consistently underestimated Kim\u2019s missile and nuclear capabilities. We seem to have gotten wrong the pace of ballistic missile development, its sub-launched ballistic missile ability, its warhead miniaturization progress \u2014 and now perhaps its hydrogen bomb development.\u000a\u000aThe intelligence community has been dependent on overhead imagery (or IMINT) and some signals intelligence (or SIGINT) for its information on North Korea for decades.\u000a\u000aHuman intelligence (or HUMINT) traditionally the best for divining the intentions of a given leader or government, has always been almost impossible due to the police state that is North Korea.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un's trusted elite come from the original 50-odd families that returned with The Great Leader Kim Il Sung from Manchuria in 1949; this elite makes for a tight inner-circle and it compounds the current difficulty regarding intelligence gathering. The only country with insight into North Korea's leadership circle is China. They aren\u2019t sharing.\u000a\u000aCompounding Western strategic myopia is that IMINT and SIGINT on North Korea are becoming increasingly problematic. Fiberoptic communications have made SIGINT much harder (necessitating direct teltap), and IMINT can be obscured (think underground) or spoofed \u2014 much as India, knowing U.S. capabilities, conducted atomic tests in 1998 despite U.S. monitoring.\u000a\u000aKim\u2019s development of mobile, solid-fueled missiles, which require minutes, not hours and or days to fuel \u2014 will further limit U.S. launch warning time.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un's provocative launching of missiles over Japan will strain Japanese, South Korean and U.S. early-warning systems increasing the chances of a fatal miscalculation.\u000a\u000aThese sobering facts, and the realization that the U.S. is now confronted by only several bad options (there are no good policy alternatives) is due to the willingness of the U.S. and its allies to kick the can down the road for the past 25 years.\u000a\u000aStill worse, however, for the American people, is that in addition to the foreign policy laziness heretofore described , the previous administration willfully threw gasoline on the fire with the signing of the disastrous Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. This nihilistic, willful action has undermined counterproliferation efforts and has served to empower (and financially enrich) North Korea.\u000a\u000aAmericans must understand that the Iran and North Korea missile and nuclear programs are inexorably linked \u2014 and cooperation continues, indeed has redoubled \u2014 since JCPOA\u2019s signing.\u000a\u000aThere is a good reason why Iran\u2019s Shahab 3 and 4 missiles are clones of Kim\u2019s Rodong missile series.\u000a\u000aThe Islamic State\u2019s balistic missile program continues to rely on North Korean technology, as it has for many years. Significantly, Iran continues its test launches because missiles were not included in JCPOA, due to Obama\u2019s haste to sign the "deal."\u000a\u000aIran\u2019s launchings, however, are in violation of its signed U.N. Agreement Limiting Intermediate Range Missiles. Iran of course denies this.\u000a\u000aAll the while, the redeye direct flight between Tehran and Pyongyang is filled with technicians going both ways.\u000a\u000aThe mullahs, after all, have what Kim needs most \u2014 cash.\u000a\u000aPyongyang\u2019s only foreign-currency-worthy export are weapons. In addition to shared missile development, Iranian nuclear scientists were present at Pyongyang\u2019s first nuclear test, and almost certainly were present at Kim\u2019s latest triumph. Remember, Iran-allied Syria modeled its nuclear plant on a similar North Korean one \u2014 before it was destroyed by Israeli bombs\u000a\u000aIran thus doesn't have to risk the ire of the West by overt further development of its nuclear program. Pyongyang is clearly assisting them in this regard \u2014 it can be done in North Korea, then brought to the Mideast.\u000a\u000aWhy has this partnership from hell avoided greater scrutiny? One main cause is money. JCPOA provides the west with the ability to expand trade with the oil-exporter. European and also U.S. firms, eager to expand, only see deals involving jumbo jets and updating oil production infrastructure\u000a\u000aIn an excellent article, author Avni states that "for decades, America shied away from revealing what the intelligence community knew about the Tehran-Pyongyang love affair because we dreamed of diplomatic breakthroughs on both fronts." This hubris was rewarded by a relationship which has drawn ever closer.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, this dynamic still seems to have a foothold in the Trump Administration, given the National Security Council\u2019s unwillingness to certify Iranian JCPOA non-compliance.\u000a\u000aThe gasoline on the fire described above was of course the $1.7 billion in cash infamously handed over to Iran on a pallet during the JCPOA. The White House stated that the cash payment was due to the "effectiveness" of sanctions (no laughs, please). Only a complete fool would believe that a large portion of this money was not sent on to pay for North Korean "assistance."\u000a\u000aThe JCPOA and Obama\u2019s reprehensible actions thus add truth to Lenin\u2019s old statement that, "the capitalists will compete with each other to sell us the rope with which we will hang them . . . "\u000a\u000aAs the U.N. talks of increasing sanctions, the Iranian-North Korean link must be highlighted by a U.N. resolution naming and sanctioning persons and entities involved in Iran-North Korea arms cooperation.\u000a\u000aAlthough it may already be too late, drawing further attention to this Tehran-Pyongyang nexus might convince allies in denial that Tehran\u2019s violations constitute a global threat.\u000a\u000aSuch sanctions could start the process of plugging a major cash source for the Kim regime.\u000a\u000aIf its too late to prevent North Korea\u2019s joining the nuclear ballistic missile club, there may still be time to stop Iran.\u000a\u000aScott Uehlinger is a retired CIA Station Chief and Naval Officer.

aVSports radio host Craig Carton was arrested Wednesday on fraud charges alleging he operated a Ponzi scheme and engaged in a ticket-selling scam that raised over $5 million, partly to repay millions of dollars in gambling debts.\u000a\u000aConspiracy, securities and wire fraud charges were unsealed in Manhattan federal court against the host of WFAN's "Boomer and Carton" show. He was arrested at his Manhattan home before dawn, before he was scheduled to go on air, authorities said.\u000a\u000aIn a related civil case, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Carton in mid-2016 solicited investments in ticket reselling enterprises after he accrued millions of dollars' worth of gambling-related debts to casinos and other third parties.\u000a\u000aThe SEC said he provided fabricated and forged documents to investors, claiming access to large quantities of face-value tickets to upcoming concerts by artists including Adele, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Roger Waters, Metallica, and Barbra Streisand.\u000a\u000a"In reality, no such agreements with the concert promoter or venue existed, and the signatures for the concert promoter or venue were forged," the SEC said.\u000a\u000aCarton has hosted the sports-themed radio program broadcast on WFAN since 2007 with former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason. The show also is simulcast on CBS Sports Network TV.\u000a\u000aCarton was not on the air Wednesday. It was unclear who will represent him in court.\u000a\u000aFederal prosecutors said Carton, 48, teamed up with Michael Wright, 41, of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, to carry out a fraud on investors by posing as power brokers in the concert ticket business. Wright also was charged. It was not clear who will represent him in court.\u000a\u000aManhattan Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a release that Carton and Wright deceived investors, raising millions of dollars "through misrepresentation and outright lies." The SEC said Carton and others misappropriated at least $5.6 million from two investors.\u000a\u000aKim said the men falsely claimed to have contracts with two companies to buy blocks of concert tickets.\u000a\u000a"Behind all the talk, the Wright and Carton show was just a sham, designed to fleece investors out of millions ultimately to be spent on payments to casinos and to pay off other personal debt," Kim said.\u000a\u000aWilliam F. Sweeney Jr., head of New York's FBI office, said Wright and Carton tried to pay off their debts with other people's money.\u000a\u000a"We see this time and time again, the rise and fall of a Ponzi scheme destined for failure. The truth is, the time will come when your luck runs out," he said.\u000a\u000aA criminal complaint described how an unidentified hedge fund executed a revolving loan agreement that would provide Carton with up to $10 million to buy tickets with the understanding that the hedge fund would share in profits. According to the complaint, Carton forwarded hundreds of thousands of dollars of the investment money to casinos.\u000a\u000aCBS owns WFAN and says it is cooperating with authorities.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was asked if testimony or a potential hearing with Trump was "off the table for this investigation."\u000a\u000a"No," the former California attorney general replied.\u000a\u000a"So it's possible that the Senate could seek his testimony?" Melber pressed.\u000a\u000a"I think it's possible \u2013 yes," she said.\u000a\u000aAsked then under what conditions the panel might seek Trump's testimony, Harris responded, "We'll see where the facts lead us."\u000a\u000aMelber pointed out the response made her "sound a little bit like Donald Trump."\u000a\u000a"Oh not at all," she laughed.

aVCities along the coast of the United States can learn from what is happening in Texas and Louisiana and be better prepared to handle and prevent massive flooding and destruction that has occurred in recent days, former FEMA director Michael Brown told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on "Newsmax Now," Brown told host Bill Tucker he himself learned some things during the 2001 Tropical Storm Allison.\u000a\u000a"They have to learn to mitigate," Brown said when asked how cities can respond to the devastation in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. "Houston learned a lot about mitigation in Tropical Storm Allison, which occurred in 2001. I remember walking into the University of Houston Medical Center in 2001 \u2014 and this isn't meant to be critical, it's just a statement of fact \u2014 The University of Houston Medical Center had put most of their laboratories underground and they had done nothing in terms of flood mitigation.\u000a\u000a"That ended up costing taxpayers literally billions of dollars to not only repair and replace those but then to build the kind of flood walls and flood barriers around the hospital, the medical facilities, so when the next big flood came along perhaps it would be high enough and strong enough to protect it.\u000a\u000a"I think cities are going to have to learn a couple of things."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

aVHurricane Harvey-flooded churches in Texas are suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to gain access to disaster relief grants, a religious liberty lawfirm announced.\u000a\u000aIn the suit, three small Texas churches damaged by Harvey are challenging a FEMA policy banning them from applying to its relief program because they are religious.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit argues nonprofits like museums and zoos qualify for FEMA's relief programs to help make basic structural repairs and begin rebuilding, but churches, synagogues, and other houses of worship are denied access to the grants.\u000a\u000aThe plaintiffs charges the policy is unconstitutional.\u000a\u000aThe lawfirm Becket filed the suit in Houston federal court against FEMA on behalf of Harvest Family Church, Hi-Way Tabernacle, and Rockport First Assembly of God.\u000a\u000a"After the costliest and most devastating natural disaster in U.S. history, the government should come to the aid of all, not leave important parts of the community underwater," Becket lawyer Diana Verm said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Hurricane Harvey didn't cherry-pick its victims; FEMA shouldn't cherry-pick who it helps."\u000a\u000aAccording to Becket, FEMA has repeatedly denied disaster assistance funds to houses of worship in the wake of disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, including a Jewish Chabad, a homeless shelter church ministry, and a Unitarian Universalist church.\u000a\u000a"Houses of worship are playing a vital role in helping Texans recover from this horrible storm," Verm's statement said. "It\u2019s time for FEMA to start helping the helpers, not continue a policy of irrational discrimination against churches."

aVThree Taco Bell employees with guns surprised two alleged robbers who reportedly attempted to rob the Cleveland establishment, killing one, WJW-TV reported.\u000a\u000aOfficers responded to the Taco Bell on West 117th Street about 2:45 a.m. Wednesday on a report of a robbery with shots fired, per WJW-TV. One suspected robber died at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland after he was shot by store employees while a second alleged robbery fled, Cleveland police told the television station.\u000a\u000aPolice found a suspect with multiple gunshot wounds when they arrived, and he was given first aid until emergency personnel arrived, WJW-TV reported. Employees told police that two armed suspects entered the restaurant wearing masks and ordered three employees to ground, the television station stated.\u000a\u000aThree other employees, identified as two 19-year-old men and a 23-year-old man, shot one of the alleged armed robbers six times while the other ran, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.

aVUrgent:\u000a\u000aDo You Support Donald Trump for the GOP Nomination? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aUrgent:\u000a\u000aWho Should the GOP Nominate in 2016? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aWhich GOP Candidate Would You Support in 2016?\u000a\u000aThey may be admired or loathed but one thing staffers and colleagues who requested anonymity agree on is that this \u201cgang of 10\u201d \u2014 senators of both parties \u2014 are the hardest-working of the elected lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Whether it is jetting home on weekends, putting in long hours in Washington or on the campaign trail, or their political rise and survive, these 10, observers agree, have an excess of \u201celbow grease.\u201dEditor\u2019s note: The entrants are listed alphabetically by state.\u2014 When U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions was blocked as George H.W. Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, observers who wrote him off as "finished" didn't reckon with the prosecutor's ability to rebound. He got elected attorney general of Alabama, then won the seat of the Democratic senator who blocked him (Howell Heflin). These days, Sessions is his party's hardest charger in the Senate on illegal immigration and a top advisor to Donald Trump.\u2014 Love him or loathe him, old and young hands on Capitol Hill almost universally regard McCain \u2014 now 80 and seeking a sixth term \u2014 as the \u201cenergizer bunny of Congress.\u201d He maintains his usual regimen of returning home to Arizona every weekend and becoming a near-omnipresence on Sunday morning (and every morning) TV talk shows. Those who know him best, such as close friend and fellow Vietnam POW Orson Swindle, swear McCain reads a book a week and, in Swindle\u2019s words, \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u2014 After a meteoric rise to the Senate in 2014 after one term in the House, this Harvard Law graduate and U.S. Army veteran of Iraq is already making a reputation for himself as a leading GOP spokesman for aggressive U.S. foreign policy. Cotton helped lead the Senate charge against the Obama administration\u2019s Iran agreement and convinced all but one of his Republican colleagues to sign a letter reminding Tehran\u2019s rulers the Senate would have last say on any agreement.\u2014 Self-styled "farm girl" and Army National Guard Col. Ernst captured imaginations with her 2014 commercials describing how she loved to "castrate pigs" and showing her on a Harley heading to target practice. Nominated to the Senate over four primary opponents and elected in the fall with 53 percent of the vote, Ernst now works hard on pro-life cause, remains an unapologetic climate change skeptic, and still finds time to handle the causes of her fellow "farm folks."\u2014 He routinely leaves staffers and colleagues speechless as he explains complex issues related to healthcare in simple terms. A physician who co-founded a pro-bono clinic with his physician-wife, Cassidy last year crafted a market-based alternative to Obamacare that he trumpeted in whirlwind press conferences and TV appearances until the Supreme Court upheld the controversial plan.\u2014 In 2014, the former Bush administration official and Lutheran college president came out of nowhere to beat three better-known and better funded opponents for nomination to the Senate. Considered an effective spokesman on government reform, Sasse is the first Nebraska senator in memory to commute weekly from what he hails as "the tall and beautiful grass at home."\u2014 Booker\u2019s capacity for long hours and hard work that is now becoming legend among his Senate colleagues and staffers first became evident when he was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Whether it was being on the scene during a fire or making the case for school vouchers, Booker was working at it in a major way. When not in Washington, the freshman senator is usually on the stump for friend Hillary Clinton and is increasingly mentioned as a vice presidential candidate \u2014 or possibly a presidential contender in 2020.\u2014 Like the Republican he unseated in 1998, Sen. Al D\u2019Amato, Schumer is home every weekend dealing with neighborhood problems and holding town meetings. During the week, however, he pays extra attention to colleagues and to the press. One joke often heard on Capitol Hill is \u201cthe most dangerous place in Washington is between a camera and Chuck Schumer.\u201d Schumer\u2019s \u201celbow grease\u201d yielded benefits this year, when he wrapped up enough votes to guarantee his election as Senate Democratic Leader when Harry Reid retires at the end of 2016.\u2014 As much as Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the raspy-voiced Brown embraces and champions the complete left-of-center agenda. But in hailing from a state where Republicans hold every statewide office except his, Brown\u2019s political survivor and stature is especially impressive. Whether the issue is same-sex marriage (he opposed a statewide measure to ban it) or the Iraq War (he fought it from the beginning), Brown outworks opponents and supporters alike, Hill-watchers agree. It is no surprise he is mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for either Sanders or Clinton.\u2014 \u201cThe best place to catch Pat Toomey,\u201d goes the joke on the Senate side of Capitol Hill, \u201cis at Union Station [the Washington, D.C., train station] on Thursday or Monday.\u201d There, the junior senator can be found heading back to Pennsylvania, where he is highly visible meeting constituents over the weekends. In Washington, he is considered a driven lawmaker who embraces small government issues as well as working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W Va.) on a modest gun control measure (which never got out of the Senate and caused Toomey some discomfort on the right). He is considered one of the more vulnerable GOP senators facing the voters in \u201916, but no one writes him off.

Like a warrior\u2019s fistful of arrows are the children of a vigorous youth. Oh, how blessed are you parents, with your quivers full of children! Your enemies don\u2019t stand a chance against you; you\u2019ll sweep them right off your doorstep."\u000a\u000aAs the anniversary of 9/11 looms, let'd not forget the loss of our unborn.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSeptember 9 is National Day of Remembrance for Aborted Children. As we solemnly observe this anniversary, we must remember and repent. (See, 2 Chronicles 7:14.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEvery day in this country over 3,000 children are aborted. This staggering number takes a toll on our whole nation; its spirit, soul, and body.\u000a\u000aIn the African American community the numbers are disproportionately high due to Planned Parenthood's mission of genocide and eugenics agenda of America's largest abortion provider. Abortion is a bad product for babies and their mothers. Abortions kill babies and hurt women.\u000a\u000aAnd to make things worse, abortion providers many times seize the opportunity to exploit natural disasters, like Hurricane Harvey, by capitalizing from the pain and circumstances that these victims find themselves in, one of the most stressful times in their lives.\u000a\u000aOne particular provider, Whole Women\u2019s Health, is offering "no-cost abortions" to victims of Hurricane Harvey. So many of these people have lost their homes, personal property, and sometimes loved ones and of they take up abortion providers on their offer they will also compound their situations by grieving with the death of a lost unborn child.\u000a\u000aLet's also remember, there is no such thing as a "cost-free abortion." There is always a cost.\u000a\u000aThe cost is the life of the baby and the harm caused to the mother, the immediate family and the human family.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis year as we observe the memorial deaths of our aborted brothers and sisters, two of my own babies included in that number, let us pray a prayer of Repentance and commitment to never be silent, never be passive and never be forgetful until all of our brothers and sisters are protected and our nation once again becomes a nation with liberty and justice for all.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLet us encourage our President and Congress to keep the commitment to Defund Planned Parenthood.\u000a\u000aFinally, let us pray for all in authority; our president and all leaders (See, 1 Timothy 2:2.), that we can live peacefully; and that our babies can live.

aVAging of the brain will spontaneously prime microglia. This is why older people suffer far greater damage from strokes, head injuries, and infections than younger people. It may also be why they develop neurodegenerative diseases at a far higher rate than younger people.\u000a\u000aAging is the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, mainly for this reason.\u000a\u000aBecause their microglia are chronically primed, any infection, vaccination, or exposure to a source of inflammation throws older people\u2019s microglia into full destructive force, causing their nervous systems to degenerate much faster.\u000a\u000aBut aging carries a number of other risks. For example, as we age our antioxidant network is less efficient, putting us at a higher risk of damage from free radicals and lipid peroxidation.\u000a\u000aOur detoxification systems are often impaired as well, and this makes us more susceptible to a number of environmental toxins as well as drug complications.\u000a\u000aFinally, immune deficiency is common and increases one\u2019s risk of autoimmune diseases, cancer, chronic inflammation and infections as well as making it difficult to cure infections. This can lead to priming and chronic microglial activation.\u000a\u000aFortunately, there are a number of nutritional measures you can take to reduce these problems. Exercise is also critical and can correct many of these problems when combined with good nutrition.

aVDonald Trump is the first president in U.S. history to have been baited into undermining his own negotiating position by negative TV coverage.\u000a\u000aLess than 12 hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions explained that the administration is ending DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 because it's unconstitutional, Trump tweeted that he might revive the program if Congress doesn't act.\u000a\u000aThis was an implicit admission that he's bluffing on DACA, which gives Democrats every incentive not to trade anything meaningful for a codification of the program. Why make any painful concessions to save DACA if the president is loath to truly terminate it?\u000a\u000aSurely, Trump wasn't thinking of any strategic or legislative imperatives; he was thinking only of how to push back against commentators calling him heartless. The time of the tweet \u2014 8:38 p.m. \u2014 suggests that he was watching TV, and reporting has confirmed as much.\u000a\u000aWhich raises the questions: Doesn't the president have better things to do than watch political punditry on cable TV shows? As one of the most famous and powerful people on the planet, why does he care what pundits say about him? And doesn't he realize that his immigration agenda will get attacked by most commentators no matter what?\u000a\u000aPresident Barack Obama famously described himself as having a pen and a phone (that's how we got DACA). Trump has a phone and a remote control, and often works them in tandem as he criticizes, praises and comments on things said about him on air.\u000a\u000aTrump is the most unusual combination of a politician who, on the one hand, was elected president by thumbing his nose at media elites and, on the other, is obsessed about what media elites write and say about him.\u000a\u000aIt's understandable that John McCain, who joked about the media being his political base, would care about his press clippings. But Trump? Who every other day broadcasts his contempt for journalists and is unafraid to take actions \u2014 pulling out of the Paris climate accord, revoking DACA \u2014 guaranteed to generate media outrage?\u000a\u000aTrump is experiencing the agony of the media-bashing media figure. He follows what's said on cable TV more closely than many people who make a living as commentators on cable TV. He sometimes knows more about the industry gossip than people who work in the industry.\u000a\u000aThis reflects his background as a TV star who leveraged his fame into the presidency. But it is, needless to say, highly unusual.\u000a\u000aGeorge W. Bush didn't pay much attention to his press coverage, confident that history would get it right and unwilling to get diverted from doing more important things. Barack Obama had an Olympian disregard for political punditry (as for many things).\u000a\u000aTrump time and again demonstrates that he is wounded by what he hears on TV. The irony is that he is reflexively incapable of fully absorbing some of the key lessons of his own success: The media are in a bubble, they aren't nearly as important as they used to be, and whatever they are hysterical about in this six-hour news cycle will soon fade in the next. Trump, though, can't get enough of the bubble and is as shortsightedly consumed with the latest thing as his media nemeses.\u000a\u000aTrump clearly feeds off the attention and considers the negative coverage, in part, as a motivator (I'll show those bastards on CNN . . . ). But his obsession with the coverage also distorts his judgment. The DACA tweet was an unforced error, or, to be more precise, an error forced by cable chatter he should be ignoring.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple of ways out of the dilemma. Trump can abandon his program and perhaps get some praise for "growing in office" (while destroying his presidency). He can continue, agitated by the coverage, to lash out, sometimes self-defeatingly. Or he can turn off the TV.\u000a\u000aThe right answer is "Click!," but he's as unlikely to give up the remote as he is his phone.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRich Lowry is editor of the National Review and author of the best-seller "Lincoln Unbound: How an Ambitious Young Railsplitter Saved the American Dream \u2014 and How We Can Do It Again.

aVConservative Republicans hissed and groaned at Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as he implored them to vote for a hurricane relief bill that includes a short-term extension of the federal debt limit.\u000a\u000aSome Republicans, attending a closed door meeting Friday, were infuriated by the sales pitch for the deal, especially when Mnuchin told them to \u201cvote for the debt ceiling for me,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina.\u000a\u000a"The comments from the treasury secretary today were not helpful,\u201d said Representative Dave Brat of Virginia. \u201cI found them to be intellectually insulting."\u000a\u000aThe House later in the morning passed the deal brokered by Democrats and President Donald Trump to suspend the debt limit, keep the government open through Dec. 8 and provide $15.25 billion in aid to flood victims in Texas and other parts of the Gulf coast. The measure, already passed by the Senate, now goes to Trump for his signature.\u000a\u000aRepublicans also laughed at White House budget director Mick Mulvaney during his presentation. Several said it was ironic that Mulvaney, who as a Freedom Caucus member led several fights over the debt limit and pushed to shut down the government, pleaded with Republicans to pass the kind of measure he used to crusade against. One member even joked in the meeting that more Freedom Caucus members should be hired by the Office of Management and Budget so that their views would change too.\u000a\u000aRepublicans complained that Mnuchin only took a few questions and didn\u2019t provide satisfactory responses.\u000a\u000a"One of the questions was, \u2018What does the debt ceiling look like in December?\u2019 and he could not answer that question," said Walker.\u000a\u000aAfter the meeting, Mnuchin left the building quickly, answering one question from a reporter as he departed, saying that he asked the House GOP to raise the debt ceiling.

aVThe moment I have been awaiting with trembling and prayerful anticipation since the week of President Trump\u2019s inauguration is dawning. The hysterical assault by the media and Democrats is starting to crumble and fall apart.\u000a\u000aLike shrieking babies who eventually become so angry and exhausted they can\u2019t cry anymore, they have to pause since they no longer can maintain an ambiance of endless accusations.\u000a\u000aUntil now, a new charge has arisen as each previous one faded. It was preemptive righteousness from the start: hostile rioters near the inaugural parade; witless film and rock stars speaking of blowing up the White House; groups of miscellaneously angry women demonstrators suggestively and graphically dressed up, demonstrating against the president for unstated reasons; an adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s "Julius Caesar" in which a Trump look-alike was murdered; a mock-up of Trump\u2019s severed head proudly held up by one of Hollywood\u2019s loopier comics; even poor, tired, desperately predictable Stephen Colbert, who began by begging Trump to run so he could be pulverized by the voters, almost at the weary end of his lame Trump gags.\u000a\u000aThis past week, the tide ran out. Vanity Fair, on balance the most nauseating publication in America, and The New York Times and The Washington Post panned Melania Trump\u2019s footwear when she got on to the airplane to go to Texas. High heels, which she changed to running shoes before she deplaned. She was called Flood Watch Barbie by refinery29, which fancies itself a chic style site. Chelsea Handler, one of the dumbest and mouthiest people on television, chimed in.\u000a\u000aThose who have no shame achieve a plenitude of shame. CNN took the president to task for beginning his remarks in Houston with, "It is my honor to be here," and helpfully suggested that Trump should have said it was his "duty" to be there. That certainly would have got the visit off to a peppy start \u2014 telling scores of thousands of flood victims that he had come (with implicit reluctance) out of duty.\u000a\u000aThere are no depths that the riff-raff of the American political media have not plumbed in the last year. The underpublicized fact is that Donald Trump ran against a complacent, biased, flabby, leftist media that had whitewashed the failures of the U.S. political class for decades. He won, they lost, they have been poor sports, and now the public is tired of their lies and their malice. Public approval of the media is under 20 per cent and polls now show Trump edging over 40 per cent.\u000a\u000aCongress is back, and if the nondescript Republican leadership can raise itself off its hands, declare to be over the chicken game that prevailed while they thought Trump might flame out spontaneously, and try to end the useless, hopeless gridlock of the last 20 years in Congress (punctuated only by some of George W. Bush\u2019s measures after 9/11 and by Obamacare), then the government will start to work for the first time in almost a generation.\u000a\u000aTrump ran against a complacent, biased, flabby, leftist media that had whitewashed the failures of the U.S. political class for decades. He won, they lost, they have been poor sports, and now the public is tired of their lies.\u000a\u000aThe answer is not, as is suggested now, including by some at National Review, "a return to congressional government." That is a fraud and merely the latest wheeze of the never-Trumpers, following the evaporation of misogyny, racism, collusion with Russians, warmongering in Korea, Nazi sympathies, temperamental instability, and, in Kafka\u2019s phrase, "nameless crimes," as excuses to evict Trump or pretend that he does not hold his office constitutionally.\u000a\u000aThere is no such thing as congressional government. There was a terrible drought in presidential leadership from the middle of the Clinton years to the end of the Obama regime, except for some of President Bush\u2019s response to the terrorist danger.\u000a\u000aThe country took Congress away from all three presidents but did not find great improvement with Newt Gingrich, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., or John Boehner, and is outraged at the failure of U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to achieve anything, even the confirmation of Trump\u2019s qualified appointees.\u000a\u000aSpeaker Ryan produced an asinine healthcare reform that would have increased the number of people not covered by health insurance by probably more than 20 million and, with modifications, only got it to the Senate with the president\u2019s help, where it failed by one vote.\u000a\u000aWhile there has never been congressional government, there have been efficient Congresses that worked with presidents of their own and the other party to produce respectably competent government.\u000a\u000aAs the Democrats do not accept the late election result and withhold cooperation on all issues, it is incumbent upon the Republicans to overcome the reciprocal dislike between Trump and most of the Republican congressional leadership and try to make the system work, for the sake of the country, their party, and themselves.\u000a\u000aInstead, we have had Republican congressional neutrality between the president and the monstrous imposture of "the resistance," a loose coalition from the Pelosian and Schumerian hacks all the way out to the violent racist rabble of Antifa and Black Lives Matter.\u000a\u000aFor over seven months, the Democrats have been conducting a sort of pretense-therapy that they could negate the election by unlimited obstructionism and smears of Trump, who has at times made their task easier by injudicious comments, endlessly amplified by the jackal media.\u000a\u000aAs Trump\u2019s campaign attacked the entire political and media establishment, it has been a stand-off between the executive branch (with many loyalty risks within) and the Democratic-media coalition, and the balance of power is with the Republicans in Congress. But not for long \u2014 either they will make peace with the president and push a Republican party unified out of joint self-interest into real and effective government, or they will be annihilated at the polls and the stand-off will continue, with the Democrats able to impeach for false partisan reasons, but not to remove. It will be either effective government or the ultimate escalation of gridlock.\u000a\u000aThe answer is not, as is suggested now, including by some at National Review, "a return to congressional government." That is a fraud and merely the latest wheeze of the never-Trumpers.\u000a\u000aThe Democrats have taken in vain the word "resistance," ennobled by the French resisters to Nazism \u2014 Jean Moulin, Albert Camus, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, and their brave cohorts \u2014 for what is really a squalid attempt at a putsch. The whole Democratic-media onslaught is finally running out of steam.\u000a\u000aIt emerged last week from a number of sources that former FBI director James B. Comey prepared the exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the e-mails affair well before the investigation neared conclusion; that there was great unrest within the FBI when Comey took it improperly upon himself to make a decision that rested with the deputy attorney general in the Clinton e-mail matter; that the FBI warned the Democratic governor of Virginia and mayor of Charlottesville three days before the rioting there of what would happen, and the mayor (who had proclaimed his city a "capital of resistance") prevented the police from taking appropriate avoidance measures; and that the FBI is refusing to give the Senate Judiciary Committee any information on its mid-campaign support for the infamous Steele dossier, which included the howling imbecility of Trump-synchronized urination by prostitutes in a Moscow hotel many years ago.\u000a\u000aEven Nancy Pelosi, spavined war-horse though she is, demurred from the laudations of Antifa in Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, when Antifa beat up a number of unarmed Republican supporters in San Francisco.\u000a\u000aSurely the beginning of the disintegration of the entire odious assault on Trump based on the theory that he is a mad interloper from an alien planet will incite Ryan and McConnell to lead the congressional Republicans off suicide watch. They can hold their noses, but they should put through some sensible legislation with the administration on taxes, employment infrastructure, immigration, and health-care reform.\u000a\u000aThe people demand it; the times require it, their political survival depends on it, the country needs it, and that is what they have been sent to Washington to do. That is how the U.S. system of government works, not through some fatuous usurpation of the executive power by a cabal of malcontents skulking around the Capitol like Caesar\u2019s assassins.\u000a\u000aThis article originally appeared in National Review.\u000a\u000aConrad Black is a financier, author and columnist.

aVKraft Heinz Co. named 29-year-old former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker David Knopf as its next chief financial officer, part of a shake-up aimed at reigniting growth at the slumping packaged-food giant.\u000a\u000aThe changes also include moving current CFO Paulo Basilio to the role of zone president for U.S. operations, tasking him with fixing a challenging domestic business that generates about 70 percent of its sales. Basilio, 42, will replace Kraft veteran George Zoghbi, though that executive will stay on as a strategic adviser.\u000a\u000aKraft Heinz hasn\u2019t posted sales growth since the company was created in a 2015 merger orchestrated by the private equity firm 3G Capital and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The company is mired in an industrywide slowdown: The largest food companies in the U.S. have lost almost $16 billion in sales over the past three years amid broad shifts in how consumers eat and shop.\u000a\u000aKnopf joined Kraft Heinz in July 2015 in connection with the merger and took a number of roles, including vice president of finance and head of global budget planning.

aVFully self-driving cars are set the hit the road within four years, but most Americans aren\u2019t ready to buy them.\u000a\u000aThe majority of U.S. consumers remain wary of the developing technology, with 55 percent of drivers surveyed by consultant AlixPartners saying they\u2019re unlikely to consider a driverless car when they come to market. Echoing other recent consumer polls, nearly half of those surveyed said they aren\u2019t confident that an autonomous car could drive them safely, with fear of hacking and software malfunctions among the leading concerns.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to autonomous vehicles, traditional auto companies and suppliers have a big two-front battle ahead of them: educating the consumer about autonomous vehicles and figuring out how to compete in the software end with highly-advantaged tech companies,\u201d Mark Wakefield, managing director and co-head of the automotive practice at AlixPartners, said in a statement.\u000a\u000aAutomakers and tech giants are pouring billions into developing self-driving cars, which are seen as a solution to growing gridlock and rising vehicle deaths. U.S. roadway fatalities jumped 14 percent over the last two years, with more than 40,000 people dying in crashes in 2016 -- largely the result of human error. But that won\u2019t change until manufacturers can get drivers comfortable with the nascent technology.\u000a\u000aAll too familiar with dropped calls and laptop meltdowns, 84 percent of consumers fear a software malfunction in a driverless car. Eight in 10 are worried about a hardware breakdown and 77 percent fret their car would be hacked, the AlixPartners survey of more than 1,500 U.S. drivers found.\u000a\u000aThe key for companies to win over skeptics is to take them for a ride with a robot at the wheel, according to AlixPartners, which administered the study in July and August. Of those respondents who had ridden in a self-driving car, 49 percent came away confident about their safety in such a vehicle, nearly twice the level of those who had never gone driverless.\u000a\u000aConsumers have more faith in tech giants such as Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. than automakers to develop self-driving software, with 78 percent saying they would trust them more to handle the coding for such a car. Traditional automakers such as General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. were trusted most to develop the hardware for driverless cars. Ride-hailing services such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. were trusted by just 1 percent of respondents to develop either the software or hardware of robot rides.\u000a\u000a\u201cTraditional auto will have to undertake massive operational and organizational changes to afford the autonomous-vehicle investments, be successful with partnerships and not get left out of the profitable parts of the new automotive ecosystem,\u201d Wakefield said.

The victory followed a fierce and highly publicized election in which Trump was scrutinized heavily by the media. Trump\u2019s victory sparked protests \u2014 some violent \u2014 across the country. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)\u000a\u000aHillary\u2019s emails: Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign was haunted by the FBI's investigation into the former secretary of state's private email server. But the probe came to a close over the summer, when Director James Comey announced the agency would not be recommending criminal charges for Clinton. The case was briefly reopened just days before the election when new emails were discovered in the course of the FBI's investigation into former Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Again, no criminal charges were recommended. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aTerror attacks: 2016 was tainted by a series of terrorist attacks across America and Europe linked to radical Islamic extremists and ISIS. The most deadly included three simultaneous bombings in Brussels, Belgium (35 killed); a shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Florida, (50 killed); a bus that plowed into a parade in Nice, France (80+ killed); and a truck that ran through a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany (12 killed). A renewed and widespread fear of terror attacks produced questions about radicalization and the ease of immigration in Western countries.

Leave supporters voted out of concern over the U.K.\u2019s surplus of monetary contributions to the EU, as well as apprehensions about immigration. Remain supporters wanted continued unrestricted trade and ease of immigration with European countries. Shortly after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, \u201cremain\u201d supporter Prime Minister David Cameron resigned and the Conservative Party\u2019s Theresa May came to power. (Daniel Sorabji/AFP/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aFinal farewells: The year 2016 was a difficult one that saw the loss of dozens of celebrities from all realms, including pop culture, entertainment, politics, and pro sports. From music legends like David Bowie and Prince to acting powerhouses like Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher, and Alan Thicke, it seemed no industry was spared.\u000a\u000aNational Anthem-gate: San Francisco 49ers second-string quarterback Colin Kaepernick made headlines this year when he chose to kneel during the National Anthem as an act of protest against police shootings of black men. Many other professional, collegiate, and even high school athletes followed suit and knelt during their sport's national anthems. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File)\u000a\u000aWhat is Aleppo?: Aleppo became a buzzword in 2016 as public recognition of one of the most war-torn and pivotal cities in the Syrian Civil War grew. Mass rapes and murders caused an evacuation order for the entire city after it was taken over by government regime and factions of ISIS. Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was heavily scrutinized in the U.S. after he asked \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d in a now-infamous television interview flub. The photo above, of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh sitting in an ambulance after being pulled out of a building hit by an airstrike, illustrates the horror of what happened in Aleppo this year. (Aleppo Media Center via AP)\u000a\u000aLaw and disorder: The police shootings of black men like Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, as well as the targeted murders of five police officers in Dallas, furthered the rift between police and the Black Lives Matter movement. Highly publicized protests drew the national spotlight this year after these events. (Jonathan Bachman/Reuters)\u000a\u000aHoneymoon in Cuba?: President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions to Cuba and the 1963 Cold War-era trade embargo was lifted after more than 50 years. Flights resumed between the U.S. and Cuba and the number of leisure travel trips will gradually increase. (Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aRio de Scary: The Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, commenced in August despite concerns over the instability of the country\u2019s government and its environment. Leading up to the Olympics, Brazil impeached its president and fears over Zika virus gripped the nation. At the end of the competition, the United States once again earned the most placements of any country with 121 medals, including 46 golds.\u000a\u000aZika scare: The Zika virus outbreak continued into 2016, and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February. In January, the first baby in the U.S. was born in Hawaii with microcephaly, a debilitating head deformation that occurs when a pregnant woman is infected with the virus. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\u000a\u000aNatural disasters: Hurricane Matthew swept the Western Atlantic and caused catastrophic destruction to Haiti, Cuba, Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas in late September and early October. A total of 1,600 people were killed, including 49 in the U.S. A month later, massive wildfires spread to the Appalachian town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee. The fire destroyed 2,400 structures and killed 14 people.

The wife of controversial hip-hop artist Kanye West had more than $10 million in jewelry stolen, after which she took a hiatus from the limelight. The perpetrators have still not been identified.

The Cubs finally broke the 108-year "curse" in the highly anticipated game, as the Indians had also not won a World Series since 1948. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\u000a\u000aBrangelina split: The celebrity world was shocked when power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their divorce after more than 10 years together. The two actors, known for their blended modern family comprised of three adopted children and three biological children, split in a public feud amid rumors of Pitt's alleged anger issues.

aVDonald Trump is president today because he was seen as a doer not a talker. Among the most common compliments paid him in 2016 was, "At least he gets things done!"\u000a\u000aAnd it was exasperation with a dithering GOP Congress, which had failed to enact his or its own agenda, that caused Trump to pull the job of raising the debt ceiling away from Republican contractors Ryan & McConnell, and give it to Pelosi & Schumer.\u000a\u000aHard to fault Trump. Over seven months, Congress showed itself incapable of repealing Obamacare, though the GOP promised this as its first priority in three successive elections.\u000a\u000aReturning to D.C. after five weeks vacation, with zero legislation enacted, Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were facing a deadline to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government.\u000a\u000aFailure to do so would crash the markets, imperil the U.S. bond rating, and make America look like a deadbeat republic.\u000a\u000aFamilies and businesses do this annually. Yet, every year, it seems, Congress goes up to the precipice of national default before authorizing the borrowing to pay the bills Congress itself has run up.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Trump only kicked this year's debt crisis to mid-December.\u000a\u000aBefore year's end, he and Congress will also have to deal with an immigration crisis brought on by his cancellation of the Obama administration's amnesty for the "Dreamers" now vulnerable to deportation.\u000a\u000aHe will have to get Congress to fund his Wall, enact tax reform and finance the repair and renewal of our infrastructure, or have his first year declared a failure.\u000a\u000aWe are likely looking at a Congressional pileup, pre-Christmas, from which Trump will have to call on Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, again, to extricate him and his party.\u000a\u000aThe question that now arises: Has the president concluded that working with the GOP majorities alone cannot get him where he needs to go to make his a successful presidency?\u000a\u000aHaving cut a deal with Democrats for help with the debt ceiling, will Trump seek a deal with Democrats on amnesty for the "Dreamers," in return for funding for border security? Trump seemed to be signaling receptivity to the idea this week.\u000a\u000aWill he give up on free-trade Republicans to work with Democrats to protect U.S. jobs and businesses from predator traders like China?\u000a\u000aWill he cut a deal with Hill Democrats on which infrastructure projects should be funded first? Will he seek out compromise with Democrats on whose taxes should be cut and whose retained?\u000a\u000aWe could be looking at a seismic shift in national politics, with Trump looking to centrist and bipartisan coalitions to achieve as much of his agenda as he can. He could collaborate with Federalist Society Republicans on justices and with economic-nationalist Democrats on tariffs.\u000a\u000aBut the Congressional gridlock that exhausted the president's patience may prove more serious than a passing phase. The Congress of the United States, whose powers were delineated in the late 18th century, may simply not be an institution suited to the 21st.\u000a\u000aA century ago, Congress ceded to the Federal Reserve its right "to coin money (and) regulate the value thereof." It has yielded to the third branch, the Supreme Court, the power to invent new rights, as in Roe v. Wade. Its power to "regulate commerce with foreign nations" has been assumed by an executive branch that negotiates the trade treaties, leaving Congress to say yea or nay.\u000a\u000aCongress alone has the power to declare war. But recent wars have been launched by presidents over Congressional objection, some without consultation. We are close to a second major war in Korea, the first of which, begun in 1950, was never declared by the Congress, but declared by Harry Truman to be a "police action."\u000a\u000aIn the age of the internet and cable TV, the White House is seen as a locus of decision and action, while Capitol Hill takes months to move. Watching Congress, the word torpor invariably comes to mind, which one Webster's Dictionary defines as "a state of mental and motor inactivity with partial or total insensibility."\u000a\u000aResult: In a recent survey, 72 percent of Americans expressed high confidence in the military; 12 percent said the same of Congress.\u000a\u000aThe members of Congress the TV cameras reward with air time are most often mavericks like John McCain, Lindsay Graham and Jeff Flake, who will defy a president the media largely detest.\u000a\u000aAt the onset of the post-Cold War era, some contended that democracy was the inevitable future of mankind. But autocracy is holding its own. Russia, China, India, Turkey, Egypt come to mind.\u000a\u000aIf democracy, as Freedom House contends, is in global retreat, one reason may be that, in our new age, legislatures, split into hostile blocs checkmating one another, cannot act with the dispatch impatient peoples now demand of their rulers.\u000a\u000aIn the days of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, Congress was a rival to even strong presidents. Those days are long gone.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPatrick Buchanan has been an adviser to three presidents, a two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000. He was also a founding member of "The McLaughlin Group," which began on NBC, and CNN's "Capital Gang" and "Crossfire." His latest book is: "The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority." For more of his reports, Go Here Now.

aVMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are important leaders in many fields, including government, economics, entertainment, science, education, and sports. Most would agree Mormons \u201cover index\u201d in many fields that affect millions throughout the world.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed Mormons. Still, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. And, while picking only 50 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank them in what we believe is a somewhat logical order, but certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps people on the list!) may take exception with the ranking.\u000a\u000aAlso, there are many more members of the U.S. Congress than are listed. They easily could have all been listed. We opted instead, however, to list only those with particular influence, such as committee assignments, caucus leadership, etc.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note we opted to not list the most obvious influential Mormon, namely the Church\u2019s beloved president, Thomas S. Monson, who faithful Mormons revere as a living prophet. Monson, like the other \u201cGeneral Authorities\u201d are clearly the most influential Mormons, certainly on the members of the Church. Nonetheless, for purposes of this list, we opted to look outside the Church hierarchy, and focused on leaders who are currently active in their respective secular fields of endeavor.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to nm_newstips@newsmax.com).\u000a\u000a1.

Bill Marriott \u2014 The executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International led the transformation of the family restaurant business into the world\u2019s largest lodging company. Marriott is easily one of the world\u2019s most recognizable and respected business leaders. He is also known for his tireless work within the Church and philanthropic communities.\u000a\u000a3. Orrin Hatch \u2013 Now in his seventh term as a U.S. senator for Utah, Hatch is currently chairman of the powerful Senate Committee on Finance.

Harry Reid \u2014 The senior U.S. Democratic senator from Nevada currently serves as the Senate Minority Leader.

Reid was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2001 (joining fellow members Frank Sinatra, Donald Trump, and Wayne Newton). The Searchlight, Nevada, native married his high school sweetheart, Landra, and together they have five children.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a7. Mike Lee \u2014 Having clearly stepped out of the long shadow cast by his famous late father, Rex Lee, Mike Lee became Utah\u2019s junior senator in 2011. Lee clerked for now Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito while Alito was a judge on the Third Circuit Court. Known as one of the most staunchly conservative senators, friends and associates say he is also known for his willingness to listen and learn from all sides.\u000a\u000a8. Jason Chaffetz \u2014 The U.S. Representative from Utah\u2019s 3rd District is currently chairman of the powerful House Oversight & Government Reform Committee. Chaffetz is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee. A popular guest on cable TV shows, Chaffetz is reportedly considering a run for Utah governor in 2020.\u000a\u000a9. Jon Huntsman (both and either Jr. or Sr.) \u2014 Utah\u2019s wealthiest citizen, Jon Huntsman, Sr., and eldest son, Jon, Jr., have both made their mark and each deserves to be on this list (but are hard to separate). After having built an impressive world-wide chemical company, Senior continues his influence through many channels, particularly through his philanthropy. His charitable giving now exceeds $1 billion, particularly in the fields of healthcare and education. Meanwhile, Jon, Jr., has served in several presidential administrations, including as ambassador to Singapore (1992-1993) and to China (2009-2011). In between, he took time to run for and win the governorship of Utah. In 2012, Republican Huntsman even made a run at the presidency.

Griffith joined the Church as a junior at McLean, Virginia\u2019s Langley High School.\u000a\u000a11. Mia Love \u2014 The U.S. Representative from Utah was the first African American female Republican and first Haitian American in Congress. Though she was raised Roman Catholic, she joined the LDS Church in 1998.\u000a\u000a12. Kim B. Clark \u2014 Clark was the popular dean of the Harvard School of Business from 1995 to 2005. He left that prestigious post to take up the mantle of president of Church-owned BYU-Idaho. Clark is now an LDS Church General Authority and is also the Church Commissioner of Education. Clark and his wife, Sue Lorraine, are the parents of seven children. [*As previously noted, the editors of this list decided not to include General Authorities on this list, even though they are obviously among the world\u2019s most influential Mormons. Clark is on this list both because of his role in education in the country and because of his somewhat secular role as Commissioner of Education, not because of his position as a General Authority.]\u000a\u000a13. Bryce Harper \u2013 One of Major League Baseball's undisputed superstars, Harper amps up the energy every time he takes the field for the Washington Nationals.

Bush signed the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, authorizing $82 million for suicide-prevention and awareness programs at colleges.\u000a\u000a20. Glenn Beck \u2014 Prominent conservative television and radio host, founder and host of Mercury Radio Arts, and founder of The Blaze, an independent news and entertainment television network and website.

aVIt might take as long as two years to recover from the catastrophic Hurricane Harvey, especially from flooding in Houston, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Newsmax TV on Thursday.\u000a\u000aIn an interview on "The Joe Pags Show," the Republican executive said real challenge to the can-do spirit and generosity that is "typical Texas attitude" will be needed most when the record flooding recedes.\u000a\u000a"Anyone who thinks this is going to be over in a day or two or a week or two is badly wrong," he said. "This is going to take years to dig out of. This is a catastrophe \u2013 especially the flooding in the Houston area \u2013 that's far larger than [Hurricane] Katrina."\u000a\u000a"We need the ongoing Texas attitude for another year or two to be the shining Lone Star that we are," he added.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"You will see these people break up their own . . . boat and go rescue people in the flooded waters of Houston. . . . You'll see strangers taking in strangers into their homes and helping them to safety.\u000a\u000a"This is typical Texas attitude: 'Listen, we got this, we can handle this.'"\u000a\u000aAbbott said he aimed to remain calm throughout the harrowing destruction.\u000a\u000a"The reason why we've gotten where we are right now is because everybody has kept a level head," he said. "And we need to continue to do that for today, tomorrow, throughout the next year. If we all keep our head, everything is going to work out just fine."\u000a\u000aAbbott also praised Vice President Mike Pence's visit to the ravaged state Thursday.\u000a\u000a"He was moved by the incredible damage . . . but also moved by the resiliency of the Texas spirit," he said. "I got to hold a 2-week-old baby, a baby that was born just days before the hurricane crossed our shores with his mother, beaming, just happy to be alive, happy to be a Texan. That's what the Texas spirit is all about."

aVMEXICO CITY \u2014 A major earthquake off Mexico's southern coast killed at least five people, with the president saying Friday it was the biggest in a century to hit the country. Houses and at least one hotel toppled, electricity was cut and people fled into the streets in panic.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Geological Survey reported the earthquake's magnitude as 8.1 and said it was centered off of Chiapas state near the Guatemalan border. But President Enrique Pena Nieto quoted local calculations it was 8.2, making it the largest in Mexico in 100 years \u2014 even larger than the magnitude 8.1 quake in 1985, which killed thousands and devastated large sections of Mexico City.\u000a\u000aOfficials said at least five people died, but the death toll could rise as authorities assess the damage. The government closed schools Friday in at least 11 states to check them for safety.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Geological Survey recorded at least 20 aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or greater within about five hours after the main shake, and the president warned that a major aftershock as large as magnitude 7.2 could occur.\u000a\u000aPena Nieto said that serious damage had been caused and that 1 million customers initially had been without power following the quake, but that electricity had been restored to 800,000 of them.\u000a\u000aThe USGS said the quake struck at 11:49 p.m. Thursday local time and its epicenter was 102 miles west of Tapachula in Chiapas. It had a depth of 69.7 kilometers.\u000a\u000aThe quake caused buildings to sway violently in Mexico's capital more than 1,000 kilometers (650 miles) away. Residents fled buildings, many in their pajamas, and gathered in frightened groups in the street. Some neighborhoods remained in darkness after electricity was knocked out.\u000a\u000a"The house moved like chewing gum and the light and internet went out momentarily," said Rodrigo Soberanes, who lives near San Cristobal de las Casas in the southernmost state of Chiapas.\u000a\u000aChiapas Gov. Manuel Velasco said that three people were killed in San Cristobal, including two women who died when a house and a wall collapsed. He called on people living near the coast to leave their houses as a protective measure.\u000a\u000a"There is damage to hospitals that have lost energy," he said. "Homes, schools and hospitals have been damaged."\u000a\u000aTabasco Gov. Arturo Nunez said two children had died in his Gulf coast state. One of them was killed when a wall collapsed, and the other was a baby who died in a children's hospital that lost electricity, cutting off the infant's ventilator.\u000a\u000aThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said waves of one meter (3.3 feet) above the tide level were measured off Salina Cruz, Mexico. Smaller tsunami waves were observed on the coast or measured by ocean gauges in several other places. The center's forecast said Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala could see waves of a meter or less. No threat was posed to Hawaii and the western and South Pacific.\u000a\u000aMexican authorities said they were evacuating some residents of coastal Puerto Madero because of the warning.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Mexico was bracing for another natural emergency on the other side of the country. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Katia was likely to strike the Gulf coast in the state of Veracruz early Saturday as a Category 2 storm that could bring life-threatening floods.\u000a\u000aIn neighboring Guatemala, President Jimmy Morales spoke on national television to call for calm while emergency crews checked for damage.\u000a\u000a"We have reports of some damage and the death of one person, even though we still don't have details," Morales said. He said the unconfirmed death occurred in San Marcos state near the border with Mexico.\u000a\u000aThe quake occurred in a very seismically active region near the point of collision between three tectonic plates, the Cocos, the Caribbean and the North American.\u000a\u000aMexico's National Seismological Service said the area has seen at least six other quakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater since 1900 \u2014 though three of those all occurred within a nerve-wracking nine-month span in 1902-1903.

aVTo say that Gene Michael was a hero would be an understatement. Gene was part of the era that when the Yankees were not playing well, in his graceful way he made them look so good. He took that same work ethic and charisma to help George Steinbrenner build that wonderful winning era of the nineties and beyond. He was a dear friend who loved the fact that in my book, "Yankee Miracles," a Puerto Rican kid from the Bronx during the era of Mickey Mantle and Billy Martin would say, \u201cGene Michael Your my hero!\u201d And he would always respond by saying, \u201cYou should set your sights higher.\u201d And laugh...\u000a\u000aI am on the committee for the Ted Williams Hall of Fame and I was so happy to have inducted Gene Michael into the museum. I know how happy that made him. I spoke to him yesterday and he sounded fine. He agreed to play the part of a scout in the motion picture, \u201cStano\u201d that I am currently working on. I will miss you forever my friend, my hero!\u000a\u000aOne of the very first Yankees that I met my first day in the Yankee clubhouse was Gene \u201cThe Stick\u201d Michael. I idolized Gene Michael because like me, he was a shortstop, and he was skinny. He was the most graceful infielder that I had ever seen.\u000a\u000aWhen Mr. Steinbrenner ordered Pete Sheehy, the clubhouse manager, to get me a uniform so that I could be a bat boy that night in order to work off damages for my graffiti antics, the first players to come over and introduce themselves to me were Ron Bloomberg, baseball's very first designated hitter, and Gene Michael.\u000a\u000aIt was so cool meeting him because I used to tag all around the city. \u201cThe Stick\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how much I idolized this man.\u000a\u000aI will never forget when he first extended his hand to me and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Gene Michael.\u201d He reminded me of the great actor Gary Cooper who played Lou Gehrig in \u201cThe Pride of the Yankees.\u201d He was just a very cool guy and very generous on the field. When he found out that I could play a little bit, he gave me a lot of advice about playing shortstop.\u000a\u000aYou could tell that he was a true student of the game because he studied everything when it came to baseball. Sometimes I would just stare at Gene sitting in the dugout in between at bats and he would be studying every player from the opposition.\u000a\u000aSometimes some of our players would sit next to him and ask his opinion about different situations. We used to have a player on the team by the name of Walt \u201cNo Neck\u201d Williams who loved talking all facets of the game with Gene. I would love to just sit and listen to them. It actually made me a better player because I would practice what they talked about.\u000a\u000aGene helped me with my fielding and Walt \u201cNo Neck\u201d Williams helped me with my hitting. It was no coincidence that that following year I would be drafted in the second round by the Pittsburgh Pirates. It would not have happened without the baseball tutelage from these two guys.\u000a\u000aI will never forget taking ground balls with Gene Michael. There used to be a game where we would play for a Coke. We would take ground balls and the guy that made the most errors had to get the winner a cup of Coke with ice after batting practice and put it on the stool in his locker. As you could imagine, I don\u2019t remember ever winning.\u000a\u000aGene was also the best card player I had ever seen. At that time, I think the big card game in the clubhouse was whisk and some guys played spade. I remember that Gene and Thurman Munson were always a team and they beat everybody.\u000a\u000aIn the winter, some of the players had a basketball team and the two best players were Gene Michael and Walt Williams. They used to play at different high schools and colleges in order to raise money for the school athletic programs. Late in the game, they always gave me a couple of minutes playing time and once they realized that I could play, I became the extra player who gave the starters a breather. Dick Barnett, the great Knick guard, even played with us. Barnett had once played for George Steinbrenner when the Boss owned the Cleveland Pipers of the old ABA.\u000a\u000aThe fans always loved \u201cthe Stick\u201d because he had been with the Yankees for almost 10 years and had a strong personal relationship with them. In those days, the players had to come out of the stadium and cross the street in order to get their cars in the parking lot. Gene always took the time to stop, sign autographs and talk to the fans. People used to feel like they personally knew him.\u000a\u000aI will never forget that one time in 1974, we were playing a Saturday afternoon game at Shea Stadium. After the game, I was leaving with my girlfriend and her sister and the car broke down. I ran inside to get help and when I got back to the car Gene was under the hood getting the car going! By that time, the gesture didn\u2019t surprise me because that\u2019s who Gene Michael was. Always helping.\u000a\u000aThat year Gene was our utility infielder. My very first road trip with the team was in August and we were in Chicago. It was a Saturday night and our manager, Bill Virdon, decided to start Gene at shortstop in place of Jim Mason. I was the happiest guy on the bench and I\u2019m sure Gene knew it. That day he went five for five and I was feeling like I had also gone five for five.\u000a\u000aThurman Munson was very close to Gene Michael. Thurman thought of Gene like a big brother. He knew how much I admired \u201cThe Stick\u201d and I think that opened the door to the great friendship that I would have with Thurman and his family. To this day, I consider the Munson family just that, family. Just as Bobby and Kay Murcer and their kids will always be my family also.\u000a\u000aIt is no coincidence that it all started with Gene \u201cThe Stick\u201d Michael, a man with one of the greatest baseball minds ever. He was extremely respected and loved by the Boss, George Steinbrenner. For me and a lot of kids like me of that era, Gene \u201cThe Stick\u201d Michael would always be our hero!\u000a\u000aP.S.: The first time I knew that Gene Michael was truly a baseball genius was October 18 of 1977. Reggie Jackson has just completed the greatest batting practice exhibition that I had ever seen since Mickey Mantle in 1968. Reggie probably hit 35 out of 50 balls Way-Way out of Yankee Stadium. Reggie then went to a telephone and called Gene Michael, who was our advance scout and would sit in the press box with a walkie-talkie and send info to Billy Martin. Reggie asked Gene, \u201cWhat do I look for today?\u201d Gene Michael said, \u201cFastball in. Move back in the batter\u2019s box a few inches.\u201d Reggie followed his orders perfectly and the rest is history. Three pitches and three home runs and the birth of \u201cMr. October!\u201d\u000a\u000aGene Michael would go on to manage, become a general manager, Vice President of Baseball Operations. But more importantly, one of The Boss\u2019s very best friends.\u000a\u000aRay Negron is a sports executive with over 40 years of experience in baseball. His first job came from a chance encounter with George Steinbrenner as a youth. He has become an American film producer, a best-selling author, and a philanthropist.

aVWalter Becker, guitarist, bassist and co-writer for the sophisticated, dark-humored band Steely Dan, has died. He was 67.\u000a\u000aThe news was confirmed by a post on Becker's personal website. No cause of death was announced.\u000a\u000aThe more retiring full-term member of the group, Becker was partnered with singer-keyboardist and co-writer Donald Fagen on a string of jazzy, sleekly produced singles and albums that ruled the charts during the '70s. After a protracted hiatus, "the Dan" returned to popularity in the '90s; their 2000 album "Two Against Nature" collected four Grammys, including one for album of the year.\u000a\u000aThe pair's gimlet-eyed, covertly perverse music, garbed in gleaming pop melodies, bebop-derived harmonies and shimmering production, was variously performed with a core working band in the group's initial heyday; those players were ultimately, and permanently, supplanted by a rotating cast of mostly jazz-schooled studio sidemen.\u000a\u000aBecker was largely absent from the musical stage during Steely Dan's extended separation from 1981-93. It was only after the group's reunion that he undertook solo recording: His albums "11 Tracks of Whack" (produced by Fagen in 1994) and "Circus Money" (2008) failed to duplicate the band's success.\u000a\u000aHe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Fagen in 2001; with typical dry humor, the pair tersely solicited questions from the star-filled audience during one of the shortest acceptance speeches on record.\u000a\u000aBecker was born Feb. 20, 1950, in Queens, N.Y., and was raised in the borough community. Initially a saxophonist, he took up the guitar as a teen.\u000a\u000aHe encountered his future partner Fagen as a student at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, while playing a gig at the local club the Red Balloon. In his 2013 memoir "Eminent Hipsters," Fagen - who studied music and English at the school -- recalled, "His amp was tweaked to produce a fat, mellow sound, and turned up loud enough to generate a healthy Albert King-like sustain."\u000a\u000aThe musicians bonded over their love of jazz and blues and the writing of such novelists as Vladimir Nabokov and humorists Bruce Jay Friedman and Terry Southern. They performed together in a number of campus bands, including one, the Leather Canary, which included classmate and future "Saturday Night Live" star Chevy Chase on drums.\u000a\u000aBecker withdrew from Bard without a diploma; after Fagen graduated in 1969, the musicians moved to Brooklyn to find work in the professional music business. They served as studio members of the pop act Jay and the Americans. In 1971, the duo decamped to Los Angeles to serve as house songwriters for ABC/Dunhill, the publishing firm operated by the Americans' record label.\u000a\u000aImpressed by Fagen and Becker's songwriting, label president Jay Lasker offered the pair a contract with the label. They organized a working group with New York guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist Jeff "Skunk" Baxter and drummer Jimmy Hodder; on early recordings with this lineup, Becker usually served as bassist.\u000a\u000aDubbed Steely Dan after a like-named sex toy in William S. Burroughs' black-hearted novel "Naked Lunch," the unit debuted in 1972 with the LP "Can't Buy a Thrill." Produced by Gary Katz (who shepherded all the act's '70s releases), it spawned the massive radio hit "Do It Again," which climbed to No. 6; the follow-up single "Reeling in the Years" peaked at No. 11.\u000a\u000aThe sophomore set "Countdown to Ecstasy" (1973) - which included "My Old School," a backhanded tribute to Fagen and Becker's alma mater Bard - was perhaps too bitter for most listeners and failed to produce any hits.\u000a\u000aHowever, album rockers lofted the 1974 collection "Pretzel Logic" to No. 8. Driven mainly by the work of such jazz-bred sidemen as saxophonists Jerome Richardson and Ernie Watts and bassist Wilton Felder of the Crusaders, the album included the No. 4 single "Rikki Don't Lose That Number," which baldly lifted the keyboard hook of jazz keyboardist Horace Silver's "Song For My Father."\u000a\u000aGrowing tension within the band and Fagen and Becker's antipathy for touring led to the dissolution of the touring Steely Dan configuration in 1974, and the duo would thereafter perform with a succession of studio musicians. Becker increasingly took on lead guitar chores, though such players as Lee Ritenour, Rick Derringer, Dean Parks, Elliott Randall, Larry Carlton and Mark Knopfler also contributed.\u000a\u000aThe albums "Katie Lied" (No. 13, 1975) and "The Royal Scam" (No. 15, 1976) bore no hit singles, but were lofted by FM radio play. The group's biggest early hit came with "Aja," a shimmering No. 3 set that included the top-20 singles "Peg" and "Deacon Blues."\u000a\u000aA confluence of difficulties led to the band's 1981 dissolution. The prolonged making of "Gaucho," which contained Steely Dan's final top-10 hit "Hey Nineteen," witnessed burgeoning antipathy between the two long-running partners.\u000a\u000a"It was the 'Gaucho' album that finished us off,' Becker said in a 1994 interview with England's Independent. "We had pursued an idea beyond the point where it was practical. That album took about two years, and we were working on it all of that time - all these endless tracking sessions involving different musicians. It took forever and it was a very painful process."\u000a\u000aThe personality clashes were exacerbated by a lawsuit engendered by the drug overdose death of Fagen's girlfriend Karen Stanley and a serious injury sustained by Becker when he was struck by a New York cab.\u000a\u000aBecker retreated to the Hawaiian island of Maui, where he grappled with drug abuse and laid low. "I spent a couple of years not doing any music or anything, just here in Hawaii trying to get healthy and adjust to the new regimen I was setting up for myself," he told England's Mojo magazine in 1995.\u000a\u000aHe crept back to work as a producer, helming albums by China Crisis ("Flaunt the Imperfection," 1985), Rickie Lee Jones ("Flying Cowboys," 1989) and Michael Franks ("Blue Pacific," 1990).\u000a\u000aHis work on Rosie Vela's 1986 collection "Zazu" marked his first work with Fagen since the breakup of Steely Dan; five years later, he gigged informally with Fagen's group the New York Rock and Soul Revue, which harbingered the partnership's touring reunion in 1993 in support of the comprehensive boxed set "Citizen Steely Dan."\u000a\u000aAn extended period of studio work resulted in the self-produced "Two Against Nature," which climbed to No. 6 and collected new kudos. The following year, Bard dropout Becker and partner Fagen received honorary music doctorates from the Berklee College of Music.\u000a\u000aA second new Steely Dan release, the No. 9 set "Everything Must Go" (2003), included Becker's first-ever lead vocal with the group, on the track "Slang of Ages."\u000a\u000aIn later years, Becker also served as a writer for the jazzy vocalist Madeleine Peyroux's "Half the Perfect World" (2006) and "Bare Bones" (2009).

There were few women consultants, there were few women candidates, there were certainly few women congressmen and office-holders," she said. "I'd walk into the RNC and I'd walk into other Republican political situations, which I have described as walking into the men's locker room at the Elks Club holding a bachelor party.\u000a\u000a"My comfort level came in learning how to think like a man and to behave like a lady," she added, saying that this allowed her to become "the highest ranking non-relative female in [the] White House."\u000a\u000aConway also said, "In explaining how I feel about one thing that Donald Trump said or did to my daughters, I would be remiss in not revealing the full conversation, which is also why Mommy, who's a woman, did not support the first female presidential candidate for a major party."\u000a\u000a"I would tell them that I respect very much that Secretary Clinton was running for president, and it showed that in this country, anybody can do anything if they set their mind to it," she continued. "At the same time, I tried to explain to them that you could be excited for someone with whom you disagree, and share in that moment in history as a proud American."

They contain the amino acid tryptophan, which increases levels of serotonin, helping to maintain normally pleasant moods. Folate found in legumes may also decrease the risk of depression.containing omega-3 fatty acids are among the best foods to prevent anxiety and depression with mood-boosting substances. Research has linked depression with a lack of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, WebMD reported. Higher rates of major depressive disorder occur in areas where people don\u2019t get enough omega-3s than in societies that normally have the healthy fats in their diets. People can get healthy doses of omega-3s from tuna, lake trout, salmon, mackerel, and sardines. These heart-healthy fish are best consumed through grilling or baking rather than frying to avoid fats.

It said 3,695 people reached the Greek islands in August, the highest number since March 2016, when a European Union-Turkey agreement came into effect to reduce the migrant flow. The previous highest figure was last August, when 3,447 people arrived.\u000a\u000aThe figures are far lower than during the peak of the refugee crisis in late 2015, when thousands were arriving daily.\u000a\u000aThe UNHCR called for "robust action to improve conditions" and the deployment of more staff.\u000a\u000a10 a.m.\u000a\u000aHungary's prime minister says that a ruling by the European Union's top court upholding the relocation of asylum-seekers opens the way to a "mixed culture and population" on the continent.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Viktor Orban says Hungary, which is refusing to take part in the EU scheme to temporarily relocate refugees from Greece and Italy, is not an "immigrant country" nor does it want to be one.\u000a\u000aOrban has kept immigration on top of his political agenda since 2015. He said Friday on state radio that he "took note" of the European Court of Justice ruling which rejected legal arguments by Hungary and Slovakia against the EU decision creating the relocation scheme.\u000a\u000aHe says "now instead of a legal fight, we have to fight a political fight" to change the decision.

aVExpectant moms who take the recommended amounts of folic acid around the time they conceive may reduce their children's risk of pesticide-related autism.\u000a\u000aHaving adequate amounts of the B vitamin folic acid before and during early pregnancy is known to reduce the risks of birth defects of the brain and spine in babies.\u000a\u000aResearchers at University of California, Davis found that that taking 800 or more micrograms of folic acid during pregnancy significantly lowered the babies' risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD), even when their mothers were exposed to household or agricultural pesticides.\u000a\u000a"We found that if the mom was taking folic acid during the window around conception, the risk associated with pesticides seemed to be attenuated," said Rebecca J. Schmidt, assistant professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences. "Mothers should try to avoid pesticides. But if they live near agriculture, where pesticides can blow in, this might be a way to counter those effects."\u000a\u000aFor the study, researchers looked at 296 children between 2 and 5 who had been diagnosed with ASD and 220 who had developed typically. Mothers were interviewed about their household pesticide exposure during pregnancy, as well as their folic acid and B vitamin intake. Data from agricultural spraying was also linked with the mothers' addresses.\u000a\u000aMothers who took less than 800 micrograms and encountered household pesticides had a much higher estimated risk of having a child who developed an ASD than moms who took 800 micrograms of folic acid or more and were not exposed to pesticides.\u000a\u000aThe risk increased according to the amount of exposure. Women with low folic acid intake who were exposed to agricultural pesticides during a window from three months before conception to three months afterward also were at higher estimated risk.\u000a\u000a"The mothers who had the highest risk were the ones who were exposed to pesticides regularly," Schmidt said. "It would be better for women to avoid chronic pesticide exposure if they can while pregnant."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.\u000a\u000aA form of folic acid called folinic acid could improve the communication skills of children with autism, according to a study from Arkansas Children's Research Institute. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that high prescription doses of folinic acid not only helped autistic children communicate better, but also identified specific biomarkers that could single out which children were most likely to respond to treatment.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one child in 68 had autism in 2010, a 119.4 percent increase from 2000.

aVThe surprise news Wednesday that Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash., would not seek re-election next year had as much impact in the nation\u2019s capital as it did in Washington state.\u000a\u000aThe announcement by Reichert, 67, came on the heels of the decision by Rep. Tom Marino, R-Pa., to leave the House and accept President Trump\u2019s offer to become the administration\u2019s \u201cdrug czar.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince New Year\u2019s Day, then, the total of Republican U.S. representatives so far announcing they are either resigning or not running again is twelve: four to take jobs in the Trump Administration, three to run for governor, and five to simply step down.\u000a\u000a\u201cBy contrast,\u201d noted David Weigel of The Washington Post, \u201cjust seven Democrats have left or announced plans to leave the House, and all but one \u2014 Rep. Niki Tsongas \u2014 did so to seek higher office.\u201d\u000a\u000aDo these figures somehow translate, as some pundits have suggested, into a better chance of Democrats turning the present breakdown of the House (240 Republicans, 194 Democrats, one vacancy) into one under Democratic control? Not exactly.\u000a\u000aIt was widely reported, for example, that since Donald Trump won only 44 percent in Reichert\u2019s 8th District (Seattle) last fall, the seat was ripe for the taking by Democrats. State Democratic officials boasted that they had four Democratic hopefuls in the race even before Reichert's announcement.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut that analysis won\u2019t hold water,\u201d Seattle\u2019s veteran conservative radio talk-show host Kirby Wilbur told Newsmax. \u201cWhile Trump was losing the 8th, Dave Reichert was winning re-election with more than 60 percent. Voters know how to split their tickets.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs King County sheriff from 1997 until his election to Congress in 2004, Reichert was known primarily as a two-fisted (and non-political) lawman. He made worldwide headlines in 2001 for his capture of Gary Ridgeway, the notorious \u201cGreen River Killer\u201d who murdered at least 48 women over a 20-year period.\u000a\u000aIt was the reputation from his days in law enforcement that almost surely helped make Reichert unbeatable at the polls. However, many grass-roots GOP activists were not pleased with his non-conservative stance. Reichert was 1 of 15 House Republicans to vote for repealing the \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy of not allowing openly gay people in the military and also was one of the 20 House Republicans to vote against the replacement measure for Obamacare known as the American Health Care Act.\u000a\u000aRepublicans expect a more conservative figure to be their candidate: former State Sen. Dino Rossi, 57, who initially led in the 2004 race for governor but was ruled out in a much-disputed recount that gave the governorship to Christine Gregoire.\u000a\u000aIn Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th District, area Republicans are already preparing for the party committee meetings that will select a nominee in a special election sure to be called to fill Marino\u2019s seat. Stalwart conservative State Rep. Fred Zeller, 51, is considered the favorite for nomination.\u000a\u000aSince the Scranton-based district has been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1960, it seems a sure bet it will remain that way after the special election.

aVTwo U.S. students claim they were raped by Italian policemen who escorted them home in a patrol car from a nightclub, and Florence prosecutors were investigating the allegations Friday.\u000a\u000aItalian authorities said the 21-year-old students were questioned by prosecutors for several hours Thursday about their allegations. The women accused the officers of raping them early Thursday morning in their apartment building.\u000a\u000aItaly has two main police forces that patrol its streets \u2014 the paramilitary Carabinieri, which are under the defense ministry, and the state police, who report to the interior ministry.\u000a\u000aItaly's defense minister said the two policemen will be immediately suspended if rape charges are lodged against them.\u000a\u000a"Investigation is still underway, but there is some basis in respect to the allegations," Minister Roberta Pinotti said Friday evening at a forum about women's issues in Milan. "Rape is always something grave. But it's of unprecedented gravity if it is committed by Carabinieri in uniform, because citizens turns to them and to their uniform to have assurances and security."\u000a\u000aItalian media say three patrol cars went to a nightclub to investigate a fight. Two cars left after calm was restored, but the third remained. The women, who reportedly spent the evening in the nightclub, told authorities that the officers drove them to their apartment building and raped them.\u000a\u000aNews reports described witnesses as confirming that they saw the women enter the patrol car.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. consul general in Florence met for about an hour with Florence's state police chief Friday morning about the case, the Italian news agency ANSA said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Embassy in Rome refused to comment "due to the sensitive nature of this case and to protect the privacy of those involved."\u000a\u000aThe women reportedly arrived in Florence several months ago to study Italian at a language institute.\u000a\u000aFlorence, with its many museums and churches full with Renaissance masterpieces, is a popular destination for many Americans, especially university students.\u000a\u000aOne heavily followed crime case involved the murder of American Ashley Olsen in her apartment in January 2016. Later that year, a court in Florence convicted a Senegalese man of killing the 35-year-old and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.

aVSocial Security has generally lost visibility as Washington and voters have focused on healthcare. It is ironic because any questions about healthcare should put Social Security in the spotlight on the front-page.\u000a\u000aA Strange Place to Lose Visibility\u000a\u000aWhy? The Affordable Care Act (ACA) added about $1 trillion of projected revenue to the program in 2010 (see the comments for details). At the time, economists believed that this legislation would cause paychecks to rise as healthcare costs are reduced. This sequence is great for Social Security because compensation will shift from healthcare premiums that are exempt from payroll taxes to wages that are taxable.\u000a\u000aI am not saying that the ACA was smart legislation, nor that laws by themselves will control the cost of healthcare. The point here is that the Trustees assume that it would push the cost of health insurance down and consequently the paychecks of workers higher.\u000a\u000aQuestions about the financial stability of Social Security are drawing near zero attention because of a healthcare initiative that stands to cost the program $1 trillion.\u000a\u000aThe ACA = Higher Wages Far Into the Future\u000a\u000aHere is the theory condensed. Employee compensation is broken into two parts, wages and the costs associated with employment. Health insurance is an example of the latter. If the costs of employment go down, wages must rise so that total compensation remains the same.\u000a\u000aThat is the theory, and it depends upon two different assumptions. First, the ACA will lower the cost of health insurance experienced by the employer. Second, the employer will spend the savings on employee wages.\u000a\u000aThe economics are sound, and discussed in greater detail in the 2010 Trustees Report. More analysis can be found on the SSA\u2019s site (see independent analysis). In that report, the authors concluded:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe health insurance cost trends exerted a disproportionate downward pressure on money wages below the taxable maximum.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf you doubt their reasoning, healthcare costs are a visible element of rising income inequality. This is part of the reason that the program\u2019s revenue base has fallen from 90 percent of wages to 83 percent over the past 30 years.\u000a\u000aWe Are Talking a Lot of Money\u000a\u000aThe ACA represents a $1 trillion smart-move for Social Security.\u000a\u000aThis money does not arrive in one year. It arrives over the course of decades. The $1 trillion figure is the value in 2010, so we are dealing with a massive change. We are talking about repealing the law, and no one is talking about breaking Social Security.\u000a\u000aAre They Right?\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t know, but the 2017 Trustees Report gives you an idea of what might happen if they are even slightly wrong. In that tome, the trustees decided that the projected cost savings were too high. The CMS data that they review suggests that businesses were not saving as much as we had previously expected. So there is less money to share with employees. The drop was nearly .01 percent, a figure so small that it was lost in the rounding process. That adjustment led the Trustees to increase the system\u2019s unfunded liabilities by $500 billion.\u000a\u000aThe Visible Takeaway\u000a\u000aBefore we dismantle the ACA, someone ought to ask what will happen to Social Security.\u000a\u000aFor people interested in the question, the Bipartisan Policy Center published a preview of the 2017 Social Security and Medicare Trustees\u2019 Reports written by the former Public Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds Charles P. Blahous III, Ph.D. and Robert D.

aVSPECIAL:\u000a\u000aFeeling Down? Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aNegative thoughts and feelings can lead to depression. Mindfulness therapy, also called mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or MBCT, offers people with depression a way to change their patterns of thinking to help boost a healthy mood, according to the American Psychological Association Depression patients often suffer from thoughts regarding the past. They may have experienced abuse while growing up or other events throughout their lives that have made them focus more on negative beliefs about themselves. This can intensify depressive moods and also interferes with recovery from depression through therapy or medication.Negative thoughts can pop up for people even as they are going through daily routines that don\u2019t seem related to the past. Mindfulness therapy helps people with depression recognize the thought patterns and emotions they experience throughout the day. They learn to know when the mind starts to wander into the past and return thoughts to the present moment.Through therapists or programs, patients incorporate mindfulness therapy in other exercises, such as yoga or body awareness, according to the American Psychological Association. People also use mindfulness in their daily routine, whether at work or play. They pay attention to what they are doing while being aware of thoughts of the past that might bring them into negative patterns.People with depression may also subject themselves to worries about the future, especially when past events affect their emotions. The therapy helps them to stop blaming themselves for what happened in the past or thinking about future events. Instead, they focus on the more important things of the moment.The APA reported that research suggests MBCT helped prevent recurring depression as effectively as medication. There are no side effects associated with mindfulness therapy, and drugs for depression lose effectiveness over time.Mindfulness therapy is combined with cognitive therapy, which focuses on resisting damaging thoughts and emotions. The mindfulness part of the therapy then increases awareness of negative trends so they can be replaced with positive thoughts of the moment, CBS News reported People with depression learn that negative thinking patterns are distorted thoughts, which might include such phrases as, \u201cI always make mistakes,\u201d according to Psych Central . Mindfulness therapy eventually takes the power away from these thoughts and words so they are no longer considered important or relevant.

aVWhen oil giant Saudi Aramco discloses its financials for the first time next year, it must either surprise investors with world record profits or reduce its aspirations for a $2 trillion valuation in its initial public offering (IPO).\u000a\u000aInvestors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure suggested by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investments aimed at helping wean the world\u2019s biggest oil exporting nation off dependency on crude.\u000a\u000aBased on Aramco\u2019s oil reserves of 261 billion barrels and a valuation of $7 to $8 per barrel in line with recent industry acquisitions - such as Total\u2019s purchase of Maersk\u2019s oil assets - Aramco warrants close to the $2 trillion valuation.\u000a\u000aBut that is not the only metric for an energy firm\u2019s worth. By other measures, Aramco\u2019s target valuation may be challenging.\u000a\u000aMost other metrics for the world\u2019s largest oil producing company are simply not known and will not be disclosed until Aramco publishes financial results before the planned IPO in 2018.\u000a\u000aYet a simple calculation using globally accepted ratios for Aramco\u2019s peers - enterprise value versus core earnings (EV/EBITDA) - shows the Saudi firm has to report EBITDA in the region of $130 billion to achieve a $2 trillion valuation.\u000a\u000aSuch an EBITDA figure would be a global first. No firm in any industry has reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) above $100 billion.\u000a\u000aBy comparison, Apple (AAPL.O), the technology giant and the world\u2019s most valuable listed firm that is worth more than $830 billion, reported EBITDA of $82 billion in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.\u000a\u000aAWAITING BOOK-BUILDING\u000a\u000aExxon Mobil, the world\u2019s largest listed energy firm with a market capitalization of $365 billion in 2016, reported EBITDA of $23 billion last year, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. In 2012, it reported EBITDA of $65 billion - but that was when oil traded well above $100 a barrel. Benchmark Brent crude is now around $54.\u000a\u000aLast year, Exxon traded at EV/EBITDA of more than 15 times, which is high by energy industry standards. If Aramco matched that same high ratio, its core earnings would need to be around $130 billion to achieve its target valuation.\u000a\u000aAramco would not be drawn when asked to comment on how it would achieve the $2 trillion figure.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is highly speculative. We do not comment on speculation or rumor,\u201d the company told Reuters in a statement.\u000a\u000aA Saudi Arabia-based industry source said Aramco\u2019s value could not be calculated until the completion of book-building to assess investor appetite.\u000a\u000aThe source said it was misleading to compare Aramco with Exxon, which has less than half the Saudi firm\u2019s oil output and not even a 10th of its reserves. EBITDA should not be the only measure, the source added.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, Aramco would do well to secure Exxon\u2019s high ratios. Investors tend to like Exxon more than other oil firms, handing it ratios that are sometimes more generous than popular technology firms such as Google and Apple.\u000a\u000aFor example, Exxon\u2019s rivals Shell, BP and Total trade at EV/EBITDA of around six times. If Aramco was assessed at that level, it would need to show core earnings at an astonishing $330 billion a year to achieve a valuation of $2 trillion.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne thing you never do ahead of an IPO is to tell the market how much the company will be worth as you immediately become hostage to a number or a timetable,\u201d said a Western investment banker, who was involved in listing another state energy firm.\u000a\u000aDRAWING CONCLUSIONS\u000a\u000aYet Aramco could prove hugely profitable, given its oil output of about 10 million barrels per day (bpd) and some of the world\u2019s cheapest crude recovery rates, alongside its global refinery network that adds further value.\u000a\u000aExxon by comparison has less than half Aramco\u2019s output - with oil-equivalent production of 4 million bpd in 2016, while the U.S. firm\u2019s reserves are a fraction of Aramco\u2019s - with proved oil-equivalent reserves of about 20 billion barrels.\u000a\u000aAramco has never published results, but conclusions about its earnings can be drawn from Saudi Arabia\u2019s accounts, given oil constitutes the lion\u2019s share of the nation\u2019s revenues, said Fareed Mohamedi, chief economist at U.S.-based Rapidan Group.\u000a\u000a\u201cBased on the Saudi current-account balance, Aramco had revenues of $160 billion last year from just oil and refined products exports when the average price of oil was $43 a barrel,\u201d Mohamedi said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo if the price of oil goes to $70 per barrel, it is not impossible for Aramco to make a top line of $250 billion a year. Given that operational costs of Aramco are one of the lowest in the world, it is not impossible to see them reporting the bottom line or earnings on a huge scale \u2013 of $100 billion a year and above,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFinancials aside, investors will also assess country risk when working out Aramco\u2019s valuation.\u000a\u000aExxon benefits from having its headquarters in the United States, even if some of its operations and production are in politically unstable nations.\u000a\u000aAramco\u2019s head office is in Saudi Arabia, a nation in a volatile region with a war in Yemen on its doorstep.\u000a\u000a\u201cAramco is definitely a fantastic, modern and high-quality company,\u201d said the Western banker. \u201cBut unfortunately, no one can say that Saudi Arabia is a fantastic country from the geopolitical prospect.\u201d

aVThe House has voted overwhelmingly to send a $15.3 billion disaster aid package to President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aLawmakers overcame objections from conservatives who didn't want the emergency aid linked to a temporary increase in America's borrowing authority.\u000a\u000aThe measure keeps the government funded into December.\u000a\u000aThe vote was 316-90. The measure would refill depleted emergency accounts, as Florida braces for the impact of Hurricane Irma and Texas picks up the pieces after the devastation of Harvey.\u000a\u000aIt's only the first installment of a federal aid package that could rival or exceed the $100 billion-plus provided after Hurricane Katrina. Future installments are likely to be more difficult to pass.\u000a\u000aThe vote postpones budget decisions into December and forces another politically difficult debt limit vote next year.

aVThe theme of President Donald Trump's policies \u2014 including illegal immigration and the DACA program \u2014 is following the law, Dr. Sebastian Gorka told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on "America Talks Live," Gorka told host Miranda Khan that Trump is thinking about one thing.\u000a\u000a"Very few people understand what undergoes the Trump administration's and the Trump campaign's polices, whether it's on trade, immigration, ISIS, you name it," said Gorka, who resigned last week as a deputy adviser to the president. "The thing that undergoes all of them is sovereignty and rule of law.\u000a\u000a"The idea that there are people like me, who have to wait in line for several years to become legal immigrants to the United States, and there are some that simply can flout the laws and be given amnesty as they were under the last administration. That is wrong.\u000a\u000a"We are a nation of laws. We are a nation of rule of law and as such, and nobody gets a break and as a result, DACA is important, and I do hope the president makes the right decision."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

North Korea continues to test both its ICBM and nuclear programs. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said Monday the reclusive nation is "begging for war" as it continues to ignore strong warnings from the international community.\u000a\u000a"The president has been very clear, no options are off the table," Gorka said. "The ball was in [North Korean leader Kim] Jong Un's court. They refused to deescalate, and that is bad news for the region."

aVThere may be at least one advantage to being short: a lower risk for dangerous blood clots in the veins, a new study shows.\u000a\u000aThese clots, called venous thromboembolisms, include blockages known as DVTs (deep vein thrombosis), which typically start in the legs and can travel to the lungs, raising a person's odds for stroke.\u000a\u000aSometimes DVTs occur after long-haul flights, so they've been dubbed "economy class syndrome." But new research suggests a slight advantage for shorter people in avoiding the clots.\u000a\u000aWhy the effect? "It could just be that because taller individuals have longer leg veins there is more surface area where problems can occur," theorized study lead author Dr. Bengt Zoller.\u000a\u000a"There is also more gravitational pressure in leg veins of taller persons that can increase the risk of blood flow slowing or temporarily stopping," noted Zoller, an associate professor at Lund University and Malmo University Hospital, in Sweden.\u000a\u000aAccording to the American Heart Association, up to 600,000 people in the United States develop a blood clot that starts in a vein each year. Risk factors for these clots include having surgery, cancer and being immobilized or hospitalized. Pregnancy or taking hormonal oral birth control pills or estrogen therapy for menopause can also cause blood clots.\u000a\u000aAlthough the new study can't prove a cause-and-effect link, one U.S. heart expert said other recent research has also suggested a connection between height and clots in veins.\u000a\u000a"As we can't do much about our height, it is worthwhile considering some preventative action" in shielding taller folks against these clots, said Dr. Maja Zaric. She's a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\u000a\u000a"Wearing gradual support stockings along with avoidance of dehydration and increasing walking during 'periods of risk' [such as prolonged sitting] may help prevent the problem before it occurs," Zaric said.\u000a\u000aThe new study involved more than 2.6 million people from Sweden: male soldiers whose health was tracked from the 1950s to the 1990s, and newly pregnant women tracked from 1969 to 2010.\u000a\u000aThe entire study group consisted of sibling pairs, to tease out any genetic or environmental factors, the researchers explained.\u000a\u000aZoller's team found that men shorter than 5 feet 3 inches were 65 percent less likely than men 6 feet 2 inches or taller to develop one of these clots.\u000a\u000aThe risk dropped 69 percent for women shorter than 5 feet 1 inch who were pregnant for the first time, compared to women 6 feet or taller, Zoller's team reported Sept. 5 in Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics.\u000a\u000aOf course, "height is not something we can do anything about," Zoller said in a journal news release. And he noted that "the height in the population has increased, and continues increasing, which could be contributing to the fact that the incidence of thrombosis has increased."\u000a\u000aThe study does has some limitations. The researchers said they weren't able to consider lifestyle factors from the participants' childhood, such as diet, physical activity and whether or not their parents smoked. But they believe their findings could possibly apply to the U.S. population, because the current Swedish population is now similarly ethnically diverse.\u000a\u000aAnd Zaric agreed that a link between height and clotting seems plausible.\u000a\u000a"This can be explained by the simple mechanics of a large and long blood vessel being exposed to the higher gravitational force which is exerted on the 'longer' blood column," she said. This could cause blood to flow less well, "which in turn may trigger development of a clot in the leg veins," Zaric said.

aVGrowing your own food provides many benefits including saving money, enjoying chemical-free foods, the enjoyment of working with nature, high food quality, and more. If you\u2019ve always dreamt of keeping a vegetable garden but your home doesn\u2019t sit on acres of sunny land, don\u2019t fret. You can grow your own healthy food in small spaces with these tips.\u000a\u000aAlert: Heart Surgeon's Secret to Healthy Blood Pressure\u000a\u000a1. Break convention \u2013 If you have nothing more than a sunny front stoop in the city, take after Gayla Trail of You Grow Girl, and plant containers you might otherwise use for annual flowers with edibles instead. Besides the obvious choice of growing herbs and greens, Gayla recommends dwarf varieties of cherry tomatoes and hot peppers.\u000a\u000a2. Square foot gardening \u2013 This ingenious method of planting was developed by gardener and author Mel Bartholomew and involves planting with minimal spacing between plants in raised beds. According to Olivia\u2019s Solutions, a square foot garden requires 80% less space than a traditional row-planted garden.\u000a\u000a3. Go vertical \u2013 Just as building a skyscraper in a crowded city maximizes space, so too does planting vertically. By growing crops that can be trellised or trained to go up a structure such as cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, and peas, you can maximize food from each precious inch of your garden, says Mother Earth News.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a4. Plant small varieties \u2013 If you don\u2019t have abundant space, you may have to forgo your dreams of planting pumpkins or winter squash. However, in the world of plants, there are seemingly endless different varieties, many of which require only a small sunny space. For instance, Mother Earth News says \u2018Ophelia\u2019 eggplant needs only a container to grow, \u2018Bush delicata\u2019 squash is a compact summer squash that won\u2019t take over the garden, and \u2018Totem\u2019 tomato plants top out at just 2 feet.\u000a\u000a5. Try edible landscaping \u2013 According to Rosalind Creasy, this means integrating edibles in to your otherwise ornamental landscape. That could mean planting colorful Swiss chard among the colorful annuals that flank your front walkway or tucking pollinator-friendly dill or mint into a perennial border.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Secret Water Cure to Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVWhile I am writing this, reports of hurricane Irma\u2019s devastation are still pouring in. Clearly, nature has flipped. Scientists have been warning for years that global warming means stronger storms and increasingly frequent freak weather. But knowing this will happen and seeing it unfolding are two different things.\u000a\u000aBut this column is not about disasters. It is about hope and about taking action.\u000a\u000aIn my previous column, I wrote that our main problem is not natural disasters, but our alienation from each other. I suggested a practical way to create positive conversation and shared a link to a free download of my book \u201cCompleting the Circle,\u201d which, among other things, offers connection games and ideas for conversations that help people connect.\u000a\u000aA few days later, I learned that two young men, who happen to also be studying with me, initiated such a discussion with survivors of hurricane Harvey, and even filmed the conversation. If you want to have hope in the future of America, you owe it to yourself to watch the abbreviated documentation. These beautiful, intelligent young people did not know each other prior to that meeting, and judging by their appearances, chances are their paths would never have converged were it not for Harvey\u2019s devastation. Yet, these millennials prove by their very conduct that solidarity throughout America is possible.\u000a\u000aThis horrific hurricane season will be over in a couple of months, and the fires in Western United States will be extinguished. If we put this menacing summer behind us and go on as before, we\u2019ll have wasted a chance to make a real change.\u000a\u000aOne of the participants in the filmed discussion said, \u201cThe mindset that we have, everybody here sitting at this table, hopefully they pass it forward.\u201d Another one added that when \u201cthere is only one goal, to help people, it restores my faith in humanity seeing everyone working together hand to hand \u2026 making connection that I believe wouldn\u2019t be possible if it wasn\u2019t for such a devastating situation, and it\u2019s sad to say that. Hopefully, the media portrays that and shows that people can come together even without a time of need and that we\u2019re not separated by belief, religion, or any of the other factors.\u201d\u000a\u000aNaturally, such isolated initiatives cannot change the face of the country. But this is nonetheless a proof of concept, which is why I\u2019m sharing it here. The authorities can and should utilize people\u2019s currently enhanced sensitivity and direct them toward seeing the power of connection.\u000a\u000aAfter less than 45 minutes of discussion, the participants, who as I said, did not know each other prior to meeting, felt so close that they exchanged emails and phone numbers. If it\u2019s that easy, given the right mode of discussion, why shouldn\u2019t every American benefit from this?\u000a\u000aIn fact, human connection is more impactful than we think. In the early 1970s, renowned physicist Dennis Gabor said, \u201cTill now man has been up against Nature; from now on he will be up against his own nature.\u201d But instead of focusing on human nature, we are looking for ways to fix nature itself, and in doing so, we\u2019re missing the whole point. Our own ill-will causes every problem in the world. Global warming, financial meltdowns that impoverish millions of people, war, famine, depression, substance abuse, inequality, and racism are all man-made disasters. If we fixed our ill-will, which causes all these crises, we wouldn\u2019t have a worry in the world.\u000a\u000aAnd the way to fix ill-will is by establishing positive human connections. This is why I am so adamant about discussions like the one I mention here.\u000a\u000aThere comes a time when you must look in the mirror and say, \u201cI\u2019m done blaming others for my problems; I have to take responsibility.\u201d As a society, we are at that point. Now is our time to start \u201cpracticing\u201d positivity toward each other. It is a conscious effort that may feel a little unnatural at first, but as we all know, practice makes perfect. And in this case, it takes very little practice to make huge progress, just look at that video.\u000a\u000aIf every person in your community attended just one or two such meetings a week, within a month the whole neighborhood would change. Going to the supermarket would mean going to see friends because you would know other shoppers, or you would know their friends, who would introduce you to their friends, and you would come home smiling. In such an atmosphere, it will be natural to care for one another and society will easily find its balance.\u000a\u000aIn such a caring space, the rest of our problems will sort themselves out, which will affect our entire environment, from human society all of nature. As it turns out, restoring nature\u2019s sanity begins with our positive connections.\u000a\u000aMichael Laitman is a global thinker living in Israel.

aVAn international team of researchers has identified a compound in cruciferous vegetables shows promise as the foundation for a new drug that can kill melanoma skin cancer without harming healthy cells.\u000a\u000aTwo Pen State College of Medicine researchers designed and synthesized a compound called NISC-6 found naturally in vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. The researchers found that the compound killed life-threatening melanoma cells and blocked tumor growth roughly 69 percent of the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was more of a fragment-based drug design,\u201d Dr. Arun Sharma, associate professor of pharmacology and leader of the study, writes in The European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. \u201cWe took isoselenocyanate moiety (fragments) from an earlier drug design we had worked on and then combined it with napthalamide moiety of mitonafide, a topo II\u03b1 inhibitor."\u000a\u000aIn layman\u2019s terms, the study authors took a naturally occurring element found in certain vegetables \u2014 known to help combat cancer \u2014 and tested how it fought melanoma.\u000a\u000a"There are a lot of recommendations that, for example, broccoli can reduce your chances of getting cancer," says Sharma. "Those are OK recommendations for prevention, but the compounds in the vegetables alone may not be potent enough to be used in a therapeutic environment."\u000a\u000aThe doctors tweaked a few components to improve the drug\u2019s effectiveness. Eventually, after numerous iterations, the doctors created a compound that they believed could kill the cancer cells without damaging the healthy surrounding tissues \u2014 which marks a significant improvement on chemotherapy and radiation.\u000a\u000a"We designed it for easy elimination from the body, so, consequently, toxicity should be reduced," says Sharma. "We also think, with this compound and this type of approach, if it goes further, we should be able to delay, or overcome resistance because it not only targets BRAF mutant melanoma cells, but also BRAF wild type melanoma cells."\u000a\u000aSharma says NISC-6 may also work on other forms of cancer. Melanoma is responsible for more than 75 percent of skin cancer deaths.\u000a\u000aAs more research continues into the potential therapeutic benefits of the natural compound, experts note that preventing skin cancer is still the best strategy.\u000a\u000aDr. Deborah S. Sarnoff, president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, tells Newsmax Health that annual full-body exams by a dermatologist should be a top priority. She says you should also check your skin regularly for changes.\u000a\u000a\u201cPay attention to new moles, an open sore that won\u2019t heal, or a growth that continues to itch, scab, or bleed. In general, it\u2019s important not to ignore a change of any kind,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000a\u201cMake an appointment with a dermatologist if you see any change in an existing mole, freckle, or spot or if you find a new one with any of the warning signs of skin cancer.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe adds that a helpful tool is what she calls the ABCDEs of melanoma detection:\u000a\u000aAsymmetry: If you draw a line down the center of your mole and the two halves do not match, that is a warning sign for melanoma.\u000a\u000aBorder: The borders of an early melanoma tend to be uneven. The edges may be scalloped or notched.\u000a\u000aColor: Most benign (non-cancerous) moles are all one color. A variety of colors in the same mole is another warning signal of melanoma.\u000a\u000aDiameter: Melanomas are usually larger in diameter than the eraser on your pencil (1/4 inch), though they can sometimes be smaller when first detected.\u000a\u000aEvolution: Benign moles look the same over time. Be on the alert when a mole starts to evolve or change in any way.\u000a\u000aSarnoff warns that the ABCDEs are a helpful tool, but not a catch all.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not only important to assess moles on their own, but also to compare them to other moles on your body,\u201d she notes. \u201cIf one spot looks noticeably different than surrounding moles \u2014 an \u2018ugly duckling\u2019 \u2013 have it examined by a dermatologist.\u201d

Read and listen, and you will hear America singing.\u2014 Perhaps the granddaddy of all songs celebrating the vastness and greatness of America, this tune was written in 1940 and recorded in 1944 by folk artist Woody Guthrie.\u2014 Country singer Lee Greenwood captures the spirit of our country with lyrics such as: "I'm proud to be an American/Where at least I know I'm free." The song was released in 1992 to instant popularity.\u2014 It was a huge hit for country singer Aaron Tippin in 2001, and it became the anthem for patriotism in the post-9/11 era.\u2014 Released by Toby Keith in 2003, this song praises America's troops, and states: "When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right/I'm out here on the front lines/Sleep in peace tonight."\u2014 Keith's 2001 song, subtitled "The Angry American," expresses rage over the 9/11 attack and warns: "Justice will be served/And the battle will rage/This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage/And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. Of A."\u2014 Released in 1974 by Johnny Cash, this tune features a trip through the history of America's wars, which left the "ragged old flag" still flying.\u2014 A hit for country singer Waylon Jennings in l984, the song had a message of American inclusiveness between veterans and non-veterans and those of every race.\u2014 Recorded in 1980 by the Charlie Daniels Band, it pulls no punches after the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis with its unabashed warning that, when threatened, Americans will always pull together.\u2014 This 2001 song from country singers Brooks and Dunn was used by both George W. Bush's and Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.\u2014 A 2005 tune by country singer Trace Adkins, it tells the story of a soldier killed in America's wars, and states: "I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company/I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done/I can rest in peace/I'm one of the chosen ones/I made it to Arlington."\u2014 In this song, Peter LaFarge relates the story of an American Indian hero who was one of the troops who raised the flag on Iwo Jima.

Malone in the glove compartment, saying, "If you're reading this, then I didn't make it home."\u2014 The title song to Billy Ray Cyrus' 1992 album has lyrics like: "All gave some and some gave all/And some stood through for the red, white, and blue/And some had to fall."\u2014 A 1983 title song for the Oak Ridge Boys' album, it urges Americans to buy American-made products and boasts, "My baby is American made."\u2014 This 2009 song by the country group Diamond Rio tackles the controversy raging over banning God from courthouses and schools.\u2014 Written by country singer Jimmy Driftwood and turned into a hit by Johnny Horton in 1959, this tune won a Grammy award for its comical take on the defense of New Orleans against invading British troops during the War of 1812.\u2014 Country singer Dierks Bentley penned this song after the 2011 Tucson, Arizona, shooting.

aVRegarded as one of the greatest players in pro golf, Arnold Palmer earned the nickname "The King" not just because of his ability to win major tournaments, but because of his personality and his unique appeal to his fans as well.\u000a\u000aPalmer died at age 87 in 2016, still involved in the world of golf. He was among the first pro golfers to take advantage of sports marketing with equipment and product endorsements. His many charitable contributions included the founding of the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies in Orlando, Florida.\u000a\u000aHere are six reasons Arnold Palmer is still considered "The King" of golf:\u000a\u000a1. Charisma \u2014 Although he may not have been the single greatest on the pro golf circuit, he was the most beloved, earning the nickname \u201cThe King,\u201d according to Golf Channel's Randall Mell. It helped get him on the Wheaties box and on the cover of Sports Illustrated 11 times.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a2. His style \u2014 \u201cThe manner in which Arnold won, the way he attacked and made birdies, it was very spectacular,\u201d said former pro and friend Dow Finsterwald. The way he attacked in his game made him a star as golf on TV came of age. \u201cArnie would knock it in the trees and make a 3,\u201d said former PGA tour golfer Bob Toski.\u000a\u000a3. Youngest winner \u2014 Palmer established himself on the pro circuit by capturing the Masters Tournament title in 1958. At age 28, he was the youngest winner of the tournament at that time.\u000a\u000aPOLL:\u000a\u000aTiger or Jack? Who Is The Greatest Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a4. Major victories \u2014 He became the first golfer to win the Masters four times \u2014 in 1958, 1960, 1962, and 1964. He was the champion at two British Opens and won a total of 93 titles during his career. He was the first pro golfer to make $1 million in winnings in 1968.\u000a\u000a5. Aging grace \u2014 Even in his later years, Palmer took to the links on the Senior Tour. His victories included the 1980 PGA Seniors Championship and the 1981 U.S. Senior Open. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2012 when Golf Digest reported he was the third highest paid golfer at age 82, behind Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\u000a\u000a6. King of golf clubs \u2014 His expertise in the game was matched by his collection of more than 10,000 golf clubs, according to Golf.com. Many of them he made himself. His golf bags often included 40 to 60 clubs. Experimenting with the grip on his equipment helped develop his game.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVAmerican consumers borrowed more heavily in July, increasing their debt primarily in a category that includes auto and student loans.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve said Friday that overall consumer credit rose $18.5 billion in July, up from the $11.9 billion increase in June.\u000a\u000aEconomists and financial markets watch the credit report closely for clues about the direction of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.\u000a\u000aNon-revolving credit, which includes auto and student loans, increased $15.8 billion. The category that includes credit cards advanced $2.6 billion.\u000a\u000aThe July increase brought consumer credit to a total of $3.75 trillion. The Fed's monthly credit report does not include mortgages or other debt secured by real estate, including home-equity loans.\u000a\u000aIncreased loan demand is often a sign of continued economic growth.\u000a\u000aThe economy expanded at 3 percent annual clip in the April-June quarter. The gains suggest that that overall growth is back on track after a lackluster start during the first three months of 2017. Hiring has occurred at a slightly slower pace than in 2016, but it remains healthy. Employers added 156,000 jobs in August as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent.\u000a\u000aThe recent growth has left consumers slightly more eager to spend. Consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in July, the best showing since April, the Commerce Department recently reported. Incomes in June grew 0.4 percent, the best showing since February.

aVThe U.S. Department of Justice has sided with the baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple based on his religious beliefs as the case moved toward the U.S. Supreme Court.\u000a\u000aThe department issued a brief supporting the position of Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver who declined to create the custom cake for Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012, Fox News reported.\u000a\u000aColorado state courts had ruled against Phillips, stating that his decision violated the state's anti-discrimination law, Fox News wrote. But the Justice Department took up his cause in a brief to the nation's highest court this week.\u000a\u000a"When Phillips designs and creates a custom wedding cake for a specific couple and a specific wedding, he plays an active role in enabling that ritual, and he associates himself with the celebratory message conveyed," acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the brief, according to Fox.\u000a\u000a"Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights," the brief continued.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department pointed out that Phillips' refused to bake the cake at the time when Colorado itself did not recognize same-sex marriages, which did not come until 2014, the HuffPost reported.\u000a\u000a"In other words, the state itself did not acknowledge the validity of the union it sought to compel petitioners to celebrate," the department stated, per the website. "Especially given that background, the state has not advanced a sufficient state interest to override petitioners' weighty First Amendment interest in declining to create the expression at issue here."\u000a\u000aJames Esseks, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT & HIV Project wrote Thursday that the Justice Department's position allows for gays to be discriminated again more broadly.\u000a\u000a"This case has never been about the cake," Esseks wrote. "It's about whether anyone in America can be turned away from a business because of who they are. It's about whether the Constitution gives businesses the right to discriminate whenever they want to. Everyone in this country should be opposed to such a radical ruling that would undermine America\u2019s core commitment to equality."

aVShockingly, half of all kids are bullied. And at least half of all kids should bear the name \u201cBully.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe know that bullying goes on all the time among students, thanks to the media, but what\u2019s happening on the home front? A far bigger story is to be told.\u000a\u000aFor example, the child who refuses to get ready in the morning and constantly makes her siblings anxious and late for school is involved in bullying behavior. Likewise is the child who goes into her sister\u2019s room and simply helps herself to whatever article of clothing she chooses, despite the fact that she\u2019s been told repeatedly to stop.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s 11-year-old Dan, who hides his sister\u2019s hair dryer and toothbrush to get a reaction out of her. And whenever he walks by his younger brother, he gives him a punch in the arm. And he forever is grabbing the remote and switching channels on his siblings.\u000a\u000aParents may be annoyed regarding these behaviors because of the ruckus they create in the family. Rarely however do parents think of these behaviors as bullying. But they are!\u000a\u000aWhat I tell parents: if one child constantly reacts negatively to another child\u2019s actions, instead of focusing your attention on the child who is reacting, take a look at what she\u2019s reacting to.\u000a\u000aShe may be prey to a bully as opposed to falling into the category of, \u201ckids will be kids\u201d or \u201che\u2019s just kidding\u201d or \u201che\u2019s younger than you.\u201d These statements rescue the bully and are excuses for bad behavior.\u000a\u000aWorse, such excuses contribute to encouraging one of your children to bully another.\u000a\u000aParents also fall prey to children who bully. A child who simply can\u2019t accept the answer \u201cNo\u201d and keeps pushing and nagging, twenty, thirty, forty times until the parent caves is a bully.\u000a\u000aIf 14-year-old Jessica is reprimanded for anything, she punishes her parents by refusing to talk with them. She\u2019s been known to carry on this behavior for several days. She also decides when she\u2019s ready for bed. No amount of telling her to go to bed has an effect.\u000a\u000aYou might say, \u201cThis kid does what she damn well pleases.\u201d Once when told she couldn\u2019t go out with friends, she jumped out of the second story window and joined them.\u000a\u000aAnytime a child repeatedly intimidates, threatens, scares, frightens, browbeats, coerces, terrorizes, or tries to lord their power over another family member, be it a parent or a younger or older sibling, they are bullying. Or calling like it is, that child is a bully.\u000a\u000aOther bullying behaviors in families: name-calling, hitting, pushing, refusing to let another pass, purposely embarrassing, making faces, and taking and breaking other family members\u2019 things.\u000a\u000aSo how do you get a bullying child to stop?\u000a\u000aThe first step is to name it. Call it like it is. Most kids do not think of themselves or their behavior as bullying. Example, \u201cYou are being a bully. Stop.\u201d (Don\u2019t tell him he is acting like a bully. This sugar coats his behavior. He is a bully).\u000a\u000aThe second step is to isolate the bully from the rest of the family. For example, if at a restaurant and your 9-year old keeps kicking his sister under the table after you\u2019ve told him to cease, tell him he is a bully and take him to the car.\u000a\u000aNo offering dinner afterward. Bummer for a parent but it\u2019s imperative that parents protect all of their children. You protect the child who is being kicked and you help the bully to stop this behavior.\u000a\u000aIf you have a child that constantly badgers you, never ever give in because if you do you reinforce this behavior. You as a parent have to show more grit than your child.\u000a\u000aI once had one of our boys stand in the corner. I think he was about 9 at the time. He told me he was going to stand all night.\u000a\u000aIn my head I thought, I will sit at the table all night knowing that he would get more tired standing than me sitting. In the end he caved and apologized. Translated: we were both winners.\u000a\u000aDo keep in mind. Bullies are not born. Bullies are made because their behavior is not checked.\u000a\u000aSome kids are more difficult than others (heaven help those parents) but no child should be permitted to intimidate or be allowed to grow into a bully.\u000a\u000aCheck out my books, \u201cThe Boy Whose Idea Could Feed the World,\u201d \u201cThe Parent Teacher Discussion Guide,\u201d and \u201cThin Becomes You\u201d at www.doriswildhelmering.com.

aVThe tide of globalism, is, according to economists, a train that has already left the station. The neo-liberal consensus, shared by both Republicans and Democrats alike over the past few decades has been that so-called \u2018free trade\u2019 is the solution to economic growth in America. But globalism also has its discontents, none less acknowledged than the American farm worker.\u000a\u000aIn 1870, at the height of the labor market in agriculture, fully half of all working Americans were employed in the agriculture industry. Today, that figure is less than one percent of all workers. There are several reasons for this. First, technological advancements have made farm work much less labor intensive. Mechanized farming methods account for the lion\u2019s share of the decline in the percentage of the agriculture-related labor force. And that is by design.\u000a\u000aEarlier in America\u2019s history, seasonal migrant workers, both American and largely Mexican, crossed the borders frequently to work the harvest seasons, and then returned to their homes in Mexico. But beginning in the 1960s, American-born workers began to organize against migrants, who they viewed as undercutting their collective bargaining rights.\u000a\u000aCesar Chavez, a revered Chicano (and ethnic identity adopted by people of Mexican descent born in the U.S.) labor and civil rights activist, decried the importation of undocumented immigrants as a direct attack by farm owners against the rights of U.S. citizens. Chavez organized major labor strikes against U.S. farmers, resulting in some cases, massive shortages and price increases in agricultural staples.\u000a\u000aBut the neoliberal agenda quickly caught on. First, farming organizations began to break the organized labor stranglehold on production by secretly importing undocumented workers from Mexico. This practice proceeded, largely unchecked, until the 1990s, when a more formal solution was devised \u2014 NAFTA. Proposed by Republicans and enacted into legislation by President Bill Clinton, NAFTA was seen by many in the business community as the solution to intractable problems of government-imposed environmental and labor regulation that was stifling American economic growth. But it was sold to the American consumer as a way of getting goods on the table at lower cost.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, NAFTA delivered on its promise of lower cost to the consumer. But at what price? It seems obvious now, but the savings to the American consumer came at the cost of the American worker. This is a tradeoff that many other countries \u2014 including especially China \u2014 have refused to make. China sees the productive worker as the engine of its economy, whereas America sees the consumer as the engine. In truth, both are wrong.\u000a\u000aIt takes both workers and consumers to drive the type of economic growth America needs now. How can consumers buy more goods if they are not generating incomes? With labor market participation rates showing modest signs of uptick after almost three decades in freefall, it seems that the labor market is recovering slightly. But we need to look for ways to get many, many more working-age Americans into the labor market.\u000a\u000aFarming is one open avenue. Whereas in 1998, more than a third of farm workers in America were recent immigrants, as of 2014, the number of recent immigrants in the U.S. labor force fell to almost eleven percent. The Obama administration touted DACA \u2014 his executive order allowing children born abroad and brought illegally to the U.S. as children \u2014 as a measure to protect the human rights of undocumented immigrants. That is not the case. The objective of DACA, driven by major corporations, was to protect the dwindling supply of cheap undocumented labor available in the agricultural industry. And that diminishing supply, ironically, was driven by the success of NAFTA in driving up job opportunities for Mexicans in Mexico. As it stands, in 2016, there is a shortage of available labor in the U.S. agricultural sector of almost one million workers. And that in turn is starting to have adverse effects on the ability of U.S. farmers to compete in the global agricultural market.\u000a\u000aThere is another side to the solution to the American labor problem that is not contained in Trump\u2019s promise to end DACA and strengthen the enforcement of immigration laws. It is that America \u2014 and especially the Republican Party \u2014 is going to have to come to terms with organized labor. American voters are not likely to return to farming and other industries under the same working conditions as undocumented immigrants. It goes without saying that a job that does not pay living wages is not a job worth doing for most Americans. On the other hand, both producers and consumers of American agricultural products are going to have to adjust to the higher costs of labor that will necessarily arise when American citizens are called upon to take over the jobs currently occupied by undocumented immigrants.\u000a\u000aThere is a third component to this shift in U.S. policy that must be addressed. As the tacit agreement between big business and undocumented labor ends, there will be a skills gap in the U.S. labor force that will be somewhat difficult to mitigate in the short term. Educational institutions, including original land grant colleges and Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs) are some of the few remaining options for teaching long lost agricultural skills in the U.S. These could provide the basis for a structural retraining platform for the burgeoning American farm labor force.\u000a\u000aArmstrong Williams is the author of "Reawakening Virtues."

aVHere's some good news for America's seniors: The rates of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia have dropped significantly over the last decade or so, a new study shows.\u000a\u000aThe analysis of nearly 1,400 men and women 70 and older found that the number of dementia cases dropped from 73 among those born before 1920 to just 3 among those born after 1929.\u000a\u000aThe reasons for the decline aren't clear, researchers said. But one factor stands out: The rates of stroke and heart attack decreased across generations. The rate of diabetes, however, has increased.\u000a\u000a"It may be that we are seeing the benefits of years of success in cardiovascular disease prevention," said lead researcher Carol Derby, a research professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\u000a\u000aThat doesn't appear to account for all of the decrease in dementia rates, however.\u000a\u000aAlthough the rate of dementia has declined, the actual number of people with dementia is expected to increase dramatically as the population bubble caused by baby boomers ages, Derby said.\u000a\u000a"Whether the changes of the rate of the onset of dementia is going to offset that population shift remains to be seen," she said.\u000a\u000aAround the world, more than 47 million people suffer from dementia, and 7 million new cases develop each year, according to the researchers.\u000a\u000aThe number of cases of dementia is projected to double every 20 years, and to reach 115 million by 2050.\u000a\u000aThe number of people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is expected to climb to 106 million by 2050, the investigators said.\u000a\u000a"While the rates may be going down, the problem is far from going away," said James Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association.\u000a\u000aDementia, an impairment of brain functions marked mainly by memory problems and personality changes, is still one of the most expensive chronic conditions, with a huge impact on patients and families.\u000a\u000aHendrix believes that living a healthy lifestyle might help prevent dementia. In fact, a recent study found that if people exercised, ate a healthy diet, stopped smoking and kept chronic medical conditions such as diabetes at bay, 35 percent of dementia cases around the world could be prevented, he said.\u000a\u000a"It's about brain health during your entire life," said Hendrix, who was not involved with the study.\u000a\u000aThe report was published online Sept. 5 in the journal JAMA Neurology.\u000a\u000aFor the study, Derby and her colleagues analyzed the rate of dementia in nearly 1,400 men and women who took part in the Einstein Aging Study from 1993 through 2015.\u000a\u000aWhen participants entered the study, they were 70 or older and didn't suffer from dementia.\u000a\u000aOver the course of the study, Derby's team found that the rate of dementia dropped steadily.\u000a\u000aAmong the 369 people born before 1920, 73 developed dementia, that number decreased to 43 among the 285 born between 1920 and 1924.\u000a\u000aCases of dementia dropped to 31 for the 344 born between 1925 and 1929 and to 3 for the 350 born after 1929.\u000a\u000a"This is not unexpected," said Dr. Sam Gandy, director of the Center for Cognitive Health at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. "Similar trends have been documented in Europe."\u000a\u000aGandy, who was not involved with the study, believes that much of the decline in the rate of dementia is the result of declining rates of stroke.\u000a\u000a"As cardiovascular health has improved, stroke incidence has fallen," he said.\u000a\u000aThe health of the blood vessels in the brain contribute to the risk for dementia, Gandy said.\u000a\u000a"So one would predict that, over time, sustained reduction in stroke risk would be a precursor to reduced dementia risk," he said.\u000a\u000aAlthough the rate of dementia has dropped, the number of cases are likely to increase, Gandy said.\u000a\u000a"The aging baby boom is such that the overall number of dementia patients will continue to rise even while prevalence numbers are falling slightly," he said.

aV\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that in six months, the Department of Justice will begin the long process for deportation proceedings against 800,000 young people who came to America as babies and young children in the care of their parents and others because those entries into this country were and remain unlawful.\u000a\u000aWhen President Barack Obama signed numerous executive orders attempting to set forth the conditions under which illegally immigrated adults whose children were born here could lawfully remain here, he was challenged in federal court and he lost. Sessions believes that the government would lose again if it declined to deport those who came here illegally as babies and young children.\u000a\u000aHere is the back story.\u000a\u000aShortly after President Obama formalized two programs, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (commonly known as DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (commonly, DAPA), in a series of executive orders, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that DAPA \u2014 the orders protecting undocumented immigrants who are the parents of children born here \u2014 was unconstitutional.\u000a\u000aBefore signing his executive orders, Obama tried to persuade Congress to amend federal immigration laws so as to permit those who came here illegally and bore children here and those who came here illegally as infants to remain here with work permits, high school diplomas, Social Security numbers, jobs and other indicia of stability and permanence. After Congress declined to vote on the Obama proposals, he authored his now-famous DACA and DAPA executive orders. He basically decided to do on his own what Congress had declined to do legislatively.\u000a\u000aBut Obama's executive orders were not novel; they merely formalized what every president since Ronald Reagan \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 has effectively done. Each has declined to deport undocumented immigrants who bore children here or who were brought here as young children. President Obama alone showed the courage to put this in writing, thereby giving immigrants notice of what they need to do to avoid deportation and the government notice of whose deportations should not occur.\u000a\u000aNumerous states challenged Obama's DAPA orders in federal court. The states argued that because they are required to provide a social safety net \u2014 hospital emergency rooms, public schools, financial assistance for the poor, etc. \u2014 for everyone within their borders, whether there lawfully or unlawfully, DAPA was increasing their financial burden beyond their ability or will to pay. Stated differently, they argued that the president alone was effectively compelling these states to spend state tax dollars against the will of elected state officials. The states also argued that DAPA was such a substantial deviation from the immigration statutes that Congress had written that it amounted to the president's rewriting the law and thereby usurping the constitutional powers of Congress.\u000a\u000aA federal district judge agreed with the states, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed that ruling. That court held that by increasing the financial burden on states against the will of the elected officials of the states, the president had violated the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution \u2014 which guarantees a representative form of government in the states, not one in which a federal official can tell state officials how to spend state tax dollars.\u000a\u000aIt also ruled that by enforcing his executive orders instead of the laws as Congress wrote them \u2014 those laws mandate deportation for all who came here illegally, no matter their age or family status \u2014 the president was failing to take care that all federal laws be enforced. That behavior, the court ruled, violated the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, which compels the president to enforce federal laws as they were written, not as he might wish them to be.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court declined to intervene by a 4-4 vote, thereby permitting the 5th Circuit decision to stand undisturbed.\u000a\u000aWhen Sessions announced this week that DACA will not be followed after March 5, 2018, he said he is confident that DACA is unconstitutional for the same reasons that the courts found DAPA to be unconstitutional. Yet there are moral, constitutional, legal and economic arguments on this that will be an obstacle to the cancellation of this long-standing program.\u000a\u000aMorally, most of the beneficiaries of DACA are fully Americanized young adults who know no other life but what they have here and have no roots in the countries of their births. Many are serving the U.S. in the military. Constitutionally, DACA has effectively been in place since 1986, and 800,000 people younger than 40 have planned their lives in reliance upon it. Legally, once a benefit has been given by the government and relied upon, the courts are reluctant to rescind it, even though the 5th Circuit showed no such reluctance.\u000a\u000aEconomically, the summary removal of more than three-quarters of a million people from the workforce would have serious negative consequences for their employers and dependents and for delicate economic forces, and there would be negative economic consequences to the government, as well, as each claimed hardship case \u2014 each person whose deportation is ordered \u2014 is entitled to a hearing at the government's expense.\u000a\u000aNow many Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress want to make a close version of Obama's executive orders with respect to immigrant infants (DACA) the law of the land \u2014 something they declined to do when Obama was president. Were this to happen, the tables would be turned on Trump. He would be confronted with the constitutional duty of enforcing a federal law that he has condemned.\u000a\u000aWould he live up to his oath of office?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJudge Andrew P. Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of New Jersey. He is Fox News\u2019 senior judicial analyst.

aVMADRID (AP) \u2014 Regional leaders in Catalonia moved Friday to defy the central government in Madrid and go ahead with a vote on independence even though Spain's constitutional court has ordered the vote suspended.\u000a\u000aWhile the pro-independence Catalan government tried to flex its muscles, most of the opposition to the vote \u2014 both regional and national \u2014 rallied around conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his efforts to crush the planned Oct. 1 ballot.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the state prosecutor targeted members of the Catalan parliament and the Barcelona-based regional government in separate lawsuits. The prosecutor's document asked judges to look into possible disobedience, abuse of power and embezzlement charges against the officials.\u000a\u000aBut despite the court's suspension of the vote and the legal threats, regional President Carles Puigdemont has pushed ahead with preparations for the ballot.\u000a\u000aAn official website offers volunteers the chance to register and help with the vote. A promotional video published in official media asks: "You were born with the ability to choose. Are you going to give it up?"\u000a\u000aOfficials in the northeastern region claim they have enlisted 560 Catalan town halls to open facilities for the ballot, despite letters sent by Spain's central authorities to the region's 947 mayors warning them that their legal duty is to impede the vote. Authorities said similar letters were being sent to public Catalan media organizations and the regional police force.\u000a\u000aIt wasn't clear what position officials would take in Barcelona, the main city in Catalonia.\u000a\u000aBarcelona Mayor Ada Colau, an activist against evictions who has become a rising political star, said people should be able to vote as long as there are no liabilities for them or for public servants.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the central government's spokesman, Inigo Mendez de Vigo, clarified that legal actions are targeting "those who organize the vote" and not voters themselves.\u000a\u000aThe pro-independence coalition ruling Catalonia says the vote will be binding and that if the "yes" side wins it will lead to the independence from Spain by Oct. 3 no matter what the turnout.\u000a\u000aSpain's constitutional court has previously ruled that only the national government is allowed to call a referendum on secession and that all Spaniards in the country must have a vote when it comes to sovereignty.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, Rajoy's cabinet began procedures to strike down a new bill approved overnight by Catalan pro-independence lawmakers. The new law was meant to become Catalonia's legal framework, or mini-constitution, as it transitions from a Spanish autonomous region to an independent republic.

aVU.S. regulators have approved the first drug to treat all forms of hepatitis C in as little as eight weeks.\u000a\u000aThe pill combination from AbbVie Inc. was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for adults without significant cirrhosis, a type of liver disease, and many patients who were not cured by prior treatment.\u000a\u000aMavyret joins two other AbbVie hepatitis C drugs, one from Merck & Co. and four from Gilead Sciences Inc. on the market. That gives doctors and patients more options, and insurers more leverage to wring discounts out of companies to cover the pricey drugs.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually develops slowly over decades, with no symptoms until serious damage is done. Without treatment, the virus can cause liver failure and liver cancer, often requiring a liver transplant or resulting in death.\u000a\u000aFor decades, hepatitis C treatment required a year of grueling shots and pills that gave patients flu-like symptoms and still barely cured half of them. Starting late in 2013, Gilead revolutionized treatment with the first pill-only medicines that brought cures in 12 weeks for more than 90 percent of patients.\u000a\u000aGilead has been raking in billions on the drugs. Insurance plans and government health programs have been straining to cover the huge cost \u2014 up to $94,500 for a course of treatment with its second drug, Harvoni \u2014 and initially limited coverage to the sickest patients.\u000a\u000aAbbvie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, said Mavyret's list price without insurance will be $26,400 for eight weeks' treatment, $39,600 for 12 weeks' treatment and $52,800 for 16 weeks' treatment.\u000a\u000aAs the latest entrant in a competitive market in which commercial insurers mostly have deals giving them discounts of up to 50 percent in exchange for not covering rivals' hepatitis C drugs, Maryvet is priced well below the other approved drugs. AbbVie spokesman Morry Smulevitz said the company initially will focus on getting coverage approved by Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration.\u000a\u000aThe key to how much market share Maryvet can get will depend on the discounts it offers payers, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote to investors.\u000a\u000aMavyret is the latest drug to treat all six forms of hepatitis C, following Gilead's Epclusa. Earlier drugs generally are limited to patients with just one or a few hepatitis C types or at certain stages of the disease.\u000a\u000aIn testing that included 2,300 adult patients, 97.5 percent who didn't have cirrhosis were cured, meaning the virus was undetectable in their blood, in eight weeks after taking Mavyret. Among patients with severe kidney damage, 98 percent were cured after 12 weeks of treatment, according to AbbVie.\u000a\u000aMaryvet combines two hepatitis C medicines, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, taken as three pills together once a day. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, fatigue and itchy skin. In patients who previously had hepatitis B infections, treatment with Maryvet can reactivate that virus, causing potentially fatal liver problems.\u000a\u000aFollow Linda A.

aVThe repercussions of 9/11 continue to exact a toll on the health of Americans. An analysis by NYU Langone Health of blood tests from children who may have breathed in the toxic ashes and fumes from the collapse of the World Trade Center towers found that they have risk factors for future heart disease.\u000a\u000aResearchers examined blood tests of 308 children, 123 who may have come in direct contact with dust on 9/11. They found that children with higher blood levels of the chemicals known to be in the dust also had elevated levels of artery-hardening fats in their blood.\u000a\u000a"Since 9/11, we have focused a lot of attention on the psychological and mental fallout from witnessing the tragedy, but only now are the potential physical consequences of being within the disaster zone itself becoming clear," says Dr. Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor at NYU School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aTrasande says the long-term danger may stem from exposure to certain perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs \u2014 chemicals released into the air as electronics and furniture burned in the disaster.\u000a\u000aChemicals include perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), widely used to make plastics more flexible until its health effects \u2014 including lower-than-normal birthweights and brain damage \u2014 led U.S. manufacturers to stop using it in 2014.\u000a\u000aOther results of the study showed that roughly every threefold increase in blood PFOA levels was tied to an average 9 percent to 15 percent increase in blood fats, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.\u000a\u000aAccording to Trasande, raised fat levels in the blood, especially LDL, are known risk factors for heart disease. If left untreated, it can lead to blood vessel blockages and heart attack.\u000a\u000aFortunately, he says, these very early signs of cardiovascular risk observed in the children can generally be addressed by diet, weight control, and exercise.\u000a\u000a"Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring the health consequences from 9/11 in children exposed to the dust, and offers hope that early intervention can alleviate some of the dangers to health posed by the disaster," says Trasande.\u000a\u000aThe results appear in the journal Environment International.\u000a\u000aIn another study published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in June, a different research team at NYU found raised blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in people who reported being exposed to WTC dust on 9/11.\u000a\u000aPrevious research has linked increases in CRP to inflammation and higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In December, Calpers voted to cut its long-term return target from 7.5 percent a year to 7 percent, a move that will require larger contributions from workers and taxpayers.\u000a\u000aThe mandate would be a big win for BlackRock, which is best known for offering lower-fee passive products, such as iShares exchange-traded funds.

Feed your seedlings \u2013 Most seed starting mixes contain almost no nutrients to feed your new plants. When seedlings first emerge, their first sets of leaves, called cotyledons, will feed the plant. Once the first true sets of leaves appear, you will need to feed with a diluted, half-strength liquid fertilizer, says Fine Gardening.\u000a\u000aALERT: The Secret Water for Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a5. Use a grow light and timer \u2013 While you can start seeds in a sunny windowsill, Tomato Envy says the results are more reliable and the plants are more robust when grown under a fluorescent grow light. These lights help produce sturdy plants. Set the lights on a timer so the plants get between 14 and 18 hours of light each day.\u000a\u000a6. Harden off \u2013 Hardening off is the process by which plants are gradually acclimated to natural sunlight and the outdoors\u2019 fluctuating temperatures before they are planted in the garden, says Fine Gardening. Place plants in direct sunlight for just a short time at first and gradually increase the time over at least a three-day period.\u000a\u000aIMPORTANT: Until There's a Wall, There Is the US Border Patrol.

aVFormer Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo on Wednesday said Donald Trump was right in terminating DACA, and Congress might unify and pass a bill to provide the "Dreamers" amnesty because of how much hatred they have for the president.\u000a\u000a"It is not President Trump's fault; it is absolutely what he should have done," Tancredo told hosts Bill Tucker and Carl Roth on NewsmaxTV's "Newsmax Now."\u000a\u000a". . . A lot of people think it's actually a law somehow, and Trump is repealing it somehow by executive order. No, not the way it happened at all, of course. Here are the exact words Barack Obama in the Rose Garden when he announced this executive action: 'Let's be clear, this is not amnesty, this is not immunity, this is not a path to citizenship, it is not a permanent fix, it is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources,' and it is of course completely unconstitutional \u2013 oh no wait, that's not right."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

aVGiving Merck & Co's immunotherapy drug Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated advanced lung cancer appears to provide durable benefits, according to an update of a closely watched clinical trial.\u000a\u000aU.S. regulators approved the drug cocktail in May but the limited clinical trial data to date means that questions still remain as to whether it will retain its effectiveness over time.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the significant improvements first reported a year ago have been maintained for more than 18 months, with the risk of disease progression or death reduced by nearly half, researchers at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress reported on Friday.\u000a\u000aPeople in the 123-patient trial who got Keytruda plus chemotherapy survived 19 months on average before their disease worsened, against 8.9 months for those on chemo alone, data from a scientific abstract at the meeting showed.\u000a\u000aThe overall survival rate was 70 percent for the combination compared with 56 percent for chemo on its own.\u000a\u000aMerck senior vice president Roger Dansey said the latest data confirmed the combination had "the potential to have a meaningful impact in the lives of many of these patients."\u000a\u000aLung cancer is by far the largest oncology market and rival drugmakers are racing to find new combinations based on immunotherapy drugs, which boost the immune system's ability to fight tumors.\u000a\u000aChemotherapy, despite its toxic side effects, has for many years been the standard treatment for the disease.\u000a\u000aMerck's small trial was the first proof of the advantages of using chemotherapy and immunotherapy together in lung cancer and the U.S. drugmaker is now awaiting more conclusive data from a bigger study.\u000a\u000aIts Swiss rival Roche is also investigating a different immunotherapy and chemotherapy mix.\u000a\u000aCompeting companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca have focused on combining two immunotherapies. However, AstraZeneca's endeavors here suffered a big setback in July when a large combination drug trial failed to help lung cancer patients as hoped.\u000a\u000aDrugs like Keytruda and rival products from other companies work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body\u2019s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.\u000a\u000aTens of billions of dollars of these drugs are expected to sell in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, the largest potential market.

aVA proposed class action lawsuit was filed against Equifax Inc. late Thursday evening, shortly after the company reported an unprecedented hack had compromised the private information of about 143 million people.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the lawsuit filed in Portland, Oregon federal court, users alleged Equifax was negligent in failing to protect consumer data, including Social Security numbers, addresses, driver\u2019s license data, and birth dates. Some credit card information was also put at risk.\u000a\u000aEquifax first discovered the vulnerability in late July, though it chose not to publicly announced it until more than a month later. The company was widely criticized for its customer service approach in the aftermath of the hack, as users struggled to understand if their information had been affected. Others expressed frustration that three senior executives sold about $1.7 million in stock in the days following the discovery of the hack. A spokeswoman for Equifax said the men \u201chad no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe plaintiffs, Mary McHill and Brook Reinhard, both reside in Oregon and had their personal information stored by Equifax.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn an attempt to increase profits, Equifax negligently failed to maintain adequate technological safeguards to protect Ms. McHill and Mr. Reinhard\u2019s information from unauthorized access by hackers,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cEquifax knew and should have known that failure to maintain adequate technological safeguards would eventually result in a massive data breach. Equifax could have and should have substantially increased the amount of money it spent to protect against cyber-attacks but chose not to.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe case was filed by the firms Olsen Daines PC along with Geragos & Geragos, a celebrity law firm known for blockbuster class action suits.

These plans let employees invest part of their paycheck before taxes. That money can grow tax free until retirement. Then the money will be taxed as income when it is paid out. Many companies offer the added benefit and incentive to employees of matching money the employee saves. This is like getting a small raise.There are many circumstances in which a saver can take money out of a 401(k) before retirement, taking a personal loan on money they invested, or paying for certain large expenses, like medical bills, education or buying a house. However, there are several drawbacks to withdrawing money from a 401(k).Money taken early from a 401(k) gets hit with a double whammy tax burden. The IRS can take 10 percent additional tax as a penalty for taking that money before retirement. The money will also be taxed as income.Withdrawals from a 401(k) before age 59 ½ are going to be more costly than you expect, CNN Money said . Aside from the early withdrawal penalties and extra taxes, there is a lost opportunity to have that money grow into the nest egg you will need later in life.Many employers will allow an employee to borrow money out of their 401(k) as a low interest loan. However, most plans have a very short pay-back window. In most cases, if you leave your employment for any reason, that money is due immediately, Bankrate said

aVHurricanes Irma and Harvey and the possibility of a debt ceiling face-off later this year are reducing the chances of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, according to Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do think it\u2019s going to have an impact on growth, on GDP,\u201d Ivascyn, whose firm oversees more than $1.6 trillion, said in a telephone interview from his office in Newport Beach, California. \u201cWe think it will initially lead to lower likelihood of the Fed moving in December.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe implied probability of a rate hike in December is about 29 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Fed has raised its benchmark rate twice this year and was expected to increase one or two more times, based on projections of members of the Federal Open Markets Committee.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump and Congress this week reached a deal to suspend the federal debt limit and fund the government into December, raising the stakes for a year-end budget battle.\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma weakened slightly to a Category 4 storm and remained on a collision course with southern Florida after devastating a chain of Caribbean islands. Two other hurricanes, Jose and Katia, are also churning in the Atlantic basin.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s the risk this is just the beginning of a series of storms,\u201d Ivascyn said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close to the peak of the season just yet.\u201d\u000a\u000aEyeing Insurance\u000a\u000aIvascyn and Alfred Murata co-manage the $95.9 billion Pimco Income Fund, which has outperformed 99 percent of its Bloomberg peers with an average annual gain of 7.4 percent over the past five years.\u000a\u000aOne possible investment opportunity down the road is insurance-related, because of what behavioral finance economists refer to as the \u201crecency effect,\u201d which leads people to increase coverage after adverse events, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s like if you have a car accident, you tend to call everyone in your family and say \u2018make sure your auto policy is up to snuff\u2019 kind of thing,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aPimco recommends becoming more defensive in the current environment of investor complacency by reducing exposure to high-priced assets, such as high-yield debt, Ivascyn said. The firm expects continued low inflation, modest U.S. growth and strength in Europe but no recession in the near-term.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re still talking about fine tuning, not doing massive trades on any of this stuff,\u201d Ivascyn said.

aVAtlanta Motor Speedway said Wednesday that it would make its camping and RV facilities available to those seeking shelter amid Hurricane Irma.\u000a\u000aThe facilities will open to evacuees starting Thursday and their resources will be free, according to Sporting News.\u000a\u000aAtlanta Motor Speedway to open camping facilities for Hurricane Irma evacuees https://t.co/S1mPVrfqv6 pic.twitter.com/1hgi1IqYG7 \u2014 Darius Goodman (@ReporterDarius) September 6, 2017\u000a\u000aThe facilities have the capacity to provide thousands of people with shelter, and evacuees will also have access to bathrooms and showers at the Rinnai Shower Station camper bath house located adjacent to the speedway.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Motor Speedway's website, evacuees interested in taking shelter at the RV or tent camping sites, can enter the property from entrance "E," which is accessible off Georgia Highway 19/41.\u000a\u000aIf evacuees are traveling from I-75 and Highway 20, they'll see signs leading them to AMS' entrance "H."

aVEaster, and the Holy Week leading up to it, is celebrated differently around the world. Some mark the holiday with egg hunts and chocolates and visits from a giant, mythical bunny, while others choose to also celebrate the Resurrection of the Christ.\u000a\u000aFor this list, Newsmax considered destinations far and wide \u2014 across the United States and around the globe \u2014 where the religious Easter holiday is celebrated with processions, parades, and pageantry that mark the foundation of the Christian faith.\u000a\u000aSince the holiday often coincides with spring break, Easter can also be the perfect time to plan a more extensive cultural family vacation abroad.\u000a\u000aFrom witnessing centuries-old religious processions across Europe to a sunrise Easter service at the Garden Tomb in Jerusalem, Newsmax has curated 25 destinations where you can experience the holy side of Easter.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 270 Ways to Slash Your 2016 Tax Bill\u000a\u000aThe list isn\u2019t focused on international destinations, either. There are plenty of equally engaging places right here in the U.S. to experience the holiday as well, including America\u2019s longest-running passion play in Oklahoma and a pilgrimage to a sacred church in New Mexico.\u000a\u000aHere are Newsmax's top 25 Easter destinations around the world:\u000a\u000a1. Jerusalem, Israel \u2014 It is pretty difficult to think of anywhere more special to celebrate Easter Week than Jerusalem, where the story that led to the first Easter unfolded. Jerusalem\u2019s Holy Week begins with a Palm Sunday parade to commemorate Christ entering the city. The route, which attracts up to 10,000 participants each year, follows the footsteps Jesus took along the Via Dolorosa in the Old City. A Palm Sunday Mass is also held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is the place where Christians believe Christ was buried and then rose from the dead. On Easter itself, a sunrise service is held at the Garden Tomb.\u000a\u000a2. Rome, Italy \u2014 Attending Easter Mass held by the Pope at the Vatican is a sacred experience for Catholics. And Rome is truly a wonderful cultural family destination to celebrate the Holy Week. Events begin on Palm Sunday with a free mass in Saint Peter\u2019s Square. There are also Mass services on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday. Also don\u2019t miss the Stations of the Cross (Via Crucis) parade on Good Friday when a huge cross with burning torches lights the sky as a procession passes each station placed by Pope Benedict XIV at the Colosseum back in 1744.\u000a\u000a3. Chimayo, New Mexico \u2014 In the tiny northern New Mexico town of Chimayo, about a 45-minute drive from Santa Fe, this simple adobe church, known as El Santuario de Chimayo, has been called the \u201cLourdes of North America\u201d for its supposed healing powers. Each year thousands of people come to this rural village to gather the soil from a place in the floor that is associated with a miraculous crucifix discovery in 1810 and is believed to have amazing curative powers. Easter Week is one of the most popular, and special times, to visit Chimayo, with many visitors choosing to make a walking pilgrimage to the church from Santa Fe.\u000a\u000a4. Bloomington, Illinois \u2014 Bloomington puts on America\u2019s oldest Passion play each Easter with a production now in its 94th consecutive year. The \u201cAmerican Passion Play,\u201d held at the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts, differs from other Passion plays in that it follows Jesus\u2019 entire life, rather than just the events surrounding Easter. In this performance, guests are transported back to Palestine in the time of Christ, and follow him on his ministry and life from the Sermon on the Mount to the Resurrection and Ascension. The settings and costumes aim to be as historically accurate as possible, and the script follows passages from the King James Version of the Bible.\u000a\u000a5. Lawton, Oklahoma \u2014 Another one of America\u2019s longest-running Easter Passion plays is performed each year at a remote location inside southwest Oklahoma\u2019s Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge known as Holy City of the Wichitas. The narrated dramatization of the birth, life, death, and Resurrection of Christ has been held outside in what is now a replica of the Holy Land every year since 1926. The story is performed entirely in pantomime with musical backing, while readers also broadcast the script on the radio and to the Easter performance crowd. Over the years, the cast has grown to some 150 members.\u000a\u000a6. Marion, Indiana \u2014 Running since 1937, the Marion Easter Pageant uses no spoken commentary, but instead tells the story of the last week of Christ\u2019s life entirely with pantomime, pageantry, and hymns. The hour-long performance, held at the Memorial Coliseum YMCA, begins with the Palm Sunday entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem and concludes with the "Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Orlando, Florida \u2014 Orlando\u2019s Bible-themed park, known as The Holy Land Experience, is a great, educationally focused family experience. The park is a living, biblical museum that is designed to replicate the city of Jerusalem some 2,000 years ago. From the Garden Tomb to the Wilderness Tabernacle, biblical history comes alive in intricate detail. Although the theme park is open year-round, in the six weeks around Easter (March 14 to April 29, 2017) they put on special Crucifixion and Resurrection re-enactments outside by the tomb.\u000a\u000a8. Lourdes, France \u2014 One of the most-visited religious sites in the world, the village of Lourdes, at the base of the Pyrenees Mountains, is especially magical at Easter. During the Holy Week, France\u2019s second most-visited city sees thousands of pilgrims \u2014 it is the largest Catholic pilgrimage destination in Europe \u2014 carrying torches in a procession through the ancient streets, meditating the prayer of the Rosary. Many companies offer organized tours, which include Mass at the Grotto, a cave-like shrine at the base of Lourdes Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.\u000a\u000a9. Lalibela, Ethiopia \u2014 Ethiopia was one of the earliest countries to embrace Christianity, and very little has changed since the 1st century in the way its practitioners worship there. Easter, known as Fasika there, begins in earnest on its eve, as congregants gather until nearly dawn when Lent fasting gives way to enormous feasting and celebration. Lalibela, named after the 13th-century Ethiopian king who commissioned its building, is the site where about a dozen interconnected churches were carved out of volcanic earth. The purpose of this architectural wonder, according to Ethiopian lore, was King Lalibela founding a \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d after Saladin had conquered the Hebrew city during the Third Crusade. Fasika, which follows the Eastern Orthodox calendar, usually falls a week or two after the Western holiday, so American travelers would not miss celebrating Easter at their home church by experiencing it in the African nation.\u000a\u000a10. Junction, Texas \u2014 The town of Junction, in Texas hill country, also puts on a re-enactment of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ in its annual pageant. It\u2019s held at sunset on the Saturday evening before Easter Sunday in an outdoor theater off Farm Road 2169. The site, known as the Easter Pageant grounds, sits on a pretty hillside beneath a bluff known as Lover\u2019s Leap. The pageant is performed and sponsored by the Men\u2019s Bible Class of Junction, which began as a veterans' ministry.\u000a\u000a11. Denver, Colorado \u2014 Red Rocks Amphitheater, just west of Denver, Colorado, is one of the world\u2019s most famous outdoor concert venues, known for the stunning red rock scenery surrounding the stage, but also its natural acoustics. On Easter Sunday, a sunrise prayer service held here attracts thousands who come to worship in this place of natural beauty. Afterwards, many choose to go for a hike in the park surrounding the amphitheater or continue west into the mountains for a day of reflection in nature.\u000a\u000a12. Florence, Italy \u2014 Another top Easter destination in Europe is Florence, which puts on a parade known as the Explosion of the Cart. The fiery procession is held on Easter Sunday in honor of the Florentine knight Pazzino, who was the first person to plant the banner of the cross at the battle of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1096. The procession, which began in the 17th century, features a float pulled by two white oxen through the streets before fireworks are set off from it before a host of fireworks explode from it.\u000a\u000a13. Seville, Spain \u2014 Holy Week, or Semana Santa in Seville, is one of Spain\u2019s largest religious festivals. The week is filled with parades, led by different religious brotherhoods, who dress in penitential robes, with giant floats featuring lifelike wooden sculptures depicting scenes from the last week of Christ\u2019s life. Many of these floats dates back to the 17th century and are considered religious works of art. The most important parade begins on the evening of Holy Thursday and continues through Good Friday dawn.\u000a\u000aAlert:\u000a\u000aWhen Do You Think Christ Is Returning? Vote Now\u000a\u000a14. Eureka Springs, Arkansas \u2014 Back in the U.S., another Passion play option can be found in the Ozark Mountains at Eureka Springs. Here \u201cThe Great Passion Play\u201d is staged in an outdoor, multi-level amphitheater with special lighting and sound effects, live animals, and a cast of 150 actors dressed in New Testament-era costumes. On Easter morning, there is a sunrise service at the amphitheater. The grounds of The Great Passion Play are also home to a few different museums, including one dedicated to the Bible, as well as a life-sized replica of Jerusalem\u2019s Eastern Gate and hiking trails, which remain open year-round.\u000a\u000a15. Mesa, Arizona \u2014 Held on the west end of the lawn north of the Mesa Arizona Temple Visitors\u2019 Center, the \u201cMesa Arizona Easter Pageant, Jesus the Christ\u201d presents the life, ministry, and mission of Christ through music, dance, and drama. This Church of Latter-Day Saints\u2019 presentation is designed for \u201call religions, ages, and cultures\u201d and takes place over multiple dates in April leading up to Easter. Claiming to be \u201clargest annual, outdoor Easter pageant in the world,\u201d the Mesa Arizona Temple hosts audiences that can exceed 10,000 in attendance.\u000a\u000a16. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2014 In Brazil, Easter falls at the end of summer, which means warm weather and plenty of light. Rio de Janeiro hosts numerous colorful processions throughout Holy Week, and during this time many of the city\u2019s streets are decorated with carpets of flowers.\u000a\u000a17. Oberammergau, Germany \u2014 This village in the Bavarian Alps has been putting on its \u201cPassion Play\u201d for nearly 400 years. This play is produced and performed entirely by Oberammergau villagers, by law, every 10 years, and it is expected to draw nearly half a million visitors to its 100-plus performances in 2020. Born out of war and plague and a promise to God, the manuscript has changed little over the centuries, yet has remained unique in updated presentations. The production is also easily the most exhaustive Passion play, expecting to take the stage for around five hours, with a three-hour dinner intermission. There is a theater tour, led daily in German and English, and an Easter market to add to the experience, as well as the many local and regional sights and delights to add to the experience.\u000a\u000a18. Verges, Spain \u2014 Also in Spain, the medieval city of Verges puts on a traditional \u201cdansa de la mort\u201d on Holy Thursday. The \u201cdeath dance\u201d re-enacts scenes from the Passion, and participants parade through the streets in skeleton costumes. The procession ends with purposefully frightening skeleton dancers carrying boxes of ashes and is followed by a macabre dance that beings at midnight and lasts for three hours.\u000a\u000a19. Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 Charleston is a wonderful city to celebrate Easter on the water. The weather is usually nice, the air scented with jasmine and other spring flowers, and there are a number of different sunrise service celebration options. One favorite is held at White Point Garden on the Battery at 6:45 a.m., and it usually draws a crowd of around 500 people. The views of the harbor as the sun comes up are inspiring.\u000a\u000a20. Dubrovnik, Croatia \u2014 One of Europe\u2019s most religious Easter celebrations takes place in the beautiful Croatian coastal city of Dubrovnik. Here you\u2019ll experience a ceremonious procession of the cross during Good Friday. Other Easter traditions include giving gifts of colored eggs and partaking in a special Easter cake known as pinca.\u000a\u000a21. Indianapolis, Indiana \u2014Christians come from across the country to experience Upon This Rock Passion Play at Pike Performing Arts Center in Indianapolis. The musical theater version of the Passion play includes soulful singing, choreographed dance, spoken words from the Bible, and even a pyrotechnic display as Christ rises from the grave.\u000a\u000a22. New Orleans, Louisiana \u2014 New Orleans is a city that knows how to put on a good parade anytime of year, but on Easter Sunday, it offers a full Easter procession through the French Quarter. Known as the Historic French Quarter Parade, it has been running since 1956, and begins at Antoine\u2019s Restaurant, continues on to Jackson Square, and then comes back to the starting point, following a stop for a mass at the St. Louis Cathedral.\u000a\u000a23. Buenos Aires, Argentina \u2014 Easter Sunday in Buenos Aires sees a number of traditions including consuming and sharing eggs and a special Easter cake, known as rosca de Pascua, with family, friends, and even colleagues. The day also includes Mass followed by big family gatherings with food, usually of the barbecue variety and a government-organized treasure hunt.\u000a\u000a24. Beirut, Lebanon \u2014 In Lebanon, half the country is Christian, and many Lebanese consider themselves quite religious, so Easter is celebrated passionately. Easter Sunday begins in church, and includes a custom that is unique to Lebanon. Known as Shanineh, it includes a procession of children carrying hand-decorated candles with ribbons and flowers.\u000a\u000a25. Lakeport, California \u2014 If you miss the Easter Passion plays, head to Lakeport, about a two-hour drive from the East Bay, on May 20 and 21, for its annual presentation of the \u201cPassion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d The Lake County Passion Play Grounds is a pastoral, lakeside landscape that serves as a 1,000-foot stage where more than 150 costumed actors re-enact the final days of Christ\u2019s ministry on Earth.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?

aVDr. Jerome Adams was sworn in as surgeon general Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence after serving as Indiana's state health commissioner while Pence was governor there.\u000a\u000aAt times called the "nation\u2019s doctor," the surgeon general oversees the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, USA Today reported. Adams, who grew up in Maryland, worked as an anesthesiologist and has a master's degree in public health.\u000a\u000aHe attended Indiana University School of Medicine and the University of California, Berkley, USA Today noted.\u000a\u000a"Dr. Jerome Adams is highly qualified not just to serve, but to succeed on behalf of the American people," Pence said in comments at the swearing-in ceremony, released by WhiteHouse.gov. "\u2026 As I saw firsthand, Dr. Jerome Adams has an extraordinary gift for empathy, and he brought that gift to his years in public service.\u000a\u000a"When I was governor of state of Indiana, it was my privilege to appoint him as the state health commissioner. And he would go on to serve my successor and two administrations in that role with great distinction," he added.\u000a\u000aDuring Adams' confirmation hearing last month, Democrats complained about the position becoming more politicized after President Donald Trump dismissed Dr. Vivek Murthy as surgeon general before his term ended, along with his comments suggesting that vaccines can cause autism, the Indianapolis Star reported.\u000a\u000aAdams said Wednesday that he will be guided by science.\u000a\u000a"I promise the American people that I am committed to letting the science lead me and to facilitating locally led solutions to our most difficult health problems," Adams said in his comments. "I promise you, the American people, that if you're willing to partner, I'm willing to go along with you and to help bring other folks to the table.\u000a\u000a"To borrow a phrase from our President, let's all work together to make American health great again," Adams added.\u000a\u000aAdams said that the country's opioid epidemic would be a focus along with untreated mental illness that may contribute to drug use, the Baltimore Sun reported.\u000a\u000a"The addictive properties of prescription opioids (are) a scourge in America and it must be stopped," Adams said in his nominating letter to lawmakers, the Sun noted.

aVVeteran Alaska Rep. Don Young has apologized after he lashed out at a freshman lawmaker during a House floor debate and said she "doesn't know a damn thing what she's talking about."\u000a\u000aYoung, 84, a Republican, is in his 23rd term as Alaska's sole House member. He was offering an amendment about wildlife management on national preserves in his state Thursday night when Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington spoke in opposition.\u000a\u000aClearly angry, Young said that Jayapal, a freshman from Seattle, "doesn't know a damn thing what she's talking about." He accused her of parroting "nonsense" from a special interest group and said, "You may not know me, young lady, but I'm deeply disturbed."\u000a\u000aJayapal, 51, objected immediately and asked that Young's words be stricken from the record. Young later apologized, saying he has tendency to "get very defensive about my state."\u000a\u000aJayapal said she accepted the apology and told Young, "We have obviously some work to get to know each other, but I can tell you that I care about my state as deeply as you do."\u000a\u000aJayapal, who was born in India, is the first Indian-American woman in the House. She later tweeted that her response to Young was "a message to women of color out there: stand strong. Refuse to be patronized or minimized. Let the small guys out there be intimidated by you."\u000a\u000aYoung, known for his brusque manner, has apologized before for words spoken on the House floor or other public venues. In 2013, he apologized for using the term "wetbacks" when discussing migrant workers. He acknowledged it was an "insensitive term" and said it should have been left behind with the last century.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Young apologized after telling Alaska high school students that while alcohol and depression are factors in many suicides, a lack of support from friends and family is sometimes to blame.\u000a\u000aYoung later said that a family member of his has committed suicide. "It's very personal to me. It may have caused me to mangle some of my statements and comments that caused this uproar," he said.

aVPresident Donald Trump has shown a new willingness to work with Democrats this week in the wake of the deal he struck with party leaders on the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000aTrump sided with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Wednesday night and came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling in order to fund a Hurricane Harvey relief bill. Republican leaders objected but the deal was struck.\u000a\u000aThat, coupled with Trump's Wednesday visit to North Dakota during which he praised a Democratic senator from that state, could signal somewhat of a power shift in Washington, according to The Hill.\u000a\u000aTrump's decision to reach across the aisle will likely give Democrats a boost as they face the Republican-controlled House and Senate. Congress has come up short on passing healthcare legislation this year and has not yet come to an agreement on tax reform or the budget. Trump has not been shy about criticizing his own party leaders.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, he appeared to be more friendly with Democratic Party leaders, referring to Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as "Chuck and Nancy."\u000a\u000a"Is he annoyed at Republican leadership? Yeah, I think he probably is," White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said, The Hill reports. "And believe me, as a Republican, so am I. As a citizen, I am, too. I was promised that they would have repealed and replaced Obamacare by now."\u000a\u000aPelosi even appeared to influence a Trump tweet. After she spoke with him Thursday morning about providing reassurance to people who have benefited from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the current form of which will be phased out in March, he tweeted this:\u000a\u000aFor all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2017\u000a\u000aAt Trump's invitation, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., traveled to her home state with Trump \u2014 a state he won in the election last fall \u2014 on Wednesday. During his remarks on stage, Trump called her a "good woman" and asked her to support his tax reform plan.\u000a\u000aSome Republicans are celebrating Trump's embrace of Democrats, saying House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have not been productive enough.\u000a\u000a"He's given Ryan and McConnell every opportunity to actually do something and they've clearly not been up to literally anything," Ned Ryun, who worked in the George W. Bush administration, told The Hill.

aVSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has often been the silent man in the Trump foreign policy team. But out of the spotlight, he appears to be crafting a broad strategy aimed at working with China to resolve the North Korea crisis and with Russia to stabilize Syria and Ukraine.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Tillerson approach focuses on personal diplomacy, in direct contacts with Chinese and Russian leaders, and through private channels to North Korea. His core strategic assumption is that if the U.S. can subtly manage its relations with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 and allow those leaders to take credit for successes \u2014 complex regional problems can be solved effectively.\u000a\u000aTillerson appears unfazed by criticism that he has been a poor communicator and by recent talk of discord with President Trump. His attitude isn't exactly "take this job and shove it," but as a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, he doesn't need to make money or Washington friends \u2014 and he clearly thinks he has more urgent obligations than dealing with the press.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTillerson appears to have preserved a working relationship with Trump despite pointedly separating himself from the president's controversial comments after the Charlottesville unrest. Although Trump didn't initially like Tillerson's statement, it's said he was ultimately comfortable with it.\u000a\u000aThe North Korea crisis is the best example of Tillerson's diplomacy. For all the bombast of Trump's tweets, the core of U.S. policy has been an effort to work jointly with China to reverse the North Korean nuclear buildup through negotiations. Tillerson has signaled that the U.S. is ready for direct talks with Kim Jong Un's regime \u2014 perhaps soon, if Kim shows restraint. Tillerson wants China standing behind Kim at the negotiating table, with its hands figuratively at Kim's throat.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite Pyongyang's hyper-belligerent rhetoric, its representatives have conveyed interest in negotiations, querying details of U.S. positions. But Kim's actions have been erratic and confusing: When it appeared that the North Koreans wanted credit for not launching missiles toward Guam, Tillerson offered such a public statement. Bizarrely, North Korea followed with three more weapons tests, in a reckless rebuff.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome analysts see North Korea's race to test missiles and bombs as an effort to prepare the strongest possible bargaining position before negotiations. Tillerson seems to be betting that China can force such talks by imposing an oil embargo against Pyongyang. U.S. officials hope Xi will make this move unilaterally, demonstrating strong leadership publicly, rather than waiting for America to insert the embargo proposal in a new U.N. Security Council resolution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTillerson signaled his seriousness about Korea talks during a March visit to the Demilitarized Zone. He pointed to a table at a U.N. office there and remarked "maybe we'll use this again," if negotiations begin.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Sino-American strategic dialogue about North Korea has been far more extensive than either country acknowledges. They've discussed joint efforts to stabilize the Korean Peninsula, including Chinese actions to secure nuclear weapons, if the regime collapses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe big idea driving Tillerson's China policy is that the fundamentals of the relationship have changed as China has grown more powerful and assertive. The message to Beijing is that Xi's actions in defusing the North Korea crisis will shape U.S.-China relations for the next half-century.\u000a\u000aTillerson continues to work the Russia file, even amid new Russia sanctions. He's known Putin since 1999 and views him as a predictable, if sometimes bullying, leader. Even with the relationship in the dumps, Tillerson believes he's making some quiet progress on Ukraine and Syria.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn Ukraine, Tillerson supports Russia's proposal to send U.N. peacekeepers to police what Putin claims are Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's assaults on Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The addition of U.N. monitors would help implement the Minsk agreement, even if Putin gets the credit and Poroshenko the blame.\u000a\u000aOn Syria, Tillerson has warned Putin that the real danger to Russian interests is increasing Iranian power there, especially as Bashar Assad's regime regains control of Deir el-Zour in eastern Syria. To counter the Iranians, Tillerson supports a quick move by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces to capture the Lower Euphrates Valley.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTrump's boisterous, sometimes belligerent manner and Tillerson's reticence are an unlikely combination, and many observers have doubted the relationship can last. But Tillerson seems to roll with the punches \u2014 and tweets. When Trump makes a disruptive comment, Tillerson seems to treat it as part of the policy landscape \u2014 and to ponder how to use it to advantage.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTillerson may be the least-public chief diplomat in modern American history, but that's apparently by choice. By Washington standards, he's strangely uninterested in taking the credit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Ignatius writes a foreign affairs column. He has also written eight spy novels.

aVLong before "The Passion of the Christ" became a runaway box office hit, raking in more than $370 million domestically since its 2004 debut, Christian films have had a spot in Hollywood history.\u000a\u000aFaith-based movies have recently enjoyed a resurrection. Audiences looking to see their own beliefs reflected on the big screen turned out in droves for films like 2014's "Heaven Is for Real" ($91.4 million), 2015's "War Room" ($67.7 million), and this year's "Miracles From Heaven" ($61.7 million).\u000a\u000aChristianity is still the most common belief system in the United States, not just the world. For example, more than two-thirds of Americans \u2014 68 percent to 75.2 percent or up to 242.72 million people \u2014 believe in Christianity, Jesus, and miracles, while up to 86 percent (or about 277.57 million people) believe in God, according to Movieguide, the biggest faith-based, family review service. In contrast to this, only 8 percent to 18 percent of America\u2019s 322.76 million people refuse to believe in God or the Jesus of the Bible.\u000a\u000aThat said, movies about Jesus Christ and movies with strong Christian and biblical moral content dominate 90 percent of the top-grossing movies worldwide, not just in Christian countries, because people have hard lives and are looking for the good, the true, and the beautiful to triumph, which usually leads them to want a savior, whether allegorical or christological.\u000a\u000aAlert: Prayer Changes Your Brain in 4 Amazing Ways\u000a\u000aA procession of Christian films paved the way for these modern-day, box-office success stories. Here, the editors of Movieguide and its publisher, Ted Baehr, have compiled for Newsmax a list of what they feel are the Top 25 Christian Movies of All Time.\u000a\u000aThe list is meant as a conversation starter, and not necessarily meant as a definitive list. The list considers the Christological, biblical content of each movie, combined with the movie\u2019s aesthetic and entertainment value, its visual or cinematic quality, its dramatic power, the cohesion and energy behind its narrative structure, its moral and spiritual acceptability for family audiences, and the moral and spiritual depth of its message and themes.\u000a\u000a1. "The King of Kings" (1927- silent), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The famous H.B. Warner played Jesus in Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s "King of Kings," still the classic of all movies about Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a2. "Quo Vadis" (1951), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This very Christian classic places Marcus Vinicius, played by Robert Taylor, between the tyrannical Nero, played by Peter Ustinov, and the beautiful redeemed Christian Lygia, played by Deborah Kerr. The movie includes a great explanation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by St. Peter.\u000a\u000a3. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" (2005), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," based on C. S. Lewis\u2019 popular Christian fable, tells the story of four English children who enter the land of Narnia, where they meet Aslan, the son of the Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea, who rescues the land from the evil White Witch. Despite some minor changes from the book, "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe," retains most of its Christian focus and is tremendously exciting, thrilling, and redemptive.\u000a\u000a4. "The Robe" (1953), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Starring Richard Burton, Jean Simmons, and Victor Mature, this Hollywood Cinemascope spectacle is the story of an Ancient Roman soldier, who turns to Christianity when embracing the robe of Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a5. "Les Misérables" (1934), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Based on the redemptive novel by Victor Hugo, "Les Misérables" tells the redeeming story of Jean Valjean who goes to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister\u2019s child and then comes to Jesus Christ through the sacrificial love of a poor bishop. Jean becomes a new man and dedicates his life to helping others though he is pursued by the unforgiving Javert.\u000a\u000aAlso highly recommended:\u000a\u000a"Les Misérables" (2012), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: The Hollywood film version of the beloved musical play of Victor Hugo\u2019s novel about an ex-convict whose life is redeemed, though is still hounded by a legalistic policeman. "Les Misérables" is a brilliant adaptation of this inspiring, spiritually uplifting Christian story that beautifully depicts God\u2019s transformational powers though the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but it contains some harsh scenes showing the brokenness of humanity without God. "Les Misérables" (1998), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean, a reformed convict pursued his whole life by a legalistic police inspector. Literally overflowing with redemption and grace in the face of horrible legalism, rigidity, and the perils of war, this journey is wonderfully told through a near flawless script, excellent acting, great photography, and wonderful set design with moderate violence and no sex or nudity. "Les Misérables" (1995), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The magnificent movie by Claude Lelouch, "Les Misérables" is not another adaptation of Victor Hugo's redemptive story; instead, the movie is a unique re-telling of Hugo's masterpiece using Hugo's work as a metaphor for life. Henri Fortin travels through life from boxer, to prisoner, to criminal, to a man redeemed through the cruel and miserable experiences in the midst of the German cruel occupation of France during World War II.\u000a\u000a6. "A Tale of Two Cities" (1935), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: In a movie starring Ronald Colman in the role of a lifetime, as the cynical lawyer Sydney Carton who makes a great sacrifice, the causes and effects of the French Revolution come alive through this richly textured rendering of the classic novel by Charles Dickens published in 1859. The movie closes with Jesus Christ\u2019s words: \u201cI am the Resurrection and the Life; he who believes in Me shall live even if he dies.\u201d (John 11:25)\u000a\u000a7. "Lilies of the Field" (1963), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Featuring a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance by Sidney Poitier, this wonderful family movie teaches the Gospel in a winsome, entertaining way that\u2019s unsurpassed by most other movies. In the story, a group of German nuns transplanted to Southwest America convince a young black man to help them build a local church. In the meantime, the young man teaches the nuns the joys of Pentecostal Protestant worship focused on Jesus and His Gospel. Both Jesus and the local church are lifted up.\u000a\u000a8. "Sergeant York" (1941), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Based on the diary of Alvin York, the most decorated soldier in World War I, this moving story tells about a willful man, played by Oscar winner Gary Cooper, who comes to Jesus Christ and comes to terms with war.\u000a\u000a9. "The Passion of the Christ" (2004), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -2: Though the violent R-rated version is too strong for younger teenagers and other susceptible viewers, there is a PG-13 version of this powerful movie by Mel Gibson, with a striking performance by Jim Caviezel and a heartbreaking, but ultimately uplifting ending that stirs the imagination and pierces the heart.\u000a\u000a10. "Ben-Hur" (1959), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Subtitled "A Tale of the Christ," this is an epic story of a young Jewish man, Judah Ben-Hur, played by an Oscar-winning Charlton Heston, who lives at the time of Christ. When his sisters are put in a Roman dungeon and contract leprosy, Ben-Hur can either choose to hate the Romans or find healing and forgiveness through the blood of Christ.\u000a\u000a11. "The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy (2001, 2002, 2003), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: The greatest, most redemptive fantasy epic ever written, about Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Fellowship of the Ring, becomes the greatest, most redemptive fantasy epic ever filmed. A spectacular, singular achievement in filmmaking.\u000a\u000a12. "Repentance" (1987 \u2013 subtitled, Soviet Union), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +2: "Repentance" is the one movie credited with helping to overthrow Communism. This magnificent movie exposes the evils of communism, statism, and totalitarianism while lifting up the suffering and the triumphant, eternal Church of Christ Jesus.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000a13. "Chariots of Fire" (1981), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: In this Academy Award-winning Best Picture, Eric Liddell is a Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of Jesus in the 1924 Olympic games and who believes that Christ is his trainer.\u000a\u000a14. "Babette's Feast" (1987 \u2013 subtitled, French), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Set in Denmark during the 1800s, this Oscar-winning adaptation of the Isak Dinesen story features two Christian sisters who spend their lives helping the needy, sick, and poor. A renowned French chef named Babette, who has been forced into exile, serves the sisters as their maid.\u000a\u000a15. "The Hiding Place" (1975), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This true story is a powerful examination of a family's faith as Corrie Ten Boom and her family hide Jews in Amsterdam during WWII.\u000a\u000a16. "Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days" (2005), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: In the German movie "Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days," Sophie and her brother, Hans, are part of a small group of Christians who are trying to instigate a student uprising to overthrow Adolf Hitler's National Socialist government in 1943. They are caught by the Gestapo, but Sophie challenges the investigator with a very strong evangelistic, Christian, Trinitarian refutation of the Nazi position. This movie is overtly Christian, but, more than that, it contains tremendous Christian theology as Sophie confronts National Socialism.\u000a\u000a17. "The Ten Commandments" (1956), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: A remake of a movie he did many years previously, this Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic remains a favorite today. Christians like it because it is a Bible story. Jews like it because Moses is one of their heroes. Everybody likes it because it is masterful, engrossing filmmaking. Though not entirely biblically correct, it gives a powerful examination of one of mankind's greatest leaders, superbly portrayed by Charlton Heston.\u000a\u000a18. "Places in the Heart" (1984), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: This movie, which stars Oscar-winning actress Sally Field, clearly shows that faith in Jesus Christ overcomes all obstacles \u2014 even death.\u000a\u000a19. "Tender Mercies" (1983), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +2: Starring Robert Duvall in an Oscar-winning performance as a down-on-his-luck country music singer, this movie was penned by Horton Foote, one of America\u2019s best writers.\u000a\u000a20. "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: Jimmy Stewart plays the beleaguered but good-hearted George Bailey, who finds out what life would be like if he\u2019d never been born. A very slight caution is urged because of the false angelology, although the movie is high on our list because of its emotive revelation of man\u2019s relationship to God, who answers our prayers.\u000a\u000a21. "Lady Jane" (1986), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: This is the powerful story of Lady Jane Grey who was crowned by the Reform Christians in England and ruled for nine days before being martyred for her strong faith in God and His Bible.\u000a\u000a22. "Eleni" (1985), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +2: "Eleni" is the greatest movie about a mother\u2019s love in the face of adversity. It is the true story of a mother who was murdered by the communists during the Greek Civil War. Eleni proclaims, \u201cChrist is risen\u201d on Easter, prays to God, and concludes before her execution with a touching statement: \u201cIt is such a joy to be a mother that I thank God for letting me know it.\u201d\u000a\u000a23. The best of the Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" adaptations: There are at least 15 movie and 25 television adaptations of Charles Dickens\u2019 "A Christmas Carol," according to the International Movie Database. Here are the best:\u000a\u000a"Scrooge" (1951), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: Starring Alastair Sim, this well-crafted and faithful version of Dickens\u2019 classic is so good it can be watched year-round. Sim does a marvelous job of bringing Scrooge to life in this heartwarming classic. Furthermore, Tiny Tim is adorable, and the Cratchit family is absolutely heartwarming and tear jerking. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" (1992), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: This is a live-action musical that retells the classic Dickens story with all our Muppet favorites, and actor Michael Caine as Scrooge. "A Christmas Carol" (1999), Quality: * * * Acceptability: +3: This very Christian version, which stars Patrick Stewart, has a great church scene that recaptures the essence of the Charles Dickens novel. "A Christmas Carol" (2009), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: This 2009 animated version features an excellent motion capture performance by Jim Carrey and overt references to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a24. "A Man Called Peter" (1955), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This fine movie demonstrates a contemporary champion of the faith, Scotsman Peter Marshall, who became clergyman and U.S. Senate chaplain.\u000a\u000a25. "True Grit" (2010), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -2: "True Grit," adapted from the Charles Portis novel by Joel and Ethan Coen, hews a bit more closely to the book but also pays some homage to the 1969 version starring the great John Wayne. After her father is killed in cold blood, spunky 14-year-old Presbyterian farm girl Mattie Ross hires one-eyed U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to track down the killer. "True Grit" has a lot of humor, but it also has some heart-rending moments. There are, however, some strong obscenities and profanities, and one violent scene is extreme, but the movie\u2019s overt Christian, biblical themes and powerful spirit of chivalry and justice are thoroughly stirring.\u000a\u000aTed Baehr is publisher of MOVIEGUIDE(r), a family guide to entertainment, and the chairman of The Christian Film & Television Commission\u2122.

aVPacking could end up being the most important factor when traveling internationally. Many times, travelers will realize too late the extra baggage they took along, causing strained muscles and extra charges.\u000a\u000aEveryone has different needs, but anyone can become a pro when it comes to packing for a trip abroad. Here are six tips for packing like a pro on your next international journey:\u000a\u000a1. List items for packing \u2014 Instead of grabbing something here and something there, list the things you will need for your trip. Items you need can depend on the length of the trip or the weather. Check off the items as you gather them, Frommer\u2019s advises.\u000a\u000aLatest: What's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Check with the airline on baggage information \u2014 On some international flights, travelers are allowed up to two 50-pound bags free of charge. A carry-on, however, is still a good idea because your baggage might not arrive on the same flight. Divide items evenly if checking more than one bag so you will have what you need incase the other bag doesn\u2019t arrive at the same time.\u000a\u000a3. Don\u2019t bring things you don\u2019t need \u2014 Research your destination to find out if you can buy personal items there. Also, voltage and plug types might be different abroad. Buying an adapter often solves the problem. Avoid packing jewelry and other valuables. Tourists make good targets for thieves, Caroline Costello points out in Smarter Travel. Unnecessary gadgets, such as DVD players, coffee makers, or other devices, only take up room, and travelers often find they never use them.\u000a\u000aTell Us: What Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Bring the right amount of clothing \u2014 Before going on a trip, take note of the clothes you wear in a week. You can make a list, then reduce the number of outfits you\u2019ll need. Bring lots of neutral colors for mixing and matching. In most cases, you won\u2019t have to change your clothes that often when traveling abroad.\u000a\u000a5. Pack shoes that can be worn with different outfits \u2014 Limit it to three pairs for dress, casual, and comfort wear, CNN Travel recommends. Pack shoes with soles to the side of the case around the edge and keep the center for clothes. Stuff socks and undergarments into shoes to save space and help keep the shape of the shoes.\u000a\u000a6. Pack really light \u2014 An alternative method is traveling light while on an international trip, according to Rick Steves\u2019 Europe. Steves recommends one carry-on-size bag for transatlantic flights that is limited to 20 pounds. Travelers walk with their bags more than they think, and going casual and simple is the best way. You can buy many things you might need later at various locations.\u000a\u000aVote Now: Should the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVA cholesterol drug reduced by 28 percent the mortality rate among men who had high cholesterol but no heart disease, according to new research out Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIn the longest such trial to date, spanning 20 years, researchers at Imperial College London found that 40 miligrams daily of pravastatin reduced deaths from heart disease in participants by more than a quarter.\u000a\u000aThe patients, 5,529 men, had high cholesterol levels but not heart disease.\u000a\u000aSenior author Kausik Ray from Imperial's School of Public Health said that "for the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels. This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins."\u000a\u000aResearchers found that giving pravastatin to men with very high LDL levels reduced 20-year overall mortality rates by 18 per cent, the study published in Circulation found.\u000a\u000aStatins also reduced the overall risk of death by coronary heart disease by 28 per cent, and cut the risk of death by other cardiovascular disease by 25 percent among those with very high LDL cholesterol.\u000a\u000a"Our findings provide the first trial-based evidence to support the guidelines for treating patients with LDL above 190mg/dL and no signs of heart disease. They also suggest that we should consider prescribing statins more readily for those with elevated cholesterol levels above 155 mg/dl and who also appear otherwise healthy."

aVSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, fired back at criticisms leveled at him by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by saying his fellow Republican needs to head back to the beach.\u000a\u000aCruz told The New York Times he is "quite confident that nobody in Texas gives a flip what Chris Christie has to say.\u000a\u000a"And it seems not many people in New Jersey do either. Chris should go back to the beach."\u000a\u000aThe last shot was a reference to Christie's decision to bring his family to a beach on a stretch of land that was closed because of a statewide government shutdown in New Jersey in July.\u000a\u000aCruz has been on the ground in Texas helping with recovery and cleanup efforts in the wake of the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey. Last week, Christie spoke with CNN and called out Cruz for voting against the 2013 Hurricane Sandy relief bill \u2014 which Cruz said was filled with pork and not much actual aid money.\u000a\u000a"I have no sympathy for this \u2014 and I see Sen. Cruz and it's disgusting to me that he stands in a recovery center with victims standing behind him as a backdrop," Christie said.\u000a\u000a"He's still repeating the same reprehensible lies about what happened in Sandy [and] called on Congress Wednesday morning to work fast on a bill to aid Texas after Hurricane Harvey."\u000a\u000aCruz's decision not to vote for federal relief for victims of Sandy, which decimated parts of New Jersey, has haunted him for years. He told CNN last week, however, that the bill put up for a vote was full of earmarks for local members of Congress.

aV"Mean Girls" the musical is set for its run on Broadway in April, 2018 at the August Wilson Theatre with previews starting March 12.\u000a\u000aThe musical is based off Tina Fey's 2004 hit high school movie that starred Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams. Fey's husband, Jeff Richmond of "30 Rock" is providing the new music and lyrics for the show, and Casey Nicholaw of "The Book of Mormon" will direct, Entertainment Weekly reported.\u000a\u000a"(The audience) will hopefully find that (this musical) has the DNA of the movie and is true to the spirit of it, but is also opened up in a lot of ways," Fey told "Entertainment Weekly. "I feel like all the music in our show is very catchy \u2014 like, I feel like you will walk out humming several songs. The songs are what make the show."\u000a\u000aBefore the show reaches Broadway, though, it will have a run at Washington D.C.'s National Theater from Oct. 31 to Dec. 3, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aThe cast will include Erika Henningsen in Lohan's character Cady Heron while Taylor Louderman plays McAdams's character Regina George, the Times said. Ashley Park will play Gretchen Wieners and Kate Rockwell will portray Karen Smith.\u000a\u000aFey gushed about the cast on "The Tonight Show," in May, telling host Jimmy Fallon, "They're like a bunch of baby Timberlakes. They can do everything!" according to Glamour.\u000a\u000aLorne Michaels, the creator of Fey's former employer "Saturday Night Live," is the musical's lead producer while Fey wrote the musical book, the Times reported.\u000a\u000a"There are lots of things you can do better in a musical," Michaels told the Times. "The characters are fuller.\u000a\u000a"The expectation is going to be really high for it. And we\u2019re all devoted to it. We want it to be remarkable, and getting there is difficult," Michaels continued.\u000a\u000aThe cult classic teenager movie about a home-school girl trying to fit into high school made $86 million domestically and another $42 million overseas when it was released in 2004, according to Box Office Mojo.

aVBEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Monday criticized President Donald Trump's threat to cut off U.S. trade with countries that deal with North Korea and rejected pressure to do more to halt the North's nuclear development.\u000a\u000aTrump issued the threat after North Korea on Sunday exploded a thermonuclear device in its sixth and most powerful nuclear test. The threat was seen as a warning to China, North Korea's main trading partner and only major ally.\u000a\u000aA foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, criticized Trump's stance as unfair to Beijing.\u000a\u000a"What is definitely unacceptable to us is that on the one hand we work so hard to peacefully resolve this issue and on the other hand our interests are subject to sanctions and jeopardized," Geng said at a regular news briefing. "This is unfair."\u000a\u000aSuch an approach would be drastic if applied to China, from which the United States imports goods worth about $40 billion a month.\u000a\u000aTrump said it was under consideration "in addition to other options."\u000a\u000aAsked whether Beijing would support tougher U.N. sanctions such as cutting off oil supplies to North Korea, Geng didn't mention oil but said whatever happened would depend on discussions among council members. Geng said China, one of five permanent Security Council members with power to veto U.N. actions, would take part in a "responsible and constructive way."\u000a\u000aGeng expressed frustration at Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's comment that Beijing had a responsibility to influence North Korea due to its status as the North's main trading partner.\u000a\u000a"We keep stressing that we cannot solely rely on China to resolve this issue," said Geng. "We need all parties to work in the same direction."

aVSponsored Content\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(Washington, D.C.) -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is unveiling a new \u201cLet\u2019s Get America Working\u201d campaign in advance of the 2016 election that will encourage both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to endorse a pro-worker platform.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the center of the platform is the need for this country to invest in infrastructure, which in turn will create good jobs for everyday Americans. Working on transportation, energy and water projects will put thousands to work in construction jobs across the country. It will also improve roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure, which in turn will help business and improve the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Labor Department\u2019s own statistics support the Teamsters\u2019 initiative. The median union worker earns more than $200 a week more than the median non-union worker. That\u2019s an extra $10,000 a year that goes into the pockets of union workers. These jobs also offer health benefits and retirement security.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile unemployment is down, the vast majority of jobs being created pay low wages,\u201d Teamster General President Jim Hoffa said. \u201cWe can stop this trend and create good-paying union jobs if government invests in our nation\u2019s workforce.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInfrastructure presents an opportunity to break the political gridlock. Congress in late July approved a three-month extension for spending on transportation projects that provides a temporary patch until the end of October for the continuing issue of road and rail funding. But it is not a real solution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 2008, Congress has transferred more than $62 billion from the general fund to keep the Highway Trust Fund afloat, and it has been more than a decade since Congress has passed a highway bill more than two years in duration. Meanwhile, the transportation system continues to crumble and the safety of those who work and travel along the vast network of U.S. roads and rails is being jeopardized. Our nation\u2019s failure to maintain and improve our infrastructure is costing Americans more and more.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere also is a significant need to move forward with a broader agenda that puts U.S. workers first. That means standing up against lousy trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that send American jobs overseas; protecting workers\u2019 rights to form unions and collectively bargain; increasing affordability of college and vocational schools; and ensuring retirement and pension security for working families.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLawmakers need to remember that dollars invested in education, job training and supporting retirement for those who worked hard all their lives helps not only individuals, but our society as a whole. These are promises each generation in this country has made to the next and we can\u2019t forget it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut if this nation is going to improve the lives of its citizens, Congress needs to advance bipartisan policies that will encourage good job growth. And it must put the current and future generations of workers in a position to succeed in the workforce by giving them the skills they need.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere was a time when all these issues weren\u2019t partisan issues \u2013 they were American values, something everyone could support. But government is broken. Partisan bickering has replaced finding solutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential for the Teamsters and like-minded allies all over the country to join together and push this message with lawmakers, colleagues, friends and family.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf elected officials from both parties want to rebuild and repair the trust between government and workers, they need to reinvest in people that have and can continue to make this country great. Better pay will lead to more spending and improve workers\u2019 quality of life. That way everyone wins.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s Get America Working! Now is the time to Build, Repair and Maintain America!

aVFor several days, news reports have indicated that North Korea is preparing for another ballistic missile launch, this time from its west coast and perhaps an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could reach U.S. territory all the way to the continental United States.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has ordered that we prepare to shoot it down, according to John Gizzi, Newsmax\u2019s White House Correspondent.\u000a\u000aWhile considering the possible targets for such a North Korean launch, the thought should not be lost that North Korea has previously launched satellites from its west coast site, southward, to approach the United States from over the South Polar regions.\u000a\u000aOur missile defenses are not well prepared to shoot down such a launch on its first pass over the United States. They have been stationed and prepared to engage ICBMs approaching the United States over the northern polar regions.\u000a\u000aSuch a \u201cSouthern\u201d ICBM attack is not a new idea. The Soviet Union developed such a system in the 1960s, called a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or FOBS. It was intended to carry a nuclear weapon in low earth orbit to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere and attack U.S. from the South, thereby avoiding our ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems, then focused on a Soviet attack from over the North Pole.\u000a\u000aAnd guess what? Our current homeland BMD systems (in Alaska and California) are also focused on attacks from over the northern polar regions.\u000a\u000aPerhaps we should regroup a bit?\u000a\u000aWhile our Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) can be helpful in defending South Korea, Japan, and Guam, it would not be of great value as a terminal defense of the United States.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, our sea-based Aegis BMD system, developed primarily as a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, can defend a much larger area and is inherently capable of shooting down ICBMs as it demonstrated in 2008 by shooting down a dying satellite that was traveling faster than an ICBM.\u000a\u000aMoreover, it should be noted that North Korea has launched its satellites (in 2012 and 2016 and, as far as I know, still orbiting over the United States every 90 minutes) from its western launch site to avoid overflying land in its early trajectory.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s recent emphasis on employing electromagnetic pulse (EMP) to attack our electric power grid should not be lost as we contemplate North Korea\u2019s intended message should the currently anticipated launch occur.\u000a\u000aAnd hopefully the president is not forgetting the potential role of Aegis BMD Destroyers and Cruisers and has directed the Navy to be prepared to defend against such a launch to North Korea\u2019s south.\u000a\u000aAfter a review of our missile defense options in 2008, President George W. Bush chose Aegis BMD as the system of choice to shoot down a threatening satellite. President Trump may need to repeat that performance.\u000a\u000aAmbassador Henry F. (Hank) Cooper, Chairman of High Frontier and an acknowledged expert on strategic and space national security issues, was President Ronald Reagan's Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks with the Soviet Union and Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) Director during the George H.W. Bush administration.

aVThe news that President Trump abandoned Republicans to strike a deal with Congressional Democrats on a three-month extension of the debt limit yielded a predictable response from his predictable cheerleaders: It was brilliant and typically shrewd for the author of "The Art of the Deal" to take the very first offer the Democrats made and ask for nothing in return.\u000a\u000aLess obsequious observers on the right claimed that this was the long-prophesied moment. The seventh seal had been broken. Donald Trump was "pivoting" at last. "The pivot is real and it's spectacular!" proclaimed Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist.\u000a\u000aIn the lexicon of Trumpism and anti-Trumpism, "pivot" has many meanings. But in this context, pivot means to reach across party lines and work with Democrats, giving the shaft to his own party, or at least to the conservatives in the GOP.\u000a\u000aSuch a move has been feared by many conservatives from the earliest days of Trump's candidacy. The former New York Democrat holds no deep love for ideological conservatism, and many of his favorite issues \u2014 protectionism, infrastructure, etc. \u2014 are more naturally part of the Democratic portfolio.\u000a\u000aBut those fears didn't pan out at first. The president and congressional Republicans tried mimic the Democrats in the wake of Barack Obama's victory in 2008 and run the table, particularly on Obamacare "repeal and replace," on a partisan basis. Unfortunately, the GOP couldn't get it done. This infuriated many conservatives, Republicans and Donald Trump himself, and to some extent rightly so.\u000a\u000aFor years, Republicans said that if they could win both Congress and the White House there'd be nothing they couldn't do. Whether this was a lie or just wishful thinking is debatable. Regardless, they failed for several reasons. The Republican majority in the Senate is much narrower than the Democratic majority was when Obama was elected. Many GOP leaders never thought Trump would win, and so they hadn't prepared for victory. Also, the Republican Party is divided along a host of fault lines, and a large swath of the Republican caucus has no experience at actually governing.\u000a\u000aThis is why Trump's decision this week to throw Sen. Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan under the bus was greeted with such glee by many Trump boosters. They place the blame for all of Trump's myriad blunders on the GOP "establishment." They'd rather see Trump pivot and work with Democrats if it means Trump can declare victory about something \u2014 anything \u2014 and if it makes the establishment look bad. What was once a fear is now a hope.\u000a\u000aThe problem is there's another reason Congress has disappointed the president and his most ardent supporters: Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing.\u000a\u000aEven under the best circumstances, major legislation cannot get out of Congress without robust presidential leadership. I wish it were otherwise, because the Congress is the first branch of government and should take the lead. But in the modern era, you can't outsource the big stuff to Congress. Trump didn't know this and refuses to learn.\u000a\u000aFor instance, earlier in the week the White House said Trump was ending the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program, which lets undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children stay here. Attorney General Jeff Sessions came out and said it was unconstitutional. But when the press \u2014 and former president Obama \u2014 castigated Trump as heartless and cruel, the president made it clear he wants Congress to restore the program by passing legislation. And if it doesn't, he suggested, he might keep the program via the same means his AG had just described as unconstitutional.\u000a\u000aMark Krikorian, the leading intellectual advocate for a more restricted immigration policy, should be a natural ally of this White House. He told the New York Times, "(Trump's) being pulled in a bunch of different directions, and because he doesn't have any strong ideological anchor, or deep knowledge of the issue, he ends up sort of not knowing what to do." Instead, the president goes with his gut on everything, letting himself be baited by negative TV coverage.\u000a\u000aThere are many reasons why the pivot theory won't pan out. Trump has made himself too radioactive with the Democratic rank-and-file. Most of his agenda is equally radioactive. But the main reason it will fail is that, contrary to wishful theories that Trump is playing "four-dimensional chess," the president doesn't really know what he's doing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJonah Goldberg is a syndicated columnist and author.

aVThe chairman of the House Freedom Caucus spoke favorably about an Obamacare replacement bill introduced by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy during a Friday morning interview.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" and said he likes the plan from Graham, R-S.C., and Cassidy, R-La., which would have states build their own healthcare platforms based on their individual needs.\u000a\u000a"The most promising thing right now, Joe, is Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Cassidy working on a block grant issue," Meadows said.\u000a\u000a"It deals with that Medicaid portion. It actually doesn't repeal all the taxes, but it gives power back to the states, allows most of the states, if not all of the states, to do better on that Medicaid portion."\u000a\u000aGraham has spoken several times about his healthcare proposal, which would involve the federal government providing grants to states. That money would then be used to build healthcare systems that would be tailored to the states' populations.\u000a\u000a"Take all the money you would spend in Washington on healthcare, block grant it back to the states, and let them design healthcare systems closer to your family," Graham said last month. "This would empower state choice; it would empower consumers."\u000a\u000aThe House passed a bill in March that would have repealed and replaced the current Obamacare law. The Senate altered the bill and eventually put it up for a vote in July, which fell short of passing.\u000a\u000aDuring Friday's MSNBC interview, Meadows also was asked about reports that suggested the House Freedom Caucus was trying to force House Speaker Paul Ryan out of his leadership role.\u000a\u000a"There is no plan, there's nothing there," Meadows said. "I can tell you, if I was working on a plan to depose the speaker, you wouldn't be reading about it in the press."

aVGENEVA (AP) \u2014 Swallow deeply, pinch the nose and repeat the mantra: "Tastes like beef, tastes likes beef." Then bite into the burger of rice, chopped vegetables, spices and mealworm larvae.\u000a\u000aThe Swiss supermarket chain Coop, to a bit of domestic hoopla, has begun selling burgers and balls made from insects. It's being billed as a legal first in Europe, a continent more accustomed to steak, sausage, poultry and fish as a source of protein.\u000a\u000aThe goal is to convince leery consumers to try a nutritious, if unusual food that "preserves the planet's resources," Coop says.\u000a\u000aAbout one-third of the burger is mealworm larvae. A burger weighing 100 grams (3.5 ounces) has about 10 grams of protein in it \u2014 about the same amount found in a child's-size beef burger.\u000a\u000aFor now, only seven of Coop's nearly 2,500 stores in Switzerland are serving up the critters concocted by the Zurich-based food startup Essento. The chain says the insect products have been flying off shelves during their limited rollout in the Alpine nation and a broader launch is planned by year's end.\u000a\u000aInsect promoters say Switzerland isn't the first European country to allow retail sales, just the first to have those sales so clearly authorized. A change in Swiss law in May allows the sale of three types of insects: mealworm larvae, house crickets and migratory locusts.\u000a\u000a"It's the first time that a state has authorized human consumption of insects in such a firm, explicit way in Europe," said Christophe Derrien, chief of the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed.\u000a\u000aInsects can be found on the shelves in Belgium, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, but that's due to a "legal void" in European Union rules, he said.\u000a\u000aNew legislation taking effect in January will smooth the way for bug burgers to turn up on picnic plates across the EU, however.\u000a\u000aThe chain says it has a policy of not releasing sales numbers, but spokeswoman Andrea Bergmann said the insect burgers and balls "have been very successful from day one and have been sold out quickly everywhere."\u000a\u000aThe burger itself has little white specks of rice inside with traces of carrot, paprika, chili powder and pepper. After a hesitant bite, the main flavors that come out are the spices. The texture is curious, a bit like a meaty falafel with a crunch. An aftertaste lingered \u2014 but maybe that was just my subconscious playing tricks.\u000a\u000aThe insect burgers, like the meat variety, can be accompanied by buns, tomatoes and lettuce. The insect balls \u2014 a mixture of mealworms with cilantro, onions and chickpeas \u2014 seem to fit best in pita bread, perhaps with a spoonful of yogurt.\u000a\u000aThe U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization has promoted insects as a source of human food, saying they are healthy and high in protein and minerals. The agency says many types of insects produce less greenhouse gases and ammonia than most livestock \u2014 such as methane-spewing cattle \u2014 and require less land and money to cultivate.\u000a\u000aStill, there's no telling how long a true conversion in consumer tastes from beef to bug burgers might take \u2014 if it happens at all.

For earning above that limit, $1 of Social Security benefits are withheld for every $2 earned, according to the Social Security Administration "While it's not a permanent loss \u2014 the Social Security Department will repay all withheld benefits in monthly increments after you officially leave the working world \u2014 those relying on a fat check from the government may have to work with a significantly reduced one while they stay on the job," Bankrate said.Working in retirement could affect the amount of Social Security benefits that is taxable, which is determined by combined income, Time magazine explained \u201cTake a retiree in the 15% federal tax bracket who is taxed on 50% of his Social Security. When he earns another $1,000, his so-called combined income rises by that much too, subjecting another $500 of Social Security income to taxes. So the tax bill on that $1,000 won\u2019t be $150 (15% of $1,000) but $225 (15% of $1,500), for an effective rate of 22.5%,\u201d Time said.

aVWhile weather may be important for high corn yields, there are a few proven ways to improve your corn yields that don\u2019t involve doing a rain dance.\u000a\u000aTechnology and science have given farmers the tools to effectively increase corn yields over the last century.\u000a\u000aHere are a few simple tried and tested methods to make sure you get the best results from your corn crops:\u000a\u000a1. Employ a crop rotation strategy \u2014 According to Delta Farm Press, more than 68 percent of the winners in the National Corn Growers Association Yield Contest employ crop rotation.\u000a\u000aIn fact, according to an article by Erick Larson, it may be the most important management practice for enhancing crop yields. That\u2019s because crop rotation improves the soil quality and reduces the risk of weeds, diseases, insects, and pests.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aThe University of Wisconsin\u2019 Agronomy Department echoes this advice, listing fertility, pest management, and soil conservation as the major benefits of crop rotation. According to one of its studies, growing winter wheat before corn can lead to a 10- to 25-percent increase in grain yield.\u000a\u000a2. Make sure your soil is healthy \u2014 While crop rotation may play a part in keeping your soil healthy, there are other factors that contribute to fertility.\u000a\u000aThe Corn and Soybean Digest suggests testing soil regularly to make sure it contains optimum pH levels. You\u2019ll also want to make sure the soil contains the correct amounts of nutrients.\u000a\u000aThe University of Wisconsin\u2019 Agronomy Department also suggests banding phosphorus and potassium with the planter and adding phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) below the soil\u2019s surface for better uptake.\u000a\u000aDelta Farm Press adds that it\u2019s also important to check the temperature of your soil. Soil that\u2019s too wet when you plant will hinder the development of roots, and soil temperatures affect germination rates.\u000a\u000aIdeally, your soil should be 55 degrees Fahrenheit two inches down, and 50 degrees Fahrenheit at six inches.\u000a\u000a3. Plant your crops early \u2014 The Corn and Soybean Digest recommends planting your crops as soon as the weather and soil are ready. They report that farmers are experiencing higher yields by planting almost a month earlier than usual.\u000a\u000aQuoting Tim Maloney, a crop consultant in Janesville, Wisconsin, the site says today\u2019s hybrid seeds are more than capable of handling early planting.\u000a\u000aAccording to research by DuPont Pioneer, early planting lengthens your growing period and can result in earlier pollination. While planting dates are determined by the climate and soil quality, they suggest planting in the last three weeks of May to end up with yields more than 300 bu/acre.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Choose hybrids with a proven track record \u2014 DuPont Pioneer believes that it\u2019s selecting the right seeds that makes the biggest difference to your corn yield.\u000a\u000aAccording to them, farmers need to match hybrid characteristics with those of their fields and environments to get the best results.\u000a\u000aBob Nielsen, Extension agronomist at Purdue University, agrees. In an article for the Corn and Soybean Digest, he said: \u201cIt's not only important to identify hybrids that perform well, but perform consistently well."\u000a\u000aThe University of Wisconsin\u2019 Agronomy Department suggests choosing a hybrid that\u2019s been proven to work under a number of different circumstances. Farmers should also base their choices on yield potential and stability, but they should also consider maturity, disease resistance, and pest management traits.\u000a\u000a5. Feed your corn \u2014 Delta Farm Press says it\u2019s important for farmers in higher rainfall areas to consider the effects of nitrogen loss.\u000a\u000aAn easy way to counteract this would be to use a nitrogen fertilizer when needed. DFP suggests applying a small amount of this fertilizer just after the plant starts growing and more just before the rapid growth stages. The idea is to reduce nitrogen loss and make more available when the crops need it most.\u000a\u000aDelta Farm Press also encourages farmers to use a \u201cstarter fertilizer." Corn responds well to phosphorous and zinc, both immobile nutrients, in its root zone. Absorbing lots of these supplements in its early stages of growth gives the plants a better chance of strong growth.\u000a\u000a6. Control ryegrass \u2014 According to Brechbuhler Scales, ryegrass competes heavily with immature corn and seedlings and the best way to eliminate it is to catch it early.\u000a\u000aScientists from the Mississippi State University recommend applying herbicide applications in fall, winter, and spring to control ryegrass and other weeds.\u000a\u000aDeDell Seeds also points out that weeds drain valuable nutrients away from new crops trying to grow. Ideally, you should be managing weeds regularly to get the best out of your crop.\u000a\u000a7. Scout your fields regularly \u2014 No matter how much planning you put into your crops before planting them, anything can happen while they\u2019re growing.\u000a\u000aThe Corn and Soybean Digest recommends regularly monitoring your crops by foot to pick up on and fix any yield-limiting factors as soon as they arise.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat

aVThere\u2019s a good reason comprehensive immigration reform hasn\u2019t seen the light of day.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not because of partisanship, since both Democrats and Republicans controlled the White House and Congress in that span. It\u2019s something much more basic: lack of common sense.\u000a\u000aStrident hardliners want an all-or-nothing approach, from deporting twelve million illegals (impossible) to having totally open borders (equally impossible). Their inability to compromise has killed any meaningful reform.\u000a\u000aThen there\u2019s the reluctance of party leaders to change the status quo, since they gain tremendous political benefit from non-action. Special interest groups, from Big Business to labor unions, line their pockets to keep things just the way they are.\u000a\u000aThe one positive immigration development \u2014 the successful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program \u2014 has just been axed by the Trump administration. The result has been an uproar, since the lives of 800,000 productive people, who had legal residency and legitimate employment, have been thrown into chaos.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s look at the controversy surrounding the DACA \u201cDreamers.\u201d\u000a\u000aQuick background: DACA, instituted by the President Obama, deferred immigration action on children brought to America by their illegal immigrant parents. It did not grant legal status, but instead protected those who qualified from being deported. It also provided work permits for two years, which were renewable.\u000a\u000aNow to the issue:\u000a\u000a1) The premise for rescinding DACA is that it\u2019s unconstitutional. Trump administration officials stated that President Obama made an end-run around congress by instituting something that should\u2019ve been under the purview of the legislative branch. That\u2019s very likely true. That said, the president has broad discretionary powers when it comes to immigration. So, given how unpredictable judges can be in interpreting the law (with some actively legislating from the bench), the jury is still out on DACA\u2019s constitutionality.\u000a\u000a2) The White House has rolled out many good policies, but most have been inexcusably bumbled due to incompetence and lack of foresight; the DACA decision was no different.\u000a\u000aRather than creating panic-inducing uncertainty, especially after months of promising \u201cbig heart\u201d compassion and telling Dreamers they shouldn\u2019t worry, the president should have worked quietly with Congress to formulate a replacement program before his announcement. That way, there would\u2019ve already been a plan in place to ensure a smooth, less-stressful transition. Doing it backwards was like discontinuing the space shuttle before having a replacement \u2014 a decision that still haunts America.\u000a\u000a3) Give President Obama credit: he led on the immigration issue when Congress would not. Maybe he overstepped his bounds, but he did what he thought was right. It certainly wasn\u2019t the first time a president had gone into uncharted territory. And recent presidents, including Eisenhower, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, all instituted executive actions protecting segments of undocumented immigration. The lesson: if more elected officials did their job instead of nothing, then presidents wouldn\u2019t push the limits of their office.\u000a\u000a4) Constitutional concerns aside, several questions: Why these people? Why now? And why not focus on more pressing immigration issues?\u000a\u000aAccording to reports, 91 percent of Dreamers are employed, and most, if not all, have no criminal record. They are paying taxes and contributing to the economy, while remaining out of the shadowy underworld.\u000a\u000aBut are they taking jobs from Americans? Maybe some, but for the most part, that is a fallacy. We may not want to hear it, but far too many Americans are unmotivated to seek work, let alone maintain a job. For some, anything not paying $125,000 for a forty-hour workweek is beneath them. Instead, the overly-coddled Entitlement Generation, which expects everything but works for nothing, is content to sip lattes and eat avocado sandwiches, while posting social media sweet nothings every 30 seconds.\u000a\u000aSorry, but you can\u2019t take a job away from someone who doesn\u2019t want to work. The market seeks productive people with a strong work ethic, and if legal Dreamers fill that bill, then good for them. What could be more capitalistic, indeed more American, than that?\u000a\u000a4) It was not the Dreamers\u2019 choice to enter America illegally, and the vast majority are productive, law-abiding people, many of whom only speak English. Where is the compassion in throwing them back into dangerous, unknown lands?\u000a\u000aThe solution is two-fold: first, President Trump must work with Congress to pass legislation that effectively continues DACA, despite the inevitable howls that will come from his hardcore base.\u000a\u000aSecond, remembering that America grants resident status to over one million legal immigrants per year, we should:\u000a\u000a\u2014 Build a border wall utilizing non-violent prisoners and illegal immigrants, which would solve prison overcrowding and save billions. Funding could be derived from drug seizures and foreign aid diverted from Mexico. The wall would also curtail drug traffickers, human smugglers, and terrorists.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Institute self-deportation by employing stringent law enforcement measures on businesses, and eliminate lavish public benefits.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Mandate businesses utilize the free E-Verify system. Any company in noncompliance should face stiff penalties and potential criminal prosecution.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Illegal immigrants convicted of crimes should serve their time and be deported. Countries refusing to accept their citizens should be cut off from foreign aid.\u000a\u000a\u2014 Document illegal immigrants by issuing long-term work visas; permanently deny them citizenship and the right to vote; require them to pass a criminal background check; and mandate taxes and fines.\u000a\u000aDone. Crisis solved with common sense and compassion.

aVRepublican Congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, leader of an influential caucus of GOP moderates in the House, announced Thursday he will not seek re-election to an eighth House term next year.\u000a\u000aDent, who has been a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said in an interview that he never intended to serve as long as he has. But he also said the polarization and conflict on Capitol Hill that make even routine legislating difficult "get tiring."\u000a\u000a"Clearly there are challenges here," Dent said. "I worry that with both political parties there is a growing protectionism, nativism and at times nihilism."\u000a\u000aDent is among a dying breed of centrist Republicans on Capitol Hill, and just the most recent GOP moderate to announce plans to leave Congress. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Dave Reichert of Washington also plan to retire after their current terms expire, and all three departures create potential pickup opportunities for Democrats as they aim to retake control of the House next year.\u000a\u000aDent's district of east-central Pennsylvania, including Allentown, leans slightly Republican and is certain to be heavily contested by both parties.\u000a\u000aDent, 57, is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, putting him at the center of spending deals routinely scorned by the party's right flank, with which he regularly did battle. He opposed Trump's election and has not hesitated to criticize the Trump administration's handling of certain policies as well as the president's tone, even while working with the administration on areas of agreement like veterans' issues. Despite his problems with Trump, Dent said that's not what's causing him to leave Congress.\u000a\u000aDent was prominent in the debate over health care legislation earlier this year, ultimately voting against the GOP's legislation to repeal and replace "Obamacare." The debate divided his own moderate caucus, known as the Tuesday Group, for which he was a prominent spokesman.\u000a\u000aDent began his career in state politics and expressed regrets even as he disclosed his plans, saying, "I've enjoyed this job immensely, I love this job." He said he has not yet made plans for his next move but hopes to continue as a voice for responsible governance.

aV\u201cThe Fourth Amendment was designed to stand between us and arbitrary governmental authority. For all practical purposes, that shield has been shattered, leaving our liberty and personal integrity subject to the whim of every cop on the beat, trooper on the highway and jail official.\u201d \u2014 Herman Schwartz, The Nation\u000a\u000aOur freedoms \u2014 especially the Fourth Amendment \u2014 are being choked out by a prevailing view among government bureaucrats that they have the right to search, seize, strip, scan, shoot, spy on, probe, pat down, taser, and arrest any individual at any time and for the slightest provocation.\u000a\u000aSuch is life in America today that Americans are being made to relinquish the most intimate details of who we are \u2014 our biological makeup, our genetic blueprints, and our biometrics (facial characteristics and structure, fingerprints, iris scans, etc.) \u2014 in order to clear the nearly insurmountable hurdle that increasingly defines life in the United States: we are now guilty until proven innocent.\u000a\u000aForced cavity searches, forced colonoscopies, forced blood draws, forced breath-alcohol tests, forced DNA extractions, forced eye scans, forced inclusion in biometric databases: these are just a few ways in which Americans are being forced to accept that we have no control over our bodies, our lives, and our property, especially when it comes to interactions with the government.\u000a\u000aConsider, for example, what happened to Utah nurse Alex Wubbels after a police detective demanded to take blood from a badly injured, unconscious patient without a warrant.\u000a\u000aWubbels refused, citing hospital policy that requires police to either have a warrant or permission from the patient in order to draw blood. The detective had neither. Irate, the detective threatened to have Wubbels arrested if she didn\u2019t comply. Backed up by her supervisors, Wubbels respectfully stood her ground only to be roughly grabbed, shoved out of the hospital, handcuffed and forced into an unmarked car while hospital police looked on and failed to intervene (take a look at the police body camera footage, which has gone viral, and see for yourself).\u000a\u000aMichael Chorosky didn\u2019t have an advocate like Wubbels to stand guard over his Fourth Amendment rights. Chorosky was surrounded by police, strapped to a gurney and then had his blood forcibly drawn after refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. \u201cWhat country is this? What country is this?\u201d cried Chorosky during the forced blood draw.\u000a\u000aWhat country is this indeed?\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, forced blood draws are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the indignities and abuses being heaped on Americans in the so-called name of \u201cnational security.\u201d\u000a\u000aForced cavity searches, forced colonoscopies, and forced roadside strip searches are also becoming par for the course in an age in which police are taught to have no respect for the citizenry\u2019s bodily integrity whether or not a person has done anything wrong.\u000a\u000aFor example, 21-year-old Charnesia Corley was allegedly being pulled over by Texas police in 2015 for \u201crolling\u201d through a stop sign. Claiming they smelled marijuana, police handcuffed Corley, forced her to strip off her pants, threw her to the ground, forced her legs apart and then probed her vagina. The cavity search lasted 11 minutes. This practice is referred to as \u201crape by cop.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavid Eckert was forced to undergo an anal cavity search, three enemas, and a colonoscopy after allegedly failing to yield to a stop sign at a Wal-Mart parking lot. Cops justified the searches on the grounds that they suspected Eckert was carrying drugs because his \u201cposture [was] erect\u201d and \u201che kept his legs together.\u201d No drugs were found.\u000a\u000aDuring a routine traffic stop, Leila Tarantino was subjected to two roadside strip searches in plain view of passing traffic, while her two children \u2014 ages 1 and 4 \u2014 waited inside her car. During the second strip search, presumably in an effort to ferret out drugs, a female officer \u201cforcibly removed\u201d a tampon from Tarantino. No contraband or anything illegal was found.\u000a\u000aThirty-eight-year-old Angel Dobbs and her 24-year-old niece, Ashley, were pulled over by a Texas state trooper on July 13, 2012, allegedly for flicking cigarette butts out of the car window. Insisting that he smelled marijuana, the trooper proceeded to interrogate them and search the car. Despite the fact that both women denied smoking or possessing any marijuana, the police officer then called in a female trooper, who carried out a roadside cavity search, sticking her fingers into the older woman\u2019s anus and vagina, then performing the same procedure on the younger woman, wearing the same pair of gloves. No marijuana was found.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, four Milwaukee police officers were charged with carrying out rectal searches of suspects on the street and in police district stations over the course of several years. One of the officers was accused of conducting searches of men\u2019s anal and scrotal areas, often inserting his fingers into their rectums and leaving some of his victims with bleeding rectums.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s gotten so bad that you don\u2019t even have to be suspected of possessing drugs to be subjected to a strip search.\u000a\u000aThanks to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Florence v. Burlison, any person who is arrested and processed at a jail house, regardless of the severity of his or her offense (i.e., they can be guilty of nothing more than a minor traffic offense), can be subjected to a strip search by police or jail officials without reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is carrying a weapon or contraband.\u000a\u000aAs technology advances, police searches are becoming more invasive on a cellular level, as well, with passive alcohol sensors, DNA collection roadblocks, iris scans, and facial recognition software \u2014 to name just a few methods \u2014 used to assault our bodily integrity.\u000a\u000aAmerica\u2019s founders could scarcely have imagined a world in which we needed protection against widespread government breaches of our privacy, including on a cellular level.\u000a\u000aYet that\u2019s exactly what we so desperately need.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, as I make clear in my book "Battlefield America: The War on the American People," the indignities being heaped upon us by the architects and agents of the American police state \u2014 whether or not we\u2019ve done anything wrong \u2014 are just a foretaste of what is to come.\u000a\u000aConstitutional attorney and author John W.

aVSPECIAL:\u000a\u000aFeeling Down? Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aRecognizing the signs of depression can be an important step toward healing. Knowing that a friend or loved one needs emotional support or medical intervention can make the difference in saving their life.Statistics show that more than one out of 10 people with depression commit suicide, according to WebMD . Here are five warning signs that someone is suffering depression.Sometimes someone who is depressed will have insomnia, and often, that person may fall asleep only to wake up during the middle of the night or in early morning, noted Dr. Norman Rosenthal on his website Often, a person with depression will have no interest in things that once ` brought pleasure, Rosenthal noted."Your loved one may gravitate only to those things that are easily enjoyed and require the least amount of effort, such as playing video-games, sitting in front of the TV or surfing the Web. This readily leads to thoughts or comments such as 'You have plenty of time and interest for surfing the Web, but not when it comes to spending quality time with me.' Engaging with another person and meeting that person\u2019s needs require more effort than surfing the Web and therefore may be an early sign of depression," Rosenthal wrote.These changes in eating habits, along with weight loss or gains, are often telltale signs that someone is depressed, noted WebMD.Headaches, stomach aches or digestive problems (that don't seem to improve even after treatment) may be signals that someone has deep anxiety or depression, WebMD added.Those who talk about suicide should be taken seriously, experts say. It's a sure sign that depression is serious and a person is likely to need not only therapy but medication, according to SAVE (Suicide Awareness Voices of Education) SAVE added: "Chronic depression can lead to feelings of despair and hopelessness, and a suicide attempt is one way some people choose to express these feelings. Most people who attempt or commit suicide don't really want to die \u2014 they just want their pain and suffering to end. A suicide attempt is also not done to gain someone's sympathy, as those that attempt to take their life do it for internal reasons-they simply can't stand the pain they feel emotionally and/or physically. \u2026 A suicide attempt must always be taken seriously."

aVTexans affected by Hurricane Harvey, including my family and me, appreciate the outpouring of support from across the country. President Donald Trump has even pledged to donate one million dollars to relief efforts. These private donations will be much more valuable than the as much as 100 billion dollars the federal government is expected to spend on relief and recovery. Federal disaster assistance hinders effective recovery efforts, while federal insurance subsidies increase the damage caused by natural disasters.\u000a\u000aFederal disaster aid has existed since the early years of the republic. In fact, it was a payment to disaster victims that inspired Davy Crockett\u2019s \u201cNot Yours to Give\u201d speech. However, the early federal role was largely limited to sending checks. The federal government did not become involved in managing disaster relief and recovery until the 20th century. America did not even have a federal agency dedicated solely to disaster relief until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter created the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by executive order. Yet, Americans somehow managed to rebuild after natural disasters before 1979. For example, the people of Galveston, Texas successfully rebuilt the city following a major hurricane that destroyed the city in 1900.\u000a\u000aFEMA\u2019s well-documented inefficiencies are the inevitable result of centralizing control over something as complex as disaster recovery in a federal bureaucracy. When I served in Congress, I regularly voted against federal disaster aid for my district. After the votes, I would hear from angry constituents, many of whom would later tell me that after dealing with FEMA they agreed that Texas would be better off without federal \u201chelp.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollowing natural disasters, individuals who attempt to return to their own property \u2014 much less try to repair the damage \u2014 without government permission can be arrested and thrown in jail. Federal, state, and local officials often hinder or even stop voluntary rescue and relief efforts.\u000a\u000aFEMA is not the only counterproductive disaster assistance program. The National Flood Insurance Program was created to provide government-backed insurance for properties that could not obtain private insurance on their own. By overruling the market\u2019s verdict that these properties should not be insured, federal flood insurance encourages construction in flood-prone areas, thus increasing the damage caused by flooding.\u000a\u000aJust as payroll taxes are unable to fully fund Social Security and Medicare, flood insurance premiums are unable to fund the costs of flood insurance. Federal flood insurance was almost $25 billion in the red before Hurricane Harvey. Congress will no doubt appropriate funding to pay all flood insurance claims, thus increasing the national debt. This in turn will cause the Federal Reserve to print more money to monetize that debt, thus hastening the arrival of the fiscal hurricane that will devastate the US economy. Yet, there is little talk of offsetting any of the costs of hurricane relief with spending cuts!\u000a\u000aCongress should start phasing out the federal flood insurance program by forbidding the issuance of new flood insurance policies. It should also begin reducing federal spending on disaster assistance. Instead, costs associated with disaster recovery should be made 100-percent tax-deductible. Those who suffered the worst should be completely exempted from all federal tax liability for at least two years. Tax-free savings accounts could also help individuals save money to help them bear the costs of a natural disaster.\u000a\u000aThe outpouring of private giving and volunteer relief efforts we have witnessed over the past week shows that the American people can effectively respond to natural disasters if the government would get out of their way.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Paul is a physician, author, and former Republican congressman.

aVA future trivia question and historical footnote, the spectacular 10-day flameout of Anthony Scaramucci qualifies as the most entertaining episode yet of the ongoing reality show that is the Trump presidency. (Working title: "The Pompadours of 1600 Pennsylvania.") But even as the cocksure sycophant's gobsmacking spectacle stole the show, something of real importance took place a bit lower on the radar.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt five separate junctures, the sinews of our democracy held against the careening recklessness of this presidency. Consequently, Donald Trump's worst week proved a particularly fine hour for American democracy:\u000a\u000a1) The military says no to Trump on the transgender ban.\u000a\u000aWell, not directly \u2014 that's insubordination \u2014 but with rather elegant circumspection. The president tweeted out a total ban on transgender people serving in the military. It came practically out of nowhere. The military brass, not consulted, was not amused. Defense Secretary James Mattis, in the middle of a six-month review of the issue, was reportedly appalled.\u000a\u000aWhat was done? Nothing. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs simply declared that a tweet is not an order. Until he receives a formal command and develops new guidelines, the tweet will be ignored.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the military told the commander in chief to go jump in a lake. Generally speaking, this is not a healthy state of affairs in a nation of civilian control. It does carry a whiff of insubordination. But under a president so uniquely impulsive and chronically irrational, a certain vigilance, even prickliness, on the part of the military is to be welcomed.\u000a\u000aThe brass framed their inaction as a matter of procedure. But the refusal carried with it a reminder of institutional prerogatives. In this case, the military offered resistance to mere whimsy. Next time, it could be resistance to unlawfulness.\u000a\u000a2) The Senate saves Sessions.\u000a\u000aTrump's relentless public humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was clearly intended to get him to resign. He didn't, in part because of increasing support from Congress. Sessions' former colleagues came out strongly in his defense and some openly criticized the president's shabby treatment of his first and most fervent senatorial supporter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndeed, Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned Trump not to fire Sessions because he wouldn't get another attorney general \u2014 the committee's entire 2017 schedule was set and there would be no hearings to approve a new AG. That was a finger to the eye of the president. Every once in a while, the Senate seems to remember that it is a coequal branch.\u000a\u000a3) Senate Republicans reject the Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000aThe causes here are multiple, most having nothing to do with Trump. Republicans are deeply divided on the proper role of government in health care. This division is compounded by the sea change in public opinion as, over seven years, Obamacare has become part of the fabric of American medicine, and health care has come to be seen as a right rather than a commodity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the stunning Senate rejection of repeal was also a pointed rejection of Trump's health care hectoring. And a show of senatorial disdain for Trump craving a personal legislative "win" on an issue about whose policy choices he knew nothing and cared less.\u000a\u000a4) The Boy Scouts protest.\u000a\u000aIn a rebuke not as earthshaking but still telling, the chief executive of the Boy Scouts found it necessary to apologize for the president's speech last week to their quadrennial jamboree. It was a wildly inappropriate confection, at once whining, self-referential, partisan and political.\u000a\u000aHow do you blow a speech to Boy Scouts? No merit badge for the big guy.\u000a\u000a5) The police chiefs chide.\u000a\u000aIn an address to law enforcement officials, Trump gave a wink and a nod to cops roughing up suspects. Several police chiefs subsequently reprimanded Trump for encouraging police brutality \u2014 a mild form, perhaps, but brutality still.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was all a joke. Nonsense. It was an ugly sentiment, expressed coyly enough to be waved away as humor but with the thuggish undertone of a man who, heckled at a campaign rally, once said approvingly that in the old days "guys like that" would "be carried out on a stretcher."\u000a\u000aWhatever your substantive position on the various issues involved above, we should all be grateful that from the generals to the Scouts, from the senators to the cops, the institutions of both political and civil society are holding up well.\u000a\u000aTrump is a systemic stress test. The results are good, thus far.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCharles Krauthammer is a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist, published weekly in more than 400 newspapers worldwide.

aVDemocratic leaders made the right call on making a deal with President Donald Trump on the debt ceiling and providing recovery funding for Harvey victims, said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., Friday.\u000a\u000a"It was the right thing to do. We have to pay our bills, keep the government open and provide relief to those that were in Harvey's way," Swalwell said Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."\u000a\u000aWorking with Trump provides "leverage" so Democrats can get other goals accomplished, the congressman said.\u000a\u000a"We have the leverage and the energy of the American people behind us, and we have a very weakened president. And so despite (Democrats) being in the minority, you will see that a majority of Republicans will vote against keeping government open, which puts us in a much better position to act on behalf of our constituents," Swalwell said.\u000a\u000aThe House of Representatives approved a bill 316-90, as part of the deal struck between Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Trump, according to CNN.\u000a\u000aThe deal combines funding for emergency hurricane relief with measures that increase the debt ceiling and keep the government open for three months.\u000a\u000a"The president is pleased Congress acted quickly," a White House official said, according to CNN.

aVThere are congressionally approved laws against approximately 4,450 federal crimes. Overall, bureaucrats have approved regulations creating more than 300,000 federal crimes.[1][2] That means at least 98.5 percent of all federal crimes were never approved by Congress.\u000a\u000aJim Copland of the Manhattan Institute refers to this as "Criminalization Without Representation."[3] "Though this practice has been normalized over the past few decades with the growth of the modern regulatory state,\u201d Copland believes that \u201cit is a sharp departure from our nation\u2019s philosophical roots. Elected representatives \u2014 and, by extension, those they represent \u2014 have not had a meaningful say in whether conduct should be criminalized." And, Copland reminds us, "the Declaration of Independence specifically states that the government\u2019s just powers are derived 'from the consent of the governed.'"\u000a\u000aThe Competitive Enterprise Institute notes that for every new law passed by Congress last year, 18 new federal rules were implemented by the bureaucracy.[4]\u000a\u000aAfter adjusting for inflation, the budget for federal regulatory agencies is nine times higher today than it was in 1970.

aVFearsome Hurricane Irma cut a path of devastation across the northern Caribbean, leaving at least 10 dead and thousands homeless after destroying buildings and uprooting trees on a track Thursday that could lead to a catastrophic strike on Florida.\u000a\u000aThe most potent Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever, Irma weakened only slightly Thursday morning and remained a powerful Category 5 storm with winds of 180 mph (285 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\u000a\u000aThe storm was increasingly likely to rip into heavily populated South Florida early Sunday, prompting the governor to declare an emergency and officials to impose mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the Miami metro area and the Florida Keys. Forecasters said it could punish the entire Atlantic coast of Florida and rage on into Georgia and South Carolina.\u000a\u000a"This could easily be the most costly storm in U.S. history, which is saying a lot considering what just happened two weeks ago," said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, alluding to the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey.\u000a\u000aFrench Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told France Info radio that eight had died and 23 injured in the country's Caribbean island territories, and he said the toll on Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy could be higher because rescue teams have yet to finish their inspection of the islands.\u000a\u000a"The reconnaissance will really start at daybreak," Collomb said.\u000a\u000aAt a news conference, Collomb also said 100,000 food rations have been sent to the islands, the equivalent of four days of supplies.\u000a\u000a"It's a tragedy, we'll need to rebuild both islands," he said. "Most of the schools have been destroyed."\u000a\u000aFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office said he will go to the islands has soon as weather conditions permit. Macron said France is "grief-stricken" by the devastation caused by Irma and called for concerted efforts to tackle global warming and climate change to prevent similar future natural disasters.\u000a\u000aIn the United Kingdom, the government said Irma inflicted "severe and in places critical" damage to the British overseas territory of Anguilla. Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan said the Caribbean island took the full force of the hurricane. He told lawmakers on Thursday that the British Virgin islands have also suffered "severe damage."\u000a\u000aIrma blacked out much of Puerto Rico, raking the U.S. territory with heavy wind and rain while staying just out to sea, and it headed early Thursday toward the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\u000a\u000aTo the east, authorities struggled to get aid to small Caribbean islands devastated by the storm's record 185 mph (298 kph) winds. Communications were difficult with areas hit by Irma, and information on damage trickled out.\u000a\u000aNearly every building on Barbuda was damaged when the hurricane's core crossed almost directly over the island early Wednesday and about 60 percent of its roughly 1,400 residents were left homeless, Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne told The Associated Press.\u000a\u000a"It is just really a horrendous situation," Browne said after returning to Antigua from a plane trip to the neighboring island.\u000a\u000aHe said roads and telecommunications systems were wrecked and recovery would take months, if not years. A 2-year-old child was killed as a family tried to escape a damaged home during the storm, Browne told the AP.\u000a\u000aOne death also was reported in the nearby island of Anguilla, where officials reported extensive damage to the airport, hospitals, shelters and school and said 90 percent of roads are impassible, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.\u000a\u000aThe agency also reported "major damage" to houses and commercial buildings in the British Virgin Islands.\u000a\u000aOn St. Thomas in the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands, Laura Strickling spent 12 hours hunkered down with her husband and 1-year-old daughter in a boarded-up basement apartment with no power as the storm raged outside. They emerged to find the lush island in tatters. Many of their neighbors' homes were damaged and once-dense vegetation was largely gone.\u000a\u000a"There are no leaves. It is crazy. One of the things we loved about St. Thomas is that it was so green. And it's gone," Strickling said. "It will take years for this community to get back on its feet."\u000a\u000aSignificant damage was also reported on St. Martin, an island split between French and Dutch control. Photos and video circulating on social media showed major damage to the airport in Philipsburg and the coastal village of Marigot heavily flooded. France sent emergency food and water there and to the French island of St. Bart's, where Irma ripped off roofs and knocked out electricity.\u000a\u000aDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday the storm "caused widescale destruction of infrastructure, houses and businesses."\u000a\u000a"There is no power, no gasoline, no running water. Houses are under water, cars are floating through the streets, inhabitants are sitting in the dark, in ruined houses and are cut off from the outside world," he said.\u000a\u000aBy Thursday morning, the center of the storm was about 110 miles (180 kilometers) north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and was moving west-northwest near 17 mph (28 kph).\u000a\u000aMore than half the island of Puerto Rico was without power, leaving 900,000 in the dark and nearly 50,000 without water, the U.S. territory's emergency management agency said in the midst of the storm. Fourteen hospitals were using generators after losing power, and trees and light poles were strewn across roads.\u000a\u000aPuerto Rico's public power company warned before the storm hit that some areas could be left without power from four to six months because its staff has been reduced and its infrastructure weakened by the island's decade-long economic slump.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies to remove debris and give other services that will largely be paid for by the U.S. government.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted Irma would remain at Category 4 or 5 for the next day or two as passes just to the north of the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Thursday, nears the Turks & Caicos and parts of the Bahamas by Thursday night and skirts Cuba on Friday night into Saturday.\u000a\u000aIt will then likely head north toward Florida, where people were rushing to board up homes, fill cars with gasoline and find a route to safety.\u000a\u000aGov. Rick Scott, who has mobilized parts of the state's National Guard, declared a state of emergency and asked the governors of Alabama and Georgia to waive trucking regulations so gasoline tankers can get fuel into Florida quickly to ease shortages.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 25,000 people or more left the Florida Keys after all visitors were ordered to clear out, causing bumper-to-bumper traffic on the single highway that links the chain of low-lying islands to the mainland.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Hurricane Katia hovered in the southern Gulf of Mexico, threatening to hit the vulnerable Mexican coast as a Category 2 or 3 hurricane, possibly late Friday or early Saturday. It had winds of 80 mph (130 kph) and was located about 210 miles (335 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico.\u000a\u000aAnd a third hurricane, Jose, was growing far out in the Atlantic. It was no immediate threat to land, though the forecast track showed it could affect the Irma-blasted Leeward Islands over the weekend. Hurricane Jose had winds of about 90 mph (150 kph). It was centered about 815 miles (1,310 kilometers) east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west-northwest at 18 mph (30 kph).\u000a\u000aAnika Kentish reported from St. John's, Antigua.

Not anymore.Groups like Friends of Abe, a conclave of Hollywood and entertainment professionals, are thriving. Actors like the late Charlton Heston, an outspoken Republican and advocate of gun freedom, helped pave the way.One caveat here: The conservative-leaning celebrities listed here may not be going to a Ted Cruz rally anytime soon. They are better described as Hollywood contrarians; they don\u2019t typically advocate any hardcore political agenda.Instead, they are for a new openness in Hollywood, and don\u2019t accept the old industry standard that one has to be a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party to find career advancement.Oftentimes these conservatives are more libertarian than traditional, button-down Republicans.Whatever their stripes, they are a unique and exciting breed changing Hollywood and, we hope, America for the better.Here, Newsmax has compiled a list of 50 influential leaders of this cultural minority who have bucked Hollywood\u2019s liberal establishment and thrived.\u2014 The actor and director famously trashed President Barack Obama in 2012 at the Republican National Convention and stirred up a firestorm of liberal griping with his patriotic film, "American Sniper."\u2014 The star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series of hit movies is not shy about voicing his Christian conservative beliefs. He backed Sen. John McCain's presidential bid in 2008 and recently told evangelist Pat Robertson, "I have surrendered my life to Jesus Christ."\u2014 The "Home Improvement" actor once told Sean Hannity he is a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d who \u201clike[s] problem solving."

aVHurricane Irma bulked up ahead of an all but certain collision with southern Florida after devastating a chain of Caribbean islands and threatening to become the most expensive storm in U.S. history.\u000a\u000aWhile the life-threatening hurricane weakened slightly, Irma grew in size meaning that most of the state will face hurricane-force winds as it cuts a path through the peninsula into Georgia. Now a Category 4 storm with top winds of 150 miles (241 kilometers) an hour, Irma will maintain its strength until it strikes Florida early Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory around 11 a.m. Eastern time. The storm has already left at least 11 people dead and thousands homeless across the Caribbean.\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch of Florida, especially the southern half, is in for a really long and horrible day on Sunday,\u201d said Todd Crawford, lead meteorologist at The Weather Company in Andover, Massachusetts. Another example of \u201cthe power of nature on a heavily populated part of the U.S. coastline is imminent, and the costs will be great.\u201d\u000a\u000aMandatory evacuations were issued for the Florida Keys and other areas. Around 650,000 people were told to leave Miami-Dade, the largest evacuation ever attempted in the county. President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate was ordered to be evacuated along with the rest of Palm Beach following forecasts of catastrophic winds and a powerful storm surge.\u000a\u000aIrma is one of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic Basin. Jose, the third major hurricane of the 2017 season with top winds of 150 miles per hour, is forecast to turn northeast and miss the U.S. In the Gulf of Mexico, Katia strengthened as it moved slowly toward Veracruz, Mexico, where it\u2019s forecast to come ashore early Saturday. The country was also struck by a powerful earthquake on Friday, shaking buildings in the capital and triggering a tsunami warning.\u000a\u000aIrma\u2019s hurricane-force winds now extend for 140 miles, creating a danger zone that would extend from West Palm Beach on the Atlantic coast to Fort Myers on the Gulf of Mexico. That\u2019s creating an \u201cinsurance industry nightmare\u201d as every county in the state could experience damaged roofs and power outages so vast it overwhelms utility repair efforts, said Chuck Watson, a Savannah, Georgia-based disaster modeler with Enki Research.\u000a\u000aDamages could easily top $135 billion in Florida, with other economic losses pushing the price tag as high as $200 billion, Watson said. Preliminary estimates show losses across the Caribbean nearing $5 billion, Josh Darr, lead meteorologist with insurance broker JLT Re Ltd. wrote in his blog Friday.\u000a\u000aTotal losses from Katrina reached $160 billion in 2017 dollars after it slammed into New Orleans in 2005.\u000a\u000a\u201cWind damage is totally going to throw a wrench into the insurance industry,\u201d Watson said. \u201cYou are talking about companies failing.\u201d\u000a\u000aInsurers including XL Group Ltd. and Everest Re Group Ltd. recovered some ground after falling 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent respectively Thursday. The storm may knock out power to more than 3 million homes and businesses, curb natural gas demand in one of the largest U.S. markets and threaten $1.2 billion worth of crops in Florida -- the nation\u2019s top grower of fresh tomatoes, oranges, green beans, cucumbers, squash and sugarcane.\u000a\u000aIrma was 405 miles southeast of Miami and is forecast to approach the north coast of Cuba and the central Bahamas before striking southern Florida Sunday morning, the hurricane center said.\u000a\u000aWhy We Expect More Havoc From Hurricanes Like Harvey: QuickTake\u000a\u000aIrma comes just two weeks after Hurricane Harvey smashed ashore in Texas, knocking offline almost a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity and causing widespread power outages and flooding.\u000a\u000aIn other storm news:

aVIn 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center designated the Family Research Council a \u201chate group\u201d because of its orthodox position on homosexuality, and its occasionally incendiary defenses of that position.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Floyd Corkins showed up at the Family Research Council headquarters with a gun.\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t mean to imply that these two things were connected. I'm telling you that they were connected. We know because the shooter told the FBI where he got the idea.\u000a\u000aConservatives have used this to try to discredit the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of hate groups. But the sad truth is that if you criticize someone, there\u2019s always some small chance that an unstable person will read your criticism and decide its subject needs killing. The shooting is still not the fault of the writer, but the fault of the shooter.\u000a\u000a(Just in case it helps, I interrupt this column to point out that you should not shoot anyone I write about, or anyone I don\u2019t write about, or anyone.)\u000a\u000aAlso, you don\u2019t need to manufacture ersatz accountability in order to discredit the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate group tally. You just need to tell people what\u2019s on the list.\u000a\u000aSome of the groups named are what anyone would think of as a hate group, like, you know, the Ku Klux Klan. But other entries are a festival of guilt-by-association innuendo about people with at best a tangential relationship to the target institution, and whose statements fall well short of blanket group-calumny or calls for violence. Or the center offers bizarrely shifting rationales that suggest that the staff started with the target they wanted to deem hateful, and worked backward to the analysis.\u000a\u000aI spent a day diving down the rabbit hole of one of the listings on the hate group, for the Ruth Institute, a small nonprofit that thinks the sexual revolution was a giant mistake. The Ruth Institute does seem to have a couple of marginally attached figures who have at some point theorized an unsupported connection between homosexuality and pedophilia. But however wrongheaded and insulting this may be, by itself, it hardly merits branding the whole organization a \u201chate group.\u201d And a lot of the other \u201cevidence\u201d for this designation is simply \u2026 well, fully deserving of those contemptuous quotation marks.\u000a\u000aLet's look at how the center justified dubbing the Ruth Institute a hate group:\u000a\u000aOne link presents the Ruth Institute\u2019s president, Jennifer Roback Morse, as having offered the \u201crace-baiting\u201d comment that President Barack Obama was \u201cmore gay than he is black\u201d -- an assertion that turns out to be an out-of-context quotation of an obvious verbal slip during a radio interview. That link also asserts that the Ruth Institute \u201creprinted a column blasting the LGBT movement\u2019s \u2018mythology of grievance and sexual oppression\u2019\u201d; in fact, the column is on the broader topic of the sexual revolution, not just LGBT activism, and the \u201cmythology\u201d refers to the (true) fact that many of the landmark legal cases that paved the revolution\u2019s legal path, including Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas, were not entirely what they seemed.\u000a\u000aThat same source claims that \u201cThe Ruth Institute even reprinted a column which attempted to link the Lawrence decision to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal\u201d -- referring to a column about legal trends in which Lawrence is mentioned only in passing, as an example of the weakening of community moral standards as a basis for law. (Whether or not you think it was a good idea, this weakening has indisputably occurred, and the Lawrence case was a landmark exhibit.)\u000a\u000aThe SPLC also criticizes Morse (a Catholic) for calling homosexuality \u201cintrinsically disordered,\u201d which I grant does sound gratuitously insulting to non-Catholics. But this is in fact a technical term in Catholic theology which also covers things heterosexuals frequently get up to. Disagree with it (and Catholic sexual teaching) as you will, it is not by itself evidence of a special animus toward homosexuals.\u000a\u000aIf misspeaking in a radio interview, quoting the Vatican and promoting articles like these on your nonprofit\u2019s blog are what now earn a spot alongside the Klan on a list of hate groups, then it may be time for the Southern Poverty Law Center to close up shop, because their work is largely done.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately the center's hate group designation remains extremely influential. Recently, a payment servicer cut off the Ruth Institute because of that "hate group" label. This piqued my interest, because I knew Morse\u2019s work on liberty and the family from long before the gay marriage debate dawned on the political horizon. I\u2019d always found it interesting and thought provoking, and I was surprised to see her lumped in with Holocaust deniers and white supremacists. My astonishment seems to have been well-founded.\u000a\u000a\u201cHate group\u201d is, of course, not a scientific term with a precise definition. The Southern Poverty Law Center's entries do highlight a lot of language about various groups that may not strike me as the equivalent of Klan rhetoric, but does make me uncomfortable. And who am I to say that \u201cdiscomfort\u201d is a better characterization than \u201chate speech\u201d? In criticizing them, am I not committing the same sin of which I accuse the SPLC, trying to leverage my platform to curtail speech I don\u2019t like through unofficial censure?\u000a\u000aWell, yes, indeed, the SPLC has a perfect right to decide what they mean by \u201chate group.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, it also has an incentive to apply this term broadly. When people see that the SPLC lists over 900 hate groups -- 900! -- this seems like good reason to panic. And maybe write a check to the SPLC.\u000a\u000aEven fairly large institutions that theoretically have ample resources to investigate the SPLC\u2019s list often rely on it, to their detriment. CNN published the list under the headline \u201cHere Are All the Hate Groups Active in Your Area,\u201d then had to alter the story upon realizing that this was effectively joining the SPLC in branding local churches and conservative nonprofits as \u201chate groups.\u201d Guidestar, which rates nonprofits, added the SPLC designations to its listings, then had to make an embarrassing volte-face when conservatives called them out. Given the increasing tendency of powerful tech companies to flex their muscle against hate groups, we may see more and more institutions unwittingly turned into critics or censors, not just of Nazi propaganda, but also of fairly mainstream ideas.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not just a problem for the groups that will be burdened when the \u201chate group\u201d label is slapped on them; it\u2019s also a problem for the rest of us. The broader the definition, the more Americans will be swept up under that label, and the less sustainable it will be. If media and other institutions use the label, they will discredit themselves with conservative readers and donors. Worse still, those readers and donors will be unable to reliably discern the actual hate groups that still exist.\u000a\u000aFor exist they do. They are tiny relative to the population, they are marginal, and they have little power. As political scientist Justin Murphy says, overt racism \u201clikely appears larger than it is, especially to progressives, precisely because it has never been less common in American history,\u201d making the few die-hards stand out in sharp relief. The same is probably true of other hateful \u201cisms.\u201d But even a handful of hate group members is too many, and it would be useful to have data on their numbers. Instead, we\u2019re getting data that tells us little about the problem of hate groups, and a whole lot about the SPLC\u2019s agenda and fundraising.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aMegan McArdle is a Bloomberg View columnist.

aVUsing vaginally applied estrogen to ease menopause symptoms likely doesn\u2019t increase a woman\u2019s risk of heart disease or certain cancers, a U.S. study suggests.\u000a\u000aMany women have been reluctant to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked pills containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes. Some women have also been reluctant to use vaginally applied estrogens, which can ease symptoms like dryness and painful intercourse.\u000a\u000aFor the current study, researchers examined data on 45,663 women in the WHI study who didn\u2019t take HRT pills. After an average follow-up of more than six years, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful difference in the odds of cancer, stroke or blood clots based on whether or not women used vaginal estrogen.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe results of the study suggest that the use of vaginal estrogen may not actually carry the same health risks as the use of estrogen pills,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Carolyn Crandall of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese results are reassuring,\u201d Crandall said by email.\u000a\u000aWomen go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\u000a\u000aStudy participants who used vaginal estrogen were less likely to be black or African-American, Hispanic, current smokers, diabetic or obese. They were also more likely to be white and college graduates with household income of more than $100,000 a year.\u000a\u000aCompared with women who didn\u2019t use vaginal estrogen, women who did had a 48 percent lower risk of heart disease and 60 percent lower odds of hip fractures, researchers report in Menopause.\u000a\u000aWhen researchers looked just at women who still had a uterus, the results looked even more favorable for vaginal estrogen users.\u000a\u000aAmong women who had not had their uterus removed, vaginal estrogen users were 61 percent less likely to have heart disease, and 60 percent less likely to have a hip fracture than women who didn\u2019t use vaginal estrogen.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how vaginal estrogen might influence the odds of heart disease, cancer or other health problems.\u000a\u000aAnother limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on different types of vaginal estrogen, so they couldn\u2019t tell whether one form might be best for avoiding cancer or heart disease.\u000a\u000aEven so, the findings should reassure women, said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director of the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women\u2019s Health in New York City.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis shows that it is perfectly safe for any woman to take low-dose vaginal estrogen,\u201d Warren, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000aSome women who have avoided vaginal estrogen because they thought it was just as risky as pills may now be able to get relief for previously untreated menopause symptoms, said Dr. Michael Thomas of the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Ohio.\u000a\u000a\u201cA study like this allows women to safely use a form of estrogen that will help their (vaginal) symptoms,\u201d Thomas, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cThey can have intercourse without pain and feel safe they are not risking their life.\u201d

Importantly, we checked with constituents across the nation, asking their views on individual members of Congress.Our survey was not scientific, but was based on solid criteria, including a House member\u2019s commitment to their job, their interest in constituent services and follow-up, their championing of issues and causes important to the national interest, their honesty, and their ability to get things done.Our survey did not include ideological litmus tests, and it comprises a bipartisan roll call of the House\u2019s greatest. We looked at each member\u2019s concern and passion for the public good.Here is our 2016 list of the 25 Hardest Working Members of Congress:\u2014 At 66 and after 16 years in the House, Cole maintains the same pace as the young campaigner who served as secretary of state of Oklahoma and chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. He now serves as deputy majority whip, as well as a member of the Appropriations, Budget, and Rules Committees. Capitol Hill reporters still marvel at how Cole replies unfailing to their requests, whether it is at midnight or on weekends.\u2014 Despite careers as a lawyer, state representative and senator, and U.S. Representative, Lynch\u2019s drive and seemingly unstoppable energy, friends agree, comes from his days as an ironworker. Working on high-altitude structures by day and attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology by nights and weekends, Lynch rose to become the youngest (30) president of the Iron Workers Local 7 union in Boston. In politics, he has been nothing short of a force of nature: unseating an incumbent in the Democratic primary to win his first term as state representative in 1994. At 61 and now a senior member of the Financial Services and Oversight and Government Reform Committees, Lynch shows no signs of slowing down as a passionate advocate for the little guy.\u2014 No argument here: Ryan\u2019s early-morning workout was highly dramatized when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012 (one BBC reporter actually did the \u201cRyan routine\u201d while broadcasting from Ryan\u2019s hometown) and his morning to midnight schedule on weekdays is well-known by colleagues of both parties. Genuinely drafted to be speaker after John Boehner\u2019s resignation last year, Ryan, has an unparalleled passion for public policy, but he still faithfully returns to his wife and three children in Wisconsin every weekend.\u2014 Former San Diego city councilman and California state legislator Vargas works overtime, Hill staffers say, to maintain close ties to the Obama White House (he and the president were Harvard Law classmates) and to work with Republican colleagues. Vargas recently co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) to benefit wounded warriors and is co-chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast with Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.).\u2014 On Capitol Hill, the joke is that "it's not what cause will Peter King take up next, but what cause hasn't he taken up yet?" At 72 and after 24 years in Congress, the Nassau County lawmaker embraces controversial causes that many lawmakers would rather ignore or don\u2019t see much bang for the political buck. King, past chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and has become the key Capitol Hill player in keeping America vigilant in its the war on terror. King serves as an active watchdog of the banking industry as a Member of the House Financial Services Committee.\u2014 The three-term lawmaker\u2019s capacity for hard work was hailed at the recent National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. A U.S. Air Force veteran of Iraq, he worked overtime in 2014 to secure congressional approval for an airstrike against Syrian strongman Assad \u2014 only to have the White House back off. His is a rising leadership star in the GOP.\u2014 The \u201cother half\u201d of the Democrats\u2019 celebrated \u201cCastro brothers,\u201d Joaquin is the identical twin brother of Housing Secretary and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. Moving with ease from state House to U.S. House, Joaquin is considered a prodigious worker on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committee.\u2014 Professional auditor and former Maricopa County Treasurer, Schweikert is considered one of GOP\u2019s best budget authorities. His mastery of detail and understanding of the budget process have made him \u201cthe indispensable man\u201d for small government conservatives in House.\u2014 One of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, Gabbard is admired on both sides of the aisle for her personal drive \u2014 elected to the Hawaii legislature at 21, deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army at 25, elected to the Honolulu City Council at 30, and Congress at 31. Sandwiching her congressional duties with those as a military police officer in the Army National Guard, Gabbard was a vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee until resigning this year to back Bernie Sanders for president.\u2014 At 36, former Miami public relations man Curbelo is fast becoming known as a hard-charging lawmaker in his first term. On the same day that the White House announced plans to lift Cuba\u2019s designation as a terrorist nation, Curbelo became a highly visible opponent to the plan. A favorite of the \u201cTea Party\u201d in his campaign, Curbelo nonetheless drew swatches of publicity for vowing never to vote against lifting the debt ceiling and declaring \u201cAmerica must never, ever default.\u201d\u2014 Even before he got to Congress, onetime Yale baseball team captain and U.S. Navy veteran DeSantis demonstrated what associates call near-superhuman capacity for work. As a first-time candidate in 2012, he raised more than $1.1 million \u2014 almost all by his telephoning and asking people \u2014 and beat five other Republicans in the primary. A Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he has been a House point man on issues ranging from taking a harder line with Putin\u2019s Russia to trying to thwart the Iran agreement.\u2014 Onetime saleswoman and Republican activist Blackburn caught conservative eyes as a state legislator in 2000. That\u2019s when she broke with fellow Republican and then-Gov. Don Sundquist over his effort to bring a state income tax to Tennessee. Having forged a hard-charging band of conservative followers, Blackburn made history in \u201902 by becoming the first woman elected to Congress from Tennessee who did not follow her husband. These days, one only has to name a conservative cause to find the lady from the Volunteer State at the forefront of it \u2014 opposing climate change, investigating Planned Parenthood, and leading the charge against net neutrality.\u2014 The tenacity of Patrick Murphy became evident to those who covered him in 2012, when the first-time candidate unseated Republican firebrand Rep. Allen West in a major upset. Murphy spent $3 million to West\u2019s $12 million and pulled off a win. Now 33, self-styled \u201cBill Clinton Democrat\u201d Murphy occasionally surprises the liberal-leaning House leadership of his party with stands such as those in favor of the Keystone Pipeline and against tighter regulations on for-profit-universities. As a candidate for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Murphy is now leading fellow Rep. Alan Grayson for the Democratic nomination and has the rare pre-primary endorsement of Barack Obama.\u2014 Puerto Rican born immigration lawyer and three-term Rep. Labrador is considered the House GOP's best point man on legislation on the issue of illegal immigration. He also helped organize the monthly "Conversations With Conservatives" meetings in which he and other right-of-center colleagues talk freely with reporters. With all this activity, Labrador still maintains the Monday to Thursday commute from Washington to his Boise district.\u2014 Indiana's former secretary of state and father of its voter identification law, Rokita wrapped up key support for Congress in 2010 within 48 hours of the nine-term incumbent's retirement announcement. These days, Rep. Rokita stays busy as vice chairman of the House Budget Committee and as the GOP's premier spokesman in Congress on voter identification measures.\u2014 He is one of his party\u2019s most high-profile voices on illegal immigration and, from Pat Buchanan in 1996 to Ted Cruz this year, he is almost always a player in someone\u2019s presidential campaign in his state\u2019s quadrennial GOP caucuses. But since he came to Congress in 2002, King has had relatively comfortable re-elections. This is due, congressional staffers say, to his vigorous tours of his district nearly every weekend and his service on the House Agriculture Committee.\u2014 The former teacher and state Capitol staffer got elected to both the New York City Council and later the U.S. House by taking out seemingly unbeatable incumbents. Now 70, and after 24 years in Washington, Maloney, according to the New York Daily News in 2014, \u201cproposed more legislation than any other House Member.\u201d Her list of legislation ranges from a measure to provide compensation to Ground Zero workers who have fallen ill and to creating a database for monitoring of all federal contracts (which passed following exposes of corruption among military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maloney also found time to be a leader outside Congress on diseases that threaten the elderly, serving on foundation boards that seek cures for both Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases.\u2014 Bald, blunt-spoken Brady suddenly became a subject of the national media last fall, when colleague Paul Ryan moved up to the speakership of the House. Almost overnight, 10-termer Brady became his successor as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Had Brady faced a challenge, few congressional correspondents doubted the Texan would emerge with the gavel. He had been key point man for President George W. Bush on passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and wrote a \u201csunset\u201d proposal to require every federal program not written in the Constitution to justify its existence in 12 years or face elimination. Most recently, Brady, 60, gave his blessings to a measure favored by anti-tax activists to sunset the U.S. Tax Code.\u2014 The best proof of Scalise\u2019s tireless knowledge and cultivation of his Republican colleagues as House GOP Whip came last year when several press outlets quoted remarks he allegedly made years before saying he was akin to Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u201cwithout the baggage.\u201d There were widespread press calls for his resignation from the No. 2 position in the House GOP hierarchy but, to remember, Republican colleagues (and fellow Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Democrat and black) rallied to Scalise\u2019s side. In part, it was a tribute to his reputation as someone who knows the needs of his colleagues and serves them.\u2014 In 2002, state legislator Van Hollen caught the eye of Democrats and the national press by winning the all-important Democratic primary in Maryland's 8th District (suburban Washington) over Tim Shriver, son of Sargent and nephew of John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy. Since then, his career has been nothing short of meteoric \u2014 rising to become chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee and then Budget Committee chairman in six years. Van Hollen is now considered the favorite to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski this year.\u2014 In contrast to her husband and predecessor John Dingell (who served a record 60 years in the seat until retiring in \u201914), freshman Rep. Debbie is back in the Dearborn-based district almost every Thursday to Monday. But she also wears the hats of Washington insider as a member of the Democratic National Committee and a top fundraiser for charities and fellow Democrats.\u2014 As far back as 1978, Chris Smith\u2019s capacity for taking on Herculean labor was sensed. Having just reached the constitutionally required age for the U.S. House (25), sporting goods salesman Smith took on powerful House Administration Committee Chairman Frank Thompson (D-N.J.) in a hopeless race. But a memo from the National Congressional Campaign Committee hailed him as one of the hardest-working candidates anywhere. Two years later, however, Smith unseated Thompson and today he is still in Congress \u2014 one of two of the GOP\u2019s 55 \u201cReagan babies\u201d elected to the House with the 40th president and still serving. As passionate as always about the pro-life cause, senior House Foreign Affairs Committee Member Smith also devotes his considerable energy to battling persecution of Christians in the Middle East and slave trafficking worldwide.\u2014 "I saw Fred Upton's high energy level first-hand in 1981," recalled TV commentator Larry Kudlow, referring to the days when he was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald Reagan and the young Upton was an aide to then-Director David Stockman. During the fight over Reagan's historic tax and budget cuts of 1981, said Kudlow, "when email wasn't invented, Fred would go night and day running confidential messages to key Members of Congress. And we won." Five years later, Upton became one of the handful of House Members who got to Congress by defeating a member of his own party. Now finishing the sixth and last year of his "termed out" stint as House Energy Committee chairman, Upton, at 63, shows no signs of slowing down and has signaled he will remain in Congress after relinquishing his chairman's gavel.\u2014 When then-state legislator Mulvaney upset 28-year Rep. John Spratt (D-S.C.) in 2010, the national press was astonished. Not so were reporters in South Carolina who had seen his drive and his flair for attention-getting issues at the State Capitol. Now 47, Mulvaney has freely voted against John Boehner for speaker, opposed lifting the debt ceiling to fund the government, and rallied fellow Tea Party lawmakers \u2014 all the while coming home to the Palmetto State\u2019s 5th District every weekend and winning re-election with ease.\u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re probably asking yourself how a black dude wins in a district that is 71 percent Hispanic, right?\u201d freshman Rep. Will Hurd told Newsmax last year. One of the big upset winners of 2012, former CIA agent Hurd explained that he went \u201cout to go to all 29 counties in the district and engaged with people." It worked, and he won. Maintaining the same discipline as a Homeland Security Committee member, Hurd is widely sought out on intelligence-related issues because, in his words, \u201cI chased al-Qaida for much of my life.\u201d

aVIf you\u2019re looking for the best doctor, online ratings are unlikely to be much help.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s the determination of researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who compared reviews of 78 of the medical center\u2019s specialists on five popular ratings sites with a set of internal quality measures and found there was essentially no correlation.\u000a\u000aThe results suggest that in a world awash in online feedback for seemingly every consumer choice, reliable, easy-to-interpret information on how good doctors are at their jobs remains scarce.\u000a\u000a\u201cPatients are using these online ratings probably more often than they should,\u201d Timothy Daskivich, a professor of urology at the medical center and an author of the study, said in an interview.\u000a\u000aBradley Anhouse, a 28-year-old who works in marketing, said he looks at online reviews more to figure out how friendly doctors and their staffs are, and how quickly he\u2019ll be seen, not to see who\u2019s the best clinician. He said he knows he has to carefully read what people write, not just the ratings, when he uses online reviews.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do try and stay away from five-star reviews and I try to stay away from one-star reviews,\u201d he said. As he\u2019s reading, he looks for things like \u201chow much time the doctor spends with you, whether they\u2019re on time, and overall friendliness,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aService and Style\u000a\u000aBrennan Spiegel, a gastroenterologist and co-author of the study, said that may be the right way to think about reviews -- as gauges of things the patient can observe.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt may be that these ratings are a good measure of the front-office service or the interpersonal style of the physician,\u201d said Spiegel, a professor and director of health services research at Cedars-Sinai. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that there\u2019s no value to these online ratings -- we\u2019re saying don\u2019t confuse those ratings in any way, shape or form with the actual technical skill.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study, published online on Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, compared measures developed by Cedars-Sinai with users\u2019 ratings on five sites: Healthgrades, Yelp, Vitals, RateMDs and UCompareHealthCare. The internal performance metrics include reviews from doctors\u2019 colleagues and administrators, how often patients are readmitted and how long they remain in the hospital, and adherence to practice guidelines.\u000a\u000aAccording to the study, there was little correlation between the doctors\u2019 performance scores and how their patients assessed them on the websites.\u000a\u000aMartin Makary, a professor of surgery and health policy at Johns Hopkins who studies health-care quality and safety, said patient satisfaction is a key gauge of doctor quality. Metrics like readmission rates and mortality are useful but don\u2019t fully capture a doctor\u2019s skill, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cKnowing the patient\u2019s experience, the experience of past patients who\u2019ve seen the doc, is one valuable component to selecting a good doctor\u201d Makary said. \u201cThe inferences that we can make from our traditional quality measures are very limited. We don\u2019t have a lot to go on.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeasuring Outcomes\u000a\u000aGina Larson, marketing director at Vitals, said the site is looking at ways to add outcome metrics alongside its patient ratings. She said star ratings are a good indicator of the doctor-patient relationship, which can be important to ensuring patients follow their doctors\u2019 advice.\u000a\u000aHealthgrades said patients typically use its ratings alongside other information and referrals to pick a doctor. The site incorporates data on the number of procedures a doctor performs into its \u201cexperience match\u201d score, and says it\u2019s working on ways to display the information more directly. Healthgrades also shows data on the quality of the hospitals that doctors are affiliated with.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople don\u2019t make a decision based on patient ratings,\u201d said Andrea Pearson, the site\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201cThey make it based on patient ratings, experience and quality outcomes.\u201d\u000a\u000aYelp Inc. is considering adding quality measures for doctors, according to spokeswoman Rachel Walker Youngblade. Its site currently lists quality indicators on health-care facilities as part of a partnership with ProPublica, and it recently added data on maternity care at California hospitals. She said research has shown that for hospitals, Yelp\u2019s ratings correlate with other quality measures.\u000a\u000aSelection Puzzle\u000a\u000aNick Fiore, a 23-year-old health-policy researcher, said he turned to online doctor-finding sites because his insurer\u2019s physician list was inaccurate. He figured most of the doctors in the specialty he was searching, nephrology, were well-qualified, so he was more interested in how he\u2019d be treated, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI not only want to have a doctor that I feel like is warm, or is going to be good at their job,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know, how long did you wait to get an appointment? What sort of experience did you have with billing?\u201d\u000a\u000aDavid Vivero said a big question typically not answered by ratings is cost. He co-founded a site called Amino, which helps patients find doctors based on how experienced the physicians are and provides information on insurance coverage and costs. It also shows some outcome information.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe launched Amino principally because there was so little actionable information about physicians,\u201d Vivero said. \u201cQuality is really really hard to get right.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpiegel and Daskivich say their study provides few answers about how to pick a doctor.\u000a\u000a\u201cNot to be coy about it,\u201d Spiegel said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely saying, if you\u2019re interested in quality, technical quality and clinical skills, do not rely on the star ratings. That much is clear.\u201d

John McCain, the Arizona Republican who cast last month's vote killing legislation to end several basic elements of the Affordable Care Act, "fund-raised off of that promise to repeal and replace Obamacare."\u000a\u000a"You take a guy like John McCain \u2014 and God bless him and everything that he's been going through \u2014 but he fund-raised off of that promise to repeal and replace Obamacare."\u000a\u000aMcCain, 81, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, was re-elected to a sixth term in November.\u000a\u000a"Then, he was the one vote that threw the thing into a tailspin, which is shocking," Trump said. "That was his promise.\u000a\u000a"That's not very settling to me personally. It's disappointing."\u000a\u000aBut Trump believes that the president will succeed in repealing the healthcare law.\u000a\u000a"What I give my father tremendous, tremendous credit for is that he will not stop," he told Pags.

aVDealing with the effects of an incoming storm is not an appropriate time to discuss issues regarding climate change, according to Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator.\u000a\u000a"To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm, versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced," Pruitt said Friday in a phone interview on CNN.\u000a\u000a"What we need to focus on is access to clean water, addressing these areas of superfund activities that may cause an attack on water, these issues of access to fuel\u2026 Those are the things so important to citizens of Florida right now, and to discuss the cause and effect of these storms, there's the\u2026 place (and time) to do that, but it's not now," Pruitt said.\u000a\u000aThe administrator said that Congress should take up the issue, but not now.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Congress should address that at some point. And Congress hasn't. All I'm telling you is, to use time and effort to address it at this point is very, very insensitive to the people in Florida," Pruitt said.\u000a\u000aSince Pruitt took charge of the EPA, climate science data has been taken off the EPA's website after being there for two decades, according to The Washington Post.

aVWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Mikhail Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia and a former governor in Ukraine, says he's not afraid to try and return to Ukraine even though his citizenship there has been withdrawn, making him stateless.\u000a\u000aSaakashvili said he will be at Poland's border with Ukraine on Sunday aiming to return home. However, he has no valid document, since his Ukrainian passport expired when Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko withdrew his citizenship in July for what Saakashvili says were political reasons.\u000a\u000aSaakashvili said Friday he's a "stateless person" facing hostility from the leaders of Ukraine and Georgia but his choice is to "be brave" under the circumstances.\u000a\u000aThe president of Georgia from 2004-13, he was stripped of his Georgian citizenship in 2015 after he moved to Ukraine's Odessa region as Poroshenko's pick for its governor.

aVPete Hoekstra on Wednesday told Newsmax TV that accepting North Korea as a nuclear state is "very much an unacceptable solution" and the United States, along with Russia and China, are "walking a fine line."\u000a\u000aOn the flip side, the former congressman and President Donald Trump's pick to become the ambassador to the Netherlands is not advocating for a full invasion of the rogue nation.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Hayworth, but any notion of accepting North Korea as a nuclear nation is quite clear \u2014 no way.\u000a\u000a"I think for the United States, for South Korea, and Japan, that's very much an unacceptable solution," Hoekstra said. "And remember, not only do they have nukes now . . . (but) we need to just accept that North Korea will continue to enhance its capabilities, its megaton delivery, the accuracy of its delivery systems, and the range? I think that's totally unacceptable."\u000a\u000aHoekstra says the United States need to lean on Russia and China to help deal with North Korea, and the three countries had better quit sparring with each other and keep their collective eyes on the big picture.\u000a\u000a"We're all walking a fine line here," Hoekstra told Hayworth. "How far do all three of us want North Korea to go with their capabilities? And so it's very much a tightrope that we're walking.\u000a\u000a"All three of us are . . . hoping that none of us make a misstep, but more importantly that North Korea doesn't make a misstep or a miscalculation where things would spiral out of control," Hoekstra said. "It's a very unsettling time right now."\u000a\u000aPlus, Hoekstra said the United States being distracted by North Korea is not such a bad thing for Russia and China.\u000a\u000a"I think absolutely the Russians and the Chinese are looking for leverage," Hoekstra told Hayworth.\u000a\u000a"China over the last number of years has made significant progress in its influence over the South China Sea. So, the more that they mess with the United States through North Korea, the less capability we have to stand up to what they're trying to do in the South China Sea," Hoekstra said.\u000a\u000a"The Russians, clearly with Ukraine and other aspirations throughout the Middle East and Europe, you know they don't mind us being tied up with North Korea," Hoekstra said.

aVSarah Paulson will play Nurse Ratched in the Netflix prequel to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."\u000a\u000aThe upcoming two-season, 18 episode series will be spearheaded by top TV producer Ryan Murphy of "American Horror Story," The Hollywood Reporter noted.\u000a\u000aHe will work alongside executive producer Michael Douglas, who was responsible for producing the original Oscar-winning film adaption in 1975.\u000a\u000aProduction is expected to kick off next year, and Murphy will be responsible for directing the first episode that was written by recent film school graduate Evan Romansky, according to USA Today.\u000a\u000aThe series is set in 1947 and follows nurse Ratched's murderous transformation into villainous monster in the healthcare system.\u000a\u000aThe character was first introduced to audiences in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and was played by Louise Fletcher, who won an academy award for Best Actress.\u000a\u000aWhile Fletcher may have left big shoes to fill, Paulson has deemed herself worthy of the role after securing an Emmy for her performance in Murphy's "The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story."\u000a\u000aThe actress, who is currently starring in the latest edition of Murphy's "American Horror Story" anthology, has nothing but praise for the producer.\u000a\u000a"Working with Ryan was the first time I felt really seen by someone in a position of power," she said about her experience on the set of "American Horror Story," according to The Guardian.\u000a\u000a"Ryan Murphy knows himself well enough, he knows what he likes and he doesn't care what anyone else does."\u000a\u000aPaulson added that "to have had that in my life only makes me want to do that more going forward, and for others to be able to have that as well."

aVWhen federal policymakers killed banks\u2019 ability to make government-backed student loans, David Bergeron should have been celebrating. A career official at the U.S. Department of Education, he had favored the move for years; it would save the government money, he reasoned, and make it better able to help distressed student borrowers.\u000a\u000aBut when it actually happened in 2010, he wasn\u2019t so sure. With the move, his agency instantly became the nation\u2019s biggest lender to college students. And in his decades of federal service, he\u2019d arrived at the view that when the government gets the chance to profit from something, it takes maximum advantage. It was only a matter of time, he feared, before that happened to student loans.\u000a\u000aSeven years later\u2014with more than 1 million former students defaulting on government-backed loans every year and with his former agency pulling the plug on a partnership with the consumer bureau tasked with protecting them\u2014his fears could soon be realized.\u000a\u000aLast week, the Education Department quietly informed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that it would stop sharing critical information on $1.3 trillion of federal student loans, ending a partnership that has let the CFPB sue loan companies and force others to change their practices in the nation\u2019s second-largest household debt market. Several former high-ranking federal officials fear the directive signals a greater leniency toward loan companies trying to collect on debts, and perhaps a new effort by the Trump administration to undermine the bureau\u2019s enforcement authority.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe system is always going to work against the interest of borrowers and toward the interest of the government,\u201d said Bergeron, who retired as the Education Department\u2019s head of postsecondary education in 2013 after more than 30 years there. \u201cThe CFPB is a check on that, and a necessary one.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo many close observers, a move to cripple the bureau has seemed inevitable. Republican members of Congress for years have tried, without success, to restrict its authority and called for the firing of its director, Richard Cordray. \u201cThink about it: Director Cordray has served longer under Donald Trump than Steve Bannon has,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, referring to the president\u2019s former adviser. The latest move by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is simply \u201csome of the political appointees of the Trump administration fighting back accordingly.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongress and the Obama administration created the CFPB in 2010, after the financial crisis, in an effort to crack down on dodgy loan companies and to supervise businesses that had historically operated with little oversight, such as payday lenders and student loan servicers. Although polls suggest few Americans know about the CFPB, since 2013 they\u2019ve filed more than 15,000 complaints with it about their federal student loans, its public database shows, accusing companies of everything from abusive collection calls to trying to stop them from enrolling in government-promoted, income-based repayment plans.\u000a\u000aThe consumer bureau has tried to curb loan practices it thinks are hurting borrowers, including actions carried out on behalf of the federal government. It has issued public warnings about potentially deceptive acts and underused debt-relief programs, referred cases to the Department of Justice, and pushed companies to stop practices it says are unfair, such as steering troubled borrowers into short-term plans that postpone their payments but still let interest accrue. Along with two states\u2019 attorneys general, it has sued one of the Education Department\u2019s largest loan contractors, Navient Corp., accusing it of illegally cheating hundreds of thousands of student debtors out of their right to lower their payments. Navient has denied wrongdoing, saying it followed department guidelines.\u000a\u000aThe Education Department, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t been penalizing its contracted loan servicers for engaging in the practices the CFPB has tried to change. The department has been consistently criticized over the years by government watchdogs\u2014both its own inspector general and the Government Accountability Office\u2014for what they\u2019ve called its lackluster oversight of its contractors. One audit found the agency didn\u2019t even keep track of borrowers\u2019 complaints.\u000a\u000aBut to DeVos\u2019s agency, the CFPB\u2019s involvement has only complicated the lives of borrowers and the government contractors paid to counsel them and collect on their debts. The two agencies\u2019 directives to loan companies sometimes conflict, which causes confusion, DeVos deputies Kathleen Smith and A. Wayne Johnson told Cordray in the letter last week terminating their partnership. The department, they wrote, is shutting out the bureau to \u201cenhance the efficiencies of our servicers.\u201d Elizabeth Hill, a department spokeswoman, didn\u2019t elaborate.\u000a\u000aAccording to Sarah Bloom Raskin, who worked on student loan policy as deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, the Education Department\u2019s move probably has more to do with protecting its contracted loan servicers from new costs than with helping student debtors.\u000a\u000aFor instance, student debtors for years have been able to make monthly payments based on what they earn rather than what they owe\u2014but the paperwork required to enroll them can be \u201cvery expensive\u201d for loan servicers, Navient\u2019s chief executive, Jack Remondi, said back in 2013, when the company was part of Sallie Mae. Millions of young Americans were eligible for those payment plans but didn\u2019t know about them. The Education Department and its Federal Student Aid office, which manages the government\u2019s student loan portfolio, were content with low enrollment\u2014until around 2012, when the White House and the CFPB began to prod them to direct their contractors to inform eligible borrowers. Since then, enrollment has soared.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Student Aid office, which Johnson now leads, was created by Congress in 1998 and directed to improve customer service for students. \u201cBut at the end of the day, what FSA is judged by is not customer service, but how much money is returned to the Treasury,\u201d Bergeron said. \u201cTheir default option is to think of servicers first and borrowers as an afterthought,\u201d Raskin said. And the government\u2019s loan contractors put its interests first; their ultimate customer, after all, is the agency that hired it to collect on debt. Navient told a federal court in March that \u201cthere is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aHill, the department spokeswoman, said her agency is \u201ccommitted to putting students\u2019 needs first, easing the burdens on student loan borrowers, and enhancing efficiencies for servicers.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow the department \u201chas made its position clear that there is no room for CFPB involvement here,\u201d said Brian Slagle, an attorney at Ballard Spahr LLP who represents financial firms before the bureau.\u000a\u000aWall Street has already taken notice. This week, Michael Tarkan, director of research at Compass Point, recommended that clients buy Navient stock. The agency\u2019s decision, he said, is an \u201cunambiguous signal\u201d that the Trump administration will take a more lenient approach to policing student loan companies.

aVPresident Donald Trump might have outlined his tax-reform plan Wednesday, but Republicans "still don't have a plan," economist Stephen Moore told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000a"This shouldn't be hard," Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told "Newsmax Now" host Bill Tucker. "As Republicans, cutting taxes is right in the strikes.\u000a\u000a"It's what Republicans are about," he added. "It's cutting people's taxes. Trump talked about this.\u000a\u000a"Got to cut taxes for businesses. We've got to cut taxes for families to create more jobs, put more money in the hands of the American people.\u000a\u000a"That's an easy message to get out to people."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"Republicans were irresponsible to take a whole month off in August."

aVMen who get a controversial blood test that looks for signs of prostate cancer appear to have a reduced risk of death from the malignancy, according to a new analysis by an international group of researchers.\u000a\u000aThe analysis re-examined data from two earlier studies that had led experts to recommend against routine use of the test, which measures levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).\u000a\u000a"The trials taken together indicate there is an important benefit," said Ruth Etzioni, who is the senior author of the analysis from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.\u000a\u000aA flaw of the earlier trials is that some men who were assigned to a no-screening group actually did get the PSA test on their own, making it difficult to identify differences between the screening group and the no-screening group.\u000a\u000aThe unclear results - and the risk that the blood tests could lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments - led the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to recommend against PSA screening.\u000a\u000aThe new analysis attempts to clear up the confusion by reexamining the data in computer models, to account for the men who got PSA tests when they weren't supposed to. Etzioni's team compared men in the two trials based on the intensity of screening they received.\u000a\u000aIn one of the trials, PSA testing was tied to a 25 percent to 31 percent reduced risk of death from prostate cancer, the researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\u000a\u000aIn the other trial, PSA testing was tied to a 27 percent to 32 percent reduced risk of death from prostate cancer, they found.\u000a\u000aEtzioni said the new results don't mean all men should be screened for prostate cancer.\u000a\u000aIn the U.S., about one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to the American Cancer Society, but most men with the slow-growing cancer won't die from it.\u000a\u000aAs a result, it's often reasonable to monitor prostate cancers instead of treating them, since the side effects of treatment - which can include incontinence and impotence - may be more harmful than helpful.\u000a\u000aIn a proposed update to its recommendation, the USPSTF suggests that men ages 55 to 69 should be able to decide if they want PSA testing based on a discussion with their doctors about the possible benefits and risks, such as biopsies and unneeded treatment.\u000a\u000a"This finding confirms or reinforces what everybody has been moving to over the last 5 to 8 years," said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. "There is some benefit to prostate cancer screening and there are some harms associated with it."\u000a\u000aBrawley, who wasn't involved in the new analysis, told Reuters Health that the benefits of screening are becoming more apparent as doctors move away from aggressively treating all prostate cancers and instead decide to monitor the many that will likely never advance and cause death.\u000a\u000aIn an editorial published with the new analysis, Dr. Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City identified ways to help ensure the benefits of prostate cancer screening outweigh the harms.\u000a\u000aFor example, he advises shared decision-making between doctors and patients, carefully selecting which men to biopsy and not screening elderly men, who are unlikely to benefit.\u000a\u000a"The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm," wrote Vickers.

aVNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie lost his chance at a spot in President Donald Trump's Cabinet because he failed to offer his support for the candidate after the damaging "Access Hollywood" tape was leaked, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon claims in an interview airing this Sunday.\u000a\u000a"Christie, because of Billy Bush weekend, was not looked at for a Cabinet position," Bannon, now executive chairman at Breitbart News, told CBS's Charlie Rose in the "60 Minutes" interview, according to an excerpt aired Friday on "CBS This Morning."\u000a\u000a"I told him 'the plane leaves at 11-o'clock in the morning,'" Bannon continued. "'If you make the plane, you make the team.' He didn't make the plane."\u000a\u000aThe video, obtained by The Washington Post a few weeks before the election, revealed graphic audio of Trump boasting to show host Billy Bush about groping women, and proved a litmus test for the campaign, Bannon said.\u000a\u000aThat weekend, Trump met with senior advisers, including Bannon, then-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, and Christie, while they discussed what steps they would be taking next.\u000a\u000a"Trump went around the room and asked people the percentages he thought of \u2014 of still winning and what the recommendation," Bannon said. "Reince started off and Reince said, 'You have \u2014 you have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history.'"\u000a\u000aTrump, "with his humor," goes "'that's a great way to start our conversation,'" Bannon recalled.\u000a\u000aAnd then, going around the room, many of the politicians in attendance were shocked by the media attack, but Trump wasn't, said Bannon.\u000a\u000a"I told him as he went around, I was the last guy to speak, and I said, 'it's 100 percent. You have 100 percent probability of winning,'" said Bannon.\u000a\u000aBannon said that he told Trump to "double down," and that he told him to do that every time because it would appeal to the American people.\u000a\u000a"You know why? 'Cause \u2014 it was a winner," said Bannon. "That's why I told him 'double down' every time. And on that day, that's the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, 'Come on, it's not 100 percent,' I go, 'It's absolutely 100 percent.' And I told him why. 'They don't care.'"\u000a\u000a"But they, they do care about respect for women," Rose said, and Bannon agreed, but Trump's comments were "just locker room talk," Bannon replied.\u000a\u000aBannon said the incident was a "litmus test" that showed who really sided with Trump.\u000a\u000a"I said it the other day to [White House Chief of Staff] General [John] Kelly during the Charlottesville thing, afterwards," said Bannon. "It's a line I remember from the movie. 'The Wild Bunch.' William Holden uses it right before that huge gunfight at the end. 'When you side with a man, you side with him,' okay? The good and the bad."\u000a\u000a"Billy Bush Saturday," he continued, "showed me who really had Donald Trump's back to play to his better angels. All you had to do, and what he did, was go out and continue to talk to the American people."\u000a\u000aAmericans, knowing the comments were "just doing locker room talk with a guy," dismissed it, Bannon said. "It had no lasting impact on the campaign. Yet, if you see the mainstream media that day, it was, literally, he was falling into Dante's Inferno."

aVScientists have found crucial genetic changes in soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, raising the possibility PTSD could soon be diagnosed with simple blood tests, The Telegraph reported Monday.\u000a\u000aUntil now the anxiety disorder could only be diagnosed through self-reported symptoms, which many soldiers and other suffering from PTSD were often reluctant to talk about.\u000a\u000aBut scientists at the University of Maastricht in The Netherlands discovered significant differences in the microRNA molecules of servicemen who had fought in Afghanistan and developed PTSD compared to soldiers who were not in combat there.\u000a\u000aThis is considered crucial, because unlike DNA, which provides the genetic code for functions in the body, microRNA regulates how active those genes are, The Telegraph reported.\u000a\u000aSince microRNA molecules can flow throughout the body and can be detected in the blood, a blood test could pick up the abnormalities.\u000a\u000aLimitations of the study, which was presented at the annual meeting of the European College of Neuropharmacology in Paris, are that this was a small pilot study, and the findings need to be validated and confirmed, according to News Medical Life Sciences.\u000a\u000aStudy author Dr. Laurence de Nijs, told News Medical Life Sciences that "Currently, there is no definite cure for patients with PTSD, and available treatments often are not effective," stressing "Individuals with PTSD are six times more at risk of committing suicide and having marital problems, and the annual loss of productivity is estimated to be approximately $3 billion."\u000a\u000aTel Aviv University Professor Josef Zohar, the former chair of the European College of Neuropharmacology, commented on the study, telling News Medical Life Sciences it "points to an innovative avenue regarding the potential identification of risk factors for susceptibility to developing post-traumatic stress disorder."\u000a\u000aHe added "The relevance of a better understanding of stress related events is unfortunately becoming clearer and clearer after each terror attack."

aVIt might get lost in today's media climate, but the United States Senate is teeming with hardworking men and women on both sides of the aisle who put in brutally long hours to try and get the job done.\u000a\u000aSome may be plotting their own White House bids in 2020 or beyond. Some may be trying to move up the Senate leadership ladder. And some, believe it or not, may just be trying to deliver on campaign promises for their constituents and the country.\u000a\u000aHere, Newsmax has compiled a list of 15 U.S. senators who are widely considered to be the hardest-working among their colleagues as evidenced by the high regard and esteem shown to them by their peers and voters.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) \u2014 Grassley won a seventh Senate term in 2016 in a landslide over a Democrat who didn\u2019t even try to attack his advanced age. That\u2019s largely because, at 83, he still visits every county in Iowa annually (he calls it \u201cthe full Grassley\u201d) and runs circles around aides barely half his age. He\u2019ll need to pace himself in the Trump era, during which the Judiciary Committee chair burned the midnight oil to get Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch approved.\u000a\u000aTrump vs. Obama: Who is Better? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000a2. Charles Schumer (D-New York) \u2014 He has his share of critics on Capitol Hill, but few can deny the intense work ethic of Schumer, who learned everything he knows about politics growing up on the streets of Brooklyn. Schumer managed to outhustle Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin last year, securing the support he needed to succeed Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as Democratic minority leader. Indeed, the Energizer bunny of the Senate just keeps going and going and going . . .\u000a\u000a3. John McCain (R-Arizona) \u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s Sunday,\u201d the inside-the-Beltway joke goes, \u201cit\u2019s John McCain on 'Meet the Press.'\u201d McCain, 80, has been a front-liner in Washington since the Reagan era and, having won a sixth Senate term last year, he shows no signs of slowing down. If anything, he seems to have found new energy this year by reviving his \u201cMaverick\u201d persona, this time to challenge President Donald Trump on foreign affairs and national security issues. His tough stances might hit Trump where it counts most: McCain is the most popular member of Congress on Twitter with more than 2.2 million followers.\u000a\u000a4. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) \u2014 Cotton is a U.S. Army veteran, Bronze Star medal winner, and Harvard Law graduate. Since moving into the Senate in 2015 from the U.S. House of Representatives, he has sponsored 76 pieces of legislation, in addition to 308 bills he co-sponsored. "His vigor in mastering the nuances of foreign policy and speaking schedule in articulating an internationalist view is well-known and often leaves younger staffers breathless," says Newsmax White House correspondent John Gizzi.\u000a\u000a5. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \u2014 During his career, Portman has developed a reputation of getting results, and his time in the Senate has only bolstered that image as he has used much of it to promote bipartisan legislation, with a third of those bills being signed into law by President Obama. Portman\u2019s longtime legislative priorities have come to the fore in this session, such as removing barriers to job growth and the opioid crisis \u2014 two concerns that have also been championed by President Trump. The senator has already introduced several pieces of legislation in this session to address those two issues.\u000a\u000a6. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) \u2014 Love him or hate him \u2014 and there are certainly plenty of folks in Washington who do \u2014 McConnell is widely considered the senator who sleeps the least, works the most, fights the hardest, and has the scars to prove it. The Senate majority leader has been fighting and working his whole life, dating back to his race for student council president at duPont Manual High School in Louisville \u2014 the first of many races he has won. \u201cAlthough I did feel a bit sorry for him,\u201d McConnell wrote of his opponent in his memoir \u201cThe Long Game.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d simply outworked him.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) \u2014 Reed is a graduate of both Harvard Law and West Point and one of a few cadets in U.S. history to be elected to the Senate. Despite being one of the less visible senators, he is admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Republican Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby once said of Reed: \u201cHe is to be commended for his tenacity, for his never-give-up.\u201d And Sen. Schumer noted that \u201cJack does it in his quiet, steadfast way, and it is extremely effective,\u201d referring to Reed\u2019s deal-making and legislative style.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 12 Ways Trump Could Make You Rich in the Next 24 Months\u000a\u000a8. John Thune (R-South Dakota) \u2014 In addition to serving on three Senate committees \u2014 Finance; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the latter of which he serves as chairman \u2014 Thune claims membership in 32 separate caucuses that tackle a variety of issues and interests.\u000a\u000a9. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) \u2014 As chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Johnson has a full grasp of the impacts of terrorism and immigration, which is why he\u2019s sponsoring a new initiative to hand over the distribution of work visas to states to issue as they see fit. Along with House Republican Ken Buck of Colorado, Johnson sees this potential legislation as a game-changer in immigration reform while allowing states to meet their specific labor shortage needs. This massive policy work also dovetails with his chairmanship of Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European and Regional Security Cooperation\u000a\u000a10. John Cornyn (R-Texas) \u2014 Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate and the party whip, has had his hands full corralling the party\u2019s voting power as discord between establishment and Tea Party Republicans has threatened to fracture the building majority. This tension is most evident, perhaps, in the sometimes perceived divide between both Texas senators: Cornyn, the establishment bellwether, and Ted Cruz, the Tea Party firebrand. But, the senior Texas senator has shown he can lead the Republican Party to major victories in Senate, such as the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000a11. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) \u2014 All you need to know about Graham's work ethic is illustrated by his jam-packed pre-Senate résumé: At 21, his parents died, leaving him to raise his younger sister on his own. He then earned his JD from the University of South Carolina School of Law, joined the United States Air Force, and went on to work as a private practice lawyer before serving one term in the South Carolina House of Representatives and four in the U.S. House. Though sometimes criticized as being one of the more liberal Republicans in the Senate, Graham has remained uncompromising in his willingness to reach across the aisle to get the business of government done.\u000a\u000a12. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) \u2014 McCaskill learned a long time ago that being a woman in politics required her to work harder. \u201cI found that if you are informed and work hard, you can earn credibility,\u201d she wrote in \u201cPlenty Ladylike: A Memoir,\u201d while describing her service in the Missouri Legislature. \u201cI went from being the young blonde with all the hair to being someone whom the senior members approached.\u201d In the Senate, McCaskill has earned a reputation as someone who pulls no punches, speaks her mind and, most importantly, gets things done.\u000a\u000a13. Susan Collins (R-Maine) \u2014 Despite initially being shut out of the Senate Republican working group on healthcare reform, Collins continues to work on the Patient Freedom Act with Louisiana Republican Sen. Dr. Bill Cassidy and other Republican co-sponsors, which they introduced in the beginning of 2017. She hopes that she can attract moderate Democrats to the table to hammer out a comprehensive replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a14. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) \u2014 One of the more prolific senators, Blumenthal sponsors an average of 70 pieces of legislation a year since his move to the Senate in 2011. Additionally, he has co-signed more than 1,700 bills written by his colleagues. Blumenthal has been quite vocal about pursuing an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal as well as an independent investigation into Russia\u2019s possible role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000a15. Mike Lee (R-Utah) \u2014 Lee is a member of the Joint Economic Committee; Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; and the Judiciary Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights in the Judiciary and the Water and Power Subcommittee in the Energy and Natural Resources.\u000a\u000aExclusive: Trump's 'Secret' Plan Revealed, 100 Days of Shock

aVSouth Korea detected that North Korea is continuing to prepare for a possible intercontinental ballistic missile launch, a move that would further raise tensions a day after it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation.\u000a\u000aChang Kyung-soo, acting chief of the defense ministry's policy planning office, told lawmakers on Monday that North Korea was making preparations for a missile firing, but didn't give a timeframe for a potential launch. The yen extended gains against the dollar after the news.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's spy agency said there is a chance North Korea could fire an ICBM into the Pacific Ocean, adding that the isolated state was able to conduct a nuclear test at any time, the Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea had threatened last month to launch missiles toward Guam, which prompted warnings of retaliation from American military officials.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea earlier in the day paved the way for the full deployment of a U.S. missile defense system while its military conducted a live-fire drill with North Korea's test site as the virtual target. The Environment Ministry on Monday conditionally approved an environmental impact report on the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system.\u000a\u000aThat removes the final administrative hurdle for complete installment of the missile shield, known as Thaad, which China sees as a threat to the region's \u201cstrategic equilibrium.\u201d South Korea's Defense Ministry said it would install the system's remaining launchers "soon."\u000a\u000aThe governments in Seoul and Washington were also discussing deployment of a U.S. carrier group and strategic bombers, Yonhap said.\u000a\u000aFollowing the nuclear test, President Donald Trump threatened to increase economic sanctions and halt trade with any nation doing business with North Korea -- a threat he has used before without following through. That list would include China, the U.S.'s biggest trading partner, which accounted for about a sixth of its overseas commerce.\u000a\u000aChina hit back at Trump's threat, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang saying the comments were "neither objective nor fair."\u000a\u000a"What is definitely unacceptable to us is a situation in which on the one hand we work to resolve this issue peacefully but on the other hand our own interests are subject to sanctions and jeopardized," Geng said at a regular briefing in Beijing, according to the Associated Press.\u000a\u000aAsian stocks fell on Monday as investors turned to haven assets, sending the yen, gold and Treasury futures higher. The biggest declines were in Tokyo and Seoul, with more moderate reactions elsewhere in the region.\u000a\u000aTrump, who threatened over the weekend to pull out of the U.S.-South Korea trade agreement, took a shot at President Moon Jae-in's administration after the nuclear test. On Twitter, he said that South Korea is finding that its \u201ctalk of appeasement with North Korea will not work.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response, Moon's office said that war shouldn't be repeated and that South Korea and its allies \u201cwill pursue the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula through peace.\u201d The two leaders haven't spoken since North Korea detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb.\u000a\u000aMoon took power in May pledging to seek peace talks with Kim's regime. He initially opposed the early deployment of Thaad, though has shifted in recent months as North Korea advanced its push for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could strike the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe disagreement between allies comes as Trump's administration looks to convince China and Russia to support stronger sanctions against North Korea at United Nations Security Council. The U.S. and other nations called for an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. on Monday in New York.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump didn't rule out an attack on North Korea when asked by a reporter, the focus of his Tweets and remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were on tighter sanctions, not military action. China and Russia oppose military force to deal with North Korea's nuclear program.\u000a\u000aIn a call with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump \u201creaffirmed the commitment of the United States to defending our homeland, territories, and allies using the full range of diplomatic, conventional, and nuclear capabilities at our disposal,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\u000a\u000aSeparately, Abe spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin late Sunday, telling him that another strong UN resolution was needed. Abe also told South Korean President Moon that the North Korea threat was grave and imminent, Japan's Kyodo News reported. Moon hasn't spoken with Trump since the nuclear detonation.\u000a\u000aSunday's test, North Korea's first since Trump took office, was a \u201cperfect success\u201d and confirmed the precision and technology of the bomb, according to the Korean Central News Agency. Energy from the underground explosion, near the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in northeast North Korea, was about six times stronger than the nuclear test of a year ago, South Korea's weather agency said.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, South Korea's military accurately fired a surface-to-surface ballistic missile and air-to-ground rocket onto a target in the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan), according to a text message from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The real-distance shooting exercise simulated the Punggye-ri site as the origin of the provocation, the joint chiefs said.\u000a\u000aHans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said the international community needs to \u201ccome up with a very different game plan than just sanctions and bomber exercises.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cRight now, everything North Korea does appears to have to be bigger and scarier,\u201d he said by email. \u201cThe signal they're sending is the same as always: we don't care what you say, we can do this and will continue to do so until you stop threatening us. And they seem to have the resources needed to do so despite sanctions.\u201d

aVGardening improves health in a variety of ways, affecting physical, mental, and emotional aspects of your life. What\u2019s great about gardening is that it\u2019s a great hobby for people of all ages.\u000a\u000aYou can reap the benefits whether you're focusing on growing houseplants or food. The healthy hobby can be performed in any sized space, such as on the patio or in the backyard. Plant some bulbs, dig holes, or prune bushes and you\u2019ll soon notice the changes that take place throughout your body, mind, and spirit.\u000a\u000aThe following are six ways gardening is good for your health:\u000a\u000a1. Lowers risk of heart disease and diabetes \u2014 The activity involved in gardening reduces stress levels to improve heart health, reducing the risk of heart-related conditions such as diabetes and obesity. The nutritious foods gardeners grow are also heart healthy, according to Rodale\u2019s Organic Life.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Causes weight loss \u2014 Any type of activity helps with weight management and gardening is a good way to burn calories, notes Heather Hausenblas in U.S. News. She adds that the American Council on Exercise reveals that gardening can burn some 300 calories an hour.\u000a\u000a3. Boosts your mood \u2014 Depression, anxiety, and anger are reduced through gardening, which increases the feel-good hormone dopamine and relaxing serotonin, says Sarah Rayner in Psychology Today. Levels of cortisol, which may trigger stress, are reduced.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Provides a sense of responsibility \u2014 Caring for plants brings gardeners respect for all living things and helps teach them how to nurture. It increases self-esteem to know you can assist nature. Working in the outdoors, even in a small garden, improves the skills you have learned.\u000a\u000a5. Great exercise \u2014 Raking and digging are considered high-intensity activities while weeding, mulching, and watering provide moderate-intensity exercise. So, gardening can even encourage you to exercise more for a healthy body and mind.\u000a\u000a6. Makes you eat better \u2014 Just as you\u2019ll want to exercise more, you\u2019ll also have more fruits and veggies in your diet. What\u2019s more, products grown in home gardens are tastier and more nutritious than produce found in stores. Gardeners have easy access to these fresh foods and should integrate them as regular sources of nutrition in their diet.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat

aVRep. Pete King, R-N.Y. said that President Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N-Y., are getting along well after their Wednesday deal on the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000a"It was almost like a love-in at times," King said after attending a White House meeting Thursday between New York and New Jersey officials that included Trump and Schumer.\u000a\u000a"He and Chuck \u2014 both of them would interrupt each other at times \u2014 and they'd go back and forth and Chuck would say something and smile and the president would look at him and smile\u2026 this went on for the whole \u2014 let's say the meeting was around 40 minutes or so?" King said Thursday evening on CNN.\u000a\u000a"It was basically the president and Chuck. Even though there was somebody between them, they \u2014 face to face, they were pretty close at times. Chuck would lean over toward him, the president would lean over toward Chuck. I felt like I was back in the neighborhood," King added.\u000a\u000aTrump mentioned in the meeting the importance he saw in working with Democrats on the debt ceiling deal, according to the congressman. "He said even if people aren't familiar with all the details of it, the fact that there's bipartisanship \u2014 it's a great spirit to have, something he wants," King said.\u000a\u000aKing said he told the president that the deal was getting a positive response from the House of Representatives, even though some Republicans are not pleased with it.\u000a\u000a"I wanted him to think it was going over great. I think it is, but I wanted to make sure," King said.\u000a\u000aThe president and Schumer have agreed to work on a deal to permanently repeal the debt ceiling, according to a Thursday Washington Post report.

aVCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) \u2014 The organization that oversees the Nobel Peace Prize said Friday the 1991 prize awarded to Myanmar's Aung Sang Suu Kyi cannot be revoked.\u000a\u000aOlav Njolstad, head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in an email to The Associated Press that neither the will of prize founder Alfred Nobel nor the Nobel Foundation's rules provide for the possibility of withdrawing the honor from laureates.\u000a\u000a"It is not possible to strip a Nobel Peace Prize laureate of his or her award once bestowed," Njolstad wrote. "None of the prize awarding committees in Stockholm and Oslo has ever considered revoking a prize after it has been awarded."\u000a\u000aAn online petition signed by more than 386,000 people on Change.org is calling for Suu Kyi to be stripped of her Peace Prize over the persecution of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority.\u000a\u000aSuu Kyi received the award for "her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights" while standing up against military rulers.\u000a\u000aShe became the country's de facto leader after Myanmar held its first free election in 2012 and she led her party to a landslide victory.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu urged her to intervene to stop the persecution of the Rohingya. In an open letter, he told his fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner that it is "incongruous for a symbol of righteousness" to lead a country where violence against the Rohingya is being carried out.\u000a\u000aRohingya have described large-scale violence perpetrated by Myanmar troops and Buddhist mobs \u2014 setting fire to their homes, spraying bullets indiscriminately and ordering them to leave or be killed.\u000a\u000aSuu Kyi has dismissed the Rohingya crisis as a misinformation campaign.

aVThe Zika virus can kill aggressive brain tumor cells, researchers at Washington University have found.\u000a\u000aThe scientists engineered the Zika virus to be better controlled by the immune system if it attacked healthy cells, then tested it on glioblastoma cells that were removed from patients\u2019 brains, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The virus killed the cells, which often grow back after chemotherapy and radiation.\u000a\u000aResearchers also tested the virus on mice and found that tumors shrank and mice lived longer than with a placebo, the Post-Dispatch reported. Further trials are planned, with clinical trials for humans to follow if successful.\u000a\u000aZika is a mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted virus that can cause severe damage to the brains of unborn babies of women who contract it.\u000a\u000aScientists theorized glioblastoma cells develop and grow in the same rapid way as fetal brain cells, so the virus might be able to target them and kill them. The virus rarely caused problems in healthy cells, scientists found, which may explain why most adults who contract it don\u2019t have any problems.\u000a\u000aZika has caused birth defects in thousands of children since it was discovered in South America three years ago. Infants exposed to Zika in utero develop microcephaly, which involves an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brain.\u000a\u000aAccording to Newsweek, it is possible the Zika virus also could kill other types of cancer stem cells, which have been shown to be treatment-resistant in many cases.

aVU.S. investors\u2019 optimism in the stock market has pushed the Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index to its highest level since September 2000.\u000a\u000aThe index, after rising in every quarter since the start of 2016, leveled off in the second quarter at +124 before rising to its current +138 in the third quarter, Gallup reported.\u000a\u000aThe survey found that investor optimism about stock market matches the 1999-2000 record high.\u000a\u000aSixty-eight percent now say they are optimistic about the stock market's performance during the next year, matching the record high for the question from December 1999 and January 2000.\u000a\u000aAt least 61% have expressed optimism about the stock market in each of the three surveys this year, a percentage matched or exceeded only four other times in the 132 times the question has been asked since April 2000.\u000a\u000aTwenty-five percent say they are "very optimistic," topping the previous record high of 24% from the first quarter of this year. Only 11% were very optimistic a year ago.\u000a\u000aThe stock market has moved generally upward for the past eight years after bottoming out in the wake of the 2008 economic crash, but investors have been slow to shed their skepticism about stocks as a good investment. This year's continued climb of the market to record-setting heights, however, has given investors enough evidence that more than two-thirds are optimistic and one-fourth are now very optimistic about its near-term performance.\u000a\u000aAs the Dow and other key economic measures have continued to move in a positive direction over the past few months, retiree investors have grown more optimistic about meeting their financial goals. With the financial status of retirees becoming more and more important as baby boomers flood the retirement rolls, the growing confidence of retiree investors provides a welcome piece of evidence about their financial well-being.\u000a\u000aThe results come from a July 28-Aug. 6 Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index survey of U.S. investors with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. The seven items that constitute the index include three on personal finances (meeting long-term investment goals, meeting short-term investment goals and maintaining income) and four on the economy (economic growth, the stock market, unemployment and inflation). The survey was in the field as the Dow Jones industrial average approached, then surpassed, the 22,000-point milestone for the first time.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the U.S. economy probably grew faster than reported in the second quarter, with data on Thursday suggesting stronger consumer spending than previously estimated.\u000a\u000aThe quarterly services survey, or QSS, from the Commerce Department implied consumer spending increased more briskly than the 3.3 percent annualized rate reported last week in its second estimate of gross domestic product, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aThe QSS report added to data on construction spending and factory orders in suggesting that second-quarter GDP growth could be revised higher from its 3.0 percent rate when the government publishes its third estimate later this month.\u000a\u000aConsidering the construction, factory orders and QSS data, JPMorgan is forecasting that GDP growth for the quarter would be raised to a 3.4 percent rate.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe believe that the QSS points to an upward revision to the ... estimate of real consumption growth,\u201d said economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVLarry David's appearance on "Finding Your Roots" is packed with surprises, including a tie to the Confederacy, when the comedian learns several astounding discoveries about his family tree.\u000a\u000aThe the upcoming season four premiere of the PBS series made headlines when it was revealed that the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star was related to Bernie Sanders, the senator who he so eloquently impersonated on "Saturday Night Live" recently.\u000a\u000aHowever, the "Finding Your Roots" episode, which airs on Oct. 3, makes various other revelations pertaining to David's ancestry.\u000a\u000aThe Daily Beast noted that many of the comedian's ancestors were victims of the Holocaust. However, David was astonished to learn that his great-great-grandfather, Henry Bernstein, fought on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War.\u000a\u000aAdding to the wonder, the PBS show's host, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr., traced many members of David's paternal family to Germany, and his great-grandmother Henrietta to Alabama.\u000a\u000a"This is just such an odd combination on my father's side of Germany and the South," the comedian remarked. "Two places that we have fought against as a country. Oh my goodness, I hope no slaves show up on this."\u000a\u000aIn the upcoming episode of "Finding Your Roots" Gates also makes a startling revelation about David's great-great-grandfather, who it turned out owned two slaves.\u000a\u000a"You can see why my father didn't want to tell me anything about his family," David jokes in the episode. "Well, Henry Bernstein, I hope you're proud of yourself."\u000a\u000aWhile this deeper look into David's ancestry certainly proves interesting, it is predominantly his relation to Sanders that has captivated public interest.\u000a\u000aThe similarities between the two had been a hot topic for years, even before David's comic impersonations of the senator aired on "Saturday Night Live," AM New York noted.\u000a\u000aFinding out that they are related was the cherry on the cake.

The proprietor replies, "That is not my dog."\u000a\u000aIt's estimated that overall there are around 4.7 million dog bite incidents in the U.S. annually, many minor.

aVIt wasn\u2019t heartlessness that moved President Donald Trump to lift protections for people who had been brought to the U.S. illegally when they were minors, his aides took pains to explain when he made the decision.\u000a\u000aThe president, they said, does not have the constitutional authority to give them work permits and immunize them from deportation. Congress has never passed a law granting legal status to the affected people. It\u2019s up to Congress, a White House fact sheet said, \u201cto responsibly address federal immigration law in an appropriate and constitutional manner.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s aides are right about President Barack Obama. He did exceed his authority when he acted without congressional approval. Obama had himself previously said that while he thought that people who came here illegally through no fault of their own should have legal status, he did not have the power to grant it. Then he decided he wanted them to have it enough to ignore the formality of the law.\u000a\u000aThe White House is right, too, that Congress can fix the problem. It can pass a law to keep the affected group from being deported \u2014 perhaps as part of a deal that also includes some funding for barriers to illegal immigration at the Mexican border \u2014 and it should do so.\u000a\u000aBut the argument would be easier to credit if Trump were not continuing another Obama policy that raises similar constitutional issues: federal payments to health insurers to cover the cost of reducing co-payments and deductibles for customers with low incomes. Congress has never appropriated money to spend for this purpose.\u000a\u000aIn both cases, then, Obama acted as though Congress had taken an action it had not. In both cases, conservatives said that his actions were unlawful and initiated lawsuits to vindicate the point. In both cases, Congress has the power to fix the problem.\u000a\u000aIn both cases, finally, some congressional Republicans have hoped that Trump would keep the constitutionally dubious Obama policy so as to avoid some negative consequences. These Republicans didn\u2019t want to see people who have gotten work permits to lose them or be deported, and they didn\u2019t want to take the risk that premiums would rise for many people without the insurance subsidies (even though the Congressional Budget Office says the risk is low).\u000a\u000aSo why is Trump continuing the Obama policy for health insurers while canceling the one for illegal immigrants? The main difference seems to be a political one. Avoiding turmoil in health-insurance markets is worth flouting the law; avoiding turmoil in the lives of illegal immigrants \u2014 even a highly sympathetic subset of them \u2014 isn\u2019t.

aVThe decisions made in Washington have a tremendous impact on your money. And in the coming weeks, the stakes are even higher.\u000a\u000aFrom a potential government shutdown to the risk of an international crisis, here\u2019s a look at four key issues facing President Donald Trump, his administration and Congress, and how they could affect your wallet.\u000a\u000a1. The debt ceiling\u000a\u000aMost observers think the chances are extremely low that Congress and the president will fail to raise the debt ceiling before October. A recent report indicates that Trump is considering whether to tie a request for federal Harvey aid to the debt limit increase in order to ensure passage.\u000a\u000aThe Bipartisan Policy Center says virtually everyone stands to lose if a deal isn\u2019t reached: \u201cOngoing risks include increasing costs to taxpayers, delayed payments to individuals and businesses, and catastrophic market impacts if the U.S. government actually defaulted on its debt (unprecedented in modern history).\u201d\u000a\u000aBond-rating agencies are watching closely, most concerned about the risk that the government could miss a debt payment. Remember, investors around the world have favored U.S. Treasury bonds because they\u2019re considered safe. That reputation would be damaged if a debt payment is missed, says Robert Brusca, economist of Fact and Opinion Economics.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat would be serious, as the U.S. debt rating would drop and some investors could be forced to sell Treasuries. No telling about how heavy foreign selling might be or how much the dollar might fall in the event of a missed debt payment,\u201d Brusca says.\u000a\u000a2. A government shutdown\u000a\u000aThe clock is ticking away toward early October here as well. The chances of a federal government shutdown have grown ahead of the federal fiscal year starting Oct. 1. A Goldman Sachs economist recently put the odds of \u201ca brief government shutdown\u201d at 50 percent.\u000a\u000aIf a shutdown happens, lasting damage to the economy is seen as minimal, says professor Phillip Swagel at the Maryland School of Public Policy and former assistant secretary in the U.S. Treasury Department.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat would have a negative impact on the economy, but it\u2019s still more of a political issue than an economic one \u2014 the ultimate impact on the economy is still modest,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s still some financial fallout in the short term if the government shuts down. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could miss paychecks. Vendors won\u2019t be paid on time. Businesses dependent on any of those people as customers stand to lose revenue.\u000a\u000aWhat about investors? An analysis of stock market performance by LPL Financial found that investors weren\u2019t hurt much from government shutdowns going back to 1976 under both Republican and Democratic presidents. On average, the S&P 500 fell only 0.6 percent during those periods. In fact, stocks rallied during three previous shutdown periods. If the possibility of a government shutdown has you considering safer investments, look to CDs.\u000a\u000a3. Tax reform\u000a\u000aAs the stock market has rallied since the election, investors have been hoping for meaningful legislation that could help the economy. The focus has been on tax reform and infrastructure funding. As relations between the president and Congress have soured, the chances that this legislation gets approved have declined.\u000a\u000aHorizon Investments chief global strategic Greg Valliere notes that \u201canimosity among Republican leaders toward Trump is intense, and it will complicate budget and tax issues \u2013 especially when the White House won\u2019t issue its own tax bill while freelancing on specific provisions.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, what if they fail to pass tax reform? Investors could sell stocks fearing that the economy won\u2019t get the hoped-for benefit. One business leader has said that hiring plans would be cut back if tax reform isn\u2019t passed.\u000a\u000a4. Risk of an international crisis\u000a\u000aAmong the biggest worries surrounding the Trump administration has been the risk of international crisis. Between an understaffed U.S. State Department and the revolving door with top posts in the White House, the risks of a misstep are seen as unusually high.\u000a\u000aAs for trouble spots, North Korea currently tops the list. With continuing missile launches from the North, the risk of war, either intentional or through miscalculation, has risen. Horizon Investment\u2019s Valliere recently said the Korean crisis is now the single greatest threat to financial markets. A shooting war using conventional weapons is bad enough and would risk hundreds of thousands of casualties and calamity in South Korea, one of the world\u2019s largest export-focused economies. If nuclear weapons are added to the equation, the potential damage to human life, and by extension, the world\u2019s economy and financial markets, is virtually impossible to calculate.\u000a\u000aSee the original article here on Bankrate.com: http://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/smart-money/issues-facing-capitol-hill-impact-on-your-money/.

aVBeing libertarian is trendy right now, so much so that many actors, activists, politicians, media personalities, financial gurus, professors, scientists, and authors call themselves libertarians, even when they don\u2019t really qualify philosophically and fundamentally.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors defined a libertarian as a consistent advocate of free-market capitalism, minimal government, and social tolerance (thus distinguishing libertarians from conservatives). Their motto might be \u201cKeep government out of the boardroom and the bedroom.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur first effort to rank the 100 most influential libertarians came from a recent survey of libertarians carried out by FreedomFest, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest gathering of free minds.\u201d More than 10,000 people participated in the survey, identifying over 200 individuals whom they deemed most influential within the libertarian sphere. We also combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed libertarians to compile this list.\u000a\u000aStill, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. Moreover, while selecting only 100 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank the entrants in what we believe is a somewhat logical order of influence, but we certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps even some people whose names are on the list!) may take exception to the ranking.\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note that we chose to leave out a few individuals whose credentials as libertarians might be less convincing, such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Howard Stern. We may well change our minds on these omissions, but for now these individuals are left off the list.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and we welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to bestlists@newsmax.com).

aVJPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is starting to look like Corporate America's shadow president.\u000a\u000aThe 61-year-old banker has made more than a dozen trips to Washington so far this year to press a broad agenda with a range of influential policymakers, people who attended the meetings or are familiar with his schedule said. Dimon has already visited the nation's capital four times as much as he does in a typical year.\u000a\u000aHis ramped-up presence comes after taking the helm of the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents CEOs of large U.S. companies, in December.\u000a\u000a"We couldn't ask for a more engaged or more effective Business Roundtable chair," said Joshua Bolten, former chief of staff for President George W. Bush, whom Dimon installed as the organization's president and CEO.\u000a\u000aThe frequency of his trips, and the wide range of policies he has been discussing, have started chatter among power brokers in Washington and on Wall Street about how much energy Dimon is devoting to issues beyond JPMorgan.\u000a\u000aAt times, they said, Dimon carries himself more like someone running the country than someone running a bank.\u000a\u000a"If you're Jamie Dimon, you've always had access," said Tim Pawlenty, CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Wall Street trade group. "The difference is, now he wants it. He wants to play a role in policy more broadly than just representing his company."\u000a\u000aDimon has said in the past that the only big job he would want would be U.S. president, but also said running for office would be impractical. Associates told Reuters he has abandoned the idea entirely, and only became more active in Washington because he was worried about his bank, the economy and the future of the country.\u000a\u000aA JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment or make Dimon available for an interview. Reuters spoke to over a dozen people who have interacted with Dimon in Washington or were briefed on his meetings. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss his activities.\u000a\u000aThose who have met Dimon recently include Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown and Mark Warner, Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is a member of House Republican leadership, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.\u000a\u000aFAMILIAR SIGHT\u000a\u000aHe was around so much during the summer that Washington regulars said it was no longer surprising to see Dimon pop out of the Capitol Hill subway system or leave a lawmaker's office. He has joked with staff about getting a condominium in Washington because of how often he travels there, one person said.\u000a\u000aAlthough Dimon's meetings typically center on topics like tax reform or financial rules, he is not shy about weighing in on issues ranging from immigration to education and criminal justice reform, those familiar with the discussions said.\u000a\u000aIn meetings, he has been using an app he asked Business Roundtable staff to build. It allows member CEOs to show how many voters in a district work for their companies, and how many facilities the companies have there, to persuade lawmakers that their priorities are aligned.\u000a\u000aDuring his interactions with lawmakers, Dimon can be brash and expresses annoyance with Congress's inability to advance legislation, people who attended the meetings said.\u000a\u000aSometimes he would show his lighter side.\u000a\u000aOne day in July, Dimon spotted his Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, an old foe who championed a rule that slashed debit card fees and which Dimon has called "downright idiotic."\u000a\u000aDurbin was withdrawing money from a non-Chase ATM when Dimon approached from behind and quipped: "We welcome competition."\u000a\u000aA Durbin representative confirmed the interaction, first described by a Politico reporter in a tweet, took place but declined to elaborate.\u000a\u000aThose who have followed Dimon through his career are not surprised that the straight-talking New York banker has become even more outspoken during Donald Trump's presidency.\u000a\u000aAssociates say he has been shocked by some of Trump's actions, such as abandoning the Paris climate accord, threats to tear up free trade deals, a call for a ban transgender people from the military and ending a program that protects people who were brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation.\u000a\u000aDimon is not the only corporate boss venturing outside his usual terrain. Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein has criticized Trump in tweets, while others including Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook and Merck & Co CEO Ken Frazier have condemned the president's actions in public statements.\u000a\u000aBut Dimon, who often refers to himself as a "patriot," differs in tone and demeanor, sources said.\u000a\u000aThe table of contents for his April letter to shareholders includes categories such as "The United States of America is truly an exceptional country," and devoted more space to public policy prescriptions than in prior years.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump said "both sides" were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left-wing protesters in Virginia, Dimon offered unsolicited advice on how a president should carry himself.\u000a\u000a"It is a leader's role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart," he wrote in an employee memo.

aVAll decent Americans have an obligation to condemn the violent bigotry of the Nazi and KKK demonstrators in Charlottesville or wherever else they spew their poisonous and threatening rhetoric. But President Donald Trump has a special obligation to single out for condemnation, and distance himself from, individuals and groups that claim \u2014 even if falsely \u2014 to speak in his name, as the racist provocateurs in Charlottesville did.\u000a\u000aDavid Duke, the notorious bigot, told reporters that white nationalists were working to \u201cfulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\u201d Richard Spencer, the founder of the Daily Stormer (a not so coded homage to the Nazi publication Der Sturmer) attributed the growth of the ultra-nationalist alt-right to the Trump presidency:\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously the alt-right has come very far in the past two years in terms of public exposure\u2026is Donald Trump one of the major causes of that? Of course.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump initially responded as follows: \u201cWe must ALL be united and condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America.\u201d But then, following the car ramming that killed a peaceful protestor, President Trump made the following statement: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s inclusion of the words \u201cviolence on many sides\u201d \u2014 which seemed improvised \u2014 suggested to some a moral equivalence between the Nazis and the KKK, on the one hand, and those protesting and resisting them, on the other hand.\u000a\u000aTrump denied that he was suggesting any such equivalence and made the following statement: \u201cRacism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut then a day later he seemed to double down on his attempt to be even handed in his comments about the \u201cmany sides\u201d of this conflict. He pointed to \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d implying that Nazis and Klansmen could be \u201cfine,\u201d because their protests were \u201cvery legal.\u201d Then he denounced \u201calt-left\u201d groups that were \u201cvery, very violent.\u201d Once again he blamed \u201cboth sides,\u201d and asked rhetorically, \u201cwhat about the \u2018alt-left,\u2019 that as you say, came charging at the alt-right? Don\u2019t they have any semblance of guilt?\u201d\u000a\u000aDavid Duke immediately praised President Trump\u2019s condemnation of the \u201calt-left,\u201d thanking him \u201cfor your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinally (though nothing this president ever tweets is final) President Trump praised the anti-racist \u201cprotesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is against this background that the president\u2019s back-and-forth statements must be evaluated.\u000a\u000aEven if it were true \u2014 and the evidence is to the contrary \u2014 that Black Lives Matter and Antifa were as blameworthy for Charlottesville as the Nazis and KKK, it would still be incumbent on President Trump to focus his condemnation especially on the violent racist right that claims to speak on his behalf. The hard left \u2014 which does, in part, include some violent and bigoted elements \u2014 does not purport to speak on the president\u2019s behalf and does not claim to be trying to \u201cfulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\u201d To the contrary, they oppose everything he stands for. This situation poses a delicate dilemma for President Trump. He has denounced the ideology of the violent racists on the alt-right who claim to be acting in his name \u2014 not quickly or forcefully enough. And he has declared his opposition to \u201cracism\u201d and specifically to \u201cthose who cause violence in its name,\u201d who he has called \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cthugs.\u201d He specifically included within these categories the \u201cKKK, Neo-Nazis [and] White Supremacists,\u201d the very groups that purport to speak in his name.\u000a\u000aWhy is that not enough? Why should he not at the same time condemn the alt-left for its violence? These are reasonable questions that require nuanced answers. Let me try to provide some.\u000a\u000aI have long believed that it is the special responsibility of decent conservatives to expose, condemn, and marginalize hard-right extremists and bigots. William Buckley showed the way when he refused to defend Patrick Buchanan against charges that what he had said amounted to anti-Semitism. Other decent conservatives followed Buckley\u2019s lead, and marginalized anti-Semites and racists who expressed bigotry in the false name of conservatism.\u000a\u000aI also believe that it is the special responsibility of decent liberals to do the same with regard to hard-left bigoted extremists. I must acknowledge, as a liberal, that we have not done as good a job as decent conservatives have done. Perhaps this is because hard-left extremists often march under banners of benevolence, whereas hard-right extremists tend not to hide their malevolence.\u000a\u000aConsider, for example, Antifa, the radical hard-left group, some of whose members violently confronted the Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville. As reported by The New York Times, the organization is comprised of a \u201cdiverse collection of anarchists, communists and socialists\u201d with its \u201cantecedents in Germany and Italy.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to The Times, \u201cIts adherents express disdain for mainstream liberal politics\u201d and support \u201cdirect action\u201d by which they mean \u201cusing force and violence,\u201d rather than free speech and civil disobedience. Their leaders claim that violence is necessary because \u201cit\u2019s full-on war.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor is this merely rhetoric. On university campuses, particularly at Berkeley, \u201cblack-clad protesters, some of whom identified themselves as Antifa, smashed windows, threw gasoline bombs and broke into campus buildings, causing $100,000 in damage.\u201d They model themselves on the \u201cWeathermen\u201d of the 1970s, who were responsible for numerous acts of violence.\u000a\u000aThey claim to be using counter-violence in defense against the violence of Neo-Nazi and Klansmen, but that is not true. They also use violence to shut down speakers with whose worldviews they disagree; they include not only right-wing extremists, but also mainstream conservatives, moderate Zionists, and even some liberals. They reject dialogue in favor of intimidation, and force.\u000a\u000aAs a liberal, I will not give these hard-left violent bigots a pass. It is true that the Nazis and KKK are currently more dangerous in terms of physical violence than hard-left groups. (It is also true that the most violent groups by far are radical Islamic terrorists, who are not the targets of Antifa protests.) But the violence of the racist right (and radical jihadists) must not lead us to ignore the reality that Antifa and its radical allies pose real danger to the future of our nation, because of their increasing influence on university campuses where our future leaders are being educated. The recent events in Charlottesville and elsewhere have made them heroes among some mainstream liberals, who are willing to excuse their anti-liberal bigotry because they are on the barricades against fascism.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s far too easy to self-righteously condemn your political enemies when they step (or leap) over the line to bigotry and violence. It\u2019s far more difficult to condemn those who share your wing, whether left or right, but who go too far. But that is what morality and decency require, as Buckley taught us.\u000a\u000aSo President Trump must stop being even handed in his condemnations. He should focus his condemnation on extreme right-wing bigots who speak and act in his name, and leave it to those of us on the left to focus our condemnation on left-wing extremists and bigots.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Alan Dershowitz on Twitter (@AlanDersh) and Facebook (AlanMDershowitz).\u000a\u000aProfessor Alan Dershowitz is the author of "Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law" and most recently, "Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters."

aVMultiple students at an Iowa high school were disciplined this week after they posed in a photo wearing white hoods and holding a confederate flag and a rifle.\u000a\u000aThe Des Moines Register reported on a photo that made the rounds on social media, which depicts five people standing in front of a burning cross. One of them was shirtless and all wore white hoods like those donned by members of the Ku Klux Klan.\u000a\u000aAfter an investigation, officials at Creston Community High School determined the students were enrolled there. The students were disciplined, although officials would not reveal what their punishments were.\u000a\u000a"That picture does not represent the beliefs of our school system, our parents, or our community," athletic director and assistant principal Jeff Bevins told the Register.\u000a\u000aCreston Police Department Sgt.

"People can have weapons in the country."\u000a\u000aThe existence of the photo comes on the heels of several racially charged incidents across the U.S., including one in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month that resulted in the death of a 32-year-old woman.

aVFederal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer has submitted his resignation although his term was due to expire in the middle of next year.\u000a\u000aThis is somewhat troubling as Fischer was assumed to provide a degree of stability in the event that Fed Chair Janet Yellen should be replaced by somebody unsuitable.\u000a\u000aIt also means that counting Yellen, whose return isn't automatic, there are five positions at the Federal Reserve that President Donald Trump can fill in the coming months.\u000a\u000aFed independence is crucial and it makes it all the more important that a multiple-year strategy for dealing with quantitative policy is \u201ccemented\u201d into place sooner rather than later.\u000a\u000aWe also had the Fed\u2019s "Beige Book" economic report of anecdotal evidence of the United States that remained supportive of the idea of tightening.\u000a\u000aDecent growth and tightening labor markets are reported, with construction and manufacturing in particular having difficulty in finding adequate as well as overall suitable labor.\u000a\u000aThe one area of weakness in production and in consumer sales was in the auto sector. The fact that this weakness was so specific suggests that it may be a sector specific issue. Perhaps, younger Americans are less animative for cars rather than a macro-economic issue.\u000a\u000aBesides all that, Trump has done a deal with the Democrats in Congress to raise the debt ceiling and the budget limit, which should provide some relief for the Treasury bills markets, which have been more in about the prospect of a \u201cdefault\u201d situation.\u000a\u000aOver in Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not announce a tapering of its bond buying or a reduction of its quantitative accommodation.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary, the ECB\u2019s press communique reads: \u201c\u2026 To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent.\u201d\u000a\u000aYes, one could easily say that circumstances have not allowed to do enough preparatory work for starting a reduction of quantitative accommodation, and so it now seems that October could, which absolutely doesn\u2019t mean will be the most likely date for the announcement of any change in the current ECB policy.\u000a\u000aNo, the Euro area simply does not need the degree of accommodation that is currently applied by the ECB.\u000a\u000aAs we all know, ECB President Mario Draghi is on the dovish wing of the dovish faction of the European Central Bank and today he has, once again, exercised, as expected, his rights at the press conference to give a dovish spin on events and said during the press conference: \u201cEuro-zone growth projections for 2017 have been revised up, but inflation forecasts have been revised down; and positive cyclical risks to the forecasts are offset by negative global factors.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoreover, there is the question of the euro. The euro\u2019s rise this year is not unexpected, nor is it unjustified. The euro was grossly undervalued and should have risen as it did.\u000a\u000aHowever, a rapid and sizable rise is disruptive.\u000a\u000aExporters always complain, but frankly any exporter\u2019s account managers say that a 10 percent move in the currency over the course of a year doesn\u2019t deserve to be in business. However, a more aggressive move over the course over a shorter period of time is potentially damaging to business.\u000a\u000aThe question is how Draghi will manage to communicate a desire for euro stability. Investors could do well keeping in mind that the ECB\u2019s own forecasts are anchored on an exchange rate of circa $1.18 per euro and that any spike above that level will be a complicating factor.\u000a\u000aFinally, we got the German production data, which in July increased 4 percent year-over-year (y/y), which is of course a very good number that confirms the ongoing upward trend.\u000a\u000aEtienne "Hans" Parisis is a bank economist who has advised investors on financial markets and international investments.

aVIt started out cold as ice, and then turned warm and friendly. Now the tortured relationship between President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan has gone cool again, with the Republican president making clear he has no qualms about bucking the GOP leader to cut deals with his Democratic foes.\u000a\u000aThe two men dined at the White House Thursday night and discussed legislative challenges ahead for the fall, a get-together that was scheduled over Congress' August recess, long before the head-spinning events of this week. In a moment that stunned Washington, Trump cut a debt and disaster aid deal Wednesday with Congress' Democratic leaders as Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell watched on helplessly, after lobbying unsuccessfully for much different terms.\u000a\u000aThe moment distilled the inherent tensions between Trump, 71, a former Democrat and ideologically flexible deal-maker, and Ryan, 47, a loyal Republican whose discomfort with Trump led him to withhold his endorsement for weeks last year.\u000a\u000aAfter Trump was elected the two papered over their differences and even developed a rapport, talking frequently during health care negotiations earlier this year, as each understood they needed the other to advance individual and shared goals. But their phone calls have tapered off of late and Trump has expressed his frustration with GOP leaders on multiple fronts, culminating in the president's decision to ditch them and join hands with the Democrats instead.\u000a\u000aTrump exulted in his newly bipartisan approach Thursday, declaring it "a great thing for our country," while Ryan mostly grinned and bore it.\u000a\u000aAt the Capitol on Wednesday, Ryan had deemed a three-month debt ceiling increase as "unworkable" and "ridiculous." Yet an hour later, Trump overruled his strong objections to side with the Democrats.\u000a\u000aThe president's rebuff on the debt came just days after Trump ignored Ryan's pleas not to end the program to aid immigrants brought to the country as children and living here illegally. Instead, Trump ended the program and tossed the issue to Congress to resolve in six months.\u000a\u000aThe debt deal headed for House passage Friday along with $15 billion in disaster aid and a three-month government funding extension.\u000a\u000aIndeed for Ryan, GOP reactions to the deal exposed some lurking threats to his perch atop a conference where unrest brews nearly ceaselessly among conservatives, and there have been recent rumblings of a possible coup.\u000a\u000aTrump remains highly popular in the conservative districts occupied by many House Republicans, much more so than Ryan himself, who is scorned by many in the GOP base as an establishment sell-out. In a whipsawed moment, some House Republicans defended Trump's handling of a deal they don't like, while simultaneously criticizing Ryan, who had been overruled by the president. It also underscored the political pressure on Ryan to try to remain in the president's good graces even when Trump is flirting with Democrats.\u000a\u000aRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the message in his conservative district is that "congressional Republicans need to get behind the president."\u000a\u000aThat sentiment "makes him weaker," King said of Ryan.\u000a\u000aRep. Paul Gosar of Arizona described Ryan as "very unpopular" in his district, while regard for Trump is "pretty high."\u000a\u000aAs far as his constituents are concerned, Gosar said, they'd be happy if Ryan got the boot and Trump stayed. "That's kind of the mantra in my district," he said.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Trump has soured on the Republican congressional leadership in recent months, fuming to associates that they led him astray on their health care strategy, among other complaints.\u000a\u000aThe president has told those close to him that he regrets choosing to tackle the repeal and replace of Barack Obama's health care law as his first legislative push. He has singled out Ryan for blame, saying the speaker assured him it would pass and instead handed him an early, humiliating failure, before ultimate House passage of a revived bill, according to three White House and outside advisers familiar with the conversations but not authorized to speak about them publicly.\u000a\u000aGOP health care efforts collapsed in the Senate in July.\u000a\u000aTrump has spoken to Ryan less frequently in recent weeks, particularly after the departure of his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who has deep Wisconsin ties to the speaker. Priebus would sometimes broker the calls and stress to each man their importance, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Those calls have occurred less often since John Kelly took over as chief of staff.\u000a\u000aThough Trump has expressed particular anger at McConnell for the failed Senate health care vote and for not protecting him from the Russia investigation, he grudgingly has told associates that he is aware of the Senate leader's grip on power. He has spoken less glowingly about Ryan's own ability to lead due to the shorter House terms and the growing insurgency within the conservative Freedom Caucus.\u000a\u000aRyan's position is seen as secure for now, if only because it is widely accepted that no other House Republican could garner the support needed to replace him. But even allies believe his tenure in the job could be finite, and might depend in part on the whims of a president with whom he has no real deep ties.\u000a\u000a"I think any speaker is going to have a very difficult time in this environment," said Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y. "The nature of that job, I think, over time, they don't last."

"They tried really hard, but it didn't fly.\u000a\u000a"And everybody realizes the whole thing was a total hoax and a spoof and that there was nothing there.\u000a\u000a"I'm proud of him," he continued.

"It's the nastiest business I've ever seen.\u000a\u000a"It's just the evilness and the hatred in that world is unlike I could've ever fathomed before.\u000a\u000a"And no matter what he does, they're going to hit him on it \u2014 and they're going to go after him," Trump added.\u000a\u000a"It's the media, the mainstream media, who does not want him to succeed.

aVPrince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their third child. And for the third time \u2014 as with her previous two pregnancies \u2014 the former Kate Middleton is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness.\u000a\u000aHyperemesis gravidarum is estimated to affect about one to three percent of pregnant women and can result in nausea and vomiting so acute that hospitalization is required. It is thought to be caused by pregnancy hormones, but doctors aren't sure why some women experience worse symptoms than others.\u000a\u000aThe condition usually begins in the early weeks of pregnancy and in many cases, subsides by about 20 weeks. But for some women, the effects may persist until the baby is born.\u000a\u000aThe condition can be "absolutely devastating," said Dr. Roger Gadsby of Warwick University, who has studied the issue for decades. "Your life is on hold while the symptoms are present," he said, noting that some pregnant women may vomit dozens of times per day and be restricted to bed rest.\u000a\u000aKensington Palace made the pregnancy announcement Monday, saying the duchess was not feeling well enough to attend an official engagement later in the day. Kate is being cared for at her Kensington Palace home in London. There was no word of when the baby is due.\u000a\u000aShe and Prince William already have two children: Prince George, 4 and Princess Charlotte, 2.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Kate was hospitalized for several days when she was believed to be suffering from dehydration.\u000a\u000aThere is no evidence that the nausea and vomiting from severe morning sickness will affect the baby's future health. Women with the condition actually have a slightly lower risk of miscarriage, according to Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.\u000a\u000aIn severe cases, however, babies can be born with lower than expected birthweight. Women with the condition are advised to eat small meals often, to avoid any foods or smells that trigger symptoms and to consult their midwife or doctor if their symptoms do not subside.\u000a\u000aIf treatment requires hospitalization, women are typically given vitamins, steroids and anti-nausea drugs intravenously. Patients are also sometimes treated with shots of heparin, to thin their blood: pregnant women are at increased risk of developing blood clots in their legs, and being dehydrated further elevates the risk.\u000a\u000aGadsby said he would expect doctors to be able to treat the duchess at Kensington Palace and that there shouldn't be any lasting effects. She would likely have to cut back on her royal schedule, though.\u000a\u000a"As long as the mom receives adequate treatment, the mom is usually fine and the baby is fine," he said.\u000a\u000aThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.
