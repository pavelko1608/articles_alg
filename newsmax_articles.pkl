VAn increasing number of people have been sickened by eating papaya now traced to a farm located in southern Mexico, U.S. public health officials said Monday in an update on the outbreak first reported more than two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aSalmonella has now sickened 109 people in 16 states and 35 were serious enough to be hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its web page dedicated to the outbreak. One person in New York City died.\u000a\u000aPapaya traced to the Carica de Campeche farm in Campeche, Mexico, appears to be the likely source, the FDA said. The farm is located on the Gulf of Mexico side of the Yucatan Peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe company did not immediately respond to an email and phones went unanswered on Tuesday. A storm warning was posted for the area as Tropical Storm Franklin was making its way across the Yucatan Peninsula.\u000a\u000aPapayas from the Carica de Campeche farm tested positive for five different strains of salmonella bacteria, which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and fever. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.\u000a\u000aCases in New York nearly tripled to 36 since the last report on July 21 and New Jersey cases have more than doubled to 26. Virginia has had 11 cases, Pennsylvania seven and Maryland has had six.\u000a\u000aConnecticut and Minnesota each have four cases, and Massachusetts has had three.\u000a\u000aIowa, Kentucky, North Carolina and Oklahoma have reported two cases and Delaware, Louisiana Michigan and Wisconsin have had one each.\u000a\u000aThe FDA said it is working with Mexican food safety authorities to conduct inspections and other follow up activities.\u000a\u000aThe Campeche farm has been added to an import alert which allows FDA field personnel to stop fresh produce from entering the U.S. from the farm until it's proven to have resolved issues that caused the bacterial contamination. It was not immediately clear how the papaya was contaminated, an FDA spokesman said.\u000a\u000a"The investigation is continuing and we'll post more information when it's available," said Peter Cassell.\u000a\u000aThe CDC said laboratory evidence using genetic testing has connected some of the illnesses to papaya from the farm.\u000a\u000aSo far the Caribena, Cavi and Valery brands of maradol papayas have been recalled but the CDC now recommends that consumers not eat, restaurants not serve, and retailers not sell maradol papayas from Mexico.

aVStress-free traveling is just one reason why cruises are the best type of vacation. Passengers can enjoy the sights, sounds, and offerings of different faraway places while leaving the travel logistics to the ship captain.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of activities onboard as well as the adventures that await when the ship reaches port. On top of that, there\u2019s usually not just one port but several destinations to visit. It\u2019s as if cruise passengers get several vacations in one.\u000a\u000aHere are six reasons why cruises are the best type of vacation:\u000a\u000a1. Great value \u2014 For one price, cruise travelers not only enjoy the sea, but they also have food service with meals and buffets throughout the day and night, according to ABC News. Accommodations are provided in comfy quarters and there\u2019s day and evening entertainment. Plus the cost includes travel to different destinations.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Family friendly \u2014 Parents can enjoy dining together while their children enjoy plenty of onboard activities. Many cruise ships offer age-related entertainment for young children or teens. Sit by the pool while the kids play video games or enjoy play areas.\u000a\u000a3. Unique itineraries \u2014 Some destinations are difficult to get to by land. Not with a cruise. Passengers can travel to faraway destinations such as Grenada, Anguilla, Hawaii, Europe, or even the Amazon, which would be more expensive when traveling by plane and staying in hotels, Cruise Critic explains.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Fun while learning \u2014 Many cruise lines include hosts who provide expertise on oceanographic or environmental issues, usually centered around the cruise. There are educational programs for kids on marine life. If the cruise includes faraway journeys to places like the Galapagos or other adventures, expert guides and equipment are available for nature lovers and photographers.\u000a\u000a5. Relaxation \u2014 As soon as the trip begins, there\u2019s no need for vacation planning. Cruise lines let passengers choose the itinerary, cabin, and tours available, Fodors notes. No stress about researching what to do. You only have to unpack once and you\u2019re off.\u000a\u000a6. See the world without hassle \u2014 Flying to Europe, Africa, or India might include frequent dealings with customs, transportation, visas, or language barriers. A cruise package, however, does all the work for you. You get transportation to places wherever you land. English-speaking tour guides are immediately available in foreign countries.\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aShould the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVSummer time activities can wreak havoc on your health. For example, dehydration can be deadly, say experts, if you overdo outdoor exercise without drinking enough fluid.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s not only fluid loss that can cause serious summer side effects. We may also lose valuable nutrients like sodium and sugar that can lead to muscle cramping, confusion, and even lack of consciousness.\u000a\u000aAlthough health experts generally advise limiting consumption of salt and sugar, it\u2019s not a good idea to do so if you\u2019re engaging in vigorous exercise during warmer summer months.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t need special sports drinks or powers bars to fuel summer workouts,\u201d says notes sports medicine expert Dr. Gabe Mirkin, of Orlando. The elite athlete tells Newsmax Health that most healthy and fit folks get the nutrients they need from ordinary foods but hot weather warriors need extra water, salt, and sugar to maintain optimum function.\u000a\u000aThe Gatorade Sports Institute recently published a study showing 46 percent of recreational exercisers can become dehydrated playing summer sports. But Mirkin points out that while it may not affect their performance, dehydration can increase your risk of fatigue, heat exhaustion, blood clots, and even stroke.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s also true that too much fluid can lead to a potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia in which the body\u2019s salt levels become diluted. The fluid moves from the body through the bloodstream into the brain which maintains its normal level of sodium causing swelling, nausea and blurred vision.\u000a\u000aEventually the person can become confused, have seizures or pass out. Mirkin says this is a medical emergency and requires immediate hospital care.\u000a\u000aAlthough the American College of Sports Medicine recommends a fluid intake of five cups or two average water bottles per hour during hot weather exercising, for someone who is not in shape or not exercising to the maximum, this can be far too much fluid.\u000a\u000aLow levels of sugar can cause muscle pain and weakness \u2013 known as hitting the wall \u2013 that occurs in long distance runners, as well as confusion or passing out in cyclists.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour muscles use primarily sugar and fat for energy,\u201d notes Mirkin. \u201cYou have an almost infinite amount of fat stored in your body, but you start to run out of sugar which is stored in your liver after 70 minutes of intense exercise.\u000a\u000a\u201cYour brain has almost no stored sugar, so it gets all of its energy from the sugar carried to it from the bloodstream. When your liver sugar levels drop, your blood sugar levels also drop and your brain loses normal function. You feel weak, tired and confused and can even pass out.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince muscles also have a limited amount of stored sugar, they too will begin to weaken when blood sugar levels dip.\u000a\u000a\u201cI recommend taking sugar five minutes before exercising and during the competition or workout if necessary,\u201d he advises.\u000a\u000aThe only mineral you need during hot weather exercise is sodium, says Mirkin.\u000a\u000a\u201cPotassium, calcium, and magnesium deficiencies rarely occur in healthy athletes,\u201d he says. \u201cSalt is necessary to hold water in your body, prevent muscle cramps, and keep your muscles contracting with force.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf you do not meet your needs for salt during periods of extended hot weather activity, you will tire earlier and increase your risk of heat stroke, dehydration, and cramps. Mirkin recommends eating salty nuts and potato chips during vigorous outdoor activity.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome sports drinks contain salt but they taste awful and the amount added is so small it may not meet your needs,\u201d says Mirkin. \u201cOne study showed that you cannot replace the salt lost through exercise by drinking sports drinks that contain salt, since they are typical contain very little.\u201d\u000a\u000aMirkin\u2018s recommendations:

aVPresident Trump's tweets about his broad power to pardon have raised the ultimate question: Can the president pardon himself? The answer is crystal clear! And anyone who gives you a different answer is misleading you, because there is only one correct answer. Here it is: nobody knows!\u000a\u000aNo president has ever tried it. No court has ever ruled on it. The framers of our Constitution never opined on it. History provides no guidance. There is a clean slate.\u000a\u000aYet pundits and academic know-it-alls will express certainty on both sides of this issue. That's what pundits and academics do. Rarely do they acknowledge they don't know, because as experts they are supposed to know. But this is one question whose answer they cannot know.\u000a\u000aThey will have opinions, as we all do. But many will deliberately confuse the is with the ought. If they would like the answer to be no, they will pretend the answer is no. If they would like the answer to be yes, they will pretend it is yes. That's the way some pundits and academics advocate: by claiming to be describing what they are not so subtly prescribing.\u000a\u000aThis has been the case especially with regard to Donald Trump. Too many academics have said that non-criminal conduct by Trump and his administration is a crime, when they wish it were a crime, so that Trump can be removed from office. But wishful thinking is not a substitute for rigorous analysis, which has been sorely lacking among some of my fellow liberal academics.\u000a\u000aSo let's rigorously analyze the question of whether a president can pardon himself.\u000a\u000aThe preliminary question is whether a sitting president can be indicted, tried and/or convicted for an alleged crime committed before he assumed office or while serving in office. The answer to that question probably is no, as most authorities suggest. That has been the Justice Department\u2019s view for some time now. It is also the view of most experts that once a president leaves office \u2014 by his term ending or by impeachment or resignation \u2014 he could be prosecuted. If that were the case, there would be no reason for the president to even consider pardoning himself now. He could wait until his last day in office.\u000a\u000aWhy the last day? Because if he can be prosecuted as soon as he leaves office, pardoning himself would protect him from that possibility, if the self-pardon were valid.\u000a\u000aWhy would he not do it any earlier? Because he might well be impeached if he pardoned himself, and the pardon power does not extend to impeachment. But he couldn\u2019t be impeached on his last day or after he leaves office. If he had doubts about the validity of a self-pardon, he could also make a deal \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 with the Vice President to resign a day before his term was up in exchange for a pardon from the one-day president.\u000a\u000aSo timing would be everything.\u000a\u000aWill we ever know for sure whether a self-pardon is constitutionally permissible? Unlikely.\u000a\u000aFirst, a President would have to pardon himself. The political cost of such an action would be very high. Second, a prosecutor would then have to try to prosecute the former president. Third, the former president would have to raise the pardon as a defense. Finally, the courts would have to decide whether, under our system of separation of powers, the courts have jurisdiction to review a presidential self-pardon. This last contingency is interesting, because as Justice Holmes reminded us, the power to pardon is not a mere \u201cprivate act of grace,\u201d but rather an important part of our \u201cConstitutional scheme,\u201d of checks and balances and separation of powers.\u000a\u000aBut the pardon power is not without limit. A president could almost certainly be prosecuted after leaving office for accepting a bribe to grant a pardon. Although he would be prosecuted for accepting the bribe, the granting of the pardon would be the quid pro quo, and thus an essential of the crime. James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers that no person \u201cis allowed to be a judge in his own case.\u201d Would violation of this principle bestow jurisdiction on a court to invalidate a self-pardon? The answer to that question remains unclear.\u000a\u000aI'm relatively certain these contingencies will never come to pass. So we will have to learn to live with the uncertainty of never knowing whether a president has the constitutional authority to pardon himself.\u000a\u000aThis article was first published by The Hill.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Alan Dershowitz on Twitter (@AlanDersh) and Facebook (AlanMDershowitz).\u000a\u000aProfessor Alan Dershowitz is the author of "Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law" and most recently, "Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters."

aVNorth Korea has announced a detailed plan to launch a salvo of ballistic missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to U.S. bombers. If carried out, it would be the North's most provocative missile launch to date.\u000a\u000aThe announcement Thursday warned that the North is finalizing a plan to fire four of its Hwasong-12 missiles over Japan and into waters around the tiny island, which hosts 7,000 U.S. military personnel on two main bases and has a population of 160,000.\u000a\u000aJapan and South Korea vowed a strong reaction if the North were to go through with the plan.\u000a\u000aIt said the plan, which involves the missiles hitting waters 30 to 40 kilometers (19 to 25 miles) from the island, could be sent to leader Kim Jong Un for approval within a week or so. It would be up to Kim whether the move is actually carried out.\u000a\u000aIt is unclear whether \u2014 or exactly why \u2014 North Korea would risk firing missiles so close to U.S. territory. Such a launch would almost compel the United States to attempt an intercept and possibly generate further escalation.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, no stranger to bluffing, frequently uses extremely bellicose rhetoric with warnings of military action to keep its adversaries on their heels. It generally couches its threats with language stating it will not attack the United States unless it has been attacked first or has determined an attack is imminent.\u000a\u000aBut the statement raised worries amid threats from both sides.\u000a\u000aFollowing reports that U.S. intelligence suggests the North might be able to pair a nuclear warhead with a missile capable of reaching targets on the United States mainland, Trump warned North Korea that "it faces retaliation with fire and fury unlike any the world has seen before."\u000a\u000aPyongyang, meanwhile, has been louder in its complaints against a new and tough round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, with strong U.S. backing, and Washington's use of Guam as a staging ground for its stealth bombers, which could be used to attack North Korea and are a particularly sore point with the ruling regime in Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aIts reported plan is extremely specific, suggesting it is actually plotting a launch.\u000a\u000aThe report said the Hwasong-12 rockets would fly over Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures in Japan and travel "1,065 seconds before hitting the waters 30 to 40 kilometers away from Guam." It said the Korean People's Army Strategic Force will finalize the plan by mid-August, present it to Kim Jong Un and "wait for his order."\u000a\u000a"We keep closely watching the speech and behavior of the U.S.," it said.\u000a\u000aSuch a move would not merely be a test launch, but a demonstration of military capabilities that could easily lead to severe consequences.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's military responded by saying North Korea will face a "stern and strong" response from Washington and Seoul. Taking it a step further, Japan's Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told parliament a missile attack on the U.S. territory would be a Japanese national emergency because it would threaten Japan's existence as a nation.\u000a\u000aIf North Korea were to actually carry it out \u2014 even if it aimed at hitting the waters off Guam and not the island itself \u2014 that would clearly pose a potential threat to U.S. territory and put the United States in a much more complicated situation than it has been during previous missile launches.\u000a\u000aGuam lies about 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) from the Korean Peninsula, and it's extremely unlikely Kim's government would risk annihilation with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens. It's also unclear how reliable North Korea's missiles would be against such a distant target, but no one was writing off the danger completely.\u000a\u000aWashington has been testing its missile defenses in response to the North's stepped-up development and the current escalation of tensions could lead to pressure for the U.S. military to try to shoot down the North's missiles in midflight if they are heading toward Guam.\u000a\u000aThat would likely open up a set of very major problems, including the possibility of both a very high-profile failure or a miscalculation of Washington's intentions and a more deadly pre-emptive strike by the North \u2014 which has missiles able to hit Tokyo and conventional weapons that could devastate South Korea's capital of Seoul.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-12, which was revealed for the first time at a military parade in April, is an intermediate-range ballistic missile that is believed to have a radius of more than 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles). It can be fired from mobile launchers, making it hard to detect and destroy on the ground.\u000a\u000aBy launching a salvo of four, the North would be attempting to make it harder for the U.S. to intercept all of the incoming missiles. Its stated flight path over Japan is also very aggressive \u2014 it has recently tried to avoid flying over neighboring countries by shooting its missiles up at a very high angle to land in the ocean.\u000a\u000aWashington, meanwhile, has been giving out mixed signals about its intentions.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump was threatening annihilation and boasting from the New Jersey golf resort where he's vacationing that he has made the U.S. nuclear arsenal "far stronger and more powerful than ever before," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm the sense of crisis.\u000a\u000a"Americans should sleep well at night," Tillerson told reporters. "Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours."

aVThe S&P 500 index had its biggest one-day drop in almost three months on Thursday as investors fled riskier assets, with technology stocks leading the charge, in response to an increasingly aggressive exchange of threats between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aU.S. equities steepened their losses late in the session after President Donald Trump said his earlier warnings to North Korea may not have been tough enough. He also said the nuclear-armed nation should be "very, very nervous" if it even thinks about attacking the United States or its allies.\u000a\u000aTrump was responding to North Korea's claim it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aInvestors have been jittery about North Korea since Tuesday when Trump said any threats from Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000aThe S&P's record close on Aug. 7 likely helped fuel its latest sell-off.\u000a\u000a"When investors are optimistic to the extreme, it means that most of their money is already in the market and there's no more money coming in," Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida.\u000a\u000aThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 204.69 points, or 0.93 percent, at 21,844.01, the S&P 500 lost 35.81 points, or 1.45 percent, to end the session at 2,438.21 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 135.46 points, or 2.13 percent, to 6,216.87.\u000a\u000aThe last time the S&P closed down more than 1 percent was May 17 when it fell 1.8 percent. It is now on track for its biggest weekly drop since the week before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.\u000a\u000aThe technology sector was the S&P's biggest drag with a 2.2 percent drop. It has been the leading S&P gainer so far this year, making it particularly vulnerable to a decline.\u000a\u000a"Since these are the stocks that have been in the spotlight the most, they tend to have the most volatility upwards and downwards," said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital Management in Sarasota, Florida.\u000a\u000aInvestors instead turned to safe-haven assets such as gold, pushing it to a two-month high, and the Japanese yen rose.\u000a\u000aThe utilities index, often seen as a bond proxy because of its companies' slow reliable growth and high dividends, was the only S&P sector that ended the day up, showing a 0.25 percent gain.\u000a\u000aThe CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its highest since the election.\u000a\u000aMacy's shares closed down 10.2 percent and Kohl's fell almost 6 percent as the companies continued to report a drop in quarterly same-store sales, stoking concerns that their turnarounds may still be a long way off.\u000a\u000aSelling was broad. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 6-to-1; on Nasdaq, a 3.60-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\u000a\u000aAbout 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.25 billion average for the last 20 days.

aVThe Democratic National Committee was not hacked by Russia \u2014 nor by anyone else \u2014 but instead was "an inside job by someone with access to the DNC's system," according to a report in The Nation.\u000a\u000a"There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee's system on July 5 last year \u2014 not by the Russians, not by anyone else," according to the Nation's report, referencing conclusions by a group of former NSA computer experts.\u000a\u000a"Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak \u2014 a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device.\u000a\u000a"In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC's system," the experts concluded, since a remote hack of the committee's servers \u2014 with the volume of data stolen \u2014 would have been technologically impossible.\u000a\u000a"This casts serious doubt on the initial 'hack,' as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer," the experts concluded.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the experts found forensic evidence proving the initial documents published by the hacker Guccifer 2.0 were forgeries intended to finger Moscow.\u000a\u000a"Forensic investigations of documents made public two weeks prior to the July 5 leak by the person or entity known as Guccifer 2.0 show that they were fraudulent," the experts said.\u000a\u000a"Before Guccifer posted them, they were adulterated by cutting and pasting them into a blank template that had Russian as its default language.\u000a\u000a"Guccifer took responsibility on June 15 for an intrusion the DNC reported on June 14 and professed to be a WikiLeaks source \u2014 claims essential to the official narrative implicating Russia in what was soon cast as an extensive hacking operation.\u000a\u000a"To put the point simply," the experts concluded, "forensic science now devastates this narrative."\u000a\u000aThe Nation's report, published Wednesday, details the extensive findings by "qualified experts working independently of one another."\u000a\u000aThey began working on the DNC case "immediately after the July 2016 events," according to the report.\u000a\u000aThese experts are part of a group called the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), established in 2003 to investigate claims by the George W. Bush administration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\u000a\u000aThe group now has 30 members, most of whom have "decades of experience in matters concerning Russian intelligence and the related technologies," the Nation reported.\u000a\u000aIn its findings, VIPS determined the NSA had the technical ability to find out exactly what happened because the agency's publicly known programs can capture all electronic data transfers.\u000a\u000a"If NSA cannot produce such evidence \u2014 and quickly \u2014 this would probably mean it does not have any," the report concluded.\u000a\u000aBesides addressing the technological issues surrounding the DNC breach and the Guccifer 2.0 drop, the VIPS report debunks a chronology of events surrounding the hack that led Democrats to finger WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as a Moscow operative in the breach.\u000a\u000aIt includes the June 12 warning from Assange it would publish hacked documents on Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign to Guccifer 2.0's second claim, July 5, that he had remotely breached the DNC servers.\u000a\u000a"With his June 12 announcement," the Nation's observed, "Assange effectively put the DNC on notice that it had a little time, probably not much, to act preemptively against the imminent publication of damaging documents.\u000a\u000a"Did the DNC quickly conjure Guccifer from thin air to create a cyber-saboteur whose fingers point to Russia?" the magazine asked.\u000a\u000a"There is no evidence of this one way or the other, but emphatically it is legitimate to pose the question in the context of the VIPS chronology.\u000a\u000a"WikiLeaks began publishing on July 22," the Nation reported.\u000a\u000a"By that time, the case alleging Russian interference in the 2016 elections process was taking firm root.\u000a\u000a"In short order," the magazine reported, "Assange would be written down as a 'Russian agent.'"

aVCountry legend Glen Campbell will be widely remembered by music fans for such well-known radio hits as \u201cRhinestone Cowboy.\u201d But to advocates for people with dementia, his greatest legacy is his bold decision to become the very public face of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u000a\u000aCampbell died Tuesday at the age of 81, after a six-year battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, his publicist Sandy Brokaw announced.\u000a\u000aThe announcement prompted a spate of tributes from mental health advocates who hailed Campbell, his wife Kimberly, and family for bravely revealing his Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis before embarking on a final \u201cGoodbye Tour\u201d that was documented in the award-winning documentary \u201cI\u2019ll Be Me.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe film is an unflinching portrayal of the progression of Campbell\u2019s disease on the tour, which had to be cut short.\u000a\u000aSince then, Campbell and his family have continued to advocate on behalf of the cause, sharing his story on Capitol Hill and speaking out on behalf of the 5.5 million Americans diagnosed with the memory-robbing disorder.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlen was a courageous advocate on behalf of Alzheimer\u2019s, not only bravely sharing his diagnosis with the world, but continuing to bring joy to his fans through his music while facing the disease so publicly,\u201d said Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlen and his family helped to bring Alzheimer\u2019s out of the shadows and into the spotlight with openness and honesty that has rallied people to take action on behalf of the cause.

Without new treatments, the number of Americans with Alzheimer\u2019s is projected to nearly triple by 2050, as the baby boom generation grows into old age.\u000a\u000aSince Campbell\u2019s disclosure that he was struggling with dementia in 2011, he has become the most visible face of Alzheimer\u2019s since Ronald Reagan.\u000a\u000aThe country music legend\u2019s last hit song and video, 2014\u2019s \u201cI'm Not Gonna Miss You,\u201d is a heartrending musical reflection on his battle with dementia \u2014 one that hit home with relatives and advocates of Alzheimer\u2019s sufferers across the country.\u000a\u000aThe song, which went viral shortly after its release, was just one in a series of courageous efforts by the Campbell family to publicize the singer-guitarist\u2019s challenges.\u000a\u000aFew people outside of Campbell's wife and three children felt the pain of his declining mental health as deeply as Jimmy Webb, the legendary songwriter who wrote the rhinestone's cowboy biggest hits, including "Wichita Lineman" and "By the Time I get to Phoenix."\u000a\u000aIn a Newsmax interview shortly after the release of \u201cI\u2019m Not Going to Miss You,\u201d Webb called the Campbells\u2019 decision to go public with his story \u201cdifficult and brave,\u201d adding: "Believe me, if there were a way for me to change this lyric, I would. Glen is one of my dearest friends."\u000a\u000aWebb said the early indications of Campbell's advancing dementia were subtle. For instance, he\u2019d forget the words to some of his favorite songs while the two were performing together, Webb recalled. But only those who knew him well would notice the memory lapses.\u000a\u000a"It just started out with him like maybe forgetting a couple of lines in a song and I'd kind of look at him and I'd think, you know, time to cut back on the red wine or something like that," Webb told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aBut it eventually became clear those little episodes were more than just minor bouts of forgetfulness.\u000a\u000aWebb and his wife, Laura Savini, remained in close contact with the Campbell family through the various phases of the disease.\u000a\u000a"There's certain stages of the disease where \u2014 I don't know how to put this, but \u2014 it's almost like cute. There's an endearing quality to it, almost like having a child, having a very precocious child," Webb said. "But then it goes from there very quickly to a place where it's no longer that, it's something else. And it really requires constant attention."\u000a\u000aWebb called Campbell "a true musical genius" who inspired him from the time he first heard the singer\u2019s voice on the radio as a teen growing up on a farm in Elk City, Okla.\u000a\u000aWebb called "Wichita Lineman," which won a Grammy in 1968, "a perfect record." With Campbell's advancing dementia, the song took on a poignant new meaning \u2014 particularly in the fading walk-off line: "He's still on the line."\u000a\u000aWebb noted that he last collaborated with Campbell on a duet of "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" \u2014 another Grammy winner \u2014 for the songwriter's 2010 duets album, "Just Across the River." It marked both the first and last time that the two sang the track together.\u000a\u000aAlthough Webb's songs have been performed by many artists over the years \u2014 including Frank Sinatra ("Didn't We"), Art Garfunkel ("All I Know\u201d), Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings ("The Highwayman"), the Fifth Dimension ("Up, Up and Away"), Joe Cocker ("The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"), Donna Summer, Richard Harris ("MacArthur Park"), and Brad Paisley ("Galveston") \u2014 Campbell has been the most public voice for his music.\u000a\u000a"We were counting up the other day that he's recorded about 70 or 80 different songs of mine," Webb said. "So basically, he would record everything that I wrote and out of those songs came some hits. But certainly not all of them were hits and some of them are just absolutely gorgeous and nobody ever heard them.\u000a\u000aCampell\u2019s last hit release, \u201cI'm Not Gonna Miss You,\u201d recorded in 2013, may be the song that most cements his legacy.\u000a\u000a"I'm still here but yet I'm gone, I don't play guitar or sing my songs," Campbell begins, then pays tribute to his wife, Kim, singing, "You're the last person I will love, you're the last face I will recall."\u000a\u000aIn the accompanying video, Campbell's moving lyrics are punctuated by personal videos and clips of performances marking his five-decade musical career.\u000a\u000aAmong the film\u2019s most striking images: Footage of a doctor showing Campbell X-rays of his brain and explaining how the disease will steal his memory.

aVBillionaire hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio advises savvy investors to buy gold now as tension between the United States and North Korea show no signs of easing.\u000a\u000a"Prospective risks are now rising and do not appear appropriately priced in," The Bridgewater Associates founder wrote in a LinkedIn blog post.\u000a\u000a"The emerging risks appear more political than economic, which makes them especially challenging to price in," wrote Dalio, manager of the world's largest hedge fund.\u000a\u000a"Two confrontational, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders playing chicken with each other, while the world is watching to see which one will be caught bluffing, or if there will be a hellacious war," wrote Dalio, who was initially bullish on President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy.\u000a\u000a"We can also say that if the above things go badly, it would seem that gold (more than other safe haven assets like the dollar, yen, and treasuries) would benefit," Dalio wrote.\u000a\u000aInvestors should allocate 5 percent to 10 percent of their portfolios to gold, Dalio wrote.\u000a\u000aHe also warned about the potential of Congress not being able to increase the debt ceiling in a fight with Trump over his border wall and the risk of a government shutdown later this year, CNBC explained.\u000a\u000a"When it comes to assessing political matters (especially global geopolitics like the North Korea matter), we are very humble. We know that we don't have a unique insight that we'd choose to bet on," Dalio wrote. "We aim to stay liquid, stay diversified, and not be overly exposed to any particular economic outcomes."\u000a\u000aDalio, who said in December that the Trump era could \u201cignite animal spirits\u201d and attract productive capital, began souring on the leader after he banned visitors from several mostly Muslim countries and proposed border taxes on Mexican goods, Bloomberg has reported.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, his executive order on immigration and bent toward U.S. trade protectionism are reminiscent of the policies of populist governments in the 1930s, Dalio and co-chief investment officer Bob Prince told clients earlier this year.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s vow to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea sounded a lot like the rhetoric Kim Jong Un uses to threaten America. And it may prove to be just as empty, Bloomberg warned.\u000a\u000aTrump has no good military options in the face of mounting evidence that Kim will soon be able to hit Los Angeles or Denver with nuclear missiles.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s weapons and nuclear facilities "are dispersed and hidden throughout the country\u2019s mountainous terrain. Failing to hit them all would leave Japan, South Korea and U.S. military bases vulnerable to attack -- with either conventional or nuclear warheads." And even if the U.S. managed to destroy everything, Seoul would still be vulnerable to North Korea\u2019s artillery, Bloomberg explained.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, investors have grown cautious over escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe loss of appetite for risk followed North Korea's claim it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam in an unusually detailed threat, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aTrump said on Thursday afternoon that his earlier warnings to North Korea may not have been tough enough.\u000a\u000aThe three major U.S. stock-market indices have sold off this week amid investors' jitters after Trump said on Tuesday that threats from Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVPope Francis has ordered a Belgian Catholic charity to stop offering euthanasia in its psychiatric hospitals.\u000a\u000aIn May, the Brothers of Charity group announced it would allow doctors to perform euthanasia at its 15 psychiatric hospitals in Belgium, one of only two countries \u2014 along with the Netherlands \u2014 where doctors are legally allowed to kill people with mental health problems, at their request.\u000a\u000aTo qualify, people must be in a state of "unbearable suffering" and at least three doctors, including one psychiatrist, must be consulted.\u000a\u000aThe charity said in a statement that euthanasia would only be performed if there were "no reasonable treatment alternatives" and that such requests would be considered with "the greatest caution."\u000a\u000a"We respect the freedom of doctors to carry out euthanasia or not," the group said, noting that this freedom was "guaranteed by law."\u000a\u000aThe Vatican press office said this week that the pope had asked the Belgians not to perform euthanasia.\u000a\u000aThe Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and the Holy See has begun investigating the decision to allow the procedure, which was made by the group's lay board of directors.\u000a\u000aThe Belgian charity's administrative headquarters in Rome issued a statement in May, arguing that allowing euthanasia "goes against the basic principles" of the Catholic Church.\u000a\u000a"This is the very first time a Christian organization states that euthanasia is an ordinary medical practice that falls under the physician's therapeutic freedom," wrote the charity's superior general, Rene Stockman, who delivered the request from Pope Francis via two letters.\u000a\u000a"This is disloyal, outrageous and unacceptable."\u000a\u000aMattias De Vriendt, a spokesman for the Belgium charity, said it had received the Vatican's request but had not yet responded.\u000a\u000a"We will take our time in the next few weeks to evaluate these letters," de Vriendt said. He said the charity's hospitals had received requests from patients seeking euthanasia recently but could not say whether any procedures had been performed.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of patients seeking euthanasia in Belgium have a fatal illness like cancer or a degenerative disease. While the number of people euthanized for psychiatric reasons accounts for only about 3 percent of Belgium's yearly 4,000 euthanasia deaths, there has been a threefold increase in the past decade.\u000a\u000aCritics have previously raised concerns about Belgium's liberal approach to euthanasia while advocates say that people with mental health illnesses should be granted the same autonomy as those with physical diseases.\u000a\u000aThe American Psychiatric Association says that doctors should not prescribe any methods to people who are not terminally ill to help them die.

aVMany seniors are traveling to see the world. Particularly if you are fortunate enough to be retired or semi-retired, you can travel at a more relaxed pace and stay longer in your favorite destinations to get a full experience.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re ready to pack your bags for a new adventure, here are some top travel destinations that are perfect for mature travelers.\u000a\u000a1. Western U.S. national parks \u2013 The west is known for its magnificent scenery, but it can take longer than an average working person\u2019s week-long vacation to see it all. These parks offer activities for every skill level. Travel Channel suggests taking a road trip to explore Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park including the Upper Geyser Basin, and ending with the Grand Teton National Park.\u000a\u000aAlert: The Secret for Joint Comfort Is Not So Secret Anymore\u000a\u000a2. Big Sur, California \u2013 This magical destination is located on California\u2019s rugged central coasts with awe-inspiring beauty in every direction. A road trip is by far the best way to experience this area, winding down the famous Highway 1 from Carmel to San Simeon. Smart Travel Tips says to take time to stop along the way for photo opportunities and to experience any number of charming coastal inns and restaurants with ocean views.\u000a\u000a3. Central Europe river cruises \u2013 CBS News says luxury river cruises are gaining popularity among retirees because, just like any other cruise, you can see several destinations at once. The most popular river cruise ships wind their way through charming European villages along the Danube and the Rhine rivers, serving guests local wine, beer, and upscale cuisine.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 'Rich by Friday' Retirement Technique Available Now!\u000a\u000a4. Sante Fe, New Mexico \u2013 This city is one for culture and art buffs because, as Smart Travel Tips notes, it has possibly the highest concentration of art galleries and museums in the U.S., and they are either within a reasonable walking distance or short drive from the town square. The rich cultural history means great local cuisine too, all with a mild climate perfect for seniors.\u000a\u000a5. Williamsburg, Virginia \u2013 With attractions to suit any budget and any activity level, this historic city offers plenty of golf, museums, and shopping. It is even a better value in the off-season says CBS News and there are plenty of senior discounts offered.\u000a\u000aTip: The Little-Known Way to Retire and Live the Good Life

aVWith Donald Trump vacationing at one of his golf resorts, the rest of us may have a chance to relax. But in truth, it's more like a short break in a continuing nightmare, with just enough time to turn on the light, look at the clock and ponder where we are before the nightmare envelopes us again.\u000a\u000aWhat can we ponder that will make all of this a bit less frightening? For one thing, it could be far worse. Trump could have fulfilled his campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, lock up Hillary Clinton, build a wall and throw out all immigrants without papers.\u000a\u000aBy now, he might have confused so many Americans about the truth that most of us would believe the words coming out of his mouth. Hell, by now he could have incited another civil war.\u000a\u000aActually, very little has happened. He's huffed and puffed, threatened and fumed, yet almost none of it has found its way into concrete laws. And maybe it never will: The typical "honeymoon" enjoyed by new presidents is over for him. His first hundred days came and went, almost without a trace.\u000a\u000aAnother thing is that Trump's "favorables," as pollsters call them, continue to tumble into territory never before seen at this stage of a presidency. Only about a third of the country still supports him; the opinions of the rest range from bad to awful. And Trump's credibility is shot.\u000a\u000aEven Republicans in Congress are now more willing to buck him. (Some are even talking about fixing what needs fixing in Obamacare.) Meanwhile, special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury with the power to subpoena Trump's financial records. Didn't Trump hint he'd fire Mueller if he did this? Wouldn't firing Mueller be the beginning of the end?\u000a\u000aTrump has also ignited a prairie fire of grassroots activism, almost all of it against him. Across the country, people who were never politically active are rolling up their sleeves and getting involved \u2014 attending congressional town hall meetings, writing letters to the editors of their local papers, organizing for the 2018 midterm elections. Some are even running for office themselves.\u000a\u000aThis outburst of political effort resisting Trump has no parallel in recent history. John F. Kennedy asked Americans to ponder what they might do for America; Donald Trump is getting them to actually do it.\u000a\u000aIn the middle of the night, one's thoughts also turn to where we are in life. Trump was born in 1946, the same year Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and, coincidentally, Clinton's own special prosecutor, Ken Starr, were born. And yours truly. We are all, shall we say, beyond our prime. There's only so much damage a septuagenarian can do from here on.\u000a\u000aTo put it another way, a few weeks from now I'll be returning to the classroom and a new crop of college freshmen. They were born in or around 1998. Chronologically, they're as far removed from Trump and the rest of us early boomers as we were, when we went to college, from Americans born in 1894. Which is to say, a very long way.\u000a\u000aSo unless Trump brings on a nuclear war that ends life on the planet as we know it, he is unlikely to have much influence on the lives of my incoming freshmen. His first (and perhaps only) term in office will be over when they're just 22. Think of being 22 years old and having your whole life ahead of you, without Trump.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Trump has been a boon to ethicists, moral philosophers and the rest of us who tend to wake up in the night and think about big scary things. Trump has brought the nation back to first principles.\u000a\u000aMost presidents spur debates over issues such as whether the economy needs a more stimulative fiscal policy, or whether America should support the expansion of NATO to the Baltic states. Trump has made us debate whether the U.S. economy can exist separate from the rest of the world, and whether we should even belong to NATO.\u000a\u000aSome presidents get us talking about civil rights and civil liberties. Trump has got us talking about democracy versus tyranny.\u000a\u000aI don't mean to minimize the damage he's already done. I don't remember America ever being so angry and divided \u2014 not even through the battles over civil rights and Vietnam. Trump has also demeaned the office of the presidency, licensed bigotry, appointed absurdly incompetent people to his Cabinet, violated every ethics and conflict-of-interest rule imaginable, reduced America's influence and moral authority in the world, and may even have conspired with a foreign power to rig a presidential election.\u000a\u000aThat's a lot in just under seven months. He deserves a vacation.\u000a\u000aBut taking the slightly longer view, the nation is still functioning. Our democratic institutions have so far withstood the test and remain strong, just as the Founding Fathers intended. Presidential power is checked and balanced, so the current occupant of the Oval Office is hemmed in. Plus, our friends and allies around the world understand that our condition is temporary. America will be back.\u000a\u000aIt has been an incredibly stressful time, but most of us are OK. In fact, I'd venture to say most Americans remain optimistic \u2014 especially my incoming college freshmen, who have their whole lives ahead of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRobert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few," now available in paperback.

"It is his if he wants it," one of the officials said.\u000a\u000aOne White House official said that Barrack would like to have some authority in South America and "really try to set some wider policy," Politico reports.\u000a\u000aBarrack has encouraged Trump to govern in a manner that appeals to more people than just his base supporters.\u000a\u000aTrump "usually leaves his conversations with Barrack on the right track," one of the sources told Politico.\u000a\u000aThe president addressed the ambassadorship in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal interview, in which Trump asked Wall Street Journal reporters if they liked Barrack.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Call him up, tell him I'm giving it to him," Trump said in the interview to reporters, according to a transcript obtained by Politico.\u000a\u000aBarrack helped introduce Trump to his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, according to an April report in The New York Times.

aVThe S&P 500 index had its biggest one-day drop in almost three months on Thursday as investors fled riskier assets, with technology stocks leading the charge, in response to an increasingly aggressive exchange of threats between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aU.S. equities steepened their losses late in the session after President Donald Trump said his earlier warnings to North Korea may not have been tough enough. He also said the nuclear-armed nation should be "very, very nervous" if it even thinks about attacking the United States or its allies.\u000a\u000aTrump was responding to North Korea's claim it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aInvestors have been jittery about North Korea since Tuesday when Trump said any threats from Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000aThe S&P's record close on Aug. 7 likely helped fuel its latest sell-off.\u000a\u000a"When investors are optimistic to the extreme, it means that most of their money is already in the market and there's no more money coming in," Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida.\u000a\u000aThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 204.69 points, or 0.93 percent, at 21,844.01, the S&P 500 lost 35.81 points, or 1.45 percent, to end the session at 2,438.21 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 135.46 points, or 2.13 percent, to 6,216.87.\u000a\u000aThe last time the S&P closed down more than 1 percent was May 17 when it fell 1.8 percent. It is now on track for its biggest weekly drop since the week before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.\u000a\u000aThe technology sector was the S&P's biggest drag with a 2.2 percent drop. It has been the leading S&P gainer so far this year, making it particularly vulnerable to a decline.\u000a\u000a"Since these are the stocks that have been in the spotlight the most, they tend to have the most volatility upwards and downwards," said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer of Aviance Capital Management in Sarasota, Florida.\u000a\u000aInvestors instead turned to safe-haven assets such as gold, pushing it to a two-month high, and the Japanese yen rose.\u000a\u000aThe utilities index, often seen as a bond proxy because of its companies' slow reliable growth and high dividends, was the only S&P sector that ended the day up, showing a 0.25 percent gain.\u000a\u000aThe CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its highest since the election.\u000a\u000aMacy's shares closed down 10.2 percent and Kohl's fell almost 6 percent as the companies continued to report a drop in quarterly same-store sales, stoking concerns that their turnarounds may still be a long way off.\u000a\u000aSelling was broad. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 6-to-1; on Nasdaq, a 3.60-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\u000a\u000aAbout 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.25 billion average for the last 20 days.

aVStarting plants from tiny seeds indoors before the arrival of spring is one of the most gratifying things you can do as a gardener. Besides the potential to save a lot of money, it is fun to watch your own healthy plants develop. Starting seeds indoors is easy with these tips.\u000a\u000a1. Self-watering system \u2013 In order to germinate, seeds and soil need consistent moisture. Because it is all too easy to forget to water when you\u2019re busy, a self-watering system can be invaluable, says Tomato Envy. Not only will you not need to worry about daily watering, but the system delivers the water from below for better plant health.\u000a\u000aTIP: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a2. Get the right soil \u2013 Never use ordinary garden soil, advises Gardener\u2019s Supply, as it can contain all sorts of fungus and disease that can kill your seedlings. Instead, try a fresh sterile seed starting mix.\u000a\u000a3. Keep seeds warm- According to Fine Gardening, most seeds germinate most reliably in soil that is between 65 and 75 degrees. If you are serious about success, try using a heat mat specifically made for starting seeds. It is placed under the containers and will gently warm the soil to optimal temperature.\u000a\u000a4. Feed your seedlings \u2013 Most seed starting mixes contain almost no nutrients to feed your new plants. When seedlings first emerge, their first sets of leaves, called cotyledons, will feed the plant. Once the first true sets of leaves appear, you will need to feed with a diluted, half-strength liquid fertilizer, says Fine Gardening.\u000a\u000aALERT: The Secret Water for Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a5. Use a grow light and timer \u2013 While you can start seeds in a sunny windowsill, Tomato Envy says the results are more reliable and the plants are more robust when grown under a fluorescent grow light. These lights help produce sturdy plants. Set the lights on a timer so the plants get between 14 and 18 hours of light each day.\u000a\u000a6. Harden off \u2013 Hardening off is the process by which plants are gradually acclimated to natural sunlight and the outdoors\u2019 fluctuating temperatures before they are planted in the garden, says Fine Gardening. Place plants in direct sunlight for just a short time at first and gradually increase the time over at least a three-day period.\u000a\u000aIMPORTANT: Until There's a Wall, There Is the US Border Patrol.

John McCain, R-Ariz., said Thursday he wants to see the Trump administration ramp up its efforts in Afghanistan to both end the ongoing war there and prevent the Islamic State (ISIS) or another group from taking over territory once U.S. forces leave.\u000a\u000aMcCain announced in a press release his intentions to tack on a detailed amendment to the defense authorization bill that would significantly increase America's Afghan war efforts.\u000a\u000a"The goal of this strategy is to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a sanctuary for terrorists to plot and conduct attacks against America, our allies, or our interests," McCain said.\u000a\u000a"To accomplish this goal, we need an integrated civil-military approach to bolster U.S. counterterrorism efforts, strengthen the capability and capacity of the Afghan government and security forces, and intensify diplomatic efforts to facilitate a negotiated peace process in Afghanistan in cooperation with regional partners."\u000a\u000aDetails of the plan include preventing the Taliban from disrupting or overthrowing the Afghan government, helping negotiate a peace process in Afghanistan, and increasing the number of U.S. counterterrorism forces in the country.\u000a\u000aMcCain criticized President Donald Trump last week after it was reported that Trump berated America's top general in Afghanistan and was considering dismissing him because "we aren't winning, we are losing."\u000a\u000aMcCain pledged his support of military commanders on the ground and said Trump is at fault, not the military.\u000a\u000a"Our commanders-in-chief, not our commanders in the field, are responsible for this failure," McCain said. "I urge the president to resolve the differences within his administration as soon as possible and decide on a policy and strategy that can achieve our national security interests in Afghanistan and the region."

aVGolf is perceived as a quiet, refined sport and one that requires civility among its players. Even if you\u2019re not new to the game, it is a good idea to brush up on your golf etiquette from time to time. If you are just starting out, it is essential to learn these important rules before you tee off.\u000a\u000a1. Arrive early - Golfers who arrive less than 15 minutes before their scheduled tee time can impose delays on the rest of the tee sheet for the day. Golf Digest suggests arriving 30 minutes early so you have time to check in, warm up and start your game relaxed.\u000a\u000a2. Turn off your phone \u2013 It is annoying to hear others\u2019 conversations on the course, but when a loud ringtone happens right during your backswing, it can throw off your shot. At the very least, silence your phone\u2019s settings. If you must take a call on the course, move away from other players, talk quietly and keep it brief says Golf Digest.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a3. Watch the line \u2013 According to Gray Box, the \u201cline\u201d is the path a ball will take from its position on the green to the hole. When you walk on someone else\u2019s line, your feet can leave imprints that are distracting. Be mindful of the lines of your fellow players and avoid them.\u000a\u000a4. Avoid slow play \u2013 Watch the pace of the group in front of you and try to keep pace with them, advises Golf. Walk at a reasonable pace between shots, and if you are not ready to play when it is your turn, encourage another player to shoot ahead of you.\u000a\u000a5. Avoid distracting others \u2013 When others are shooting, don\u2019t stand in their field of sight where you are likely to distract them. Golf advises being silent and stopping all conversation with others while someone else is concentrating on their shot.\u000a\u000aPOLL:\u000a\u000aTiger or Jack? Who Is A Better Golfer?\u000a\u000a6. Don\u2019t hog the practice green \u2013 Unless you are by yourself, limit balls on the practice green to two says Golf Digest. Any more than two balls can be obnoxious and limits space for other golfers.\u000a\u000a7. Keep your cool \u2013 It is understandable to get frustrated and show emotion when your game isn\u2019t going well.

aVDeputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka pushed back on a report Thursday afternoon that seemed to suggest he was admonishing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for discussing military matters.\u000a\u000a"I never said that \u2013 that's fake news 101," Gorka said during an appearance on Fox News. "I have the audio."\u000a\u000aGorka was referring to comments he made during a BBC Radio program, which, according to The Hill, included this soundbite:\u000a\u000a"You should listen to the president. The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical."\u000a\u000aThe Department of State later weighed in, with spokesperson Heather Nauert defending her boss as America's top diplomat.\u000a\u000a"He's a Cabinet secretary," Nauert said, noting she had not yet heard or read Gorka's remarks herself. "He's the fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick."\u000a\u000aGorka explained to Fox News he was referring to the media asking Tillerson about military matters, in this case the situation with North Korea.\u000a\u000a"I said for reporters to force our chief diplomat, the amazing Rex Tillerson, to give details of military options is nonsensical," Gorka said. "He is the secretary of state. That means you don't understand what the words secretaries of state means. It's fake news. Classic example."\u000a\u000a"I was admonishing the journalist or the fake news complex that are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they're demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state," Gorka added. "That's why we have a Department of Defense."

aVSpecial:\u000a\u000aTop Doc Shares Simple Daily Habits for Healthy Prostate\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aThe One Thing Your Prostate Needs Every Morning\u000a\u000aRobotic surgery is a method of treating prostate cancer that allows doctors to make several small incisions in the abdomen to remove the prostate cancer with as little damage to surrounding tissue as possible. The surgeon controls robotic arms from a panel near the operating table.The robotic procedure results in less pain and blood loss as well as quicker recovery time than in traditional methods in which a surgeon makes a single long incision to remove the prostate and surrounding tissues.Robotic surgery is also called robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or RALRP. According to the American Cancer Society , it has similar results for the patient to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, or LRP, which includes several small incisions using an instrument with a tiny video camera to let the surgeon see inside the abdomen.Robotic surgery has advantages over laparoscopic methods, da Vinci Surgery reported . More patients appear to return to normal erectile function following a 12-month checkup. Erectile dysfunction is a common concern for men undergoing prostate surgery.The da Vinci system provides a clearer vision for the surgeon to operate with precision, dexterity and control, da Vinci Surgery noted. It allows more precise removal of cancer tissue. This results in a shorter operation than with traditional laparoscopy. There is a lower risk of complications. Patients also find a quicker return of urinary continence.The precision of robotic surgery helps to avoid damaging or removing healthy prostate tissue and clearing away the prostate cancer, according to Dr. David B. Samadi, chief of robotic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Other laparoscopic methods allow a lower resolution image through the small video camera, causing a limited field of vision for the surgeon, Samadi explained.With better vision through robotic surgery, the surgeon has an easier time removing malignant tissue with limited interference and harm to surrounding tissue. The potential for scarring is lessened and patients have a shorter recovery period.The risk of infection at the incision site is reduced through the da Vinci system. The size of the incision is smaller than with traditional methods. Fewer and smaller incisions with robotic surgery lead to little or no visible scarring. Scar tissue build-up may affect the full function of the prostate.The success of robotic surgery may depend on the experience of the surgeon, according to the Urology Care Foundation , which noted that the more surgeries a doctor has done, the better the chance he or she will have in performing the surgery with a reduced risk of complications.

aVPresident Donald Trump's savvy use of Twitter has spawned a grassroots nation of followers who pump out tens of thousands of tweets every day in support of #MAGA, Politico reported.\u000a\u000aThe genesis in 2015 of private rooms on Twitter provided a home for ardent supporters of Trump who are committed to amplifying the president's message through tweeting and, especially, retweeting.\u000a\u000aRetweeting is "the cardinal rule," Politico reported.\u000a\u000aThe invite-only rooms hold up to 50 people, and many people are in multiple rooms, sometimes 20 or more.\u000a\u000a"The whole idea is to share tweets and retweet people in the group\u2019s tweets," Brian Fraser, who manages one of the "Patriots United" rooms, told Politico.\u000a\u000aSince last summer, Fraser's followers increased from 13,000 to nearly 170,000 today.\u000a\u000aIt's common for one person to tweet and retweet hundreds of times daily.\u000a\u000a"This is clearly tapping into a group of people that are zealous, have a lot of time on their hands, and are tenacious as can be," Dr. Alan Rosenblatt, an expert in the history of online political campaigning, told Politico.

aVRetirement is a major, exciting life event, but it can also be stressful if you\u2019re not fully prepared. Here are some things to do well in advance of your planned retirement to make the transition easier.\u000a\u000a1. Define retirement \u2013 The idea of a traditional retirement spent sitting on a porch swing every day is outdated. Today\u2019s retirees are active, and many wish to continue some kind of fulfilling work whether it\u2019s part-time employment or volunteer work. Mark Dorman, CEO of the Dorman Group, tells U.S. News and World Report that retirees should \u201cdefinitely avoid doing nothing.\u201d Give some thought to your expectations.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a2. Cut expenses \u2013 Begin looking for ways to decrease financial obligations. Begin by listing your monthly expenses, be honest, and figure out ways to save money. AARP recommends eliminating as much debt as possible since this will mean less monthly expenses against your retirement income.\u000a\u000a3. Research Social Security \u2013 For many people, Social Security will be needed to supplement retirement savings. AARP says that it pays to wait as long as possible to begin receiving your benefits since the payouts are larger. Waiting until full retirement age can also benefit your spouse if they survive you.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000a4. Visit your doctor \u2013 While you still have employer-sponsored health insurance, visit your doctors and evaluate your overall health. Address any issues you may have been putting off like dental work, hearing tests, and eye exams, advises HuffPost.\u000a\u000a5. Make housing decisions \u2013 You will need to live somewhere, so determine the most practical choice. If you would like to downsize or move to another city, do it before you retire. HuffPost says it may be impossible to get a new mortgage if you can no longer show lenders you have a regular income.\u000a\u000a6. Plan for the unexpected \u2013 You will stress less in retirement if you have already thought about how you will handle the expenses if you suddenly need a new hot water heater or if you become ill, says AARP. Have a plan ready before you quit working.\u000a\u000a7. Stay connected \u2013 Full-time work will no longer provide a social outlet, HuffPost says, so think about ways you can connect with others. For some, hobbies and clubs work well and for others, picking up part-time work is the answer.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack

aVThe attorney general's office sued Purdue Pharma on Tuesday, alleging that the drug manufacturer has continued its deceptive marketing of OxyContin in a state that has been called the "ground zero" of the opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000aIn a civil complaint, the state alleges that Purdue Pharma has downplayed the drug's risk of addiction, overstated its effectiveness, claimed it is nearly impossible to abuse and failed to report suspicious prescribers. It's the latest in a string of lawsuits by state, county and local governments accusing prescription opioid manufacturers of fraud and deceptive marketing.\u000a\u000aThe attorney general's office in New Hampshire has been investigating half a dozen drug companies and their marketing practices for two years. During that time, the opioid problem has continued to grow. Nearly 500 people died of overdoses in 2016 \u2014 a nearly ten-fold increase since 2000. In October, the deputy administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration called the state "ground zero" for the crisis.\u000a\u000a"To defeat the epidemic, we must stop creating new users, and part of that is making sure these highly addictive and dangerous drugs are marketed truthfully and without deception and in such a way as not to minimize addiction risks or overstate benefits to patients," said Deputy Attorney General Ann Rice.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for Cranbury, New Jersey-based Purdue Pharma said the company vigorously denies the allegations, though it shares New Hampshire's concerns about the opioid crisis and is committed to finding solutions.\u000a\u000a"OxyContin accounts for less than 2% of the opioid analgesic prescription market nationally, but we are an industry leader in the development of abuse-deterrent technology, advocating for the use of prescription drug monitoring programs and supporting access to Naloxone \u2014 all important components for combating the opioid crisis," said Robert Josephson.\u000a\u000aIn 2007, Purdue and three of its executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges for deceptive conduct, but the New Hampshire lawsuit alleges that it has continued the same practices. While the company has touted its coordination with law enforcement, in New Hampshire it provided a list of suspicious providers only when asked specifically by the state's board of medicine, the lawsuit states. And the names all came from the board's investigations or media reports, not from Purdue's sales data or information about its marketing visits.\u000a\u000aAccording to the lawsuit, Purdue had four to six sales representatives who saw six or seven prescribers a day in New Hampshire from 2013 to 2015. One prescriber told prosecutors the message she received was that opioids were "safe, safe, safe, safe."\u000a\u000aPurdue also told prescribers that patients who seemed to be misusing opioids were experiencing "pseudoaddiction," the lawsuit alleges. The company's marketing materials suggested that "illicit drug use and deception" might reflect untreated pain rather than addiction, thus encouraging physicians with potentially addicted patients to respond by prescribing more opioids, the state argues.\u000a\u000aDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan lashed out at opioid drugmakers on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"The role that drug makers have played in contributing to the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis that is devastating communities in New Hampshire and states across the country is abundantly clear," she said in a statement. "Through improper marketing of prescription opioids, drug makers have long been running a campaign of deception to mask how addictive these products really are.\u000a\u000aHassan said even though companies are fined "these issues continue to persist, and it is time for real change to reverse the tide of this horrific epidemic that stems in large part from the misuse and abuse of prescription opioids."\u000a\u000aThe New Hampshire case comes less than two months after Missouri's attorney general sued Purdue and two other pharmaceutical companies. Ohio's attorney general filed a similar lawsuit against five companies in May, and three district attorneys and the guardians of a baby born dependent on drugs filed a lawsuit in June against three companies in Tennessee.

aVThe Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank, sued Seattle after its city council passed a measure in July that would place a 2.25 percent income tax on wealthier residents.\u000a\u000aThe tax was estimated to affect the 9,000, or 2 percent, of the city\u2019s taxpayers \u2013 people who make more than $250,000, or $500,000 for couples filing jointly.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit, filed on behalf of 19 Seattle citizens, alleges the proposed tax violates the state constitution and restrictions on cities to impose income taxes, The Wall Street Journal reported. Another group called the Opportunity for All Coalition, founded by Seattle venture capitalist Matt McIlwain, filed a lawsuit the same day, the newspaper said.\u000a\u000aWashington is one of seven U.S. states without an income tax, and the liberal-leaning state has had a longstanding aversion to taxing income. The legal battle over Seattle\u2019s proposed tax is seen as a litmus test for the how the state\u2019s politics have changed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis tax is illegal and we are confident an independent judiciary is going to uphold the law, is going to uphold 100 years of precedent,\u201d David Dewhirst, litigation counsel for the Freedom Foundation, told the WSJ.\u000a\u000aThe state\u2019s Supreme Court in 1993 struck down a statewide income tax as unconstitutional. The state constitution requires property be taxed at a uniform rate, which the court said applied to income in turning down the tax.\u000a\u000aTax supporters say the rich need to pay their fair share. The state\u2019s poorest 20 percent of residents, or those making less than $21,000 a year, pay 16.8 percent of their income, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group.\u000a\u000aThe top 1 percent, or those making $507,000 or more, pay 2.4% of their income, the group said.\u000a\u000aThe Seattle economy growing and joblessness is below the national average of 4.3 percent, but soaring housing prices are also blamed for growing homelessness.\u000a\u000aThe tax is forecast to bring in $140 million for the city \u2013 assuming that businesses don\u2019t pick up and leave. The city passed a $15 minimum wage that has hurt the poorest workers, according to a study.\u000a\u000aA University of Washington team studying the law's effects found that the law boosted pay in low-wage jobs since taking effect in 2015. But it also caused a 9 percent reduction in hours worked, The Seattle Times reported. For an average low-wage Seattle worker, that's a loss of about $125 per month, the study said.\u000a\u000a"If you're a low-skilled worker with one of those jobs, $125 a month is a sizable amount of money," said Mark Long, one of the authors, told the Associated Press. "It can be the difference between being able to pay your rent and not being able to pay your rent."

aVThe Trump administration is considering reducing the annual $1 million mortgage deduction cap for U.S. homeowners as a part of its broader tax reform, despite earlier promises to protect the tax advantage, Politico reported.\u000a\u000aPolitico said the popular deduction came up this week at a White House roundtable with real estate industry representatives led by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. The publication quoted an attendee as saying Cohn was willing to "ruffle some feathers" by putting everything on the table.\u000a\u000aThe Internal Revenue Service says homeowners can deduct all interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. Lowering the mortgage deduction cap could help pay for major tax cuts for businesses and individuals that Republicans view as crucial for driving U.S. economic growth.\u000a\u000aBut the White House pushed back on the notion that its position has changed.\u000a\u000a"As we've said since we introduced our principles in April, we intend to protect the homeownership deductions," White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said.\u000a\u000aCohn told Bloomberg TV Friday that the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate should be more in line with the 24 percent average rate among other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\u000a\u000a"We cannot be substantially higher than the OECD average tax rate out there," he said. "We've got to get in line with the rest of the world, we've got to entice capital to be invested in the United States."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump wants to cut the corporate rate far lower to 15 percent, a level that Republicans in Congress view as unlikely. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters this week it would be a challenge to get the rate to 25 percent.\u000a\u000aIn a separate Friday interview on Fox Business Network, Cohn said the administration and Congress are committed to get as low a rate as possible for businesses.\u000a\u000aTwo congressional tax committees are drafting tax legislation that is expected to be unveiled in September. Republicans hope to pass the bill before the end of 2017.\u000a\u000aCongress faces a packed legislative agenda when lawmakers return to Washington in September after their August break, including the task of raising the debt ceiling before October, when the Treasury Department is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity.\u000a\u000aCohn told Fox the administration is well aware of the calendar and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is working to ensure the debt ceiling gets raised.

"I don't they're living up to the spirit of the agreement."

aVNorth Korea has announced a detailed plan to launch a salvo of ballistic missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to U.S. bombers. If carried out, it would be the North's most provocative missile launch to date.\u000a\u000aThe announcement Thursday warned that the North is finalizing a plan to fire four of its Hwasong-12 missiles over Japan and into waters around the tiny island, which hosts 7,000 U.S. military personnel on two main bases and has a population of 160,000.\u000a\u000aJapan and South Korea vowed a strong reaction if the North were to go through with the plan.\u000a\u000aIt said the plan, which involves the missiles hitting waters 30 to 40 kilometers (19 to 25 miles) from the island, could be sent to leader Kim Jong Un for approval within a week or so. It would be up to Kim whether the move is actually carried out.\u000a\u000aIt is unclear whether \u2014 or exactly why \u2014 North Korea would risk firing missiles so close to U.S. territory. Such a launch would almost compel the United States to attempt an intercept and possibly generate further escalation.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, no stranger to bluffing, frequently uses extremely bellicose rhetoric with warnings of military action to keep its adversaries on their heels. It generally couches its threats with language stating it will not attack the United States unless it has been attacked first or has determined an attack is imminent.\u000a\u000aBut the statement raised worries amid threats from both sides.\u000a\u000aFollowing reports that U.S. intelligence suggests the North might be able to pair a nuclear warhead with a missile capable of reaching targets on the United States mainland, Trump warned North Korea that "it faces retaliation with fire and fury unlike any the world has seen before."\u000a\u000aPyongyang, meanwhile, has been louder in its complaints against a new and tough round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, with strong U.S. backing, and Washington's use of Guam as a staging ground for its stealth bombers, which could be used to attack North Korea and are a particularly sore point with the ruling regime in Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aIts reported plan is extremely specific, suggesting it is actually plotting a launch.\u000a\u000aThe report said the Hwasong-12 rockets would fly over Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures in Japan and travel "1,065 seconds before hitting the waters 30 to 40 kilometers away from Guam." It said the Korean People's Army Strategic Force will finalize the plan by mid-August, present it to Kim Jong Un and "wait for his order."\u000a\u000a"We keep closely watching the speech and behavior of the U.S.," it said.\u000a\u000aSuch a move would not merely be a test launch, but a demonstration of military capabilities that could easily lead to severe consequences.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's military responded by saying North Korea will face a "stern and strong" response from Washington and Seoul. Taking it a step further, Japan's Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told parliament a missile attack on the U.S. territory would be a Japanese national emergency because it would threaten Japan's existence as a nation.\u000a\u000aIf North Korea were to actually carry it out \u2014 even if it aimed at hitting the waters off Guam and not the island itself \u2014 that would clearly pose a potential threat to U.S. territory and put the United States in a much more complicated situation than it has been during previous missile launches.\u000a\u000aGuam lies about 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) from the Korean Peninsula, and it's extremely unlikely Kim's government would risk annihilation with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens. It's also unclear how reliable North Korea's missiles would be against such a distant target, but no one was writing off the danger completely.\u000a\u000aWashington has been testing its missile defenses in response to the North's stepped-up development and the current escalation of tensions could lead to pressure for the U.S. military to try to shoot down the North's missiles in midflight if they are heading toward Guam.\u000a\u000aThat would likely open up a set of very major problems, including the possibility of both a very high-profile failure or a miscalculation of Washington's intentions and a more deadly pre-emptive strike by the North \u2014 which has missiles able to hit Tokyo and conventional weapons that could devastate South Korea's capital of Seoul.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-12, which was revealed for the first time at a military parade in April, is an intermediate-range ballistic missile that is believed to have a radius of more than 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles). It can be fired from mobile launchers, making it hard to detect and destroy on the ground.\u000a\u000aBy launching a salvo of four, the North would be attempting to make it harder for the U.S. to intercept all of the incoming missiles. Its stated flight path over Japan is also very aggressive \u2014 it has recently tried to avoid flying over neighboring countries by shooting its missiles up at a very high angle to land in the ocean.\u000a\u000aWashington, meanwhile, has been giving out mixed signals about its intentions.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump was threatening annihilation and boasting from the New Jersey golf resort where he's vacationing that he has made the U.S. nuclear arsenal "far stronger and more powerful than ever before," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm the sense of crisis.\u000a\u000a"Americans should sleep well at night," Tillerson told reporters. "Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours."

aVJames J. Hamula, a Mormon church leader, was excommunicated and removed from his post Tuesday for the first time in nearly three decades.\u000a\u000aHamula was released from a mid-level leadership council based on disciplinary action by the religion's highest leaders, said Eric Hawkins, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u000a\u000aHawkins didn't say why Hamula was ousted, but the Utah-based church said it was not for apostasy, which refers to teaching inaccurate doctrine or publicly defying guidance from church leaders.\u000a\u000aEfforts to reach Hamula at listed phone numbers were not successful.\u000a\u000aThe last leader to be excommunicated was the late George P. Lee in 1989 after Lee, an American Indian, called Mormon leaders racist. The church said then that Lee was removed for "apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member of the church."\u000a\u000aThe last church leader removed before Lee was Richard R. Lyman, who was excommunicated in 1943 for adultery but baptized again 11 years later.\u000a\u000aHamula became a member of a group called the "General Authority Seventy" in 2008. It is a group of nearly 90 leaders that sit below the church president, his two counselors and two other levels of leaders.\u000a\u000aThey help run church operations by serving as a bridge between local lay leaders in Mormon congregations around the world and the top leaders working at church headquarters in Salt Lake City.\u000a\u000aHamula's removal is surprising because he was well-regarded and was even considered by some outside Mormon scholars as a possible candidate to join the high-level Quorum of the Twelve Apostles when the church was filling three vacancies in 2015, said Matthew Bowman, a Mormon scholar and history professor at Henderson State University.\u000a\u000aHamula was not chosen, but he was still considered an up-and-comer destined for more important assignments, Bowman said. In recent years, Hamula served in important roles as assistant executive director of church history and executive director of a department that reviews all documents published by the church.\u000a\u000a"He had a promising future," Bowman said.\u000a\u000aHis removal will likely be talked about among some of the nearly 16 million worldwide members of the Mormon religion, but it may not cause a huge stir because it may be the first time many have heard of Hamula, Bowman said.\u000a\u000aHamula was born in Long Beach, California, and is married with six children, according to his church biography. He was a lawyer until joining the leadership council in 2008.\u000a\u000aThat year, he gave a speech at a Mormon conference watched by millions about choosing good over evil.\u000a\u000a"Satan is marshaling every resource at his disposal to entice you into transgression," Hamula said. "He knows that if he can draw you into transgression, he may prevent you from serving a full-time mission, marrying in the temple, and securing your future children in the faith, all of which weakens not only you but the church."

aVU.S. employers hired more workers than expected in July and raised their wages, signs of labor market tightness that likely clears the way for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start shrinking its massive bond portfolio.\u000a\u000aThe Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs last month amid broad-based gains. June's employment gain was revised up to 231,000 from the previously reported 222,000.\u000a\u000aAverage hourly earnings increased nine cents, or 0.3 percent, in July after rising 0.2 percent in June. That was the biggest rise in five months. On a year-on-year basis, wages increased 2.5 percent for the fourth straight month.\u000a\u000a"The Fed set a low bar for balance sheet normalization to begin in September, and today's number cleared that bar with elan," said Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000aAlthough the economy is near full employment, wage growth has not been strong in part because many of the jobs being created are in low-wage sectors. Last month, restaurants and bars added 53,100 jobs.\u000a\u000aJuly's monthly increase in earnings could, however, offer Fed policymakers some assurance that inflation will gradually rise to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.\u000a\u000aEconomists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September. The Fed bought these securities to lower interest rates in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\u000a\u000aSluggish wage growth and the accompanying benign inflation, however, suggest the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year and its benchmark overnight interest rate is in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\u000a\u000aThe dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on the jobs report, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher.\u000a\u000aEconomists had forecast payrolls increasing by 183,000 jobs and wages rising 0.3 percent in July.\u000a\u000aRepublican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, cheered Friday's employment data. "Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun," Trump said on Twitter. "Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!"\u000a\u000aExcellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes, cutting regulation and boosting infrastructure spending.\u000a\u000aBut after six months in office the Trump administration has failed to pass any economic legislation and has yet to articulate a plan for much of its economic agenda.\u000a\u000aUNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS\u000a\u000aWage growth is crucial to sustaining the U.S. economic expansion after output increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, an acceleration from the January-March period's pedestrian 1.2 percent pace.\u000a\u000aThe economy also got a boost from another report on Friday showing a sharp drop in the trade deficit in June.\u000a\u000aThe unemployment rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.3 percent in July, matching a 16-year low touched in May. It has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year and is now at the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017.\u000a\u000a"Stable year-on-year wage growth should decrease the perceived risk of further slowing in wages and prices," said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York.\u000a\u000a"Strong payroll gains that place downward pressure on the post-crisis low unemployment rate will keep the center of the Fed comfortable with increasing policy rates in December."\u000a\u000aJuly's decline in the jobless rate came even as more people entered the labor force, underscoring job market strength.\u000a\u000aThe labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.9 percent. The share of the population that is employed climbed to 60.2 percent, matching an eight-year high touched in April.\u000a\u000aA broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 8.6 percent last month. This alternative gauge of unemployment hit a 9-1/2-year low in May.\u000a\u000aMonthly job growth this year has averaged 184,000, close to the 2016 average of 186,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\u000a\u000aManufacturing payrolls advanced by 16,000 jobs in July, the largest gain since February. Employment in the automobile sector rose by 1,600 despite slowing sales and bloated inventories that have forced manufacturers to cut back on production.\u000a\u000aU.S. auto sales fell 6.1 percent in July from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.73 million units. General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co have both said they will cut production in the second half of the year.\u000a\u000aConstruction payrolls rose 6,000 last month as hiring at homebuilding sites increased 5,100. The professional and business services sector added 49,000 workers last month.\u000a\u000aRetail employment rose by 900 as hiring at motor vehicle and parts dealerships as well as online retailers offset a drop of 10,000 in employment at clothing stores.\u000a\u000aCompanies like major online retailer Amazon are creating jobs at warehouses and distribution centers. Amazon this week held a series of job fairs to hire about 50,000 workers. Government payrolls rose by 4,000 in July.

aVBecause everyone is sensitive to criticism and most everyone gets criticized from time to time, here are three questions that you might ask yourself the next time someone criticizes you.\u000a\u000a1. Is the criticism I'm receiving valid?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. Is it partially valid?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. What might I have done differently in this situation to have avoided the criticism?\u000a\u000aBy asking these three questions of yourself, you put the criticism leveled against you in perspective. If you fine the criticism is valid or partially valid, change your behavior.\u000a\u000aIf after careful consideration, you find no validity in what was said, you might want to keep this third century B.C. story which was recounted by Will Durant in The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage in mind.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen a simpleton abused him, Buddha listened in silence; but when the man had finished, Buddha asked him: \u201cSon, if a man declined to accept a present made to him, to whom would it belong?\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cThe man answered: \u2018To him who offered it.'\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c'My son,' said Buddha, 'I decline to accept your abuse and request you keep it for yourself.'"\u000a\u000aCheck out Doris\u2019 latest books, \u201cThe Boy Whose Idea Could Feed the World\u201d as well as, \u201cThe Parent Teacher Discussion Guide.\u201d and "Thin Becomes You".

aVPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut legal immigration to the United States in half over the next decade is a rock-solid idea that will shore up the middle class and boost the economy, Michael Cutler, a former top Immigration and Naturalization Service special agent, told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000a"I hope it becomes law, I know there's too many politicians on both side of the aisle who are globalist. This isn't the left-right issue . . . This is about globalist versus populist. Donald Trump believes in sovereign borders," Cutler said to Newsmax's JD Hayworth.\u000a\u000a"To take the position of being pro-enforcement is not to take a position that's anti-immigrant. We admit more than 1 million lawful immigrants every year, the president says that's too much, let's cut it in half.\u000a\u000a"That would still make it, I would believe, the most generous immigration policy, admission policy, of any country on the planet."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

When you bring in workers from third-world countries in adequate numbers and they bring with them expectations of third-world wages and working conditions, you turn America into a third-world country," Cutler said.\u000a\u000a"We need to reverse the trend, we need to bolster our middle class, which is the heart and soul of America.\u000a\u000a"[The middle class] provides that beacon for folks living below the poverty line to know they can aspire and indeed live up to those aspirations and become part of the middle class and be economically successful in America."

aVLeah Remini said a Scientology investigation by federal agencies is needed because of wrongdoing at the celebrity-rich church, The Hollywood Reporter reported. "I'm talking about the FBI, the police, the Department of Justice, the IRS," she said.\u000a\u000aRemini, who has been a harsh critic of the Church of Scientology after leaving the religion in 2013, earned an Emmy nomination for her series "Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath." A second season of the series is scheduled to begin next week, THR noted.\u000a\u000aThe A&E series will move into more of an "activist" role, the former "King of Queens" star told THR, saying she hopes to present enough evidence to spark a federal investigation of Scientology.\u000a\u000a"If the FBI ever wanted to get anywhere, all they would need to do is do a raid,\u201d Remini said. \u201cEverybody who's ever gone to Scientology has folders, and anything you've ever said is contained in those folders."\u000a\u000aRemini has charged the Church of Scientology with sexual and physical abuse. Scientology officials told Rolling Stone magazine her claims were "false allegations in an effort to garner publicity.\u000a\u000aAs for Remini calling for an investigation, \u201cit is pure balderdash. The Church is a religious institution committed to our religious, social and humanitarian missions."\u000a\u000aRemini\u2019s television series followed her 2015 book, "Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology," in which she chronicled her time at the church.\u000a\u000a"We've heard from people who were inside Scientology, who told me, 'I watched your show. I went on the Internet. I decided to leave,'" Remini said, per Rolling Stone. "We get tons of those. And it's those moments that you go, 'OK \u2013 we're doing something.'"\u000a\u000aTHR noted that Remini is returning to prime time television on the cast of CBS's "Kevin Can Wait," reuniting her with her former "King of Queens" partner Kevin James.\u000a\u000a"I'm just happy to be laughing again," Remini said.

aVDemocrats want Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., to "go away and stop being so public," according to one member of the Democratic National Committee.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee, has been embroiled in scandals since the presidential election, when leaked emails showed her apparent preference for nominee Hillary Clinton over Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u000a\u000a"We wish she would go away and stop being so public by doubling down on negative stories," DNC member Nikki Barnes told Politico on Thursday.\u000a\u000aWasserman Schultz has also taken fire for her defense of IT staffer Imran Awan, who's been under federal investigation for theft since February. She fired Awan in late July after he was arrested on charges of mortgage fraud while at an airport intending to leave for Pakistan. She repeatedly defended Awan even after two dozen of her colleagues fired his associates who were also under investigation.\u000a\u000a"After details of the investigation were reviewed with us, my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling," Wasserman Schultz said in a written statement, according to The Miami Herald. "Upon learning of his arrest, he was terminated."\u000a\u000aBarnes added that Wasserman Schultz left the party "in shambles" as chair, and that she continues to draw negative attention to the party as it attempts to rebuild.\u000a\u000a"This adds to Debbie being re-branded as the Democrats' disastrous destruction," she said. "Those of us on the DNC know we have to rebrand ourselves and earn the people's trust. And unfortunately Debbie's name does not scream trust. It screams power. It screams limited access. It screams WikiLeaks now. DNC lawsuit. It screams a lot of negative things to the public. That's not how we want to rebrand ourselves."

aVShares of department store chains Macy's Inc. and Kohl's Corp. tumbled on Thursday as the companies reported a drop in quarterly same-store sales, stoking concerns that their turnaround may still be a long way off.\u000a\u000aWhile the declines in same-store sales were not as bad as feared, gross margins at both the companies slipped as they continued to rely on discounts and promotions to woo customers back to their stores.\u000a\u000aMacy's gross margins fell to 40.3 percent from 40.9 percent a year earlier, while those of Kohl's fell to 39.4 percent from 39.5 percent.\u000a\u000aA beat was pretty widely expected, but the longer term concerns of department stores in secular decline remain unresolved, Susquehanna analyst Bill Dreher said.\u000a\u000a"Negative comps still reflect market share losses, most likely to off-price retailers TJX Cos. Inc. and Ross Stores," Dreher said.\u000a\u000aSales at stores open more than 12 months fell 2.5 percent at Macy's and 0.4 percent at Kohl's. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had estimated a 3 percent drop at Macy's and 1.5 percent at Kohl's.\u000a\u000aDepartment store operators have been struggling with declining mall traffic and tough online competition, especially from Amazon.com Inc, leading to a tenth straight quarter of falling same-store sales at Macy's and sixth-straight quarter at Kohl's.\u000a\u000aIn response, the department store chains have been cutting costs by shutting stores, selling or leasing real estate and reducing inventory.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, other experts have been warning of the long-term economic threat from a retail "apocalypse" or "armageddon."\u000a\u000aTo boost traffic, Macy's is revamping its beauty business, investing in Backstage, its off-price discount business, and improving its e-commerce site, while Kohl's has been adding more national brands such as Under Armour Inc to its stores.\u000a\u000aNet income attributable to Macy's shareholders rose to $116 million, or 38 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 29 from $11 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier.\u000a\u000aThe company recorded impairment charges of $249 million in the year-earlier period.\u000a\u000aExcluding items, Macy's earned 48 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\u000a\u000aNet sales fell 5.4 percent to $5.55 billion, but beat analysts' estimates of $5.52 billion.\u000a\u000aKohl's reported a 1 percent fall in net sales, its sixth straight quarter of decline.\u000a\u000aShares of Macy's were down 6.8 percent at $21.47 on Thursday, while Kohl's stock price fell 8.8 percent to $38.21 in morning trading.

From their legal and professional troubles \u2014 domestic violence, steroid use, or gambling \u2014 to their over-the-top consumerist lifestyles complete with high-priced luxury vehicles and plenty of bling, the public is privy to every detail.Because of that, we often don't hear about those athletes that make religion their focus. Many of America's top professional sports figures rank God as No. 1 in their lives, and they're not afraid to show their dedication and religious beliefs both on and off the field.Here, Newsmax has assembled a list of the top 50 athletes and coaches who have deep religious faiths and live out their religions as the major light of their lives.\u2014 The Heisman Trophy winner who went on to quarterback for the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, and New England Patriots made it a practice to kneel in prayer before games, so much so that it sparked a new trend \u2014 "Tebowing." But Tebow's deep Christian faith goes well beyond that, from his preaching and supporting Evangelists in the Philippines to maintaining his virginity until marriage. "I still honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, because at the end of the day, that's what's important, win or lose," he has said. "We need to get back to one nation under God and be role models for kids."\u2014 The USA World Cup soccer team captain and Texan is a devout Roman Catholic, who has said, "My faith in Christ is what gives me confidence for the future. I know that through both good times and bad, He is faithful and will watch over me."\u2014 The five-time Major League Baseball All-Star and Texas Rangers outfielder came clean about his struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol in his autobiography "Beyond Belief," and said he credits God for saving his life and career. "It's a God thing," he says.\u2014 The former Dallas Cowboys linebacker turned to God after serious injuries threatened his career. In a video for non-profit group "I Am Second," he said: "God just had a different plan. He blessed me to be the comeback player of the year in the NFL. You have to realize that there is a God and he does show up and do miracles. My faith in Jesus is everything. It is my life."\u2014 The mixed martial arts champion briefly turned to God at the age of 20 after a neck injury nearly halted his career in 2004, but he later backslid. After his sister was kidnapped in Brazil, raped, and murdered, he said, "My heart was hard and getting bitter. I wanted a solution to my pain. I started praying. God spoke to my heart. That was my biggest touch with a true relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Now I have a great family and a great relationship with God."\u2014 The former Brigham Young University star and player for the Sacramento Kings, the Chicago Bulls, the New Orleans Pelicans, and the Westchester Knicks is very open about his Mormon faith. He married his wife, Whitney, in a "sealing" ceremony at the LDS Temple in Denver and has said, "I definitely have grown closer to the Lord since I\u2019ve been in the NBA. I'm not doing all this to put on a show. I\u2019m doing it because I truly believe in the church and believe in the gospel and this is how I want to live my life."\u2014 The top women's tennis professionals and sisters are well known to be devout Jehovah's Witnesses. They were home-schooled by their equally devout mother and do not vote in elections, as their faith teaches them to remain neutral in politics.\u2014 The quarterback of the San Diego Chargers is a devout Roman Catholic and once told Life Teen, "Appreciate the faith. Appreciate what we have and what a great gift the sacraments are. If you're going to be a Catholic man, be it all the way." He often speaks to youth groups about abstaining from sex until marriage, as he did.\u2014 The Major League Baseball player has a Catholic mother and a Jewish father. The second baseman for the Detroit Tigers, Kinsler is a prominent member of the Jewish community and won the Jim Sundberg Community Achievement Award in 2008.\u2014 The San Francisco Giants pitcher, a Cy Young Award winner, has been a devout Christian since childhood. "I knew enough to understand I wanted to be saved and wanted Jesus to be Lord of my life," he once said.\u2014 The Ukrainian-born welterweight boxer is an orthodox Jew who will not fight on the Sabbath or Jewish holidays, keeps kosher, and even enters the ring to the strains of Yiddish rap music. "I have a personal relationship with God that I won\u2019t compromise," he has said.\u2014 The boxing champ was raised Catholic, but has been very public about his conversion to Evangelical Christianity. He credits his beliefs for turning him away from adultery, drinking, and gambling when he was spinning out of control.\u2014 The retired NFL coach is a devoutly religious Evangelical who once reportedly considered leaving football for a prison ministry . He has also supported the Indiana Family Institute, which opposes gay marriage.\u2014 The retired NBA player born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a devout Baptist and has devoted much of his life to humanitarian work with religious groups in his homeland.\u2014 The Ladies Professional Golf Association champ has stated publicly that her Jewish faith plays an important role in her career and life.\u2014 The current head coach of the Oakland Raiders NFL Team is a "cradle Catholic" who heads the Jack Del Rio Foundation to help underprivileged children.

aVPresident Donald Trump continued his attacks Thursday on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the Obamacare repeal debacle, but declined to say whether he should step down.\u000a\u000a"I said, 'Mitch, get to work, and let's get it done,'" Trump told reporters at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., with Vice President Mike Pence. "They should have had this last one done.\u000a\u000a"They lost by one vote.\u000a\u000a"For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace," Trump said. "And, frankly, it shouldn't have happened.\u000a\u000a"That I can tell you, it shouldn't have happened."\u000a\u000aTrump has been attacking the six-term Kentucky Republican on Twitter since Wednesday, first citing Obamacare in response to McConnell's comments to a local Rotary Club that the president had "excessive expectations" regarding his agenda.\u000a\u000aEarlier Thursday, the president tweeted for McConnell to "get back to work" and address healthcare, along with tax reform and infrastructure.\u000a\u000a"I just want him to get repeal and replace done," Trump told reporters in Bedminster. "I've been hearing repeal and replace now for seven years.\u000a\u000a"All I hear is repeal and replace. And, then, I get there, and I said: 'Where's the bill? I want to sign it, first day.'\u000a\u000a"And they don't have it," Trump said.\u000a\u000aHe noted Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act many times over the past seven years \u2014 most recently in 2015 \u2014 but President Barack Obama vetoed it.\u000a\u000a"They never had a president, so it didn't matter," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"So, I say very simply, 'Where is repeal and replace?' Now I want tax reform and tax cuts."\u000a\u000aHowever, when reporters asked whether McConnell should resign, Trump only told them to ask should the majority leader fail to get several legislative items passed.\u000a\u000a"If he doesn't get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn't get taxes done \u2014 meaning cuts and reform \u2014 and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done \u2014 infrastructure \u2014 if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"What is that, a yes or a no?" a reporter shouted.\u000a\u000a"You can ask me the question," the president responded. "That means ask me that question.\u000a\u000a"Let's hope he gets it done."

aVPresident Donald Trump is willing to begin a preemptive attack on North Korea if talks do not pan out, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\u000a\u000a"If negotiations fail, he is willing to abandon strategic patience and use preemption. I think he's there mentally. He has told me this," Graham said in a Thursday interview with Hugh Hewitt.\u000a\u000a"We cannot allow the capability to mature in North Korea that could put every American sitting in the crosshairs of a nuclear attack by a very unstable, provocative leader of North Korea," Graham said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. has changed its stance on North Korea away from "strategic patience," which is a code word for weakness, Graham said.\u000a\u000aWhile Graham has been critical of the president, he told Hewitt they agree on North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aTrump's outlook on the situation is "deadly serious, very curious," Graham told Hewitt. "Now the question for him is what are the options available to him under the preemption scenario."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea leader Kim Jong Un does not behave rationally, Graham said. "The last person I want to have the capability to strike the American homeland is the leader of North Korea, because he is crazy."\u000a\u000aThe senator, during a CBS News interview Wednesday, called on China to take action against North Korea.\u000a\u000a"You're going to have a war in your backyard," if they do not deal with Kim Jong Un, Graham said.

aVPublic pension fund investments returned only 0.6 percent on average in fiscal year 2016, according to a report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, far lower than their 7.6 percent average target rate.\u000a\u000aLower than expected returns did little to improve the nation\u2019s growing unfunded pension liabilities. Of the 170 plans studied, the average funding ratio was 72 percent for the fiscal year, about the same level as the year before, according to the report. Under new accounting standards introduced in 2014, however, the plans were only 68 percent funded.\u000a\u000aLower than anticipated investment returns have plagued pension funds since the financial crisis as many public retirement systems have failed to earn enough to close their chronic shortfalls. Growing unfunded pension liabilities \u2014 the difference between what governments\u2019 owe public workers versus what has been set aside \u2014 has weighed on the finances of states and cities across the country, threatening the credit ratings of Illinois, New Jersey, Kentucky, and others.\u000a\u000aSome plans have responded to adverse market conditions by lowering the assumed rate their investments would gain during an average year. However, lower assumed rates of return mean that governments must contribute more to public pension systems to make up the difference, a move that lawmakers in some states and cities have been hesitant to do in the past.\u000a\u000aThe authors of the report noted that even though returns for fiscal year 2017 are better, the recovery will likely do little to improve funding ratios. They estimate that even if pension systems achieve their estimated rates of return over the next few years, they will only be 72.9 percent funded by 2021.

aVIn 1992, the Democratic Party faced a challenge on the issue of abortion. Pennsylvania's governor, Robert Casey, a Democrat dedicated to the working class, asked to speak at the national convention in New York City. He wanted to propose a pro-life plank for the party platform, mostly as a way of affirming his Catholic beliefs.\u000a\u000aHe fully understood that the motion would be voted down, but the Democratic Party refused to permit him even to air his views, so great was his heresy. "That sent a strong signal to working-class Catholic and evangelical voters that if they did not fall in line on this one issue they were no longer welcome in the party," writes Mark Lilla in "The Once and Future Liberal," his brief but brilliant book that comes out later this month.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI wonder if today the Democrats are making the same mistake on immigration. To be clear, I think the bill that the Republicans rolled out this week is bad public policy and mean-spirited symbolism. But that's not the issue. Lilla acknowledges that he is a pro-choice absolutist on abortion, but he argues that a national party must build a big tent that accommodates people who dissent from the main party line on a few issues.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn Lilla's view, there is a larger crisis within American liberalism. When he visited the homepage of the Republican National Committee, he found a statement of broad principles that guide the party, starting with the Constitution and ending with immigration. On the Democrats' homepage, by contrast, he noticed a set of links to "People," and when he clicked on them he got to pages specifically designed to appeal to one group or another \u2014 women, Hispanics, Native Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans. Alluding to Lebanon's system of power sharing among religious and ethnic groups, Lilla writes, "You might think that, by some mistake, you have landed on the website of the Lebanese government \u2014 not that of a party with a vision for America's future," writes Lilla.(The Democratic National Committee's website now features the party's platform more prominently.)\u000a\u000aThere have been two different agendas for American liberalism, according to Lilla. The first was Franklin Roosevelt's \u2014 a collective, national effort to help all Americans participate in the country's economic and political life. Its symbol was two hands shaking, an affirmation of the binding strength of national unity. The more recent liberal project has been centered on identity, affirming not unity but difference, nurturing and celebrating not national identities but sub-national ones. "A recurring image of identity liberalism is that of a prism," Lilla notes, "refracting a single beam of light into its constituent colors, producing a rainbow. This says it all."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aImmigration is the perfect issue on which Democrats could demonstrate that they care about national unity and identity \u2014 and that they understand the voters for whom this is a core concern. Look at the Democracy Fund's voter survey done in the wake of the 2016 election. If you compare two groups of voters \u2014 those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, and those who voted for Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 \u2014 the single biggest divergence on policy is immigration. In other words, there are many Americans who are otherwise sympathetic to Democratic ideas but on a few key issues \u2014 principally immigration \u2014 think the party is out of touch.\u000a\u000aAnd they are right. Consider the facts. Legal immigration in America has expanded dramatically over the last five decades. In 1970, 4.7 percent of the American population was foreign-born. Today it's 13.4 percent. That's a large shift, and it's natural that it has caused some anxiety.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe anxiety is about more than jobs. In his 2004 book "Who Are We?," the Harvard scholar Samuel Huntington pointed out that the scale, speed and concentration of Mexican migration into America after 1965 were without precedent in the country's history and could provoke a backlash.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHe asserted that America had more than just a founding ideology; it had a culture that had shaped it powerfully. "Would America be the America it is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish or Portuguese Catholics?" Huntington asked. "The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico or Brazil." He advocated some modest limits on immigration and, more importantly, a greater emphasis on assimilation.\u000a\u000aDemocrats should find a middle path on immigration. They can battle Trump's drastic solutions but still speak in the language of national unity and identity. The country's motto, after all, is "out of many, one" \u2014 not the other way around.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFareed Zakaria hosts CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS," and makes regular appearances on shows such as ABC's "This Week" and NBC's "Meet The Press."

aVGeorgetown University in Washington, D.C. has announced that its law school is setting up an institute with lawyers to take on a number of issues such as immigration, according to a Georgetown Law statement.\u000a\u000aThe Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law "aims to teach students to use the power of the courts to defend U.S. constitutional rights and values," the statement said.\u000a\u000aGeorgetown University is a Catholic institution with strong ties to Pope Francis, according to the Washington Examiner.\u000a\u000aThe institute will take on "immigration restrictions, religious discrimination, free expression and privacy protection, national security, and whistleblower protection," among other areas, according to the statement.\u000a\u000aThe institute already is planning to take on Texas in its battle against sanctuary cities.\u000a\u000a"The Institute is also supporting key plaintiffs in . . . City of El Cenizo v. Texas, which challenges a new state law that seeks to counter sanctuary city policies. The law, currently scheduled to take effect on September 1, purports to make it a crime for police and other public agencies to pursue an approach to enforcing federal immigration law contrary to that officially endorsed by the State of Texas, even if they believe it is in the best interest of public safety."\u000a\u000a"I have dedicated much of my career to developing and defending responsible executive branch authorities," said visiting professor Joshua A.

aVWhen Sarah Sanders was named White House press secretary July 21, a major milestone for women was achieved. Sanders, who had been deputy press secretary, became only the third woman to hold the position and the first mother to ever hold it.\u000a\u000aSo, what are influential women saying about the appointment?\u000a\u000aNewsmax spoke to Penny Young Nance, CEO and President of Concerned Women for America, who said, "She [Sarah Sanders] has really conducted herself in a way that has brought grace and dignity to the role."\u000a\u000aNance added she is pleased by the "very sharp conservative women who have been recognized and tapped for top positions at this White House."\u000a\u000aWhat is the biggest difference between Sanders and those who have gone before her? Nance attributes this to the fact "she is a southern lady. She has a great wit, but is also very charming. She is able to diffuse difficult situations. Sarah brings her own brand to the job."\u000a\u000aA major difference between Sarah Sanders and the two previous women who were White House press secretaries is she is a mother of three.\u000a\u000aNance offered Sanders some advice: "Working moms all over this country every day have to meet that balance and trade-off on priorities."\u000a\u000a"It's not a one-time decision," She added. "It is a decision every day and tradeoffs that you make every day.\u000a\u000a"It's not easy when you have a top executive role, but I am pleased to see that conservative women are finding that balance. They are working with their husbands and their families in order to be able to balance their lives and care for their children as well as have a professional career."\u000a\u000aAlex Sink, who was the 2010 Democratic nominee for governor of Florida and lost by a slim 1 percent of the vote, is happy to see Sarah Sanders as White House press secretary.\u000a\u000a"It is important to have women role models in very important jobs in business and in government as well," she said.\u000a\u000a"When I heard she had three young children, it kind of took my breath away because the job of press secretary is a 24/7 hour job," she added. "Kudos to her and to all of her family members who are helping her raise her family, because it truly takes a village."\u000a\u000aSink, who also served as Florida's Chief Financial Officer from 2007-2011, remarked: "She is in a very difficult position because she is working for a very unorthodox president, and it bothers me when she has to spin the truth.\u000a\u000a"My advice to her is that there is nothing more important to her than her own personal integrity. At some point in time she has to decide whether or not her personal integrity is aligned with the demands of her boss."\u000a\u000aMarjorie Dannenfelser, President of Susan B. Anthony List, spoke to Sanders' performance so far.\u000a\u000a"Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a strong, articulate pro-life leader who will make an outstanding White House press secretary," Dannenfelser said. "Already she has had a key role in communicating President Trump's pro-life commitments and vision to the American people, and has done so with aplomb."\u000a\u000aThe veteran pro-life activist added, "We are encouraged to see such an outspoken advocate for unborn children and their mothers take on even greater responsibility in the Trump administration."\u000a\u000aSanders herself recognized the importance of her new position as press secretary during the White House press briefing July 26.\u000a\u000aShe told reporters: "I also hope to send my daughter a message and to every other kid in America: Don't listen to the critics, dream big, and fulfill your potential \u2013 because in this country, you still can."\u000a\u000aSamantha Snellings, who is studying Journalism, Political Science, and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is a summer intern at the Washington, D.C. bureau of Newsmax.

aVThe North Korean nuclear threat is a "hinge" moment for the U.S. and China, and for the new international order both nations say they want.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf Washington and Beijing manage to stay together in dealing with Pyongyang, the door opens on a new era in which China will play a larger and more responsible role in global affairs, commensurate with its economic power. If the great powers can't cooperate, the door will slam shut \u2014 possibly triggering a catastrophic military conflict on the Korean peninsula.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's bullying style, even in dealing with trivial matters of domestic politics, obscures the extent to which he has tried to marry U.S. policy on North Korea with that of China. For the most part, he has been surprisingly successful. Beijing and Washington have mostly been aligned, as in last weekend's unanimous U.N. Security Council vote in favor of additional sanctions against Pyongyang to punish its continued missile tests.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWashington's diplomatic goal, although it hasn't been stated publicly this way, is to encourage China to interpose itself between the U.S. and North Korea and organize negotiations to de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. threat is that if China doesn't help the U.S. find such a diplomatic settlement, America will pursue its own solution \u2014 by military means, if necessary.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTrump amped up the rhetoric Tuesday, telling reporters: "They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe U.S. threat may be a bluff, but with Trump, you never know. Top U.S. officials understand that a pre-emptive war against North Korea could result in horrendous loss of life and a post-conflict outcome that would be worse for all parties. But when national security adviser H.R. McMaster says that a nuclear-armed North Korea is "intolerable" to Trump, one should assume he means it \u2014 and that he is preparing a menu of military options.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow comes the moment of nuclear brinkmanship. North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said Monday, in reaction to the U.N. vote and Chinese-American calls for talks: "We will under no circumstances put the nukes and ballistic rockets on the negotiating table." Is he bluffing? Again, we don't know.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome diplomats saw ambiguity in the vagueness of Ri's conditions for any talks. But many leading analysts believe that North Korea, rather than stepping away from the edge, is racing toward having an operational nuclear-missile capability that can strike the U.S, as a matter of self-protection.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTwo intelligence assessments disclosed Tuesday added increased urgency to the crisis. The Defense Intelligence Agency concluded late last month that North Korea has mastered the technology for a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could sit atop a missile that could hit America, according to The Washington Post. A white paper by Japan's defense ministry reached a similar conclusion and warned that the nuclear threat was now an imminent problem.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's rhetoric blasts the United States. But in a deeper way, it's China that's being put in an intolerable position by Pyongyang. China has been flashing red lights about the North Korean program for more than a year. President Kim Jong Un's regime responded by conducting its fifth nuclear test last September and continuing its missile tests, despite urgent Chinese warnings. Kim's slap to Beijing even included assassinating his half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, who was under Chinese protection.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's defiance of the U.S. and China is rooted in its ideology of "juche," or militant self-reliance. The official North Korean website sums up the philosophy as: "independence in politics, self-sufficiency in the economy and self-reliance in national defense" \u2014 a creed that promotes go-it-alone confrontation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat's at stake in this confrontation was underscored by discussions last weekend at an annual gathering of the foreign policy establishment called the Aspen Strategy Group. This year's meeting included five Trump administration officials, as well as a collection of former top officials from previous Republican and Democratic administrations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmong the clearest points of consensus was that the North Korea crisis provides what one participant called a "catalytic" moment. If China and the U.S. can find a common path and resolve the crisis peacefully, they will succeed in "modernizing the global order," which was the broad topic of the Aspen discussions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd if they fail? If Trump's fiery rhetoric alienates Beijing rather than motivating it? If Pyongyang decides to test its doctrine of self-sufficiency with a roll of the nuclear dice? If Trump becomes the first president since John Kennedy to truly find himself at the nuclear brink? One way or another, the coming months will shape global security for many years ahead.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Ignatius writes a foreign affairs column. He has also written eight spy novels.

aVThe Disney "pink slime" defamation case against its ABC network by Beef Products Inc., described as ending in an undisclosed settlement, actually ended up costing the entertainment giant $177 million to settle, in addition to insurance recoveries, a quarterly financial report showed.\u000a\u000aPrivately-held BPI sued American Broadcasting Company in 2012 for $5.7 billion, saying it and reporter Jim Avila had defamed the company by using the "pink slime" tag, and making errors and omissions in a series of reports that year, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aWalt Disney Co. and BPI, which calls the product "lean finely textured beef," came to an undisclosed settlement in June, 3-1/2 weeks after a trial began in South Dakota, where BPI is based.\u000a\u000aDisney reported the settlement of the litigation in a footnote to its financial report, saying it was seeking additional insurance proceeds to recover its cash payment.\u000a\u000aThe financial tables show a charge of $177 million described as being "in connection with settlement of litigation." The figure is not directly linked to the "pink slime" case, but the BPI litigation is the only one Disney specifies in the report.\u000a\u000aReuters could not immediately reach Disney and an attorney for BPI for comment.\u000a\u000aIn a statement in June, ABC said it stood by its reporting.

There is a significant discount for weekly (20 percent) and monthly (40 percent) rentals.\u000a\u000a"President Donald J. Trump's Childhood Home," reads the listing, which includes photos of the home. "In 1946, Donald Trump was born to Fred and Mary Trump, and brought home to Jamaica Estates. Here they lived, in a home built by Fred himself.\u000a\u000a"Not much has been changed since the Trumps lived here, the kitchen is original, and the opulent furnishings represent the style and affluence in which the Trumps would have lived. This is a unique and special opportunity to stay in the home of a sitting president."\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Post, a real estate investor bought the home from the previous owners last December for $1.39 million. That investor quickly flipped the house and sold it for $2.14 million to an unknown buyer.\u000a\u000aThe Airbnb listing says the current owner lives in the home and, therefore, one of the bedrooms is not accessible to guests renting it out.\u000a\u000aThere is also a life-sized cutout of Trump in the living room.\u000a\u000a"He is a great companion for watching Fox News late into the night," the listing reads.

The idea put forward didn't pass, it was in many ways an ill-conceived idea."\u000a\u000aThe debate on healthcare has divided Washington ever since former President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. Now that Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches, they have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to pass legislation this year that would repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aGraham said he is frustrated the party cannot come to an agreement on how to fix the nation's healthcare system.\u000a\u000a"There is no way to sugar coat this. The Republican Party promised for eight years to repeal and replace Obamacare," Graham said. "We failed, and if we give up, shame on us."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump also criticized McConnell on Wednesday, asking why he was not able to pass healthcare legislation after he has had nearly a decade to come up with a plan.

aVYoung Australian golf pro Jason Day practiced golf as way of staying on the straight and narrow during his troubled childhood, says Golf Digest. As a successful competitor, he\u2019s come a long way since then, becoming one of the game\u2019s longest drivers and a successful competitor. Golfers of all levels can improve by implementing these tips from Day.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a1. Perfect your stance \u2013 Jason Day\u2019s video on Swing by Swing Golf shows he uses two parallel sticks positioned on the ground pointing at his target. One stick is by his feet and the other is by his ball. He widens his stance just enough so his ball falls just inside where his left heel is on the ground. Day says, \u201cYour stance is your Launchpad.\u201d\u000a\u000a2. Try a \u201cflighted shot\u201d \u2013 When a round isn\u2019t going well, Day describes to Golf Digest a technique that can rescue it. The shot involves using a grip that is down about a half-inch from the handle and shifting your weight slightly to the left. Next, pivot your body away from your target on the backswing, and don\u2019t let your arms continue to swing after you\u2019ve pivoted. Finally, make solid contact with the ball and swing at about 80 percent of your usual speed.\u000a\u000a3. Practice your weight shift \u2013 John Stahlschmidt analyzed Day\u2019s technique and told Golf Tips that power hitters often have their belt buckle literally pointing to their target at the moment of impact. The solid ball contact comes from the perfect weight shift to the left throughout impact.\u000a\u000aPOLL:\u000a\u000aTiger or Jack? Who Is The Better Golfer?\u000a\u000a4. Practice speed \u2013 Day tells Golf that the best way to practice hitting long is to increase your speed. He recommends warming up and practicing by swinging a light alignment stick as fast as you can a dozen times before teeing off. He says this will make your driver feel heavier initially, but your body will retain the speed from the warm-up drill.\u000a\u000a5. Get centered \u2013 Day tells Golf that failing to play the ball off the exact center will cost you accuracy. His coach ensures he\u2019s always lining up with the ball at the center of the clubface and with the equator of the ball even with the top of the clubhead. He suggests asking a friend to help, since this can be hard to see for yourself.\u000a\u000aVOTE:

aVPresident Donald Trump says he was surprised by an FBI raid on his former campaign chairman's home, calling the move "pretty tough stuff."\u000a\u000aFBI agents searched Paul Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, home on July 26. Their warrant sought information including tax documents and banking records.\u000a\u000aTrump was asked about the search during a question-and-answer sessions with reporters at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course. He says he "thought it was a very strong signal," adding: "They do that very seldom.

aVUnfortunately, the North Korean situation continues to distort the markets.\u000a\u000aThe BBC reported that North Korea says a plan that could see it fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam will be ready in a matter of days. State media said Hwasong-12 rockets would pass over Japan and land in the sea about 17 miles (30km) from Guam, if the plan was approved by Kim Jong-un. It denounced Donald Trump's warnings of \u201cfire and fury\u201d and said the US leader was \u201cbereft of reason.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. has warned the North its actions could mean the \u201cend of its regime.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs an investor and taking into account all what has been \u201csaid\u201d so far, I would prefer to become, to say it mildly, seriously cautious about the situation.\u000a\u000aAnyway, world stocks/equities overnight fell for a third day in a row and investors moved again into the Swiss franc, Japanese yen, U.S. dollars and gold, albeit not in a dramatic way.\u000a\u000aNow, on a completely other subject, Kenneth Rogoff who is an American economist and, yes, chess Grandmaster, and is also the Thomas D. Cabot Professor of Public Policy and Professor of Economics at Harvard University just told the BBC that a sudden rise in interest rates poses the greatest threat to the global economy.\u000a\u000aBesides all that food for thought, a couple of days ago a new Goldman Sachs report, published a new economic research paper titled \u201cThe Lags of Monetary Policy: Waiting for Godot\u201d wherein the Goldman economists Jan Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn gave us as investors their \u201creally interesting\u201d Global Economic Forecasts,.\u000a\u000aTheir conclusions read: \u201cOne key practical implication is that we should not expect the lagged effect of a higher funds rate to restrain U.S. growth, unless the Fed brings about a meaningful tightening of financial conditions.\u000a\u000aSo far, there is no sign of this; in fact, the recent easing in our FCI (Financial Conditions Index) to the most expansionary level since 2014 should translate into a continued positive growth impulse, if maintained.\u000a\u000aConversely, the recent tightening in financial conditions in the Euro area, which many investors don\u2019t seem to care about, suggests that ECB policy is somewhat less supportive for growth than implied by its very low policy rate.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnyway, all this becomes interesting, as these top economists of Goldman Sachs Research say they expect real GDP for the U.S. to grow by 2.1 percent this year, by 2.2 percent in 2018 and by 1.7 percent in 2019 while for the Euro area they expect real GDP to grow by 1.9 percent this year, and by 1.4 percent in 2018 and 2019.\u000a\u000aThey also expect core CPI inflation for the U.S. (core PCE that matters to the Fed) to be at 1.5 percent in 2017, at 1.8 percent in 2018 and at 2.1 percent in 2019 while for the Euro area they expect core CPI inflation to be at 1.0 percent in 2017, at 1.1 percent in 2018 and at 1.3 percent in 2019.\u000a\u000aThey expect policy rates for the U.S. to be at 1.4 percent in 2017, at 2.4 percent in 2018 and at 3.4 percent in 2019 while for the Euro area they expect policy rates to remain at 0.0 percent in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\u000a\u000aOf course, nothing is written stone, but as an investor it could be not such a bad idea to keep these projections in mind as some kind of a background when long-term investment decisions have to be taken, which doesn\u2019t apply, of course, for short-term trading operations.\u000a\u000aEtienne "Hans" Parisis is a bank economist who has advised investors on financial markets and international investments.

aVBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Scientists say climate change is affecting the timing of river floods across Europe, with the biggest shifts seen along the Atlantic coast.\u000a\u000aResearchers looked at data across a 50-year period, finding that half the measurement stations in western Europe \u2014 from England to Portugal \u2014 showed floods happening more than two weeks earlier by 2010.\u000a\u000aIn a paper published Thursday by the journal Science, the researchers found that earlier snow melts are also bringing floods in northeastern Europe forward by over a week.\u000a\u000aFloods around the North Sea area are happening more than a week later than in 1960.\u000a\u000aThe authors concluded that future climate change may force farmers, hydropower plants, water companies and residents in affected areas to adjust to shifts in flood patterns.

The endorsement seemed out of the blue at first, but then it became clear that Brooks is one of several Republicans who will run against Strange's reelection effort.\u000a\u000aBrooks fired back Wednesday afternoon by saying Strange and Senate Leader Mitch McConnell do not support the president's agenda.\u000a\u000aI agree completely, Mr. President.

They only have the capacity to do the political thing, to make sure that they stay in their jobs and that they don't offend anybody in this town too deeply."\u000a\u000aThat, Flanagan said, is causing "crazy votes" in the Senate \u2014 such as Sen. John McCain's no vote on a skinny Obamacare repeal last month.\u000a\u000a"The work has to be done in regular order in the House if you expect the Senate to follow," Flanagan said. "Newt [Gingrich] found this to be true with Bob Dole in the Senate. This is always true, and I can go on here for 10 minutes, but I won't, and I think that's really the problem."\u000a\u000aFlanagan later added Washington needs a new crop of lawmakers who are less worried about politics and more concerned with doing what is right to run the government.\u000a\u000a"We need better, higher-quality people running for office, and I don't know how we get that done in this age, but in an age where we've ended privacy, in any age where everybody knows everything about everybody, there's a whole bunch of people who don't want their lives on display as completely as they are today, and so they avoid the public life, and we've got to find a way to work around that," he said.

aVWhile the recent, unanimous U.N. Security Council adoption of new sanctions against North Korea is clearly an encouraging move in a positive direction, there is little reason to regard it is other than a very small step along a very steep and treacherous path forward.\u000a\u000aIn reality, North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un can\u2019t likely be pressured into relinquishing nuclear armaments and delivery systems essential for his impoverished hermit country to achieve plausible international stature \u2014 in combination with a pretense of U.S. threat to keep his population in line. Nor can other less directly impacted nations be counted on to fully back the U.S. in bringing about sufficient economic hardship to collapse North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile technology industry.\u000a\u000aThe latest round of Security Council sanctions follows eight previously unsuccessful resolutions adopted since 2006 when North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. The latest, this time prompted by two long-range missile launches last month, ratchets up previous restrictions even more.\u000a\u000aKey pressure points include: a prohibition of all coal, iron, iron ore, and seafood exports; new restrictions on North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank; a cap on new investments and joint ventures; and strengthened shipping oversight.\u000a\u000aThe sanctions left other important elements of North Korea\u2019s economy relatively untouched. For example, oil imports remain open. And while a cap was placed on the number of North Korean laborers permitted to work overseas and send remittances home, those already employed abroad are permitted to stay.\u000a\u000aChina, a primary North Korean trade partner, has a history of hedging its interests both ways. As Duyeon Kim, a visiting senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum in Seoul told The Wall Street Journal, "Beijing\u2019s reluctance to implement U.N. sanctions is further enabling Pyongyang to sprint down the weapons path." Kim added, "China knows it can squeeze the North enough without the collapse it fears, but Beijing chooses not to because of its own strategic interests."\u000a\u000aSpeaking at the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional Forum in Manilla, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the Korean Peninsula had reached a "critical point of crisis," and that this circumstance has caused a "turning point for negotiations."\u000a\u000aYi who had previously met with his North Korean counterpart, reported that Beijing has urged Pyongyang to "stop the missile tests and even nuclear research which violate the U.N. Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the international community."\u000a\u000aHe noted, however, that "Sanctions are necessary, but [are] in no way the ultimate purpose. Imposing fresh sanctions is aimed at bringing the conundrum back to the negotiating table."\u000a\u000aThus far, the situation only appears to be getting worse. North Korea said it would launch "thousands-fold" revenge against the U.S. over the sanctions. President Trump responded yesterday during a press briefing that North Korea would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen" if it made any more threats against the U.S.\u000a\u000aJust hours later, North Korea said it was "carefully examining" a plan to attack Guam, situated in the Western Pacific \u2014 just slightly more than 2,000 miles north of the Australian coast.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed cautious expectations that violent conflict can be avoided. He said at a Manilla news conference, "We hope again that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to a conclusion to choose a different pathway, and when conditions are right that we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so that they feel secure and prosper economically."\u000a\u000aWhen later asked when the U.S. would determine was the right time to talk, Tillerson said, "We\u2019ll know it when we see it . . . The best signal that North Korea could give us that they\u2019re prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches."\u000a\u000aThe time window for any peaceful resolution is rapidly closing.\u000a\u000aVery troubling, U.S. spy satellites have recently detected North Korean military loading two anti-ship cruise missiles onto a high-speed boat on the east side of the country. This is not a positive indication that Kin Jong Un is ready to talk.\u000a\u000aIt is also now well established that the most recent of those North Korean ICBMs had a potential range of more than 6,400 miles . . . capable of reaching Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago.\u000a\u000aSome defense experts believe that Kim Jong Un may already have up to 60 nuclear weapons, and a newly released U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment reported by The Washington Post also indicates that North Korea already has a missile-ready nuke.\u000a\u000aWhether or not Pyongyang has yet developed a nuclear missile capable of handling atmospheric reentry necessary for a devastating electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device capable of disrupting vast regional electric power grids is not entirely clear.\u000a\u000aOne thing, however, is very certain.

aVRegarded as one of the greatest players in pro golf, Arnold Palmer earned the nickname "The King" not just because of his ability to win major tournaments, but because of his personality and his unique appeal to his fans as well.\u000a\u000aPalmer died at age 87 in 2016, still involved in the world of golf. He was among the first pro golfers to take advantage of sports marketing with equipment and product endorsements.

Charisma \u2014 Although he may not have been the single greatest on the pro golf circuit, he was the most beloved, earning the nickname \u201cThe King,\u201d according to Golf Channel's Randall Mell.

Youngest winner \u2014 Palmer established himself on the pro circuit by capturing the Masters Tournament title in 1958.

Major victories \u2014 He became the first golfer to win the Masters four times \u2014 in 1958, 1960, 1962, and 1964. He was the champion at two British Opens and won a total of 93 titles during his career. He was the first pro golfer to make $1 million in winnings in 1968.\u000a\u000a5. Aging grace \u2014 Even in his later years, Palmer took to the links on the Senior Tour. His victories included the 1980 PGA Seniors Championship and the 1981 U.S. Senior Open. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2012 when Golf Digest reported he was the third highest paid golfer at age 82, behind Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\u000a\u000a6. King of golf clubs \u2014 His expertise in the game was matched by his collection of more than 10,000 golf clubs, according to Golf.com. Many of them he made himself. His golf bags often included 40 to 60 clubs. Experimenting with the grip on his equipment helped develop his game.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

But the best foods for skin health contain nutrients that protect people from skin problems and even enhance their appearance.Certain foods nourish skin cells and tissues to overcome blemishes, acne, eczema, psoriasis, and other skin disorders, according to BBC Good Food Here are the five best foods that promise to cure skin problems:with omega-3 fatty acids are vital to healthy skin. Known for heart health and protection against heart disease, omega-3s boost blood circulation for a healthy glow to the skin. Research has shown that fish oil protects the skin against sun damage, WebMD reported . The fatty acids build up cell membranes to shield the skin against harmful substances and clear the way for skin nutrients. Omega-3 fish include tuna, mackerel, salmon, herring, lake trout, and sardines.contains beta-carotene and like other dark, leafy green vegetables, this antioxidant works to repair skin cells as well as slow down the development of skin cancer cells, according to TotalBeauty . Age-defying spinach also provides the body and skin with folate, potassium, and fiber to restore skin cells damaged from sun exposure. This wards off the skin cancers. Spinach also provides vitamin A, also known as retinol, for skin health, as do other leafy greens, carrots, and butternut squash., such as oranges, tangerines and lemons, are among the highest sources of vitamin C, which contributes to improved skin health and faster healing, according to Chris Kresser, a promoter of nutrition and best-selling author . He noted that research has shown better skin appearance and fewer wrinkles for people with diets high in vitamin C. Other sources of vitamin C include strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.have unsaturated fats and essential fatty acids that are called the \u201chealthy fats.\u201d Walnuts, Brazil nuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds have the healthy fats that reduce inflammation to significantly improve the skin, Jacqueline Banks, a certified holistic health counselor, wrote in an article for Fox News . Almonds are also known to strengthen cell membranes for skin health.is packed with protein and vitamins to enhance the immune system, necessary to maintain vibrant, clear and young-looking skin, TotalBeauty said. Yogurt and other dairy products contain vitamin A, which protects the skin from environmental damage and overexposure to the sun that can cause premature wrinkles.

aVU.S. regulators have approved the first drug to treat all forms of hepatitis C in as little as eight weeks.\u000a\u000aThe pill combination from AbbVie Inc. was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for adults without significant cirrhosis, a type of liver disease, and many patients who were not cured by prior treatment.\u000a\u000aMavyret joins two other AbbVie hepatitis C drugs, one from Merck & Co. and four from Gilead Sciences Inc. on the market. That gives doctors and patients more options, and insurers more leverage to wring discounts out of companies to cover the pricey drugs.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually develops slowly over decades, with no symptoms until serious damage is done. Without treatment, the virus can cause liver failure and liver cancer, often requiring a liver transplant or resulting in death.\u000a\u000aFor decades, hepatitis C treatment required a year of grueling shots and pills that gave patients flu-like symptoms and still barely cured half of them. Starting late in 2013, Gilead revolutionized treatment with the first pill-only medicines that brought cures in 12 weeks for more than 90 percent of patients.\u000a\u000aGilead has been raking in billions on the drugs. Insurance plans and government health programs have been straining to cover the huge cost \u2014 up to $94,500 for a course of treatment with its second drug, Harvoni \u2014 and initially limited coverage to the sickest patients.\u000a\u000aAbbvie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, said Mavyret's list price without insurance will be $26,400 for eight weeks' treatment, $39,600 for 12 weeks' treatment and $52,800 for 16 weeks' treatment.\u000a\u000aAs the latest entrant in a competitive market in which commercial insurers mostly have deals giving them discounts of up to 50 percent in exchange for not covering rivals' hepatitis C drugs, Maryvet is priced well below the other approved drugs. AbbVie spokesman Morry Smulevitz said the company initially will focus on getting coverage approved by Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration.\u000a\u000aThe key to how much market share Maryvet can get will depend on the discounts it offers payers, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote to investors.\u000a\u000aMavyret is the latest drug to treat all six forms of hepatitis C, following Gilead's Epclusa. Earlier drugs generally are limited to patients with just one or a few hepatitis C types or at certain stages of the disease.\u000a\u000aIn testing that included 2,300 adult patients, 97.5 percent who didn't have cirrhosis were cured, meaning the virus was undetectable in their blood, in eight weeks after taking Mavyret. Among patients with severe kidney damage, 98 percent were cured after 12 weeks of treatment, according to AbbVie.\u000a\u000aMaryvet combines two hepatitis C medicines, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, taken as three pills together once a day. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, fatigue and itchy skin. In patients who previously had hepatitis B infections, treatment with Maryvet can reactivate that virus, causing potentially fatal liver problems.\u000a\u000aFollow Linda A.

aVSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged Democrats to "park their hatred of Donald Trump" while the threats by North Korea loom.\u000a\u000aGraham's remarks came Thursday during an interview on "The Hugh Hewitt Show."\u000a\u000a"There's nothing in the Constitution limiting the ability to use force to protect America," Graham said. "Having said that, it would be very smart if the Congress could come together and tell the president you have our authorization to use military force to stop the threat to the homeland as a last resort.\u000a\u000a"That would send a signal to North Korea and China that would probably do more good to avoid war than anything I can think of. And to accomplish that task, our Democratic friends would have to park their hatred of [President] Donald Trump and put the country first."\u000a\u000aGraham said the situation with North Korea is growing "increasingly dangerous."\u000a\u000aSo, what I'm trying to do is reinforce a message I think should be delivered forcefully, that is we will not allow North Korea to have an ICBM with a weapon on top to hit the American homeland. We're not going to contain the threat. We're going to deny that capability, and our policy has changed dramatically, and we're trying to make sure that our allies and our enemies know that.\u000a\u000aAnd Graham defended the president's strategy in dealing with the North Korea threat.\u000a\u000a"I think he's made a decision long ago, quite frankly, to try to negotiate the threat with North Korea, to try to find a way through negotiations to end the threat to the American homeland," he said. "But if negotiations fail, he is willing to abandon strategic patience and use preemption."\u000a\u000aTrump has warned North Korea it faced "fire and fury" over its threats, CNN noted.

aVEconomists are growing worried that lawmakers in Washington are getting dangerously close to budget deadlines, which may be negative for financial markets in the next few weeks.\u000a\u000aForecasters in a monthly survey by The Wall Street Journal estimate on average a 22 percent chance that the government will shut down at the end of September, and a 17 percent possibility that the U.S. Treasury will miss payments. Those outlays include federal payrolls and Social Security checks.\u000a\u000aLawmaker returning from the August recess face two important deadlines. Congress needs to decide whether to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, which would give the Treasury the authority to borrow more money. The following day is the end of the fiscal year and the deadline for Congress to approve legislation to keep the government running.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe annual games of Debt Ceiling Roulette and Federal Budget Chicken pose greater risks than ever this year,\u201d Amy Crews Cutts, chief economist of the credit reporting agency Equifax, told the newspaper.\u000a\u000aEconomists estimate a 6 percent chance the U.S. will default on debt payments, a low possibility but still double the risk from a survey earlier this summer.\u000a\u000a\u201cDefault would have quick and severe effects on the economy that no party wants to bear,\u201d said Brian Schaitkin, senior U.S. economist at the Conference Board.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s inability to repeal and replace his predecessor\u2019s healthcare law have cast doubts on other campaign pledges, including tax reform and trillion-dollar spending on roads, bridges and airports.\u000a\u000a\u201cA growth-oriented tax package could lead to a surge in business investment,\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist of Amherst Pierpont Securities, told the WSJ. \u201cIf nothing gets done, disappointment could set in.\u201d

aV\u000a\u000a"The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before," the president declared in a series of tweets Monday morning, and that "will never change." Many observers were quick to point out that this assertion isn't borne out in the polls.\u000a\u000aSuch nitpicking, however, overlooks a more important part of this story. In the 1990s and 2000s, Trump had political ambitions, but the traditional two-party system and the media landscape served as impenetrable barriers. It was the breakdown of the old ways that opened a path for someone interested in breaking them down even more \u2014 in part by embracing a new base of mostly non-college-educated whites.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, Republicans have relied on white, middle-class, white-collar, married suburbanites. The American Communities Project identifies 106 "urban suburbs" \u2014 the relatively affluent near-in suburbs of major cities. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won 92 of them. In 2016, Trump lost 89.\u000a\u000aAs Politico's Charlie Mahtesian recently chronicled, Republicans have been steadily losing market share in these crucial districts and counties for decades, as suburbanites become a bit more liberal and a lot more hostile to Republican populism on cultural issues.\u000a\u000aGeorgia's 6th Congressional District illustrates the trend. Mitt Romney carried the highly educated suburban district by 23 points in 2012. Trump squeaked out a win there by 1 point in 2016. That same year, Republican Rep. Tom Price won re-election, receiving 61.7 percent of the vote. In the recent special election to replace Price after he was named secretary of Health and Human Resource, Republican Karen Handel beat Democrat Jon Ossoff by less than four points.\u000a\u000aJust as inexorably, the Democrats have been watching white, blue-collar workers, the heart of the old Franklin D. Roosevelt alliance, migrate to the GOP for some time now. Democrats bet heavily on the growth of minorities, particularly the black vote, urban liberals, immigrants and millennials. This coalition delivered two historic victories for Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aBut opposition to Obama accelerated the defection of rural, working-class and older whites to the GOP cause, costing Democrats 63 House seats and roughly 1,000 elected offices nationwide.\u000a\u000aNow, both parties have similar dilemmas: Their new bases are too small to guarantee electoral success but too strong to allow fundamental rethinking of how the parties do business.\u000a\u000aThe Democratic base of hard-core liberals and Trump "resisters" is not a majority coalition. But it is the dominant ideological force within the party (and mainstream media), and hence the leadership is very reluctant to broaden the party's message. The new push for zero tolerance of pro-life Democrats is just one obvious illustration of the bind the Democrats are in.\u000a\u000aTrump, meanwhile, has dedicated the first six months of his presidency to keeping his base happy. That's in part because he can't get legislation through Congress, so he tweets red meat to the faithful instead.\u000a\u000aHis media cheerleaders increasingly define conservatism not as adherence to any program, but as personal loyalty to Trump. Hence the rising call from figures such as the recently suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling to purge the party of "RINOs" (Republicans In Name Only) who are critical of the president. If Trump had an approval rating in the high 50s instead of numbers that bounced around in the 30s, following this advice would not threaten the fragile GOP majority.\u000a\u000aThe Democrats have settled on economic populism as their unifying theme, not so much because that's where all the passion is but because they can't agree on any other agenda that would enlarge their coalition. The GOP, in turn, is shrinking its ideological commitments \u2014 and appeal \u2014 and focusing instead on populist rage and the president's cult of personality. Both courses leave vast swaths of the electorate up for grabs.\u000a\u000aAs a result, there's the potential for an opening in 2020 for some opportunistic figure \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg? Michael Bloomberg? \u2014 from outside the beleaguered and sclerotic party system who could forge a coalition from both the traditional Democratic and Republican columns, much as Emmanuel Macron did in France. An independent candidate always seemed like a pipe dream in America's two-party system. But so did Trump's candidacy until not very long ago.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJonah Goldberg is a syndicated columnist and author.

aVGardening is an enjoyable hobby, but it is also a wonderful way to reduce your dependence on store-bought food, which is often not grown locally or organically. Even if you don\u2019t have a lot of space or time, these tips will help you make the most of your garden and provide your family with as much high-quality food as possible.\u000a\u000a1. Start with great soil \u2013 Your growing medium will be your plants\u2019 home for as long as it is producing for you. Natural Living Ideas suggests adding plenty of compost to garden soil as an amendment. Healthy plants grow stronger and produce a bigger harvest.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Extend the seasons \u2013 Mother Earth News says to \u201cstart early, end late.\u201d Pushing your harvest time window earlier in the spring and later into the fall or winter means using cloches to protect plants from frost or cloth row covers for larger areas.\u000a\u000a3. Plant perennial crops \u2013 Many gardeners overlook perennials, but they can bring big harvests that just return and get bigger every year, advises Mother Earth News. Fruits like blackberries, blueberries, and rhubarb produce every year, and an asparagus patch, when properly maintained, will produce for decades.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Succession planting \u2013 According to Earth911, this method of staggering the timing of your plantings will produce more food over a longer period of time. For example, you might plant an initial crop of lettuce from seed in early April and then plant again three weeks later. Then, you\u2019ll have your new lettuce maturing just as the first crop is finishing up. When one crop is finished, remove it and plant something new in its place.\u000a\u000a5. Harvest early and often \u2013 Natural Living Ideas says that most gardeners get lazy about harvesting crops later in the season. They recommend harvesting vegetables as soon as they are ready; don\u2019t wait. They also say regular harvesting keeps the plant producing better than if you leave vegetables on plants for too long.\u000a\u000a6. Cut-and-come-again crops \u2013 These are crops that produce more than one harvest, says Mother Earth News. For example, Swiss chard can be harvested just a few leaves at a time while leaving the plant in the ground. It will continue to produce over a long period of time. Broccoli will often produce side shoots and smaller heads once the main head is harvested.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVA single injection of a fragment of a life-extending protein hormone could improve cognition in those with neurodegenerative illnesses, according to new research published Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe klotho protein was found to enhance cognitive and physical performance in aging or impaired mice, said a study carried out by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco and published in the journal Cell Reports.\u000a\u000a"With our new aging demographic, cognitive dysfunction and lack of mobility are now emerging as our biggest biomedical challenges, and there are no truly effective medical therapies for these debilitating problems," said lead author Dena Dubal.\u000a\u000a"Our findings suggest that treatment with a klotho fragment enhances brain function across the lifespan and could represent a new therapeutic strategy to boost brain resilience against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."\u000a\u000aBut researchers said clinical studies would be necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of injecting klotho in humans.\u000a\u000aThe body naturally produces the complex hormone that is involved in multiple cellular processes, and is linked to prolonging life in worms, mice and humans.\u000a\u000aIn model organisms as well as in humans, klotho levels decrease with age, chronic stress, cerebral aging and neurodegenerative illnesses.\u000a\u000aPrior studies had found that life-long exposure to elevated levels of klotho boost mental functions, but it remained unclear whether short-term treatment using the hormone could quickly improve cognition.\u000a\u000aIn this study young mice treated with the hormone for four consecutive days showed markedly improved cognitive function, benefits that lasted more than two weeks.\u000a\u000aAging mice showed improvements in just two days following a single shot of the treatment.\u000a\u000aAnd several days of the treatment alleviated impairment in mice showing signs of neurodegenerative illnesses.\u000a\u000a"All of this work is going to teach us something really important about how the body transmits resilience to the brain," Dubal said.

aVPresident Donald Trump backed an immigration bill that would both stunt economic growth and reduce jobs in the U.S. by over 1 million, according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school.\u000a\u000aIn ten years, the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy, or RAISE Act, would reduce growth by .7 percent and eliminate 1.3 million jobs, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\u000a\u000a"The domestic worker participation rate won't increase enough to fill the jobs that would have been held by immigrants who are no longer allowed in the country," the report reads.\u000a\u000aSens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga., introduced the bill, which CNBC reports is expected to reduce legal immigration by half. It would place job skills and other abilities ahead of family connections for those looking to obtain permanent legal residency.\u000a\u000aThe two wrote an op-ed in USA Today Tuesday defending their bill, arguing that it will improve the economy, as it will "reduce our annual immigration levels by half after ten years and reorient it toward high-skilled workers, which is just what our economy needs."\u000a\u000aCotton's communications director Caroline Rabbitt told CNBC that the study "misses nearly half of all green cards," and that "this gross undercounting of green cards is an understandable mistake for people new to immigration, but it's embarrassing for purported 'experts' and shows that their projections are unreliable."

aVFake eclipse glasses will likely be worn by many when millions of Americans turn their faces skyward to see the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in a century. Knockoffs of specially designed protective eyewear for staring at the sun are flooding the U.S. market.\u000a\u000aExperts cautioned the public to stay clear of unsafe counterfeits, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aEven as makers of certified, safety-tested solar eye ware rushed to meet surging demand before the Aug. 21 eclipse, they have joined astronomers and optometrists in warning of defective knockoffs.\u000a\u000a"It's a bunch of unscrupulous people cashing in on the eclipse and putting public safety at risk," said Richard Fienberg, press officer for the American Astronomical Society.\u000a\u000aStaring at the sun without proper filtration, even when it is partially obscured by the moon during an eclipse, can damage or destroy photo-receptor cells of the eye's retina, leaving blind spots in a person's field of vision, experts said.\u000a\u000aSpecial eyeglasses made with proper solar filters allow viewers to safely gaze at the sun any time for unlimited duration, the AAS said.\u000a\u000aAlthough the advent of solar-safe sunglasses dates back more than three decades, they have never been so widely available to the public as for the 2017 event, which Fienberg said may rank as the most watched total solar eclipse in human history.\u000a\u000aThat is largely because this year's spectacle will be the first in 99 years to span the entire continental United States -- the world's third most populous nation -- across a 70-mile-wide path over 14 states, from the Pacific coast of Oregon to the Atlantic shore of South Carolina.\u000a\u000aIt will also be the first total solar eclipse visible from any of the Lower 48 states since 1979.\u000a\u000aAs a measure of excitement surrounding the event, a leading supplier of solar lenses, Arizona-based Thousand Oaks Optical, has sold enough of its filters this year alone to produce roughly 100 million pairs of glasses, company owner Pat Steele-Gaishin told Reuters.\u000a\u000aWhile no data exists for how many made-for-eclipse eyeglasses are in circulation overall, shady distributors of purportedly solar-safe shades abound on the Internet, Fienberg said.\u000a\u000aThe lenses of some obvious fakes allow the penetration of light from such relatively faint sources as fluorescent lamps, while the only thing one should see through authentic solar-safe filters when looking at objects fainter than the sun is pitch blackness.\u000a\u000aOther bogus glasses have come stamped with forged logos of reputable manufacturers or with phony safety labels.\u000a\u000aPeru State College in Nebraska, which lies in the path of the eclipse, ordered 7,500 pairs for students but discovered the shipment from a Chinese distributor was defective and came with safety certificates for ordinary sunglasses.\u000a\u000aPeru marketing director Jason Hogue said the college has since reordered from a legitimate supplier.\u000a\u000aThe AAS and NASA have posted a list of reputable solar filter brands, retail distributors and online dealers.\u000a\u000aPrices range from as little as 99 cents for a pair of paper-frame glasses to $20 or $30 for a more stylish plastic set.\u000a\u000aWhile a last-minute rush has left many dealers out of stock two weeks before the big day, the good news is that U.S. astronomy buffs have to wait only seven more years for the next total solar eclipse over North America, in April 2024.\u000a\u000aMade from an extremely opaque black polymer film containing fine carbon powder, true solar-safe lenses are designed to screen out 250,000 times more visible light than would otherwise reach the naked eye, said B.

aVNorth Korea has announced a detailed plan to launch a salvo of ballistic missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, a major military hub and home to U.S. bombers. If carried out, it would be the North's most provocative missile launch to date.\u000a\u000aThe announcement Thursday warned that the North is finalizing a plan to fire four of its Hwasong-12 missiles over Japan and into waters around the tiny island, which hosts 7,000 U.S. military personnel on two main bases and has a population of 160,000.\u000a\u000aJapan and South Korea vowed a strong reaction if the North were to go through with the plan.\u000a\u000aIt said the plan, which involves the missiles hitting waters 30 to 40 kilometers (19 to 25 miles) from the island, could be sent to leader Kim Jong Un for approval within a week or so. It would be up to Kim whether the move is actually carried out.\u000a\u000aIt is unclear whether \u2014 or exactly why \u2014 North Korea would risk firing missiles so close to U.S. territory. Such a launch would almost compel the United States to attempt an intercept and possibly generate further escalation.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, no stranger to bluffing, frequently uses extremely bellicose rhetoric with warnings of military action to keep its adversaries on their heels. It generally couches its threats with language stating it will not attack the United States unless it has been attacked first or has determined an attack is imminent.\u000a\u000aBut the statement raised worries amid threats from both sides.\u000a\u000aFollowing reports that U.S. intelligence suggests the North might be able to pair a nuclear warhead with a missile capable of reaching targets on the United States mainland, President Donald Trump warned North Korea that "it faces retaliation with fire and fury unlike any the world has seen before."\u000a\u000aPyongyang, meanwhile, has been louder in its complaints against a new and tough round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, with strong U.S. backing, and Washington's use of Guam as a staging ground for its stealth bombers, which could be used to attack North Korea and are a particularly sore point with the ruling regime in Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aIts reported plan is extremely specific, suggesting it is actually plotting a launch.\u000a\u000aThe report said the Hwasong-12 rockets would fly over Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi prefectures in Japan and travel "1,065 seconds before hitting the waters 30 to 40 kilometers away from Guam." It said the Korean People's Army Strategic Force will finalize the plan by mid-August, present it to Kim Jong Un and "wait for his order."\u000a\u000a"We keep closely watching the speech and behavior of the U.S.," it said.\u000a\u000aSuch a move would not merely be a test launch, but a demonstration of military capabilities that could easily lead to severe consequences.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's military responded by saying North Korea will face a "stern and strong" response from Washington and Seoul. Taking it a step further, Japan's Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera told parliament a missile attack on the U.S. territory would be a Japanese national emergency because it would threaten Japan's existence as a nation.\u000a\u000aIf North Korea were to actually carry it out \u2014 even if it aimed at hitting the waters off Guam and not the island itself \u2014 that would clearly pose a potential threat to U.S. territory and put the United States in a much more complicated situation than it has been during previous missile launches.\u000a\u000aGuam lies about 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers) from the Korean Peninsula, and it's extremely unlikely Kim's government would risk annihilation with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens. It's also unclear how reliable North Korea's missiles would be against such a distant target, but no one was writing off the danger completely.\u000a\u000aWashington has been testing its missile defenses in response to the North's stepped-up development and the current escalation of tensions could lead to pressure for the U.S. military to try to shoot down the North's missiles in midflight if they are heading toward Guam.\u000a\u000aThat would likely open up a set of very major problems, including the possibility of both a very high-profile failure or a miscalculation of Washington's intentions and a more deadly pre-emptive strike by the North \u2014 which has missiles able to hit Tokyo and conventional weapons that could devastate South Korea's capital of Seoul.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-12, which was revealed for the first time at a military parade in April, is an intermediate-range ballistic missile that is believed to have a radius of more than 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles). It can be fired from mobile launchers, making it hard to detect and destroy on the ground.\u000a\u000aBy launching a salvo of four, the North would be attempting to make it harder for the U.S. to intercept all of the incoming missiles. Its stated flight path over Japan is also very aggressive \u2014 it has recently tried to avoid flying over neighboring countries by shooting its missiles up at a very high angle to land in the ocean.\u000a\u000aWashington, meanwhile, has been giving out mixed signals about its intentions.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump was threatening annihilation and boasting from the New Jersey golf resort where he's vacationing that he has made the U.S. nuclear arsenal "far stronger and more powerful than ever before," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm the sense of crisis.\u000a\u000a"Americans should sleep well at night," Tillerson told reporters. "Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours."

"And that is what the Senate has faced with healthcare."\u000a\u000aThe "Dunkirk" film told the story of the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk, during which British and Allied military forces evacuated from a French beach as Germany claimed France as its own.\u000a\u000aWicker was referring to the late-night vote two weeks ago that was highlighted by Sen. John McCain's no vote on the skinny repeal of Obamacare. If McCain had voted yes, the measure would have passed.\u000a\u000a"In the Senate, we came up one vote short of going to conference with the House with a plan," Wicker said.

aVPresident Donald Trump continued his attacks Thursday on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the Obamacare repeal debacle, but declined to say whether he should step down.\u000a\u000a"I said, 'Mitch, get to work, and let's get it done,'" Trump told reporters at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., with Vice President Mike Pence. "They should have had this last one done.\u000a\u000a"They lost by one vote.\u000a\u000a"For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace," Trump said. "And, frankly, it shouldn't have happened.\u000a\u000a"That I can tell you, it shouldn't have happened."\u000a\u000aTrump has been attacking the six-term Kentucky Republican on Twitter since Wednesday, first citing Obamacare in response to McConnell's comments to a local Rotary Club that the president had "excessive expectations" regarding his agenda.\u000a\u000aEarlier Thursday, the president tweeted for McConnell to "get back to work" and address healthcare, along with tax reform and infrastructure.\u000a\u000a"I just want him to get repeal and replace done," Trump told reporters in Bedminster. "I've been hearing repeal and replace now for seven years.\u000a\u000a"All I hear is repeal and replace. And, then, I get there, and I said: 'Where's the bill? I want to sign it, first day.'\u000a\u000a"And they don't have it," Trump said.\u000a\u000aHe noted Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act many times over the past seven years \u2014 most recently in 2015 \u2014 but President Barack Obama vetoed it.\u000a\u000a"They never had a president, so it didn't matter," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"So, I say very simply, 'Where is repeal and replace?' Now I want tax reform and tax cuts."\u000a\u000aHowever, when reporters asked whether McConnell should resign, Trump only told them to ask should the majority leader fail to get several legislative items passed.\u000a\u000a"If he doesn't get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn't get taxes done \u2014 meaning cuts and reform \u2014 and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done \u2014 infrastructure \u2014 if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"What is that, a yes or a no?" a reporter shouted.\u000a\u000a"You can ask me the question," the president responded.

aVA future trivia question and historical footnote, the spectacular 10-day flameout of Anthony Scaramucci qualifies as the most entertaining episode yet of the ongoing reality show that is the Trump presidency. (Working title: "The Pompadours of 1600 Pennsylvania.") But even as the cocksure sycophant's gobsmacking spectacle stole the show, something of real importance took place a bit lower on the radar.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt five separate junctures, the sinews of our democracy held against the careening recklessness of this presidency. Consequently, Donald Trump's worst week proved a particularly fine hour for American democracy:\u000a\u000a1) The military says no to Trump on the transgender ban.\u000a\u000aWell, not directly \u2014 that's insubordination \u2014 but with rather elegant circumspection. The president tweeted out a total ban on transgender people serving in the military. It came practically out of nowhere. The military brass, not consulted, was not amused. Defense Secretary James Mattis, in the middle of a six-month review of the issue, was reportedly appalled.\u000a\u000aWhat was done? Nothing. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs simply declared that a tweet is not an order. Until he receives a formal command and develops new guidelines, the tweet will be ignored.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the military told the commander in chief to go jump in a lake. Generally speaking, this is not a healthy state of affairs in a nation of civilian control. It does carry a whiff of insubordination. But under a president so uniquely impulsive and chronically irrational, a certain vigilance, even prickliness, on the part of the military is to be welcomed.\u000a\u000aThe brass framed their inaction as a matter of procedure. But the refusal carried with it a reminder of institutional prerogatives. In this case, the military offered resistance to mere whimsy. Next time, it could be resistance to unlawfulness.\u000a\u000a2) The Senate saves Sessions.\u000a\u000aTrump's relentless public humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was clearly intended to get him to resign. He didn't, in part because of increasing support from Congress. Sessions' former colleagues came out strongly in his defense and some openly criticized the president's shabby treatment of his first and most fervent senatorial supporter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndeed, Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned Trump not to fire Sessions because he wouldn't get another attorney general \u2014 the committee's entire 2017 schedule was set and there would be no hearings to approve a new AG. That was a finger to the eye of the president. Every once in a while, the Senate seems to remember that it is a coequal branch.\u000a\u000a3) Senate Republicans reject the Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000aThe causes here are multiple, most having nothing to do with Trump. Republicans are deeply divided on the proper role of government in health care. This division is compounded by the sea change in public opinion as, over seven years, Obamacare has become part of the fabric of American medicine, and health care has come to be seen as a right rather than a commodity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the stunning Senate rejection of repeal was also a pointed rejection of Trump's health care hectoring. And a show of senatorial disdain for Trump craving a personal legislative "win" on an issue about whose policy choices he knew nothing and cared less.\u000a\u000a4) The Boy Scouts protest.\u000a\u000aIn a rebuke not as earthshaking but still telling, the chief executive of the Boy Scouts found it necessary to apologize for the president's speech last week to their quadrennial jamboree. It was a wildly inappropriate confection, at once whining, self-referential, partisan and political.\u000a\u000aHow do you blow a speech to Boy Scouts? No merit badge for the big guy.\u000a\u000a5) The police chiefs chide.\u000a\u000aIn an address to law enforcement officials, Trump gave a wink and a nod to cops roughing up suspects. Several police chiefs subsequently reprimanded Trump for encouraging police brutality \u2014 a mild form, perhaps, but brutality still.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was all a joke. Nonsense. It was an ugly sentiment, expressed coyly enough to be waved away as humor but with the thuggish undertone of a man who, heckled at a campaign rally, once said approvingly that in the old days "guys like that" would "be carried out on a stretcher."\u000a\u000aWhatever your substantive position on the various issues involved above, we should all be grateful that from the generals to the Scouts, from the senators to the cops, the institutions of both political and civil society are holding up well.\u000a\u000aTrump is a systemic stress test. The results are good, thus far.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCharles Krauthammer is a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist, published weekly in more than 400 newspapers worldwide.

aVIt may be no coincidence that some of the greatest literary names had a love for alcohol \u2014 think Hemingway, Poe, and Faulkner \u2014 drinking may have given their creativity a boost and helped them plow through mental blocks that stifled their productivity. According to a study from Austria's University of Graz, alcohol relaxes areas in the brain and allows thoughts to be more creative.\u000a\u000aAmounts as small as a glass of wine or beer will do the trick say researchers.\u000a\u000aResearchers gave people either beer or a non-alcoholic beer that tasted the same. They were then given tasks, such as a word association test determining what word linked Swiss, blue, and cake. Those who drank alcohol were much more likely to get the correct answer \u2014 cheese. Those who drank alcohol were also more likely to do better on a creative thinking problem, deciding a tire was used more creatively as a lampshade than as a swing.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to do this study because alcohol is so linked with creativity, and great writers like Ernest Hemingway," lead author Dr. Mathias Benedek told Daily Mail. "Previous research has found almost half of the great writers had a history of drinking.\u000a\u000a"We found that a small drink can indeed help with certain aspects of creativity, although it may make hard, focused work more difficult.\u000a\u000a"So, it might well work for someone who is sitting down to do creative writing or brainstorming ideas in a boardroom," Benedek concluded.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple of theories explaining why alcohol helps with creativity. One is it may give your mind the freedom to explore alternate ways of solving a problem. The other is that alcohol allows you to access your unconscious mind to find alternative solutions, Benedek said.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition.\u000a\u000aOther studies have also found a link between creativity and alcohol, such as a study at the University of Illinois which found that drinkers who were brainstorming ideas outperformed non-drinkers 4 to 1 when given creative tasks.\u000a\u000aHow does alcohol unleash creativity? It could be its ability to help drinkers relax. Researcher Mark Beeman from Northwestern University found that thinking too hard blocked the creative process, but when volunteers were relaxed, they were more likely to have a "Eureka" moment.

aVThe U.S. Constitution only speaks to voting in federal elections. It's silent on voting requirements and protocols for state and local elections.\u000a\u000aThe Constitution addresses voting and requirements for congressional and presidential elections and speaks to the rights of citizens to vote generally in federal elections.\u000a\u000aRatified in 1791, the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution declares, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."\u000a\u000aTherein lies the voting conundrum. The Constitution is clear that only "citizens" are eligible to vote in federal elections, yet non-citizens may be able to vote in state and local elections \u2014 if state law allows it. Therefore, legal and non-legal aliens are eligible to vote in state and local elections in states permitting non-citizen voting.\u000a\u000aIn 1996, in an effort to strengthen federal voting integrity, Congress passed a law that the president signed. A law providing penalties for non-citizens voting in federal elections.\u000a\u000aThere is a problem with granting non-citizens the vote in state and local elections.\u000a\u000aThe federal government relies on states to administer federal elections. That means states register voters at the local level, maintain voter roles, and set rules for voting in federal, state, and local elections.\u000a\u000aThere aren\u2019t two sets of records \u2014 one for state and local elections and one for federal elections. There is clear and present danger that because voting records are co-mingled \u2014 non-citizens may vote in federal elections because they appear on state and local voting records as duly "registered voters."\u000a\u000aSince 1926, no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state elections, but that does not mean it will not happen in the future. Today, there are 11 local governments allowing non-citizens to vote. In Maryland, 10 local governments permit such voting in all local elections. San Francisco, Calif. allows non-citizens parents to vote in school board elections.\u000a\u000aThe co-mingling of voter records by local governments that allow for non-resident voting could taint federal elections, causing both illegal and unintended results.\u000a\u000aThe federal government must protect the integrity of its own elections by setting forth \u2014 by law \u2014 what states are required to do in the administration of federal elections.\u000a\u000aWith over 12 million or more non-citizens illegally living and working in the U.S. there is a real danger that voter fraud is occurring during federal, state, and local elections. There is waste, fraud, and abuse in every government program \u2014 it is simply a matter and question of degree.\u000a\u000aSo, you can bet that if there is fraud in Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and welfare by non-citizens, there is likely also to be fraud in voting registrations and voting nationally as well.\u000a\u000aThis is why it is vitally important for our nation to get a handle on voting integrity by federal, state, and local officials working together to institute uniform standards of record keeping, sharing, administration, voter registration, and voting protocols.\u000a\u000aWhen a state's right infringes on a federal constitutional right \u2014 there is a serious problem, one which must be addressed immediately by Congress and/or the courts.\u000a\u000aToday, we have 50 different states with 50 different and convoluted standards and protocols for both registration and voting. This is an invitation for voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement.\u000a\u000aIf states and local governments want to allow non-citizens to vote that is their business, as long as as their laws are not at odds with the Constitution.\u000a\u000aVoting in federal, state and local elections should be an exclusive right to citizens only, and only those invested, as citizens with all the rights and obligations thereto, should have the right to vote. Transients should not be accorded a citizen's rights and privileges.\u000a\u000aBradley Blakeman was a member of President George W. Bush's senior White House staff from 2001 to 2004.

Representing the United States at the dinner was Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.\u000a\u000aBefore Tillerson's trip, the U.S. had said he had no plans to interact with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, who was spotted at the gala smiling and toasting with the other foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aTensions have risen the past several months as North Korea has conducted nuclear weapons testing, and concerns heightened with two successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles which experts say could possibly reach the United States. North Korea is in violation of international law and of U.N. Security Council resolutions by conducting the tests.\u000a\u000aThough the U.S. is interested in negotiating with North Korea, Tillerson said this week such talks would have to be predicated on the North giving up its nuclear weapons aspirations and that the conditions for such talks haven't yet been met by North Korea's government.

aVGrowing your own food provides many benefits including saving money, enjoying chemical-free foods, the enjoyment of working with nature, high food quality, and more. If you\u2019ve always dreamt of keeping a vegetable garden but your home doesn\u2019t sit on acres of sunny land, don\u2019t fret. You can grow your own healthy food in small spaces with these tips.\u000a\u000aAlert: Heart Surgeon's Secret to Healthy Blood Pressure\u000a\u000a1. Break convention \u2013 If you have nothing more than a sunny front stoop in the city, take after Gayla Trail of You Grow Girl, and plant containers you might otherwise use for annual flowers with edibles instead. Besides the obvious choice of growing herbs and greens, Gayla recommends dwarf varieties of cherry tomatoes and hot peppers.\u000a\u000a2. Square foot gardening \u2013 This ingenious method of planting was developed by gardener and author Mel Bartholomew and involves planting with minimal spacing between plants in raised beds. According to Olivia\u2019s Solutions, a square foot garden requires 80% less space than a traditional row-planted garden.\u000a\u000a3. Go vertical \u2013 Just as building a skyscraper in a crowded city maximizes space, so too does planting vertically. By growing crops that can be trellised or trained to go up a structure such as cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, and peas, you can maximize food from each precious inch of your garden, says Mother Earth News.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a4. Plant small varieties \u2013 If you don\u2019t have abundant space, you may have to forgo your dreams of planting pumpkins or winter squash. However, in the world of plants, there are seemingly endless different varieties, many of which require only a small sunny space. For instance, Mother Earth News says \u2018Ophelia\u2019 eggplant needs only a container to grow, \u2018Bush delicata\u2019 squash is a compact summer squash that won\u2019t take over the garden, and \u2018Totem\u2019 tomato plants top out at just 2 feet.\u000a\u000a5. Try edible landscaping \u2013 According to Rosalind Creasy, this means integrating edibles in to your otherwise ornamental landscape. That could mean planting colorful Swiss chard among the colorful annuals that flank your front walkway or tucking pollinator-friendly dill or mint into a perennial border.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Secret Water Cure to Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVThe man responsible for creating the password advice we've all been using for the last 20 years now says he was wrong.\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch of what I did I now regret,\u201d retired former National Institute of Standards and Technology manager Bill Burr, now 72, told The Wall Street Journal.\u000a\u000aBurr wrote the unofficial rules regarding how to choose a strong password, including using a mix of letters, numbers and symbols and changing passwords every 90 days.\u000a\u000aAfter 20 years of studying the passwords users chose for their accounts, the document written by Burr was rewritten in June to reflect the latest thinking and observations about strong passwords.\u000a\u000aPaul Grassi, an NIST adviser who led the rewrite, said his group didn\u2019t think much of a revision would be needed, but they \u201cended up starting from scratch\u201d to determine what actually works best in choosing strong passwords, the WSJ reported.\u000a\u000aIt turned out that using special characters didn\u2019t make passwords much harder to crack, but they did make passwords harder to remember and keep track of. And changing passwords every 90 days didn\u2019t help much either, especially if the change was only a slight one, the WSJ said.\u000a\u000aThe new guidelines state that a long, easy-to-remember phrase is more effective than a shorter password with strange characters. It would actually take 550 years for a computer to decode a phrase like \u201ccorrect horse battery staple,\u201d cartoonist Randall Munroe calculated, and only three days to decode \u201cTr0ub4dor&3,\u201d at 1000 guesses per second.\u000a\u000aGrassi praised the longevity of Burr\u2019s guidelines despite their replacement, saying, \u201cI only hope to be able to have a document hold up [10 to 15 years],\u201d the WSJ reported.\u000a\u000aBiometric data such as a fingerprint or retinal scan also was recommended for password use whenever possible.

aVWe need narratives. We build our lives around them. We want to see heroes rise and succeed\u2014and we want to see villains meet their dastardly end.\u000a\u000aThis theme of good and evil plays out everywhere. Books, movies, video games, you name it. It creates a conflict that can be resolved in a satisfactory way.\u000a\u000aWe try to bring it to real life too. But the real world is a lot messier than it is on a page or the silver screen.\u000a\u000aConsider Martin Shkreli. Last week, the hedge fund manager\u2019s trial ended. He was found guilty on three of the eight counts, and now faces sentencing. There\u2019s something downright Shakespearean about the whole thing.\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ve probably heard the name. That\u2019s because Shkreli rose to infamy for buying up a drug off-patent, then increasing the price 5,000 percent. It was easy to portray the jump in price of a life-saving drug as the closest thing to a real-world Bond villain we\u2019re likely to get.\u000a\u000aBeyond that, Shkreli has the kind of take-no-prisoners attitude that makes President Trump look like a seasoned and deferential diplomat. His attitude during his initial hearing last summer was to get it over with so he could go play the video game Pokmon Go.\u000a\u000aBut raising the price of a drug isn\u2019t why Shkreli was on trial. He was accused of securities frauds at one of his former hedge funds. The fact that he was found not guilty on more than half the counts raises dubious questions.\u000a\u000aWe live in a litigious society, and going to trial is expensive. Prosecutors have learned over the years to over-charge the accused. The intent is to get them to agree to a plea deal, which saves the expenses of a trial for both sides. But the end result is that people will plea to something they didn\u2019t do, rather than risk the possibility of a worse sentence.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a rotten system, and a miscarriage of justice for a system that\u2019s supposed to give everyone the right to a fair and meaningful trial. Being overcharged simply shows the fact that someone as despised as Shkreli can be overcharged too. It\u2019s hard to make frivolous charges stick as long as jurors are honest about the facts and evidence presented\u2014even against a real-world villain.\u000a\u000aWhile it\u2019s clear from last week\u2019s ruling that Shkreli did wrong during his time at a hedge fund, the waters get murkier as we look past that to his role in raising drug prices.\u000a\u000aCan I call Shkreli a villain? Of course. But the best villains have a sense of humanity in them that really makes their actions tragic. I can also recognize that he has a tremendous analytical skill. And that, if he had been mentored in a way that instilled a sense of ethics, he\u2019d be out there managing a successful pharmaceutical company right now, rather than winning the \u201cmost hated man in America\u201d award.\u000a\u000aThink about it this way: Shkreli found an off-patent drug with no competitors that he could acquire cheaply, and then turn around and raise the price. If he had taken a different tack of gradually raising the price over time, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten all the negative press and publicity. And by raising the price 5,000 percent overnight, he sent a signal to others in the pharma industry that they should be making generic versions of the drug too.\u000a\u000aCapitalism entails competition. Competition keeps players honest. But the drug industry has patents\u2014and for a good reason. It can take years for a drug to pass muster, up to and including FDA approval. In some cases, it can even take up to a decade. These drugs cost millions of dollars to develop before the first batch is ready for consumption. Entrepreneurs should get some kind of compensation for taking the risk. After all, for every successful drug out there, there are plenty that didn\u2019t make the cut. Those cost millions to develop too.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s clearly something Shkreli understood. He just went about it the wrong way. And now society is worse off\u2014whether from higher drug prices for those who need it, or from those who could benefit from Shkreli\u2019s skills and knowledge. That\u2019s why Shkreli is more hated than Bernie Madoff\u2014Madoff mostly ripped off the rich with his Ponzi Scheme. Madoff did more damage in dollar terms, but Shkreli jacked up prices on something that people needed to live.\u000a\u000aBut hey, we got our villain, right? That\u2019s a happy ending, isn\u2019t it?\u000a\u000aMaybe not.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a German word that\u2019s come to mind as I\u2019ve read through all the hot takes on Shkreli. It\u2019s called schadenfreude.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a compound of the words \u201charm\u201d and \u201cjoy.\u201d Essentially, it means \u201chappiness at the misfortune of others.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a lot of that going around too. It apparently isn\u2019t enough that we got the bad guy. Now we can revel in the fact that he\u2019s had his day in the court, and ultimately lost. There\u2019s a lot of schadenfreude at play when it comes to business. We can be gleeful when a bank we had trouble with as a customer falls on hard times. Or when someone who has been making your work life miserable gets the layoff axe.\u000a\u000aBut what does that say about us? Maybe that deep down, we have the same flaws as the people we think of as villains. And while we may be the hero to our own story, we might be a villain in someone else\u2019s\u2014and don\u2019t even know it.\u000a\u000aAs humans, we crave a good narrative. But the world is much more complex than that. We can be grateful that justice has been done against Martin Shkreli and his behavior. But it\u2019s not worth reveling over. If he can reform himself and improve his behavior, he can yet provide tremendous value to society in the years ahead.\u000a\u000aAnd that\u2019s the greatest narrative of all: the villain, overcoming their evil nature through great effort, rising to become a hero. That\u2019s the ending I want to see with Shkreli. It\u2019ll take years and prison time to see if it plays out. Here\u2019s hoping. It\u2019s better than schadenfreude.\u000a\u000aBut at the end of the day, what we really know from this whole ordeal as investors is to stay away from flashy management\u2014when they go down, they damage their shareholders as well,\u000a\u000aAndrew Packer is a Senior Financial Editor with Newsmax Media. He currently writes the Insider Hotline investment advisory, serves as investment director for the Financial Braintrust, and writes the monthly newsletter Crisis Point Investor.

aVVeteran NBA star forward Zach Randolph was arrested on a marijuana charge after several police cars were vandalized when a large gathering became unruly at a Los Angeles housing project, authorities said Thursday.\u000a\u000aRandolph, 36, was taken into custody late Wednesday on suspicion of possessing marijuana with intent to sell, according to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Liliana Preciado.\u000a\u000a"The charges are false and misleading," Randolph's agent and attorney Raymond Brothers told The Associated Press on Thursday. "We're looking at all options to resolve this matter."\u000a\u000aPolice on patrol observed a crowd drinking, smoking pot, blasting music and blocking streets at the Nickerson Gardens project in Watts, Preciado said.\u000a\u000aOfficers called for backup when the crowd grew and people began throwing bottles and rocks.\u000a\u000aFive police cars and one sheriff's vehicle ended up with smashed windows and slashed tires. No officers were hurt.\u000a\u000aOfficers also arrested Stanley Walton, 43, on suspicion of carrying a gun as an ex-convict, Preciado said. She didn't know if Walton has an attorney.\u000a\u000aPolice recovered two guns, impounded two vehicles and seized narcotics, Preciado said.\u000a\u000aRandolph, a 16-year league veteran, spent 8 seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies before signing with the Sacramento Kings in July. Representatives for the Kings did not immediately return calls seeking comment Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe two-time NBA All-Star played for Michigan State University before being drafted in 2001 by the Portland Trail Blazers.

aVScientists have the first major evidence that blood tests called liquid biopsies hold promise for screening people for cancer. Hong Kong doctors tried it for a type of head and neck cancer, and boosted early detection and one measure of survival.\u000a\u000aThe tests detect DNA that tumors shed into the blood. Some are used now to monitor cancer patients, and many companies are trying to develop versions of these for screening, as possible alternatives to mammograms, colonoscopies and other such tests. The new study shows this approach can work, at least for this one form of cancer and in a country where it's common.\u000a\u000a"This work is very exciting on the larger scale" because it gives a blueprint for how to make tests for other tumor types such as lung or breast, said Dr. Dennis Lo of Chinese University of Hong Kong. "We are brick by brick putting that technology into place."\u000a\u000aHe led the study , published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine. Lo is best known for discovering that fetal DNA can be found in a mom's blood, which launched a new era of non-invasive testing for pregnant women.\u000a\u000aThe study involved nasopharyngeal cancer, which forms at the top of the throat behind the nose. It's a good test case for DNA screening because it's an aggressive cancer where early detection matters a lot, and screening could be tried in a population where the cancer is most common \u2014 middle-aged Chinese men.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Epstein-Barr virus is involved in most cases, so tests could hunt for viral DNA that tumors shed into the blood in large quantities, rather than rare bits of cancer cells themselves.\u000a\u000aAbout 20,000 men were screened, and viral DNA was found in 1,112, or 5.5 percent. Of those, 309 also had the DNA on confirmatory tests a month later. After endoscope and MRI exams, 34 turned out to have cancer.\u000a\u000aMore cases were found at the earliest stage \u2014 71 percent versus only 20 percent of a comparison group of men who had been treated for nasopharyngeal cancer over the previous five years. That's important because early cases often are cured with radiation alone, but more advanced ones need chemotherapy and treatment is less successful.\u000a\u000aScreening also seemed to improve how many survived without worsening disease \u2014 97 percent at three years versus 70 percent of the comparison group.\u000a\u000aOnly one person who tested negative on screening developed nasopharyngeal cancer within a year.\u000a\u000aThe researchers estimate 593 people would need to be screened at a total cost of $28,600 to identify one cancer case. It may be worth it in Hong Kong, but maybe not in places like the U.S. where the disease is rare, and more people would have to be screened at a greater cost to find each case, said Dr. Richard Ambinder of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who wrote a commentary in the journal.\u000a\u000aStill, "this is showing that liquid biopsies have great promise," he said. "This is an advance that will indeed save lives."\u000a\u000aThe study was sponsored by an Asian foundation and the Hong Kong government. Lo and some other authors founded Cirina, a Hong Kong-based company focused on early cancer detection, and get royalties related to DNA blood tests. In May, Cirina merged with Grail Inc., a California company working on cancer screening blood tests with more than $1 billion from drug companies and big-name investors such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.

aVPeople who smoke marijuana have a three times greater risk of dying from hypertension, or high blood pressure, than those who have never used the drug, scientists said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe risk grows with every year of use, they said.\u000a\u000aThe findings, from a study of some 1,200 people, could have implications in the United States among other countries. Several states have legalised marijuana and others are moving towards it. It is decriminalised in a number of other countries.\u000a\u000a"Support for liberal marijuana use is partly due to claims that it is beneficial and possibly not harmful to health," said Barbara Yankey, who co-led the research at the school of public health at Georgia State University in the United States.\u000a\u000a"It is important to establish whether any health benefits outweigh the potential health, social and economic risks. If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public."\u000a\u000aMarijuana is also sometimes used for medicinal purposes, such as for glaucoma.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, was a retrospective follow-up study of 1,213 people aged 20 or above who had been involved in a large and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2005\u20132006, they were asked if they had ever used marijuana.\u000a\u000aFor Yankey's study, information on marijuana use was merged with mortality data in 2011 from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, and adjusted for confounding factors such as tobacco smoking and variables including sex, age and ethnicity.\u000a\u000aThe average duration of use among users of marijuana, or cannabis, was 11.5 years.\u000a\u000aThe results showed marijuana users had a 3.42-times higher risk of death from hypertension than non-users, and a 1.04 greater risk for each year of use.\u000a\u000aThere was no link between marijuana use and dying from heart or cerebrovascular diseases such as strokes.\u000a\u000aYankey said were limitations in the way marijuana use was assessed -- including that researchers could not be sure whether people had used the drug continuously since they first tried it.\u000a\u000aBut she said the results chimed with plausible risks, since marijuana is known to affect the cardiovascular system.\u000a\u000a"Marijuana stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increases in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen demand," she said.\u000a\u000aExperts not directly involved in the study said its findings would need to be replicated, but already raised concerns.\u000a\u000a"Despite the widely held view that cannabis is benign, this research adds to previous work suggesting otherwise," said Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at Britain's York University.

The idea that there are no limits on journalists, what does that mean? Does that mean that the New York Times and CNN can publish our launch codes? No, of course not," Gorka told Rita Cosby, guest host of Newsmax's "The Todd Schnitt Show."\u000a\u000a"A free press is essential to a free society, but that does not mean you are completely immune from the laws that pertain to the national security of all Americans."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Kelly address all the employees in the Eisenhower Executive Building \u2013 that's next to the West Wing \u2013 yes I am [encouraged]," he said.\u000a\u000a"In the first five months of this administration we've had 62 national security leaks in comparison to the first five months of the Obama administration that had eight leaks in the first five months of the Bush administration that had nine leaks. This is outrageous, it endangers all Americans and we will stop it."\u000a\u000aGorka, a counterinsurgency and counterterrorism expert, is the author of "Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War."

aVPresident Donald Trump's "hyperbole and overheated rhetoric" toward North Korea are raising questions about whether he is showing the kind of judgment and temperament that are appropriate for handling the growing tensions between the two nations, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a frequent critic of the president, said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"Not since Harry Truman, in fact, has this kind of 'reign of ruin,' I think those were Harry Truman's words after the Hiroshima attack to pressure the Japanese into surrendering, in effect, a threat of another nuclear attack, has any president used this kind of rhetoric," the Connecticut Democrat told MSNBC's "Andrea Mitchell Reports" program.\u000a\u000aFurther, he said, the fact that Trump threatened North Korea with "fire and fury" without his words being reviewed or vetted by his national security team raises even more questions about the processes being used in the White House.\u000a\u000a"[This is] a process that will involve the most serious decisions about war and peace, and we should all recognize there's no such thing as a quick, easy preemptive strike here," said Blumenthal. "We're not talking about sending a missile or 60 missiles as was done in Syria to wipe out a hangar. A preemptive strike leads to war. And as Gen. [James] Mattis observed so powerfully, it is war that will be more devastating than we've seen many of us in our lifetime."\u000a\u000aBlumenthal said he is also "deeply concerned" about North Korea's capabilities for cyber warfare.\u000a\u000a"The cyber capabilities of the North Koreans and our adversaries are well beyond what the public understands," said Blumenthal. "In some of the briefings we've had in the Armed Services Committee, we've asked what some of the greatest threats are, [and] some military leaders say cyber."\u000a\u000aThe nation needs to be mindful about building its cyber defenses, but also declaring what would construe an act of war on the United States during the course of a cyberattack.\u000a\u000a"Sen. [John] McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I have repeatedly raised with officials of this administration and of past administrations the lack of clear policy to define what is an act of war that will prompt the kind of response that we need to do," he said. "The Russian attack on our election system, in my view was an act of war."\u000a\u000aThat attack used cyber warfare, not a military strike, but it still was an attack, Blumenthal said.\u000a\u000aHe told the program that in his view, if North Korea uses such warfare to attack financial institutions in the United States or South Korea, that "may well" constitute an act of war.\u000a\u000aBlumenthal also commented on the news that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's home was raided by the FBI last month, calling it a "stunning development."\u000a\u000aHe said he knows as a former U.S. attorney that such tactics are used in the "most serious investigations" when dealing with a target or witness who is uncooperative and not trusted.\u000a\u000a"A judge would demand clear, persuasive evidence of probable cause that a crime has been committed and that the individual, Paul Manafort, is connected with that crime," he said.

aVFinancial markets haven\u2019t really reacted much to the escalation in tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, and some observers explain that it\u2019s largely because in the worst-case scenario it\u2019s impossible to guess the appropriate price for things like stocks and bonds.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s hard to price a potentially extinction event (at least for much of the Korean peninsula)," is how Timothy Ash, a senior strategist at Bluebay Asset Management in London, puts it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a point also made by Mark Mobius, the Templeton Emerging Markets Group executive chairman and apostle for emerging-market investing.\u000a\u000aHe said in a May interview about the prospect of a North Korean nuclear conflict: "there\u2019s nothing you can do about it -- if something breaks out, we\u2019re all finished anyway.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaybe that\u2019s why the worst day this year for the Kospi index of South Korean stocks was July 28, which was all about a global tech-stock retreat and nothing to do with geopolitics.

aVWhile some in America complain about President Trump, in Israel he is a rock star.\u000a\u000aI just left Israel after meeting with top officials, media personalities, tech entrepreneurs, and many citizens from all walks of life.\u000a\u000aThe overwhelming view was that America was lucky to have a strong and resolute president like Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are well informed and especially clued in on U.S. media \u2013 many can catch CNN and Fox News on TV \u2013 and they expressed bafflement to me that the American media has been so hostile to President Trump.\u000a\u000aFor the Jewish state, Trump is a breath of fresh air. After eight years of Obama, who tilted U.S. policy toward Iran and gave Israel a cold shoulder, many are breathing a sigh of relief.\u000a\u000aA recent Jerusalem Post poll found that 61 percent of Israel's Jews believe Trump is "pro-Israel" and a Pew survey of all nations found Israel to be the second strongest supporter of Trump, with 56 percent saying they had full confidence in him. (The first was the Philippines with 69 percent expressing support.)\u000a\u000aSenior Israeli officials I spoke with say President Trump has been the most supportive of any U.S. president in recent memory, including George W. Bush, who also was quite popular.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are on the front line of freedom. They are surrounded by hostile states. In their mind, appeasement is dangerous and there is little margin for error when their security is at stake.\u000a\u000aOne high-ranking Israeli official told me that the equation for Israel has changed because of three key Trump officials: Jared Kushner, the president's special adviser, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aKushner, to whom the president has given the task of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, understands that Israel is the cornerstone of regional stability.\u000a\u000aPrevious administrations typically began their peace process by blaming Israel. Kushner took a different approach by affirming Israel as a U.S. ally.\u000a\u000aBoth Mattis and McMaster, the official said, grasp the strategic role Israel has played for U.S. security in the region and they have been stalwart in their support.\u000a\u000aToday, under Trump, ISIS is being crushed.\u000a\u000aQatar, a Gulf state that has "played both sides" but consistently helps fund the bad guys, including the Muslim Brotherhood, is being contained.\u000a\u000aTrump is also taking Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism as a great threat to the region. Trump has been praised for being willing to tackle the Iranian problem as he is tackling North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump's outreach to Putin could be crucial in dealing with Iran and North Korea, one official said.\u000a\u000aI first came to Israel at the age of 19 as a college student.\u000a\u000aLife was challenging back then, but the people haven't changed. Israel is a nation of realists.\u000a\u000aThey see President Trump for what he is, a champion of freedom and security.\u000a\u000aChristopher Ruddy is CEO of Newsmax Media, Inc., one of the country's leading conservative news outlets.

aVIt can be tough for people with diabetes to choose appropriate over-the-counter medicines for a cold, cough or headache, a pharmacist explains.\u000a\u000aMany of these so-called OTC drugs contain carbohydrates (including sugar) that can affect blood sugar levels, or ingredients that can interact with diabetes medications, according to Miranda Wilhelm. She is a clinical associate professor at Southern Illinois University School of Pharmacy.\u000a\u000aBut labels on OTC medicines don't list carbohydrates, she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm was to present a report on the topic Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, in Indianapolis.\u000a\u000a"It's a dilemma because in some cases the carbs are so high it's equivalent to a snack," Wilhelm said in an association news release.\u000a\u000a"On the other hand, if you actually read the ingredients, you might be afraid to take something that's safe and could help with symptoms. In other words, you may not be limited to OTC medicines that are formulated for people with diabetes, and that's surprising for most people with the condition," she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm offered the following advice:\u000a\u000aGood diabetes management is important. "If your A1C levels are well-managed and your blood pressure is at or near your goal, you should be fine taking most OTC medicines -- whether or not they contain carbohydrates -- if you just need them for a few days," she said.\u000a\u000aRead the label. "If you're concerned about your blood sugar levels, look for medicines labeled 'sugar-free' or 'for people with diabetes,'" Wilhem suggested.\u000a\u000aTake pills instead of liquids. Liquid forms of medicines typically contain more carbohydrates, and sometimes as much alcohol as a glass of beer or wine, she said.\u000a\u000aIf possible, choose a "topical" medicine. The reason: They don't get into your bloodstream. For example, a nasal spray is better for treating a stuffy nose than a medicine you take by mouth. If you have muscle pain, ice the area and use a skin cream that treats pain instead of taking Motrin, Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen).\u000a\u000aGet OTC recommendations from health professionals. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you avoid ingredients that would interact with your other medicines. Check labels for ingredients that can pose problems, such as caffeine and acetaminophen.\u000a\u000a"Something that says it's safe for people with diabetes is fine, but if it doesn't address your symptoms, it's not going to help you, meaning it's medicine you don't need," Wilhelm said.

aVThe Missouri Highway Patrol is still searching for a man wanted in the murder of a Missouri police officer, The Kansas City Star reported Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"We're following up any leads," Sgt. Bill Lowe told reporters in Chilhowee earlier Tuesday where officers had surrounded a home. "Any lead we get is a good lead until we deem that it didn't work out."\u000a\u000aIan James McCarthy, 39, allegedly shot officer Gary Michael, 37, late Sunday during a traffic stop and fled in his SUV before crashing it a few blocks away. He then abandoned the vehicle and escaped on foot.\u000a\u000a"We've searched a school, we've searched buses, we've searched wooded areas, we've searched another home in Clinton," Lowe said. "This is no different. We're doing everything we can to find him."\u000a\u000aMichael, who had been with the Clinton Police Department for less than a year, was shot in the chest with what was described as a "long gun." Police afterward found a .223 rifle casing on the seat of McCarthy's SUV.

aVCoinbase Inc., the digital currency exchange that in the past two months suffered a trading crash and upset customers over how it handled the bitcoin split, received a $100 million investment from a group led by IVP.\u000a\u000aSpark Capital, Greylock Partners, Battery Ventures, Section 32 and Draper Associates also participated, according to a statement Thursday. Coinbase plans to use the money to expand its engineering and customer support staff, open a New York office for its professional trading platform GDAX and grow Toshi, \u201ca mobile browser for the ethereum network that provides universal access to financial services,\u201d said Megan Hernbroth, a spokeswoman.\u000a\u000aFounded in 2012, San Francisco-based Coinbase said it has seen \u201cunprecedented growth\u201d over the last year as it helped customers buy and sell more than $25 billion worth of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. Cryptocurrencies have seen enormous price gains -- bitcoin is up 250 percent year to date -- trouncing other asset classes amid an explosion of attention, but there are growing pains.\u000a\u000aOn June 21, ether crashed to 10 cents from $317.81 on Coinbase\u2019s GDAX exchange. The cause was a single $12.5 million trade -- one of the biggest ever -- that triggered further selling. It all happened in just 45 milliseconds, after which computer algorithms started buying, driving prices back up to $300 within 10 seconds. \u201cWe have reimbursed all customers affected,\u201d Hernbroth said. To help prevent a repeat of the ether crash, Coinbase is considering developing circuit breakers that would pause trading to prevent accidents after consulting with industry experts including the New York Stock Exchange, which has an investment in the company.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, the bitcoin community updated the software it runs to increase the amount of transactions the network can process. In so doing, it created a new digital currency known as bitcoin cash. Initially, Coinbase said it wouldn\u2019t support access to bitcoin cash for its customers, which angered many and led to threats of lawsuits, according to Fortune magazine.\u000a\u000aCoinbase has subsequently said it would allow customers to access their bitcoin cash by Jan. 1.\u000a\u000aHernbroth said they\u2019ll hit the Jan. 1 deadline \u201cassuming no additional risks emerge.\u201d

aVA "rally cat" appeared in Busch Stadium on Wednesday. It was the sixth inning, with the Cardinals trailing the Kansas City Royals. What happened next is why the ever-superstitious St. Louis fans want the cat to become a regular.\u000a\u000aThe kitty was ejected and then Yadier Molina hit the next pitch for a grand slam home run, giving the Cardinals an 8-5 lead (which also ended up being the game's final score).\u000a\u000aHere's our little hero, the Rally Cat (although the grounds crew guy might say differently). #STLCards pic.twitter.com/OrR2IFAv8d \u2014 FOX Sports Midwest (@FSMidwest) August 10, 2017\u000a\u000aThe cat, which headed for the centerfield wall, was retrieved by a member of the Busch Stadium grounds, identified by KMOX as Lucas Hackman.

America offers a plethora of roadside attractions, often in out-of-the-way locations, some educational, some beautiful, and some just downright weird and wacky, but all guaranteed to make visiting them well worth the drive.In anticipation of highway season, Newsmax has gathered up a list of the 50 best roadside Americana attractions for your touristing enjoyment.\u2014 This attraction features 38 cars spray-painted gray and stacked exactly like the famous Stonehenge monument in England, and you can spray paint the cars yourself.\u2014 It boasts three acres of miniature replicas of the world's most famous cathedrals and architectural wonders, such as the Great Wall of China, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, St. Paul's Cathedral in Rome, and others.\u2014 This installation of 10 classic cars is buried diagonally, nose first, at the exact same angle of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. Why? Who knows. It's art \u2014 just look at it.\u2014 Don't miss this stop where you can see scads of 20-foot-tall statues, including the Muffler Man, the bikinied Uniroyal Gal, a tanning, beer-sipping surfer, and many more.\u2014 It stands 134 feet tall and registers a constant 134 degrees in recognition of the day the temperature hit that high point in the town, located very close to Death Valley.\u2014 With such oddities as a giant human foot statue standing 11 feet tall, a huge levitated coffee cup pouring out a stream of java, a giant pair of pliers topped with a huge cockroach, and others courtesy of sculptor Ken Nyberg, this is a must-see.\u2014 With more than 50,000 flattened beer cans as siding, and dangling beer can wind chimes, the house also has marble, rock, and wood landscaping ever since the day when owner John Milkovisch got tired of mowing his lawn.\u2014 This stop contains of around 20 amazing matchstick creations, including a 1/70th scale model of the USS Iowa battleship, a large scale model of Notre Dame Cathedral, and a "Plane Loco" sculpture, a winged train made up of more than 1 million matchsticks.\u2014 Erected 77 years ago at the Benewah Creamery Company, these landmarks stand 38 feet tall and 15 feet wide.\u2014 Though it may look like you've just arrived in Alaska, this building \u2014 a vintage ice plant \u2014 is actually built from stucco and mica, which glistens in the sun and gives the impression of being made of ice. It dates back to 1932.\u2014 This scientific research facility, made largely of glass, contains enclosed biomes, including a savannah grassland, an ocean reef, a rain forest, a fog desert, and mangrove wetlands, as well as human living quarters.\u2014 The whale structure, measuring 80 feet from its tail to its wide, toothy grin, can be seen basking in a pond. Located on Route 66, the whale was built in the 1970s as an anniversary gift.\u2014 These near life-sized sculptures of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, an Apatosaurus, and others also include a creationism museum. The attraction also features Dinny the Dinosaur, an enormous 150-ton building shaped like a brontosaurus.\u2014 This 900-pound sculpture of Old Saint Nick reading a Christmas letter from a child is actually an advertisement for the nearby Santa Claus House, a store where Christmas never ends.\u2014 Make sure to stop by this 50-foot-tall mountain covered in 100,000 gallons of paint, plastered with Biblical sayings and colorful drawings, with a cross planted on top. Artist Leonard Knight spent 30 years on his mission to create a "tribute to God."\u2014 This venue pays homage to the barbed wire that made fencing cattle lands possible and led to civilization in the early West. The museum has examples of more than 2,000 types of barbed wire and barbed wire sculptures.\u2014 Stop and marvel at this four-tower chateau made of beer cans, hubcaps, and scrap metal by its owner, Donald "Cano" Espinoza.\u2014 This attraction features a 600-pound clown's head atop a 50-foot silo at Wild Bill's Nostalgia Center. The head rises up out of the silo. The clown head once belonged to Bob Keeshan, famed as Captain Kangaroo and Clarabel the Clown.\u2014 The home of the former president boasts a 13-foot-tall statue of a peanut bearing Carter's trademark toothy grin.\u2014 This 135-acre roadside stop complex is fronted by its mascot, a 97-foot-tall statue of "Pedro," a Mexican bandito, and a 200-foot-tall "Sombrero Tower." The stopover has a motel, gas stations, restaurants, gift shops, and a fireworks store, all constructed in faux adobe in keeping with the Mexican theme.\u2014 Standing an impressive 27 feet tall, this attraction is actually an operating B&B, with a room inside the beagle.\u2014 At 65 years old and 70 feet tall, the structure serves as a water tower and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\u2014 It started out as a baseball, but now it's a 4,200-pound gargantuan ball of paint, created by 24,350 coats of paint over 40 years.\u2014 This landmark is a 22-ton concrete and iron structure memorializing those who bought in Oklahoma's oil boom. It stands 76 feet tall and has its massive arm resting on an oil derrick.\u2014 Weighing 19,973 pounds, measuring 41.42 feet in circumference, and standing more than 10 feet all, the ball is still growing.\u2014 Home of the famed Louisville Slugger, the bat is a 68,000 pound, 120-foot-long replica of Babe Ruth's famous bat. It is located at the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory, which also contains a giant limestone baseball glove.\u2014 Ready and waiting for when the actor shuffles off the mortal realm, this pyramid-shaped, 10-foot-tall tomb bears the inscription, "Omnia Ab Uno," or "Everything From One."\u2014 It's just what it sounds like \u2014 a 19-foot-tall concrete gorilla holding a gold Volkswagen Beetle in his outstretched left hand, while his right hand reaches down, palm up, providing a seat for anyone who cares to sit and admire the car.\u2014 It began as a mission of Father Paul Dobberstein in gratitude for being saved from death after he fell ill with pneumonia. Today, 50 years later, the grotto is 100 yards long, made entirely of semiprecious stones, and valued at $4 million. Nine separate grottos each portray a scene from the life of Christ.\u2014 Weighing in at 1,700 pounds, this life-size chocolate moose stands in a pool of liquid chocolate. But don't take a bite \u2014 after 18 years, Lenny is pretty stale.\u2014 Towering 55 feet above the town, his arms on hips, a big smile on his emerald face, this statue weighs four tons. It was built in 1970 to mark the completion of Interstate 90.\u2014 This landmark is built entirely from old newspapers, except for its frame, floors, and ceiling. In all, owner Elis Stenman used more than 100,000 newspapers to construct the odd home, starting in 1922. Appropriately, Stenman is the engineer who designed the machines that make paperclips.\u2014 Though not as large as its namesake in Pisa, Italy (Niles' tower stands only 94 feet as compared to Pisa's 183), it does include four fountains and a 30-foot pool.\u2014 This restaurant built in the shape of Aunt Jemima is a must-visit. Over the years since its construction in 1940, political correctness has resulted in the figurine's gradual skin lightening, but the 28-foot-high restaurant still serves some delicious down-home Southern cooking.\u2014 The original 1831 bridge was shipped over from London at a cost of nearly $10 million. Today, you can drive or walk across its 950 feet and pretend you're in England.\u2014 This museum rests on top of 1.5 million cubic yards of hazardous radioactive waste from an abandoned uranium ore processing plant. Take a stroll, if you dare.\u2014 The home offices of the Longaberger Basket Co. is itself a giant basket, standing seven stories high. At a cost of $30 million, the company erected the odd building, which includes 150-ton handles and is 160 times longer than the basket after which it is modeled, in 1997.\u2014 The statue, which bills itself as the "coldest spot in the nation," stands 27 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it mutters in fuzzy, barely audible English.\u2014 At this underground lake 140 feet below the surface, you can tour fascinating caverns, ride in a glass-bottomed boat across the lake, and see 20,000-year-old jaguar tracks in the stone.\u2014 This attraction contains an estimated 4,655,000 colorful stamps, weighs 600 pounds, and measures 32 inches in diameter in front of a framed sunburst mural also made of stamps. And it all started out as a golf ball.\u2014 Lucy dates back to 1881 when there was a flurry of construction on buildings shaped like animals. She stands 65 feet high, measures 60 feet long and 18 feet wide, and weighs about 90 tons, and has been used as a restaurant, an office, a motel, and even a speakeasy. Visitors can climb up inside Lucy's leg and stand in the decorative howdah on top of her red blanket.\u2014 This is a green splash of alien-themed weirdness located near the legendary Area 51, where UFO enthusiasts claim the U.S. conducts UFO research. It includes a gas station, a convenience store, and a truck stop, but you might want to leave the kids in the car for this one.\u2014 This hillside is filled with hundreds of crosses of various sizes, covered with religious messages such as, "Hell is hot, hot, hot." It was erected by the late William Rice, beginning in 1976 after the death of his mother.\u2014 Standing 30 feet high and anchored in 9 feet of solid concrete, the nut serves as an ad for McGinn's Pistachio Tree Ranch and a nearby winery.\u2014 This 5,000-square-foot home is carved out of a sandstone mountain, and includes 14 rooms, a 65-foot stone chimney, and a bathtub carved out of the rock. Over 20 years, 50,000 cubic feet of sandstone was removed to create the unique home, which has tours and a gift shop.\u2014 Stop by the self-proclaimed birthplace of the mythic lumberjack and see the 18-foot-tall, 2.5-ton statue accompanied, of course, by Paul's faithful bovine friend, Babe the Blue Ox.\u2014 This creation sprang to life in 1982 and is made out of more than 2,000 steel wheel rims welded together and painted black. The turtle's 2,000-pound head bobs up and down on a pivot.\u2014 This three-story royal wonder is made from gleaming aluminum printing press plates by artist Howard Sullivan. It is crammed full of Solomon's sculptures and includes the "Boat in the Moat," a replica of a Portuguese sailing galleon turned into a restaurant and, of course, a gift shop.\u2014 This landmark stands outside the Seabee Museum and Memorial Park and is dedicated to the U.S. Naval Construction Forces' wartime record. The ferocious-looking bee holds a hammer in one hand and a machine gun in the other, ready for battle.\u2014 Make sure to stop by these 10 acres of strangeness, made up of 40 sculptures by Wayne Porter that seem other-worldly, including swimming goldfish, metal vultures, rocking horses, odd fantasy creatures, and a 60-foot-tall, 25-ton longhorn bull head.

Heirloom tomatoes \u2014 These colorful tomatoes are known for their superb flavor, and their popularity has surged in recent years. Because farmer\u2019s market vendors and specialty grocers can charge as much as $4 per pound for them, it\u2019s worth learning to grow your own. According to Profitable Plants Digest, one healthy tomato plant can produce 25 pounds of succulent tomatoes for the miniscule cost of one seed.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Loophole Can Qualify Senior for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a2. Culinary herbs \u2014 Any accomplished home cook knows the importance of having fresh herbs on hand. Herbs command high prices in stores. Growing your own is easy even for those with limited space, and it can save you hundreds of dollars in a single growing season, says Savvy Gardener.\u000a\u000a3. Lettuces \u2014 The cost of lettuce is rising, and that is especially true for plastic tubs of gourmet lettuce mixes at your local grocer. Lettuce is easy to grow from seed and you will have a great variety. Planting just a few square feet of lettuce and harvesting the leaves gradually will ensure you have plenty of fresh salads in spring, according to Earth Easy.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack\u000a\u000a4. Garlic \u2014 A mainstay in any well-equipped kitchen pantry, garlic can cost up to $7 per pound at the supermarket, Earth Easy notes. When you grow your own, you plant individual cloves, and each single clove becomes an entire new head of garlic. Garlic is also easy to grow, and it stores well once harvested, so grow a lot.\u000a\u000a5. Zucchini \u2014 Summer squash and zucchini plants are prolific at the height of the season. For the cost of just one seed, one plant can yield dozens of fresh squash. In addition to delicious fresh eating, zucchini freezes well and can also be used to make delicious zucchini bread to stretch the yields even further, suggests Bonnie Plants.\u000a\u000aImportant: Gingrich and Reagan Video Goes Viral. See It Now\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVA Chris Cornell memorial statue has been commissioned by the family of the late Soundgarden frontman, to be erected at a time and place in Seattle still to come.

aVWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who last month made national news for switching his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, Thursday defended a $4.5 billion request he's made to save the coal industry in his state and elsewhere in the eastern part of the United States, saying the measure is needed for national security.\u000a\u000a"It's anything but that," Justice told Fox News' "America's Newsroom" anchor Bill Hemmer, when the reporter asked him if the request that's been made to President Donald Trump is an industry bailout.\u000a\u000a"I mean, just think for just one second," said Justice. "We came really close to completely losing our eastern coal fields in the past probably four years. Fifty-five companies took bankruptcy. Now at the end of the day, we better awaken to one thing, and that's for sure: We can't afford today to do without coal in the east."\u000a\u000aJustice, a coal and real estate millionaire, was elected as governor as a Democrat in 2016. Until 2015, however, he was a Republican, switching just before running for the state's top office.\u000a\u000aAccording to Bloomberg, Justice's plan calls for the Department of Homeland Security to send pay eastern U.S. utility companies $15 for each ton of Appalachian coal they use.\u000a\u000aCritics have panned the plan, saying it would be misguided and too expensive. Andrew Cosgrove, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, noted that power plants used at least 110 million tons of Appalachian coal in 2016, and paying $15 a ton would have cost at least $1.65 billion.\u000a\u000aBut Justice said he's discussed his plan with Trump, and that the president is interested. The governor also told Bloomberg he spoke with Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Vice President Mike Pence and Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law.\u000a\u000aThe governor told Hemmer that if the eastern coal fields are lost completely, and the nation is dependent on coal or natural gas from the nation's western states, that would expose the eastern power grid.\u000a\u000a"Are we truly willing to take that risk?" said Justice. "I'm not looking for a hand-out in any way, shape, form or fashion. I'm looking for a way to put our miners truly back to work, back to work by the tens of thousands."\u000a\u000aHemmer, pointed out that western coal mine industry experts have complained that Justice's plan does not meet with free market principles, and about the governor's political party switch.\u000a\u000a"It's just a matter of national security," the governor responded. "Think about if you awaken to the fact the eastern coal fields are gone and there is a disruption. There is a bomb at a gas junction or at a bridge or two that is bringing western coal. What are we going to do?"\u000a\u000aJustice said he thinks Trump "really gets" his plan, and "really understands it."\u000a\u000a"This is not a way to expand gigantic coal tonnages but to put the coal miners back to work," said Justice. "If we don't do this we're willing to roll the dice and take a risk. Just think, Bill, we had the power go out one night in New York City and we had just an absolute melee. Now, just think if we had a power disruption in the winter for three months what would happen? We would lose hundreds of thousands of people. It's a risk I don't think we need to take."

aVLONDON (AP) \u2014 Britain's National Crime Agency says human trafficking and modern slavery are much more prevalent than previously thought, and there are 300 active police investigations across the U.K.\u000a\u000aAgency official Will Kerr says investigators have found widespread evidence of people as young as 12 being sold for sexual exploitation or forced labor. He said victims can be found working in car washes, on construction sites, in brothels and at cannabis factories.\u000a\u000aKerr told reporters Thursday that "the growing body of evidence we are collecting points to the scale being far larger than anyone previously thought."\u000a\u000aThe agency is launching a campaign to raise public awareness of modern slavery. Kerr says signs of slavery include visible injuries, a distressed appearance and any indication an individual is being controlled by another person.

aVI do not care whether you carry a Sig Sauer, Glock, Colt, Smith & Wesson, or any other brand of firearm (well, unless it\u2019s a Springfield).\u000a\u000aMy two main concerns are that people do carry firearms, and that they do it safely.\u000a\u000aI thought that was a unanimous opinion in the Second Amendment community, but a recent occurrence has made me rethink that position. It seems that some place brand loyalty over safety concerns.\u000a\u000aI try to stay active on both Facebook and Twitter promoting gun rights, firearm industry information, and firearm safety. These worlds collided last week when we found out that the Dallas Police Department issued a recall for their Sig Sauer handguns. There were concerns that the P320 would go off when dropped. Sig Sauer denied that potential. After sharing this story, Sig owners started getting defensive about their choice of weapon.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, August 7, a video was released by The Gun Collective that demonstrated the Sig P320 accidentally firing when it was dropped. Omaha Outdoors, the makers of the video, showed that when striking the ground on its back plate, the trigger is heavy enough to continue the momentum and move rearwards, thus firing. They even showed that a different type of trigger prevents it from happening.\u000a\u000aWhen this video was watched, many of those previously defensive Sig owners launched into accusations of a rigged test perpetrated by a company who sells Glocks primarily. Most did not want to even consider that their weapons might have a potentially fatal flaw.\u000a\u000aThen the second shoe dropped. On Tuesday, August 8, a second independent video showed another Sig P320 failing a drop test. Before I even had time to let this sink in, we were informed about a Connecticut police officer who is suing Sig Sauer for injuries caused when his P320 was dropped and fired, the bullet striking his leg.\u000a\u000aWhile writing this article, Sig Sauer issued a statement offering voluntary upgrade \u201cenhancements\u201d to rectify the possibility of an unintended discharge.\u000a\u000aI am glad that Sig Sauer did not wait and addressed the problem immediately. However, I don\u2019t think it should be voluntary. This should be a mandatory recall to ensure that all their firearms are safe from this issue.\u000a\u000aRegarding Sig owners, please don\u2019t be defensive nor dismissive of any potential safety issue with your firearm. Contact the company and have your trigger replaced.\u000a\u000aI carry a Glock 19. The reason I bought this specific brand of weapon is because of their \u201cSafe Action System\u201d which is specifically designed to prevent the weapon from firing without the trigger being pulled, even if it is dropped. I have been a proud Glock carrier since 2010. However, if a safety issue was found in Glock pistols, I would want to know as much as possible, as quickly as I could gather the info. I would not get defensive. I would not think it was a conspiracy.\u000a\u000aSafety should be the first concern of every gun owner and concealed carrier. Brand loyalty should be a distant second.\u000a\u000aJohn Cylc is an eight year U.S. Army veteran. He is also a contributor to LifeZette. To read more of his reports \u2014 Click Here Now.

They say some states will divide your assets among your surviving spouse and children, but not all states do it the same way. Even if you simply want to leave everything to your spouse, you will still need to specify this in your will.\u000a\u000a3. Be mindful of beneficiary designations \u2013 As U.S. News and World Report points out, beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life insurance policies override anything specified in your will.

aVSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., took a shot Wednesday at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., while taking about healthcare.\u000a\u000a"I like Mitch, but for eight years we've been saying we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013 it's not like we made this up overnight," Graham told "The Brian Kilmeade Show," per The Hill.\u000a\u000a"We have been working on repealing Obamacare all year. The idea put forward didn't pass, it was in many ways an ill-conceived idea."\u000a\u000aThe debate on healthcare has divided Washington ever since former President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. Now that Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches, they have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to pass legislation this year that would repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aGraham said he is frustrated the party cannot come to an agreement on how to fix the nation's healthcare system.\u000a\u000a"There is no way to sugar coat this. The Republican Party promised for eight years to repeal and replace Obamacare," Graham said. "We failed, and if we give up, shame on us."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump also criticized McConnell on Wednesday, asking why he was not able to pass healthcare legislation after he has had nearly a decade to come up with a plan.

aVWhat a stunning, intriguing travel destination Turkey used to be. And once upon a time, it was a uniquely safe and secular state remarkably free of extremism, despite a teeming, overwhelmingly Muslim population that numbers some 79.5 million souls.\u000a\u000aNowadays, however, Turkey is being progressively radicalized under the firm hand of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey\u2019s tiny community of some 160,000 Christians is all too aware of the encroaching danger they face.\u000a\u000aErdogan was prime minister of Turkey from 2003 until 2014, and has been president since 2014. Over those years his penchants for despotic rule and Islamism have become increasingly evident.\u000a\u000aOf course, the trouble for Christians didn\u2019t start with Erdogan. Armenian, Syriac, and Pontic Greek Christians have never forgotten the genocide that took place in Turkey in the early 20th Century, when well over a million of their own died at the hands of Turkish killers.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, the future of Turkey\u2019s Christians has darkened dramatically. Just over a year ago a failed coup attempted to overthrow Erdogan and his hardline AKP political party. Since then, an ongoing purge of \u201cterrorists\u201d has led to tens of thousands across the country being arrested and jailed. The country\u2019s religious minorities have seen the writing on the wall.\u000a\u000aFollowing the coup attempt, Turkey expert Aykan Erdemir at Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) explained, \u201cOn August 7, in a demonstration of solidarity, Turkey\u2019s Jewish and Christian religious leaders joined the \u2018Democracy and Martyrs\u2019 rally, the government\u2019s million-strong anti-coup demonstration in Istanbul. In denouncing the coup plotters, however, three of the speakers insulted religious minorities by tarring the plotters as \u2018seeds of Byzantium,\u2019 \u2018crusaders,\u2019 and as a \u2018flock of infidels.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aEven before the failed coup, Christians had endured sporadic violence. Two Catholic clergymen were murdered \u2014 a priest in 2006 and a bishop in 2010. In 2007, a well-known Armenian journalist was assassinated. Just a few months later, a German and two Turkish converts to Christianity were brutally killed \u2014 some say ritually tortured \u2014 while working at a Christian publishing house.\u000a\u000aJustice was certainly not served on behalf of any of those Christians.\u000a\u000aAykan writes, \u201cThe five culprits of the publishing-house massacre were released in 2014, and the murderer of the priest walked [in 2015]. The Armenian editor\u2019s assassin received a hero\u2019s welcome when brought into the police station, where officers praised his courage and asked him to pose with the Turkish flag.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe pressure on Christians hasn\u2019t come solely from physical assaults. Just weeks ago, Fox News reported that the Turkish state has seized some 50 religious properties from the Christian minority: \u201cMor Gabriel \u2014 one of the world\u2019s oldest working monasteries since it was started in the 5th Century \u2014 filed an appeal against the confiscations, but it was rejected in May by a governmental commission tasked with liquidating the seized assets.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Muslim prayers are now being offered in Istanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia, one of the world\u2019s oldest and perhaps the most splendid of all historic Christian churches.\u000a\u000aThreats, thefts, beatings, and murders that are applauded by state officials are appalling. But a particularly ominous action took place in October 2016, apparently as another by-product of the abortive coup.\u000a\u000aAmerican pastor Andrew Brunson and his wife, Norine, were arrested and accused of \u201cactivities against national security.\u201d The Brunsons have lived and ministered in Turkey for more than 20 years. They were locked up in isolation for nearly two weeks, and were forbidden to seek legal counsel or alert U.S. embassy representatives.\u000a\u000aEventually Brunson\u2019s wife was released, but Brunson is still being held \u2014 despite a direct appeal from President Trump to President Erdogan. The White House reported that Mr. Trump \u201craised the incarceration of Pastor Andrew Brunson and asked that the Turkish government expeditiously return him to the United States.\u201d\u2019\u000a\u000aAndrew Brunson remains behind bars, presumably being held as a pawn for some future political chess game between Turkey and Western powers. Turkey\u2019s Christian community remains on high alert alongside Jews and other religious minorities, feeling very much at risk.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Turkey\u2019s panoramic tourist sites continue to tempt travelers \u2014 especially Christians who want to explore New Testament locales.\u000a\u000aThe Christian tourists come to witness glorious relics of Turkey\u2019s past. But increasingly, they find a land whose spectacular beauty is overshadowed Erdogan\u2019s ever-tightening fist.\u000a\u000aNewsmax Religion and Freedom Editor Lela Gilbert is an internationally recognized expert on religious persecution, an award-winning writer, and an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute who lived in Jerusalem for over a decade.

aVThe leader of the Wisconsin Senate said Wednesday he doesn't know if he has the votes to pass a package of incentives for a Foxconn plant in the southeastern corner of the state, raising doubts about whether legislators will be able to meet a deadline for finalizing the deal.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald expressed concerns about some specifics of the deal with the Taiwanese electronics giant, which could decide to go elsewhere for its first U.S. factory if the $3 billion package isn't approved by Sept. 30.\u000a\u000aThe Republican leader said he wants to know more about how bonding for interstate reconstruction near the plant's site will affect a $1 billion shortfall in the state's transportation fund. He also expressed concern about a fiscal analysis that found the state won't break even on the incentives package for at least 25 years.\u000a\u000a"I just want to be able to talk intelligently about this thing and I'll be honest with you, I can't do that right now," Fitzgerald said during an interview with WISN-AM radio Wednesday afternoon. "We're just trying to make sure all our ducks are in a row."\u000a\u000aDespite Fitzgerald's concerns, Assembly Republicans planned to take the first votes on the package next week, with a committee vote set for Tuesday and a full floor session scheduled for Aug. 17. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos tweeted he wants the Legislature to pass the plan by Labor Day.\u000a\u000aFitzgerald accused Vos of drafting amendments to the plan without consulting the Senate, further complicating matters. He said he plans to send the bill to the Legislature's budget-writing committee but wants the panel to finish work on the state budget before it takes up the Foxconn bill.\u000a\u000a"The interaction between the two documents has become very, very intertwined over the last few weeks," he said.\u000a\u000aAsked for comment on Fitzgerald's remarks, Gov. Scott Walker's spokesman Tom Evenson replied that the governor is ready to work with both houses to bring more jobs to the state.\u000a\u000aThere was no immediate response to a message The Associated Press left in Foxconn's general email box Wednesday afternoon.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump announced last month that Foxconn would build a 20 million-square-foot plant in Wisconsin. The company has said the facility could employ as many as 13,000 people.\u000a\u000aWalker, who faces re-election next year, signed a memorandum of understanding with Foxconn promising to deliver the incentive package by Sept. 30.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the road borrowing, the package would provide up to $3 billion in tax breaks for the company depending on how many jobs are created.\u000a\u000aIt also exempts the plant from a number of environmental regulations, lifting the requirement for environmental impact statements on construction and operations and making it easier to fill wetlands around the plant site.\u000a\u000aDepartment of Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp, a Walker appointee, told the agency's board in Milwaukee that the Foxconn plant is a "gift" and promised regulatory rollbacks in the incentive bill wouldn't lead to environmental damage.

aVA former radio disc jockey accused of groping Taylor Swift before a concert testified Tuesday that he may have touched the pop superstar's ribs with a closed hand as he tried to jump into a photo with her but insisted he did not touch her backside as she claims.\u000a\u000aDavid Mueller told jurors at the civil trial on dueling lawsuits filed by Mueller and Swift that he and the singer-songwriter were trying to reach around one another and "our hands touched and our arms touched" during a photo opportunity he estimated lasted no more than 40 seconds.\u000a\u000aUnder questioning by his attorney, Mueller said he may have touched Swift's "rib cage, or rib, or ribs."\u000a\u000aThe 2013 photo of Swift, Mueller and Mueller's girlfriend taken at the pre-concert event in Denver is a key piece of evidence in Mueller's suit claiming he was fired after being falsely accused by Swift. He is seeking at least $3 million.\u000a\u000aThe photo shows Mueller with his hand behind Swift, just below her waist. Both are smiling.\u000a\u000aHer lawyers have called the photo "damning" proof that Mueller groped her.\u000a\u000aMueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, showed jurors the photograph during his opening remarks. Two jurors stared at the photo on their computer monitors while a few others kept glancing at it as McFarland spoke.\u000a\u000a"If you look at that photograph, his hand is not underneath Miss Swift's skirt, and her skirt is not rumpled in any fashion," McFarland said, noting that no one on Swift's concert team saw anything amiss.\u000a\u000aMueller also testified that one of his station bosses, Hershel Coomer, told him that he had met Swift earlier before the show and that "he told me that he had his hands on her butt."\u000a\u000aMueller said, "I thought he was just telling me one of his stories."\u000a\u000aUnder cross-examination, Mueller couldn't explain why he didn't tell a boss investigating the incident about the exchange with Coomer.\u000a\u000aSwift has said she is positive it was Mueller who groped her.\u000a\u000aSwift has countersued Mueller, claiming sexual assault. She is seeking a symbolic $1, saying she wants to serve as an example to other women who have been assaulted.\u000a\u000aProceedings ended for the day Tuesday and were set to resume Wednesday.\u000a\u000aIn his opening statement, Douglas Baldridge, an attorney for Swift, told jurors that his superstar client is "absolutely certain" she was sexually assaulted and will prove it in court.\u000a\u000aBaldridge also asked what possible reason Swift would have to make up an allegation.\u000a\u000a"That's the one and only story we have to tell you \u2014 that Mr. Mueller grabbed her rear end," he said.\u000a\u000aMueller's attorney told jurors that inappropriate touching is wrong, but falsely accusing someone of the offense is equally unacceptable.\u000a\u000aMueller, wearing a smoke gray jacket and a white shirt, sat in court with his back to Swift and her mother, Andrea Swift.\u000a\u000aTaylor Swift had her hair in a bun and wore a conservative black dress with tights. She is expected to testify later in the trial.\u000a\u000aMueller testified that he wants to clear his name and recover earnings he lost after being fired. He said he hasn't been able to get a job in radio since the incident.\u000a\u000a"It's a humiliating experience to be accused of something that despicable," he testified.\u000a\u000aBaldridge repeatedly interrupted Mueller during an aggressive cross-examination and noted that Mueller has said he lost an audio recording of a meeting he had with his bosses before they fired him.\u000a\u000a"We'll never know what's on it, will we?" Baldridge asked.\u000a\u000a"No, we won't," Mueller responded. "They're gone."\u000a\u000aBaldridge repeatedly asked Mueller if he could grasp "any reason, incentive or motive for Miss Swift" to make up the allegation or be involved in 2 years of litigation.\u000a\u000a"I cannot," Mueller replied.\u000a\u000aBaldridge did get Mueller to concede that various supervisors with KYGO and its parent firm had discussed the possibility of letting him go even before the encounter with Swift.

aVComprehensive (or integrative) medicine combines the best of holistic and pharmaceutical treatments to create a therapy plan. The wonderful thing it is that it gives you a full tool kit to deal with your problems.\u000a\u000aMany natural therapies can be very helpful for pain. My three favorite pain-relieving herbals are willow bark, Boswellia, and cherry.\u000a\u000aWhile going after and eliminating the underlying causes of the pain, it is also perfectly reasonable to use pain medications for temporary relief.\u000a\u000aThe toxicity of chronic pain is far greater than the toxicity of these medications. The main problem is that these medications can cause side effects, especially when started at high dose.\u000a\u000aIt is reasonable to start with a higher dose if needed to get pain free quickly, but if the side effects become problematic, immediately lower the dose to the level that is comfortable (even if this is simply one-half tablet daily at bedtime).\u000a\u000aAs your body adapts to the side effects over a week or two, the dose can then be raised. Starting at too high a dose, without stopping and retrying at a lower dose in the face of side effects, is the major reason why people do not tolerate medications for pain that otherwise would be very helpful.

aVThere\u2019s a lot of head scratching going on in Alabama these days.\u000a\u000aThe right is wondering if there\u2019s a united effort to keep conservative candidates from taking over the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aAfter Sessions, a conservative himself, was sworn into office, Gov. Robert Bentley, R-Ala., appointed Luther Strange to keep the seat warm until the Dec. 12 special election.\u000a\u000aStrange was the Alabama state attorney general at the time, and there were rumblings that his appointment was a quid pro quo arrangement. He\u2019d asked the Alabama House to hold off impeachment proceedings against Republican Bentley last year.\u000a\u000aStrange apparently found Capitol Hill to his liking, and announced his intention to run in next Tuesday\u2019s primary, where he\u2019ll face stiff competition \u2014 especially from conservatives Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Ray Moore.\u000a\u000aBut the last thing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wants is another Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, or Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to deal with. So the Kentucky Republican is pulling out all the stops to see that Strange gets to stay where he is.\u000a\u000aMcConnell\u2019s hardball tactics include making up to $8 million from his own super PAC available to assure Sen. Luther Strange remains in office. The Kentuckian also added the weight of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is under his control, to the effort, and advised political consultants that any work they do for Strange\u2019s opponents will be done at the cost of future work for the NRSC.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Senate\u2019s Obamacare repeal/replace debacle has led to a minor feud between McConnell and President Trump.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, the Senate majority leader attributed Trump\u2019s frustration over the Senate\u2019s failure to get Obamacare repealed to "artificial deadlines" the president imposed. "Now our new president has of course not been in this line of work before, " Sen. McConnell said. "And I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process."\u000a\u000aTrump took exception and used his favorite medium \u2014 Twitter \u2014 to fire back at the Kentuckian. "Sen. Mitch McConnell said I had 'excessive expectations,' but I don't think so," Trump tweeted. "After 7 years of hearing repeal and replace, why not done?"\u000a\u000aGiven the president\u2019s irritation with the Senate majority leader, one might assume that Trump would cast his lot with either Brooks or Moore. Not so. On this issue he\u2019s copacetic with McConnell. "Sen. Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama," the president tweeted Tuesday. "He has my complete and total endorsement!"\u000a\u000aStrange, with money provided by McConnell\u2019s super-PAC, touted Trump\u2019s endorsement with a six-second campaign ad.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s endorsement left Brooks confused. "I respect President Trump, but I am baffled and disappointed Mitch McConnell and the Swamp somehow misled the president into endorsing Luther Strange," Brooks said in a statement. "Perhaps the President is unaware that Luther Strange corruptly and unethically held a criminal investigation over the head of disgraced Governor Bentley to obtain the senate appointment."\u000a\u000aIf Brooks was disappointed, conservative radio host Mark Levin was livid. "Outrageous! Jeff Roe, Cruz's former presidential campaign manager, celebrating Trump's pathetic endorsement of . . . [Luther Strange]," Levin tweeted. Levin added, "Trump-McConnell-Rove-Roe join together to defeat conservatives in Alabama Senate race. We won't forget."\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not difficult to understand Trump\u2019s thinking. He obviously believes that conservatives like Cruz and Lee, as well as libertarian-leaning senators like Rand Paul, R-Ky., are too much of a loose cannon to get his legislative agenda through the Senate.\u000a\u000aAlthough the power and money may be behind Strange, it\u2019s going to be a rocky road for him. A July 20 Cygnal/Politico poll had him easily leading the field of nine GOP candidates with 35 percent of the vote.\u000a\u000aSince then, however, his popularity has been steadily declining. The latest, an August 7 JMC Analytics poll, had Moore leading at 30 percent, followed by Strange at 22 percent and Brooks at 19 percent.\u000a\u000aAssuming no candidate attains a majority on Aug.15 \u2014 an odds-on certainty \u2014 a runoff of the two top vote-getters is scheduled for Sept. 26. And it\u2019s entirely conceivable that Strange could be victorious in a head-to-head contest against Moore or Brooks.\u000a\u000aThe fix could be in.\u000a\u000aMichael Dorstewitz is a retired lawyer and has been a frequent contributor to BizPac Review and Liberty Unyielding.

aVTaking a common vitamin supplement could significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects worldwide, Australian scientists said Thursday, in what they described as a major breakthrough in pregnancy research.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that deficiency in a key molecule among pregnant women stopped embryos and babies' organs from developing correctly in the womb, but could be treated by taking the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin.\u000a\u000a"Now, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin," said Sally Dunwoodie, a biomedical researcher at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.\u000a\u000a"The ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly."\u000a\u000aHealth Minister Greg Hunt hailed the study as a "historic medical breakthrough".\u000a\u000a"Today's announcement provides new hope to the one in four pregnant women who suffer a miscarriage," Hunt said Thursday, citing Australian data.\u000a\u000a"And with 7.9 million babies around the world currently being born with birth defects every year, this breakthrough is incredible news."\u000a\u000aThe scientists used genetic sequencing on families suffering from miscarriages and birth defects and found gene mutations that affected production of the molecule, NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).\u000a\u000aWith Vitamin B3 -- found in meat and vegetables -- needed to make NAD, they tested the effect of taking the supplement on developing mice embryos that had similar NAD deficiencies as human ones, and found a significant change.\u000a\u000a"Before vitamin B3 was introduced into the (mice) mother's diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects," the Victor Chang Institute said in a statement.\u000a\u000a"After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy."\u000a\u000aThe researchers said the next step was to develop a test to measure NAD levels to identify which women were most at risk from having a baby with a birth defect, and to then ensure they had sufficient Vitamin B3.\u000a\u000aThey added that current vitamin supplements for pregnant women might not contain sufficient levels of Vitamin B3.\u000a\u000aThe study was funded by the Australian government as well as private donations.

aVTaylor Swift testified Thursday that a former radio DJ reached under her skirt and intentionally grabbed her backside underneath her skirt during a meet-and-a-greet photo session before a 2013 concert in Denver.\u000a\u000a"He stayed attached to my bare ass-cheek as I lurched away from him," the pop star testified in federal court during a trial over the claim.\u000a\u000aDespite being stunned, Swift said she did not say anything to David Mueller about it because she did not want other fans lined up to hear anything and she did not want to cancel the event and disappoint them.\u000a\u000aSwift said she tried to get as far away from Mueller as she could. She said she told Mueller and his girlfriend, Shannon Melcher, who was also in the photo, "thank you for coming" in a monotone voice before they left.\u000a\u000aDavid Mueller sued Swift and others on her team, claiming they cost him his job and is seeking up to $3 million in damages. Swift countersued, alleging sexual assault, and is asking for a symbolic $1 judgment.\u000a\u000aSwift said a security guard working for her witnessed the groping.\u000a\u000aShe testified guard Greg Dent saw David Mueller "lift my skirt" and grab her but that it was it was impossible for anyone to see Mueller's hand beneath her skirt and on her buttock because they were posing for the photo with their backs to a wall.\u000a\u000aSwift said that someone would have had to have been underneath her to see the actual groping "and we didn't have anyone positioned there."\u000a\u000aMueller testified Wednesday that the photo taken before the concert was "weird and awkward," but he insisted that he touched Swift in the ribs, not in the rear.\u000a\u000aMueller testified his hand was touching Swift's skirt after he put his arm around her and their arms got crossed: "My hand was at rib-cage level and apparently it went down."\u000a\u000aThe case is being tried in federal court under a law allowing the proceeding when the parties live in separate states and the dispute involves a damages claim higher than $75,000.

aVHope is fading for a feel-good ending at the U.S. box office.\u000a\u000aAfter several months of flops like Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cKing Arthur\u201d and EuropaCorp\u2019s \u201cValerian,\u201d movie studios and theaters are beginning to acknowledge that their streak of record-setting ticket sales may be coming to an end. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the world\u2019s biggest cinema chain, laid out a worse-than-projected outlook for the North American box office this week.\u000a\u000aThat announcement dragged down shares of theater stocks, wiping out $1.3 billion from the value of the top four cinema operators in North America since Aug. 1. Even with a new \u201cStar Wars,\u201d a Marvel superhero movie and the sequel to \u201cBlade Runner\u201d on the docket for the holiday season, the box office is unlikely to make up for a \u201csevere hit\u201d in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. To date, receipts are down 2 percent in 2017, and AMC is projecting a 1.5 percent decline for the full year.\u000a\u000aThe concern is that the slump isn\u2019t just a run of bad luck. Cinema operators have managed for years to keep increasing sales by raising ticket prices amid stagnant attendance, but a sharp drop in filmgoing would make that harder to sustain. And the tried-and-true formula of churning out big-budget sequels and cinematic universes populated with superbeings seems to be wearing on filmgoers. Movies featuring once-reliable draws Jack Sparrow, the Transformers and the Mummy did poorly in the U.S.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, competition is heating up. Netflix Inc. and other digital distributors are creating more original movies, and consumers have more demands on their attention than ever, from Snapchat to YouTube. Further exacerbating the trend, studios are expected to push for a new premium video-on-demand window this year.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that Hollywood could reverse the trend next year, when a new movie about Han Solo, an Avengers film, and sequels to \u201cDeadpool\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d are scheduled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is very typical of the movie business,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cYou could make the argument that the slate for next year looks really good, which should grow the market next year in North America. That part\u2019s a cyclical thing, and it\u2019s likely to come back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd movie-theater operators Regal Entertainment Group, Cinemark Holdings Inc. and Imax Corp. aren\u2019t facing the same level of pressure as AMC, which is carrying almost $5 billion in debt after expanding its empire to Europe, with acquisitions in the U.K. and Sweden.\u000a\u000aControlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group Co., AMC has become the poster child for China\u2019s incursion into Hollywood. Concern that Dalian Wanda\u2019s international investments may wane is adding to AMC\u2019s troubles. \u201cWith China cracking down on funding for AMC\u2019s majority shareholder, Dalian Wanda, the cinema chain faces murky prospects given its high debt level and appetite for global M&A,\u201d wrote Geetha Ranganathan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\u000a\u000aAs an expression of confidence in its future, the theater operator late Thursday announced its board approved as much as $100 million in repurchases of its Class A stock, or about 5 percent of its total equity market value, which includes Class B shares held by Wanda.\u000a\u000aChief Executive Officer Adam Aron said he also plans to buy shares personally over the next 60 days.\u000a\u000aAMC said Tuesday it will cut jobs and plans to write off its investment in National CineMedia LLC, resulting in a loss of as much as $178.5 million. The company will also pursue \u201cstrategic pricing\u201d -- possibly selectively charging more for hot tickets or offering discounts to fill seats -- and cut back on investments in improvements to its theaters, such as reclining seats.\u000a\u000aThe revised outlook means AMC\u2019s indebtedness is likely to be higher by the end of the year, though probably not enough to lead to a downgrade, said Jason Cuomo, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Dialing back on investments will help the company weather the storm, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have some levers they can pull and manage, and they\u2019re not going to stand still,\u201d Cuomo said.\u000a\u000aCanada\u2019s Cineplex Inc. also reported poor second-quarter results as movie fans grow tired of franchises, so-called \u201csequel-itis.\u201d It too will cut spending and jobs, even as it considers price hikes to offset higher minimum wages in Canada. Regal\u2019s earnings missed estimates, while Imax\u2019s were in line with analysts\u2019 projections. Cinemark is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe big shadow hanging over the industry is whether studios will push to shorten the time between theater and home release of their movies, from the standard three months to within weeks after theater attendance has dropped off. The concern is that such a premium video-on-demand offering would give consumers less incentive to go see a movie in theaters, knowing they could watch it at home within weeks.\u000a\u000aThe studios are negotiating with cinema operators over the matter, pushing for an agreement as soon as the end of this year. Reaching a deal may be tricky. Studios are restricted from coordinating among themselves because of antitrust rules -- while exhibitors have said they will only agree to deals that boost their bottom line.\u000a\u000aMeantime, the industry is counting on Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d opening Nov. 3, and \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d on Dec. 15, to make the picture brighter.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil you see box office turn, people have to assume the worst for everything and that is why see people stay relatively concerned on the space until you get to Q4,\u201d said Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. While he has a buy rating on the stock, he says in the past he may have been too positive. \u201cYou have got zero opportunity for positive news until maybe November of Q4 when the slate looks a little bit better.\u201d

Several board members say the sign also is "inappropriate."\u000a\u000aTooker questioned the tickets during a town meeting Aug. 1.

aVJOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's main opposition party submitted a motion to dissolve the nation's parliament on Thursday, which, if passed, would require fresh national elections.\u000a\u000a"The ANC is willing to do anything to protect President Jacob Zuma," said John Steenhuisen, chief whip of the Democratic Alliance party. "South Africans need to be given the opportunity to make their voices heard at the polls."\u000a\u000aThe dissolution motion comes hot on the heels of a no confidence vote which Zuma narrowly survived earlier this week.\u000a\u000aThe dissolution attempt, which requires 201 out of 400 parliamentary votes to pass, is seen as unlikely to succeed as the ANC holds a majority of 249 of the house's seats.\u000a\u000aThe motion says the some ANC lawmakers "no longer represent the earnest hopes and aspirations of the electorate" and "exhibit unquestioning fealty to President Jacob Zuma and to the organization he leads."\u000a\u000aThe ANC blasted the DA's move as an attempt to subvert the will of South African voters by trying to dissolve a government that received 62 percent of the national vote in the 2014 polls.\u000a\u000aZuma has survived multiple attempts by the opposition to remove him from power, as he has faced growing anger over multiple allegations of corruption while the economy has slid into recession.\u000a\u000aTuesday's no-confidence motion was the first to be held by secret ballot, and more than 25 members of his ruling party revolted and supported the motion or abstained, the ANC said.\u000a\u000a"We are deeply disappointed that some of our ANC members allowed themselves to be used by the opposition to fracture and weaken the ANC and destabilize our country," the party said in a statement. It did not say how and if it would discipline members who did not tow the party line.\u000a\u000aThe ANC is expected to replace Zuma as party president at a meeting in December, but his term as head of state is set to continue until elections in 2019.

aVWhen 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Florida in 2016, Gov. Rick Scott publicly offered his sympathy to the victims' families and the LGBT community.\u000a\u000a"These are individuals. Let's love every one of them," he said then.\u000a\u000aBehind the scenes, gay rights advocates say his staffers went a step further, promising to pursue an executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ state workers and contractors. More than a year later, no such order has been issued.\u000a\u000aThe advocates believe the order has become even more important in the past couple of weeks as the U.S. Justice Department \u2014 under Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 filed court papers in a New York case saying that sexual orientation is not covered by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The law bans workplace discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\u000a\u000aThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, however, enforces the law against private employers and says sexual orientation is covered.\u000a\u000aThe Republican governor wouldn't talk about the alleged commitment his staff made when asked by an Associated Press reporter on Tuesday. But he said federal guidelines protect the gay community and the state follows them.\u000a\u000aState Rep. Carlos Smith, a gay Democrat, accused Scott of using the nightclub shooting to his political advantage.\u000a\u000a"Many political leaders used the tragedy at Pulse to leverage their own political careers and to make promises to our community that they could have delivered on but they did not," Smith said at a recent forum for Orlando's gay and Latino communities. A majority of the Pulse victims were gay Latinos.\u000a\u000aAfter the Pulse massacre, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, the gay advocates said two members of the governor's staff met at a hotel with leaders from the group Equality Florida.\u000a\u000aThe governor's staffers \u2014 then-chief of staff Kim McDougal and legislative affairs director Kevin Reilly \u2014 asked what could be done to show solidarity with the LGBTQ community, and the advocates answered that he should issue the anti-discrimination order, according to the Equality Florida representatives.\u000a\u000a"They sat with us and said, 'This is something that is important.' This was an issue they believed could move forward and if there was any problem, any concerns, they would let us know," Equality Florida CEO Nadine Smith said.\u000a\u000aNothing happened.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the matter in Tampa on Tuesday, Scott wouldn't say if he would sign such an order or had changed his mind.\u000a\u000a"I think it's important that everybody in our state feels comfortable and never feel discriminated against and that's what's important to me," Scott said.\u000a\u000aReilly and McDougal didn't respond to emails and a phone call.\u000a\u000aScott often has had a chilly relationship with the gay community. The governor supported Florida's attempt to defend its ban on gay marriage, which eventually was struck down by federal courts and he campaigned against adoptions by gays and lesbians in 2010. After the Pulse attack, he was criticized for calling the attack a terrorist act but neglecting to note it targeted the LGBTQ community. The Pulse gunman had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State group.\u000a\u000aAn executive order from the governor would be important for Jim Brenner, and his husband, Chuck Jones, because now there's too much ambiguity on whether gay state workers are protected from discrimination, said Brenner, who retired last September from a his job as fire management administrator at the Florida Forestry Division in Tallahassee. His husband still works for the state Education Department.\u000a\u000aBrenner, who is widely published in trade periodicals, believes his sexual orientation hindered his career promotions.\u000a\u000a"Peers felt I did a very good job, but I got to a certain point where things just came to a screeching halt," Brenner said. "I believe it's because of sexual orientation. Everybody knew that I was living with someone and that someone wasn't a woman."

Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aWhich GOP Candidate Would You Support in 2016?\u000a\u000aThey may be admired or loathed but one thing staffers and colleagues who requested anonymity agree on is that this \u201cgang of 10\u201d \u2014 senators of both parties \u2014 are the hardest-working of the elected lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Whether it is jetting home on weekends, putting in long hours in Washington or on the campaign trail, or their political rise and survive, these 10, observers agree, have an excess of \u201celbow grease.\u201dEditor\u2019s note: The entrants are listed alphabetically by state.\u2014 When U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions was blocked as George H.W. Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, observers who wrote him off as "finished" didn't reckon with the prosecutor's ability to rebound. He got elected attorney general of Alabama, then won the seat of the Democratic senator who blocked him (Howell Heflin). These days, Sessions is his party's hardest charger in the Senate on illegal immigration and a top advisor to Donald Trump.\u2014 Love him or loathe him, old and young hands on Capitol Hill almost universally regard McCain \u2014 now 80 and seeking a sixth term \u2014 as the \u201cenergizer bunny of Congress.\u201d He maintains his usual regimen of returning home to Arizona every weekend and becoming a near-omnipresence on Sunday morning (and every morning) TV talk shows. Those who know him best, such as close friend and fellow Vietnam POW Orson Swindle, swear McCain reads a book a week and, in Swindle\u2019s words, \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u2014 After a meteoric rise to the Senate in 2014 after one term in the House, this Harvard Law graduate and U.S. Army veteran of Iraq is already making a reputation for himself as a leading GOP spokesman for aggressive U.S. foreign policy. Cotton helped lead the Senate charge against the Obama administration\u2019s Iran agreement and convinced all but one of his Republican colleagues to sign a letter reminding Tehran\u2019s rulers the Senate would have last say on any agreement.\u2014 Self-styled "farm girl" and Army National Guard Col. Ernst captured imaginations with her 2014 commercials describing how she loved to "castrate pigs" and showing her on a Harley heading to target practice. Nominated to the Senate over four primary opponents and elected in the fall with 53 percent of the vote, Ernst now works hard on pro-life cause, remains an unapologetic climate change skeptic, and still finds time to handle the causes of her fellow "farm folks."\u2014 He routinely leaves staffers and colleagues speechless as he explains complex issues related to healthcare in simple terms. A physician who co-founded a pro-bono clinic with his physician-wife, Cassidy last year crafted a market-based alternative to Obamacare that he trumpeted in whirlwind press conferences and TV appearances until the Supreme Court upheld the controversial plan.\u2014 In 2014, the former Bush administration official and Lutheran college president came out of nowhere to beat three better-known and better funded opponents for nomination to the Senate. Considered an effective spokesman on government reform, Sasse is the first Nebraska senator in memory to commute weekly from what he hails as "the tall and beautiful grass at home."\u2014 Booker\u2019s capacity for long hours and hard work that is now becoming legend among his Senate colleagues and staffers first became evident when he was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Whether it was being on the scene during a fire or making the case for school vouchers, Booker was working at it in a major way. When not in Washington, the freshman senator is usually on the stump for friend Hillary Clinton and is increasingly mentioned as a vice presidential candidate \u2014 or possibly a presidential contender in 2020.\u2014 Like the Republican he unseated in 1998, Sen. Al D\u2019Amato, Schumer is home every weekend dealing with neighborhood problems and holding town meetings. During the week, however, he pays extra attention to colleagues and to the press. One joke often heard on Capitol Hill is \u201cthe most dangerous place in Washington is between a camera and Chuck Schumer.\u201d Schumer\u2019s \u201celbow grease\u201d yielded benefits this year, when he wrapped up enough votes to guarantee his election as Senate Democratic Leader when Harry Reid retires at the end of 2016.\u2014 As much as Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the raspy-voiced Brown embraces and champions the complete left-of-center agenda. But in hailing from a state where Republicans hold every statewide office except his, Brown\u2019s political survivor and stature is especially impressive. Whether the issue is same-sex marriage (he opposed a statewide measure to ban it) or the Iraq War (he fought it from the beginning), Brown outworks opponents and supporters alike, Hill-watchers agree. It is no surprise he is mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for either Sanders or Clinton.\u2014 \u201cThe best place to catch Pat Toomey,\u201d goes the joke on the Senate side of Capitol Hill, \u201cis at Union Station [the Washington, D.C., train station] on Thursday or Monday.\u201d There, the junior senator can be found heading back to Pennsylvania, where he is highly visible meeting constituents over the weekends. In Washington, he is considered a driven lawmaker who embraces small government issues as well as working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W Va.) on a modest gun control measure (which never got out of the Senate and caused Toomey some discomfort on the right). He is considered one of the more vulnerable GOP senators facing the voters in \u201916, but no one writes him off.

Others might work out of necessity, but there may be certain tax drawbacks. Considering these tax disadvantages of working after 65 will come in handy when planning retirement.People who continue to work and also draw Social Security benefits may find themselves in a higher tax bracket and paying more in taxes, U.S. News and World Report said . Delaying Social Security retirement benefits until age 70 will provide the maximum amount possible, 132 percent of the full retirement age benefit. Not drawing after turning 70 will realize no additional benefit.Depending on a person\u2019s residence, it may cost more in state and local taxes, as well as living expenses. Relocation may bring advantages. A number of states do not have income taxes and are considered retirement havens. Also, a relocation to a lower cost-of-living state may make a big difference in expenses and could offset the need to continue to work past retirement.One tax advantage people can take is to enroll in Medicare when turning 65 . Payroll taxes have been paying for it the entire time a person has been working. Not enrolling would be a significant tax drawback when working after 65. Medicare and a Medicare supplement plan are almost certainly going to be less expensive than private or employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. Remaining enrolled in private or employer-sponsored health coverage will make Medicare coverage secondary, losing most of the benefit of it even though you\u2019ve already paid for it.Assuming income remains at the same level or grows while working after 65, it could cost a person the opportunity to convert pre-tax retirement plans to after-tax instruments, such as Roth IRAs, U.S. News said. Withdrawing funds from pre-tax investments costs people more in taxes if they withdraw the money at a higher tax rate while still working.

"I think the president can't disassociate himself from this. He's part of the leadership team; he's not an observer sitting up in the stands; he's on the field. It was a collective failure; both the Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate failed.\u000a\u000a"But to get involved shooting at each other when there were 16 Democrats voting no for every single Republican who voted no, is goofy."\u000a\u000aGingrich said a bigger loss is ahead for Republicans if they don't learn a lesson from failing on healthcare.\u000a\u000a"What bothers me is, we have a lot of things we need to learn how to do if we're going to be an effective governing majority party, and I'm frankly equally afraid they're going to mishandle the tax cuts exactly the way they mishandled healthcare, and if that happens, we'll be at the end of the year with a disaster," Gingrich said.\u000a\u000aPart of that lesson is a theme Gingrich has been saying all along in a warning to Republicans who are poised to start work on tax reform \u2014 quit setting deadlines.\u000a\u000a"Setting these deadlines, when you don't have a clear plan, when you don't have an absolute majority \u2026 these kind of deadlines create these expectations and then it becomes a crisis and then somebody has to have failed. \u2026\u000a\u000a"Replacing Obamacare \u2026 may take three or four or five years and it may take 10 or 12 different bills," Gingrich said. "I'm not sure anybody's smart enough to write a single bill to replace Obamacare in one giant step, and I'm not sure you'd get a majority in the House and Senate if you could."

aVUpset stomach, nausea, or vomiting can ruin the day or several days of a cruise vacation. Travelers who take preventive measures beforehand benefit from simple natural remedies that avoid seasickness.\u000a\u000aThere are over-the-counter medications that help prevent motion sickness, but natural alternatives are also available. These remedies often help overcome the causes of seasickness, such as rough seas or even the mind tricking itself into making you feel sick.\u000a\u000aSeasickness on a cruise might also be caused by visual disorientation from imbalance because of the ship\u2019s motion.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000aThese six natural remedies offer help in avoiding seasickness:\u000a\u000a1. Ginger \u2014 Ginger candy, cookies, tablets, or capsules may relieve mild symptoms for many people, according to USA Today. It\u2019s recommended passengers start using the natural remedies at least 24 hours before embarking on a cruise.\u000a\u000a\u200b2. Wristbands \u2014 Brands such as Sea-Band and BioBands are sold in drugstores and may prevent symptoms of seasickness from occurring. The wristbands have a round knob that puts acupressure on points in the wrist to control nausea.\u000a\u000a3. Climbing to the top deck \u2014 Travelers who feel the beginnings of nausea or seasickness may find relief by getting to the top deck where the motion is not as profound. Looking out at the horizon and focusing on a fixed point reduces the stimuli that may trigger symptoms.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Self-control \u2014 If you believe or convince yourself you will get sick, it could cause the illness. Avoiding powers of suggestion helps to prevent seasickness, according to Alara Shannon at iCruise.com. By using the mind to stay in control and staying focused on ship activities, passengers avoid unhealthy influences.\u000a\u000a\u200b5. Cruise options \u2014 An outside cabin in the middle of the ship provides travelers with a balance point, Cruise Critic notes. A window view also helps with a focus point to maintain equilibrium. Choosing to cruise on larger, modern ships offers more stabilization for a smooth ride.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Lying down \u2014 Simply by lying down and closing your eyes if you are hit with seasickness helps to comfort the middle ear, which can cause motion sickness, according to Chuckie Bags. It relieves tension and avoids conflicting messages that contribute to illness.\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aShould the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVGenetics play a huge role in hair loss, but let\u2019s not forget that if you dye your hair and put other chemical products into it constantly, hair will lose its youthful luster, start breaking, and fall out.\u000a\u000aYou have more power than you think to preserve your hair.\u000a\u000aHair loss is a symptom of low thyroid. So make sure you take thyroid hormones under the care of a knowledgeable prevention expert.\u000a\u000aBlood tests don\u2019t show the way your thyroid functions nearly as accurately as your hair does.\u000a\u000aTreat your hair gently. Wash it with shampoos that are organic and plant-based. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t dye your hair because our culture feels very strongly that women with white or grey hair are old.\u000a\u000aBut until we change that cultural mindset, use organic dyes.\u000a\u000aSupplements like biotin, B12, and marine algae extracts such as Viviscal help as well.\u000a\u000aSkin care begins with sun protection. Keep your face out of the sun whenever possible and use sunscreen, but only on your face.\u000a\u000aIf you managed to avoid a bad sunburn before the age of 16, you have pretty much done a great job of ensuring your face won\u2019t prematurely age.\u000a\u000aUse body moisturizers after showers to keep your skin soft and prevent wrinkles. Do not use powders or drying agents.\u000a\u000aYour skin likes moisture \u2014 so give it moisture. Drink lots of water. The better hydrated you are, the less likely you are to get wrinkles.\u000a\u000aIt will also eliminate liver toxins that leave you with dark circles and bags around the eyes.\u000a\u000aEat fresh vegetables and fruit, and stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and sugar substitutes.\u000a\u000aWhen you drink a cup of caffeinated tea or coffee, you need three glasses of water to make up for the dehydration they cause.\u000a\u000aPlane travel is hugely dehydrating, so when you fly be sure to drink plenty of water.\u000a\u000aTake milk thistle, a supplement that clears your liver, and watch your skin improve rapidly.\u000a\u000aConsider growth hormone. If saggy skin runs in your family, you may start using human growth hormone (HGH) in your late 40s under the supervision of a knowledgeable physician.\u000a\u000aCost can be a factor here because HGH is quite expensive. Don\u2019t buy inexpensive HGH drops or lozenges on the Internet. HGH gets absorbed only if injected.\u000a\u000aOne more thing: Avoid weight swings. Try to stay within 5 pounds as much as possible, with the exception of pregnancy.\u000a\u000aPeople who keep their weight stable don\u2019t get saggy skin.

aVCoffee gives you much more than just a morning energy boost, say recent studies which point to health benefits that cover you from head to toe. They also show that the more coffee you drink throughout the day, the more health benefits your caffeine fix provides. Here's a rundown of the latest reasons for you to sit, relax, and enjoy another cup of java.\u000a\u000aLongevity. Studies show that coffee drinkers live longer than those who don't, and that it offers protection from many of the diseases of aging including cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. Researchers at Stanford found that inflammation drives the aging process, and that compounds associated with caffeine act as antioxidants and counter metabolites that trigger inflammation. They analyzed the genes of seniors and found that those with the lowest levels of inflammation drank caffeine.\u000a\u000aOne study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that those who drank five cups of coffee every day had the lowest risk of dying prematurely, and scientists found no long-term health risks.\u000a\u000aLiver cancer. Coffee could be an important weapon in the fight against liver cancer, and the more you drink, the lower your risk, says a British study published in BMJ Open. Researchers discovered that drinking one cup of coffee a day cuts the risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, by 20 percent and two cups drop the risk by 35 percent. But according to the data, five cups of coffee a day slashes your risk in half.\u000a\u000aA study published in the journal Hepatology found that coffee also reduces the risk of dying from cirrhosis of the liver by 66 percent in patients whose cirrhosis was caused by non-viral hepatitis.\u000a\u000aDementia. Caffeine may boost an enzyme in the brain that protects against dementia, say researchers from Indiana University. The enzyme, called NMNAT2, reduces the damage caused by harmful Tau proteins in the brain which accumulate due to aging and from brain-destroying plaques.\u000a\u000aWhen researchers gave caffeine to mice modified to produce lower levels of NMNAT2, they began to produce the same levels of the enzyme as normal mice. According to researcher Hui-Chen Lu, substances that increase levels of NMNAT2 in the brain could create a "blockade" against neurological disorders.\u000a\u000aAge-Related Macular Degeneration. A Portuguese study found that drinking about 78 milligrams of caffeine daily \u2014 about the amount in one shot of espresso \u2014 lowered the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in seniors.\u000a\u000aThe study found that higher consumption of antioxidants such as caffeine, beta-carotene and vitamins C and E, reduced the risk of AMD by 35 percent. "This work is a stepping stone towards effective preventive medicine in AMD," said lead author Rufino Silva, M.D., Ph.D.\u000a\u000aErectile dysfunction. Men who drink two or three cups of coffee every day are less likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) than men who don't. A study published in PLOS ONE found that men who consume 85 to 170 milligrams of caffeine a day \u2014 the amount found in two to three cups of coffee \u2014 were 42 percent less likely to have ED than men who consumed zero to seven milligrams a day. Researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston suspect that caffeine triggers a series of events that relaxes arteries in the penis which increases blood flow.\u000a\u000aProstate cancer. An Italian study found that men who drank three cups of Italian-style coffee every day reduced their risk of prostate cancer by 53 percent. The coffee was prepared "Italian Style" using high pressure, very high water temperature, and no filters. The benefit is probably due to the caffeine, but may also be increased due to the method of preparation, say scientists, which could lead to a higher concentration of the helpful bioactive substances.\u000a\u000aMelanoma. The more coffee you drink every day, the lower your risk of malignant melanoma, which is the most deadly form of skin cancer. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that people who drank four or more cups of coffee daily lowered their risk by 20 percent when compared to those who didn't drink coffee.\u000a\u000aStress. Although many claim caffeine causes the jitters, many people believe a cup of coffee or tea is calming. Scientists from Portugal, the United States, and Brazil gave mice caffeine in their drinking water and then subjected them to stress. Although stress usually quickly causes symptoms such as anxiety and memory problems, caffeine had a calming effect, and most of the usual symptoms didn't develop. Professor Rodrigo Cunha from the University of Coimbra said caffeine blocked a stress-related chemical.\u000a\u000aStill more studies found that coffee reduces the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and suicide, and helps with weight loss.

aVWhile some in America complain about President Trump, in Israel he is a rock star.\u000a\u000aI just left Israel after meeting with top officials, media personalities, tech entrepreneurs, and many citizens from all walks of life.\u000a\u000aThe overwhelming view was that America was lucky to have a strong and resolute president like Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are well informed and especially clued in on U.S. media \u2013 many can catch CNN and Fox News on TV \u2013 and they expressed bafflement to me that the American media has been so hostile to President Trump.\u000a\u000aFor the Jewish state, Trump is a breath of fresh air. After eight years of Obama, who tilted U.S. policy toward Iran and gave Israel a cold shoulder, many are breathing a sigh of relief.\u000a\u000aA recent Jerusalem Post poll found that 61 percent of Israel's Jews believe Trump is "pro-Israel" and a Pew survey of all nations found Israel to be the second strongest supporter of Trump, with 56 percent saying they had full confidence in him. (The first was the Philippines with 69 percent expressing support.)\u000a\u000aSenior Israeli officials I spoke with say President Trump has been the most supportive of any U.S. president in recent memory, including George W. Bush, who also was quite popular.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are on the front line of freedom. They are surrounded by hostile states. In their mind, appeasement is dangerous and there is little margin for error when their security is at stake.\u000a\u000aOne high-ranking Israeli official told me that the equation for Israel has changed because of three key Trump officials: Jared Kushner, the president's special adviser, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aKushner, to whom the president has given the task of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, understands that Israel is the cornerstone of regional stability.\u000a\u000aPrevious administrations typically began their peace process by blaming Israel. Kushner took a different approach by affirming Israel as a U.S. ally.\u000a\u000aBoth Mattis and McMaster, the official said, grasp the strategic role Israel has played for U.S. security in the region and they have been stalwart in their support.\u000a\u000aToday, under Trump, ISIS is being crushed.\u000a\u000aQatar, a Gulf state that has "played both sides" but consistently helps fund the bad guys, including the Muslim Brotherhood, is being contained.\u000a\u000aTrump is also taking Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism as a great threat to the region. Trump has been praised for being willing to tackle the Iranian problem as he is tackling North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump's outreach to Putin could be crucial in dealing with Iran and North Korea, one official said.\u000a\u000aI first came to Israel at the age of 19 as a college student.\u000a\u000aLife was challenging back then, but the people haven't changed. Israel is a nation of realists.\u000a\u000aThey see President Trump for what he is, a champion of freedom and security.\u000a\u000aChristopher Ruddy is CEO of Newsmax Media, Inc., one of the country's leading conservative news outlets.

aVMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are important leaders in many fields, including government, economics, entertainment, science, education, and sports. Most would agree Mormons \u201cover index\u201d in many fields that affect millions throughout the world.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed Mormons. Still, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. And, while picking only 50 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank them in what we believe is a somewhat logical order, but certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps people on the list!) may take exception with the ranking.\u000a\u000aAlso, there are many more members of the U.S. Congress than are listed. They easily could have all been listed. We opted instead, however, to list only those with particular influence, such as committee assignments, caucus leadership, etc.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note we opted to not list the most obvious influential Mormon, namely the Church\u2019s beloved president, Thomas S. Monson, who faithful Mormons revere as a living prophet. Monson, like the other \u201cGeneral Authorities\u201d are clearly the most influential Mormons, certainly on the members of the Church. Nonetheless, for purposes of this list, we opted to look outside the Church hierarchy, and focused on leaders who are currently active in their respective secular fields of endeavor.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to nm_newstips@newsmax.com).\u000a\u000a1. Mitt Romney \u2014 A fifth-generation Mormon, the former governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee served as a missionary in France. He and his gifted wife, Ann, are the parents of five sons. In addition to a distinguished career at Bain Capital, Romney is widely credited with rescuing the scandal-ridden Salt Lake City Olympic games.\u000a\u000a2. Bill Marriott \u2014 The executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International led the transformation of the family restaurant business into the world\u2019s largest lodging company. Marriott is easily one of the world\u2019s most recognizable and respected business leaders. He is also known for his tireless work within the Church and philanthropic communities.\u000a\u000a3. Orrin Hatch \u2013 Now in his seventh term as a U.S. senator for Utah, Hatch is currently chairman of the powerful Senate Committee on Finance. He is also a member and former chairman of both the the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Known traditionally as a conservative, Hatch is one of just a handful of senators who can and does effectively reach across the aisle on important legislation.\u000a\u000a4. Jack Gerard \u2013 Currently president of the influential American Petroleum Institute (API), a position he has held since 2008, Gerard has been active as a leader in the Church and is a board member and past chairman of National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He and his wife, Claudette, have eight children, including twin boys they adopted from Guatemala.\u000a\u000a5. Clayton Christensen \u2014 Clayton M. Christensen is the Kim B. Clark Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School. He is known as an expert on disruptive innovation. He is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including several New York Times best-sellers, such as "The Innovator's Dilemma." Christensen is the co-founder of Innosight, a management-consulting company; Rose Park Advisors, an investment firm; and the Innosight Institute, a non-profit think tank. Christensen is widely acclaimed as one of the world\u2019s most influential business theorists. In 2015, he won the Edison Achievement Award \u2014 a prestigious award given to world leaders in innovation. Previous winners include Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Ted Turner, and Bill Marriott.\u000a\u000a6. Harry Reid \u2014 The senior U.S. Democratic senator from Nevada currently serves as the Senate Minority Leader. Previously the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission, Reid has served in the Senate since 1986. He was a high-profile and controversial U.S. Senate Majority Leader from 2006 until 2015. Reid was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2001 (joining fellow members Frank Sinatra, Donald Trump, and Wayne Newton). The Searchlight, Nevada, native married his high school sweetheart, Landra, and together they have five children.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a7. Mike Lee \u2014 Having clearly stepped out of the long shadow cast by his famous late father, Rex Lee, Mike Lee became Utah\u2019s junior senator in 2011. Lee clerked for now Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito while Alito was a judge on the Third Circuit Court. Known as one of the most staunchly conservative senators, friends and associates say he is also known for his willingness to listen and learn from all sides.\u000a\u000a8. Jason Chaffetz \u2014 The U.S. Representative from Utah\u2019s 3rd District is currently chairman of the powerful House Oversight & Government Reform Committee. Chaffetz is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee. A popular guest on cable TV shows, Chaffetz is reportedly considering a run for Utah governor in 2020.\u000a\u000a9. Jon Huntsman (both and either Jr. or Sr.) \u2014 Utah\u2019s wealthiest citizen, Jon Huntsman, Sr., and eldest son, Jon, Jr., have both made their mark and each deserves to be on this list (but are hard to separate). After having built an impressive world-wide chemical company, Senior continues his influence through many channels, particularly through his philanthropy. His charitable giving now exceeds $1 billion, particularly in the fields of healthcare and education. Meanwhile, Jon, Jr., has served in several presidential administrations, including as ambassador to Singapore (1992-1993) and to China (2009-2011). In between, he took time to run for and win the governorship of Utah. In 2012, Republican Huntsman even made a run at the presidency. He currently chairs think tank Atlantic Council and is the co-leader, along with Joe Lieberman, of No Labels.\u000a\u000a10. Thomas B. Griffith \u2014 A graduate of Brigham Young University and the University of Virginia Law School, Griffith is now a federal judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Griffith served as the Senate Legal Counsel during the Clinton impeachment trial during which he provided nonpartisan legal counsel to both parties. Griffith was once included on The New Republic\u2019s list of Washington\u2019s most powerful, but least known people. Griffith joined the Church as a junior at McLean, Virginia\u2019s Langley High School.\u000a\u000a11. Mia Love \u2014 The U.S. Representative from Utah was the first African American female Republican and first Haitian American in Congress. Though she was raised Roman Catholic, she joined the LDS Church in 1998.\u000a\u000a12. Kim B. Clark \u2014 Clark was the popular dean of the Harvard School of Business from 1995 to 2005. He left that prestigious post to take up the mantle of president of Church-owned BYU-Idaho. Clark is now an LDS Church General Authority and is also the Church Commissioner of Education. Clark and his wife, Sue Lorraine, are the parents of seven children. [*As previously noted, the editors of this list decided not to include General Authorities on this list, even though they are obviously among the world\u2019s most influential Mormons. Clark is on this list both because of his role in education in the country and because of his somewhat secular role as Commissioner of Education, not because of his position as a General Authority.]\u000a\u000a13. Bryce Harper \u2013 One of Major League Baseball's undisputed superstars, Harper amps up the energy every time he takes the field for the Washington Nationals. Harper was selected as the National League Rookie of the Year in 2012 and as the NL's MVP for 2015. At the age 23, the Las Vegas native was the fourth youngest player to win the MVP, and the youngest ever to win by unanimous decision.\u000a\u000a14. Jeff Flake \u2014 The junior Republican U.S. Senator from Arizona is known as a fiscal conservative and also serves on the Liberty Committee and the Republican Study Committee. Flake was born in Snowflake, Arizona, a town founded by Erastus Snow and William Jordan Flake, the senator's great grandfather.\u000a\u000a15. E.

aVPresident Donald Trump brushed off Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to expel hundreds of U.S. diplomatic employees from Russia, instead thanking Putin and insisting it will save the U.S. significant cash.\u000a\u000aIn remarks to reporters Thursday, Trump dismissed Putin's move, saying it would "cut down our payroll" at the State Department.\u000a\u000a"I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down on payroll," Trump said, adding: "As far as I am concerned, I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. There's no real reason for them to go back. So, I greatly appreciate the fact that they've been able to cut our payroll for the United States. We'll save a lot of money."\u000a\u000aIt was unclear whether the president was joking at all in his remarks, which were made following a security briefing held during an extended working vacation at Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course.\u000a\u000aPutin said last month the U.S. would have to cut 755 of its embassy and consular staff in Russia because of new U.S. sanctions.\u000a\u000aMoscow's move was a long-expected response to President Barack Obama's order to expel 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian recreational retreats in the U.S.\u000a\u000aObama took action following allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u000a\u000aTrump has said he believes U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia meddled in the election, but he has dismissed possible collusion between Moscow and his campaign aides as a "witch hunt."

aVWhat a man considers a crisis tells us a lot about his character. In the past governors have declared a state of emergency for hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, riots, epidemics, crime waves, Trump rallies, and earthquakes.\u000a\u000aEvidently in Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval thinks those problems are too 20th century for him. He\u2019s declared a state of emergency because Nevada is running out of marijuana! Maybe Sandoval had a severe case of the munchies that clouded his thinking or maybe his priorities are just different, but mobilizing the state government because of a "wacky tobaccy" shortage breaks new ground in emphasizing trivialities.\u000a\u000aNevada has legalized the sale of mota for "recreational" uses (are there truthfully any other?) and just two weeks after the chronic crop went on sale retailers began warning their supply is almost down to seeds and stems.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I question the need for a state of emergency. I was under the impression Mary Jane users were a calm, mellow lot more prone to expressing outrage if stores ran low on Cheetos after a "bake sale." While it was the sellers who were more prone to violence.\u000a\u000aYet blaming the governor for the laughing grass shortage is probably unfair, since he didn\u2019t support dope legalization in the first place. The blame rests on a supposedly "conservative" Republican legislature that let crony capitalism get in the way of the competition they purportedly support.\u000a\u000aNevada has 100 approved marijuana growers and 47 licensed retail outlets. One would think at a ratio of two to one there would be ample supply for all. And if the "conservatives" in the legislature had even a passing acquaintance with the market there would be plenty. Unfortunately the temptation to meddle in the market to protect big campaign contributors was too great to overcome.\u000a\u000a(Somehow this is starting to sound more and more like the Obamacare repeal failure.)\u000a\u000aAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the booze industry in Nevada was worried about competition from smoke brokers. It\u2019s one thing to challenge the cartels when marijuana was illegal and well-armed entrepreneurs controlled distribution, but ordering your lobbyist to twist a few legislative arms is no problem.\u000a\u000aAs a result the legislature supported allowing only liquor wholesalers to move the killer bud from the hydro farms to the retail outlets. In a world where high school kids have no difficulty obtaining left\u2013handed cigarettes, you\u2019d think the legislature could manage a simple transport issue.\u000a\u000aInstead they turned it over to the bureaucracy for implementation, which kept the campaign contributions flowing, but not the reefer. Nothing excites a bureaucrat like the opportunity to regulate a virgin industry. First you get to write the rules, then you can cash in by joining the parasite sector and lobbying your old bureaucracy over the rules you established!\u000a\u000aYou might be under the mistaken impression Nevada is too dry for a swamp, but you would be wrong.\u000a\u000aOut of the 70 alcohol distributors only seven were interested in completing the application process. This indicates one of two market conditions undermined the new program. One, maybe the John Barleycorn cartel wasn\u2019t so concerned about sensimilla shipping after all and the inhale market wasn\u2019t quite the threat to the swallow market that had been feared.\u000a\u000aOr the new rules were so complicated and expensive to follow that the liquor distributors decided to stick with what they knew.\u000a\u000aDeclaring the state of emergency means the state bureaucracy can issue new rules on yerba sales. After the first disaster a chastened bureaucracy could ask the legislature to end the limitation on shippers and let the retailers make their own arrangements as is done in Colorado.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re requesting permission to run a natural gas pipeline across the state, their goal is just to make it easier to fill a few pipes.\u000a\u000aRight now the stores that sell the herb are running low on inventory because of demand from two markets. One is the recreational market and the other is the "medical" marijuana market. Sellers have been "cannabis-izing" the "medical" supply to meet the demand from the just want to have fun crowd, possibly because they were healthier and would put up a bigger fight than the "medical" users.\u000a\u000aNow during the "emergency" government opponents and media members will be rounded up, wait that\u2019s in Venezuela. In Nevada the "emergency" allowed the Nevada Tax Commission to expand the definition of who is allowed to transport yerba, although I don\u2019t foresee the regulations loosening enough to certify an illegal with a backpack.\u000a\u000aIn summary, this is a story of the intersection of two forms of dependence: Nevada residents have learned that indulging in crony capitalism can be just as addictive as indulging in chronic marijuana smoking.\u000a\u000aMichael R. Shannon is a commentator, researcher for the League of American Voters, and an award-winning political and advertising consultant with nationwide and international experience.

aVThe battle lines have been so sharply drawn, in what is now a bloodless civil war for direction of U.S. public policy, that the two sides cannot really communicate with each other. There is a commendable candor in Kellyanne Conway\u2019s statement, "They hate us and we hate them."\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t hate Never Trumpers. I know many of their principal and most articulate spokesmen who have defected from the conservative Republican ranks, and in many cases I have known them for a great many years. I could never entertain allowing a matter of political differences to interfere in a valued friendship.\u000a\u000aWhile I am hopeful that Donald Trump (also a friend) will be a successful president, and am glad that he has the opportunity to govern, I am not so impassioned on the subject that it blinds me to the virtues of some of his detractors or to the president\u2019s shortcomings.\u000a\u000aBut it is impossible to receive a serious hearing from a Never Trumper for a pro-Trump argument, and the pro-Trumpers are generally convinced of the discreditable motives of the Never Trumpers.\u000a\u000aThere is now unfolding what must be the last civilized debate about the trajectory of events in Washington, D.C. before the civil war moves from the heavy and frequent skirmishing that has intensified since the election to the fight to the death that seems inevitably to impend. The president said in a powerful address to a very enthusiastic audience in West Virginia last week, where he received the grace of conversion to the Republican party of the formerly Democratic governor, Jim Justice, that the entire special-counsel investigation into relations between the Russian government and the Trump campaign is "a total fabrication" and "an attempt to [reverse] one of the greatest political defeats in American history." So it is.\u000a\u000aDeputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said on television over the weekend that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could not go beyond the parameters of his specific assignment \u2014 Trump campaign-Russia relations and "relevant matters" \u2014 without Rosenstein\u2019s approval. When it was pointed out by Chris Wallace on Fox News that the special-prosecutor investigation of President Bill Clinton had started with financial activities in the Whitewater affair in Arkansas before Mr. Clinton became president and ended with the blue dress and Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Rosenstein made the point that in that case, the special prosecutor, Ken Starr, had to ask the authority of the then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to follow this trail and that any attempt to replicate the pattern by Mueller would require Rosenstein\u2019s approval.\u000a\u000aHe stated squarely that he would not approve "a fishing expedition." It is also reported by his own counsel that the president has communicated in the appropriate manner, through his counsel, with Mr. Mueller, and that this channel has been entirely constructive.\u000a\u000aIt is possible to believe that Mueller is a man of integrity who will confine himself to his brief and not be transmogrified by his position into an assassin leaking a dumpster-load of tendentious allegations and innuendos to the press every day, in the time-honored manner of U.S. special prosecutors where the president is in the frame. There is yet to emerge any serious evidence that anyone committed a crime in this area. The entire confection of Russian collusion arose immediately after the election, despite the fact that Democratic officials such as John Podesta had a great deal more to do with the Russians than the Republicans did, and that by historic criteria, there was no justification for a special counsel to be named at all. Some laws had been broken in the Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Whitewater matters, apparently by people in or close to the administrations, and although all three investigations were undistinguishedly conducted and led to more injustice than justice, there was at least a reason for them.\u000a\u000aIn this case, James B. Comey was fired for cause. He then produced a (vigorously contested) self-addressed memo summarizing a conversation with the president, and leaked it to The New York Times, possibly illegally, for what he volunteered to be the motive of causing the appointment of a special prosecutor to rummage through the administration of the man who fired him.\u000a\u000aThe attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had mistakenly told his confirmation hearing he had not met with Russians when he had, and left himself no choice but to recuse. Comey\u2019s sour grapes back-stab of the president may have left the just-confirmed deputy attorney general, Rosenstein, little choice, but he might have found someone other than the close friend and career benefactor of the man who had just, with questionable ethics and legality, generated the apparent need for a special counsel. Some of the president\u2019s public reflections on the subject have muddied the waters, but his chagrin is understandable\u000a\u000aThis is the same Comey who whitewashed Hillary Clinton by usurping the role of deciding whether she should be prosecuted in the e-mail controversy. This is not the role of a police chief, but he made a clear case for indictment and then announced that he had decided not to prosecute.\u000a\u000aLoretta Lynch, the attorney general, had disqualified herself by improperly meeting with President Clinton, but Comey should have reported to the deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, and left the decision to his superiors in the Justice Department.\u000a\u000aAfter the storm he caused by making this decision \u2014 ultra vires to him, but popular in the administration \u2014 he tried to square things with a brief reopening of the investigation, before slamming it shut again a few days before the election.\u000a\u000aComey tried to be the queen-maker, then the nonpartisan investigator and judge, then the returning queen-maker, and then the coup leader against the new king. This is not the role of an FBI director. It is irritating to see hostile references to J. Edgar Hoover as the original over-mighty FBI director. Hoover had his faults, but in 47 years in fundamentally the same position as Comey, he never attempted to influence presidential elections or incite a presidential impeachment \u2014 and never presumed to speak for the attorney general.\u000a\u000aWhether Mueller conducts himself professionally or not, there is no excuse for a special counsel to have been appointed, and the president was (as he need not have mentioned publicly) badly let down by Jeff Sessions. The scramble of nominal Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, and drooling partisan Democrats such as Sen. Chris Coons, to pass redundant, grandstanding legislation to protect Sessions and Mueller is nauseating.\u000a\u000aTrump ran against and defeated both parties, the Clintons, the Bushes, and Obama \u2014 and most of their close collaborators in the Congress. The war continues and until the president has enough economic progress, or enough time without gaffes that the hostile media can amplify into a wall of noise, or a sudden foreign-policy success such as with North Korea or even Venezuela, if he wants to start moving the needle of the polls upwards, he will face the problem of cowardice and lethargy in his own party.\u000a\u000aSen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement in Kentucky this week that Trump was responsible for the almost total failure of the Republican Congress to achieve anything in the past six months was just more self-serving claptrap from a familiar and very tiresome source. A lengthy pastiche of picayune snobberies in The New Yorker this week, from discredited journeymen such as Eliot Cohen, typifies the vacuity of most of the Trump-hate. The attacks are on Trump\u2019s admittedly grating (but steadily less frequent) flippancies and inattention to precise detail, but comparisons with Warren Harding in The New Yorker piece prove merely that, as in the 2016 Clinton campaign, there is no opposition argument except defamation and the pomposities of aspiring salonniers.\u000a\u000aThe apostate conservatives should realize that, if Trump loses, they don\u2019t get a new Reaganism.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s course is clear. Speak and tweet more carefully, as he is generally doing; show more focus; shut down the nonsense and indiscretions in the White House; prepare an unstoppable tax bill; take a strong line in North Korea (after three successive administrations have failed and dropped this horrible mess into his lap); denounce the Mueller investigation for the outrage that it is; do the necessary to set another special counsel on the backs of the Clintons, Lynch, Comey, Wasserman Schultz, and the unmaskers and leakers (the Democrats deserve the heat more than Trump does and this one-way shooting gallery must end). If Rosenstein allows Mueller to go fishing, challenge it in the courts.\u000a\u000aThis is a civil war and apostate conservatives should realize that, if Trump loses, they don\u2019t get a new Reaganism in the Republican party and renewed importance and self-importance for themselves; they get the semi-permanent return of those responsible for the decline of America, the sleazy transformation of America into an ineffectual force in the world and into an inert, economically stagnant welfare state.\u000a\u000aThe choice, for sane conservatives, is Trump or national disaster, and it\u2019s time for my learned friends on the highbrow right to come back to (the troubled American part of) this planet \u2014 though I see no sign of it happening.\u000a\u000aThis article first appeared in National Review.\u000a\u000aConrad Black is a financier, author and columnist.

aVWomen who experience sleep disorders like insomnia and apnea during pregnancy may be more likely to deliver premature babies than pregnant women who don\u2019t have trouble sleeping, a U.S. study suggests.\u000a\u000aCompared with women who didn\u2019t have sleep problems, women with insomnia were 30 percent more likely to have a preemie and the odds for women with sleep apnea, a breathing disorder, were 50 percent higher, the study found.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is normal to experience sleep changes during pregnancy - often due to discomfort, pain or frequent trips to the bathroom,\u201d said lead study author Jennifer Felder, of the University of California, San Francisco.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe current study focused on more impairing sleep problems that were severe enough to result in a sleep disorder diagnosis,\u201d Felder said by email.\u000a\u000aApnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder that involves repeated stops and starts in breathing, has been linked to high blood pressure during pregnancy, which is an independent risk factor for preterm births. Obesity and advanced age can make apnea more likely.\u000a\u000aEven though many pregnant women have insomnia at some point, previous studies haven\u2019t offered a clear picture of how this type of sleep deprivation influences the odds of preterm births.\u000a\u000aWorldwide, preterm birth is the leading cause of death for children under 5 years old, the researchers note in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.\u000a\u000aPregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The new study focused on preterm infants, delivered at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation, and extremely premature babies delivered before 34 weeks.\u000a\u000aIn the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.\u000a\u000aThe study team examined data on more than 3 million births in California from 2007 to 2012. They focused on 2,172 women who had a sleep disorder diagnosis and compared their birth outcomes to a randomly selected group of 2,172 mothers who were similar in many ways but had no sleep issues.\u000a\u000aWomen with sleep disorders were more likely to be black, age 35 or older, obese, and to have other medical issues like high blood pressure, diabetes and infections as well as higher odds of smoking or using drugs and alcohol while pregnant. They were also more likely to have a history of preterm birth.\u000a\u000aOverall, almost 15 percent of women with sleep disorders had a preterm birth, compared with 11 percent of women without sleep issues.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or even whether sleep disorders directly cause preterm births.\u000a\u000aEven so, the results offer fresh evidence of the link between sleep disorders and early arrivals, said Dr. Ghada Bourjeily, a researcher at Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cSleep appears to get worse in pregnancy in many, even women who do not have a preexisting sleep disorder,\u201d Bourjeily said by email. \u201cUnfortunately, we do not know yet whether improving sleep quality before or during pregnancy would prevent development of negative outcomes such as preterm birth.\u201d\u000a\u000aStarting pregnancy at a healthy weight, however, may make sleep disorders less likely, said Dr. Amos Grunebaum, director of obstetrics at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing overweight or obese increases your risk of having a sleep disorder,\u201d Grunebaum, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cIt also increases pregnancy complications.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen sleep disorders do surface during pregnancy, women should discuss symptoms in detail with their doctors, said Dr. Milena Pavlova, a researcher at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. This includes any issues with breathing, gasping or choking at night or any uncomfortable leg or body sensations that prevent sleep.\u000a\u000aExpectant mothers should also make sleep a priority in their schedules, Pavlova, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cAllow enough time for sleep - the life you save may be your baby\u2019s,\u201d Pavlova said.

"It's been a very confusing issue for the military.\u000a\u000a"I think I'm doing the military a great favor."\u000a\u000aIn a series of three tweets last month, Trump upended an Obama-era policy of more than a year that allowed transgender troops to serve openly.\u000a\u000aHis announcement came with little or no coordination with the Pentagon and landed while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was on vacation, leaving the astonished department scrambling to come up with a coherent response.\u000a\u000aFive transgender women in the US military filed suit against Trump and the Pentagon this week over the ban.\u000a\u000aIn a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, the five plaintiffs from the Air Force, Coast Guard and the Army said they faced uncertainty about their futures, including whether they would be fired or lose post-military and retirement benefits.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit was filed against Trump, Mattis and various other senior military officials by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and GLAAD, a legal advocacy group.\u000a\u000aAll the unidentified "Jane Doe" plaintiffs were previously men who have transitioned to being female.\u000a\u000aThe number of transgender troops among America's 1.3 million active duty service members is small, with estimates ranging from between 1,320 and 15,000.\u000a\u000aIn the two weeks since Trump's tweets, the White House has still not provided the Pentagon with clear directives on how it should implement a transgender ban, so the current policy remains in place for now.

That's the problem with ratcheting it up," Mudd said on "The Situation Room" Wednesday. "The President ratchets it up and the North Koreans say, 'OK, you have got a pair or twos, we have got three threes. We are going to put them on the table.'"\u000a\u000aCole said Thursday, "Frankly, I think he meant to be crystal clear to the North Koreans and I think that was probably a good thing," adding that Trump had made his point "very clearly," and that "the North Koreans should understand that [if] they engage in provocative actions, that there'll be consequences to that."\u000a\u000aHe also said that Trump has "had more success than anybody else in getting the Chinese to take this seriously."

aVPARIS (AP) \u2014 French soldiers taking part in Operation Sentinelle are the highest profile symbols of the fight against Islamic extremism \u2014 but along with other security forces patrolling French streets are increasingly the main targets of attacks.\u000a\u000aOperation Sentinelle was created to guard prominent French sites after a string of deadly attacks in 2015. The soldiers' status as representatives, and defenders, of the state, has put security forces in the line of fire. But experts offer other reasons, too, for why attacks in France have recently focused on heavily armed protectors.\u000a\u000aNo civilians have been attacked this year \u2014 although intelligence services have foiled seven planned attacks, France's interior minister said recently. More than 230 people, many of them out for a night of fun, were killed in 2015 and 2016.\u000a\u000aIslamic radicals may seek extra media visibility presumably afforded by going after emblematic targets or be tempted by the wish to die as a "martyr," several experts said. Or they may want to up assurance of redemption with an especially "heroic" act in the ultimate stage of a life spent mainly in delinquency in which security forces were the top enemy, the experts added.\u000a\u000aKnives, machetes, hammers and vehicles have been used in the seven attacks this year \u2014 in each case against security forces \u2014 despite France's state of emergency. In the latest, on Wednesday, a BMW slammed into six soldiers as they left their barracks outside Paris for duty in what authorities said was a "deliberate" attack. The suspect, an Algerian living legally in France, was arrested after a highway manhunt and hospitalized with bullet wounds.\u000a\u000a"We need to finally suppress the idea that there is a common profile for terrorists," said Alain Bauer, a leading criminologist and security expert. But, he added, attacking security forces is "a la mode" now in France.\u000a\u000aIn 2015 and 2016, soft targets were more common, after a Syrian who served the Islamic State group as its high-profile spokesman and strategist before being killed urged sympathizers in Europe and the U.S. to launch attacks against civilians \u2014 "especially the spiteful and filthy French." High-level attacks, from the November 2015 massacres in Paris to last year's Bastille Day truck attack in Nice, followed, with 216 dead.\u000a\u000aThis year, one person, a police officer on the crowded Champs-Elysees Avenue, has been killed. One attacker died in a second incident on the avenue after his car laden with weapons caught fire after he rammed it into a convoy of gendarmes.\u000a\u000aNot all the attacks were claimed by IS, and like the attacker who plowed his car into the soldiers, not all were French. Except for Wednesday's car attack, the attackers chose tourist haunts \u2014 going after security forces, not the crowds.\u000a\u000aA study released in March by the Center for Terrorism Analysis, or CAT, showed that France isn't alone. Attacks on security forces have been a constant in the West. Between 2013 and 2016, a majority \u2014 53 percent \u2014 of 72 targeted attacks, either carried out, attempted or planned, were aimed at society's protectors. The study also showed that France, with the highest number of Western jihadis in Syria and Iraq, and largest Muslim population in Western Europe, was the most targeted Western country.\u000a\u000aIS cites France's participation in the U.S.-led coalition when claiming attacks in the country.\u000a\u000a"They want to die as martyrs," said Jean-Charles Brisard, president of the CAT center.\u000a\u000aIn November 2015, when teams of extremists stormed into Paris from Brussels and killed 130 people enjoying a weekend on the town, they "waited for intervention forces to arrive to die with weapons in their hands facing apostate forces," Brisard claimed.\u000a\u000aFor another expert, Alain Rodier, a former intelligence officer, many French Islamic extremists who go after symbols of the state had spent much of their lives doing just that as small-time delinquents. In France, police and youth in tough neighborhoods have notoriously bad relations with authorities in uniform and some delinquents who radicalize repeat old habits, he said.\u000a\u000a"In reality, they've transferred what they did before," Rodier said. They are people who haven't traveled to combat zones and take action "on their own initiative," he said, adding that the notion of redemption also can also motivate the choice of targets. They are often fed by extremist preachers whose message is "the more heroic the action the more their sins are pardoned."\u000a\u000aWednesday's attack threw the spotlight on the Sentinelle force, currently 7,000-strong with half of its members posted in the Paris region. Some have questioned why soldiers are patrolling sensitive sights from train stations and airports to places of worship \u2014 when they have never stopped an assault since their deployment after attacks in January 2015 on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a Kosher grocery.\u000a\u000aThe soldiers are "a presence that reassures, protects," Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday, but also symbols "and therefore direct targets."\u000a\u000aThey are also magnets for attacks, Bauer said.\u000a\u000aThe force's real purpose, Bauer said, is "just trying to convince your population that you're safe ... (and) let everybody go to work every day."\u000a\u000aBe they soldiers, police or gendarmes \u2014 all of whom have been attacked this year \u2014 the crucial determinant is media attention, according to Bauer.\u000a\u000a"Terrorism is about communication and violence," he said.

aVGlen Campbell, the Hollywood-handsome country singer with pop appeal whose long road to success gave special meaning to his best-known song, \u201cRhinestone Cowboy,\u201d has died. He was 81.\u000a\u000aHe died Tuesday, according to the Associated Press, citing Campbell\u2019s publicist Sandy Brokaw. No cause was given. Campbell and his wife disclosed in June 2011 that he had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and that his next round of concerts would be a farewell tour.\u000a\u000aCampbell\u2019s rendition of \u201cRhinestone Cowboy\u201d was a crossover hit in 1975, reaching No. 1 on country and pop charts. Though written and first performed by Larry Weiss, the song was so associated with Campbell that it became his nickname and the title of his 1994 autobiography, which described his hardscrabble roots and detailed how fame had led him to alcohol and cocaine, undermined his first three marriages and made him an absentee father.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s been a load of compromising, on the road to my horizon,\u201d he sang,\u000a\u000a\u201cBut I\u2019m gonna be where the lights are shining on me\u000a\u000aLike a rhinestone cowboy\u000a\u000aRiding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his memoir, written with Tom Carter, Campbell said: \u201cI loved the line confessing compromising in the first verse. I thought it was my autobiography set to song.\u201d\u000a\u000aA sharecropper\u2019s son from Arkansas, Campbell eked out a living playing guitar in bands and studios before bursting onto the scene in his 30s.\u000a\u000aGrammy Awards\u000a\u000aHe won four Grammy Awards in 1967 for performances on \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d and \u201cBy the Time I Get to Phoenix,\u201d which won the Album of the Year Grammy for 1968. Jimmy Webb, who wrote the title track on \u201cBy the Time I get to Phoenix,\u201d also provided Campbell with his next two hits, \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and \u201cGalveston.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is emblematic of the new winds blowing in from the country,\u201d New York Times critic Robert Shelton wrote in 1968. \u201cHe brings sophistication and refinement to his rural ballads and an excellent voice and fluent guitar to more urbane material.\u201d\u000a\u000aAll told, Campbell made 11 albums certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 500,000 copies, plus four albums certified platinum for exceeding 1 million, and one album, \u201cWichita Lineman,\u201d certified double platinum for 2 million in sales.\u000a\u000a\u2018True Grit\u2019\u000a\u000aMusical success led Campbell to television, as host of \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour,\u201d and film, where he acted with John Wayne in the western classic \u201cTrue Grit\u201d (1969). He toured globally in the 1970s and enjoyed a million-selling album and crossover hit with \u201cSouthern Nights\u201d in 1977.\u000a\u000aHis failed marriages, plus a turbulent romance with Tanya Tucker, offered hints at a troubled private life that included abuse of alcohol and what he called \u201cmy personal demon,\u201d cocaine. He said in his autobiography that the \u201cself-imposed mental and spiritual bondage\u201d of his life was in stark contrast to \u201cmy public image of the clean-cut, all-American boy next door.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe kicked his destructive habits in the late 1980s, crediting his evangelical Christian faith and the support of his fourth wife, the former Kimberly Woollen.\u000a\u000aA 2003 drunk-driving arrest in Phoenix produced a widely published, unflattering mug shot and a painful reminder for Campbell of the price of addiction. He spent a few days in the Maricopa County Jail and a month in rehabilitation at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California.\u000a\u000aSharecropper\u2019s Son\u000a\u000aGlen Travis Campbell was born on April 22, 1936, in the small town of Billstown, Arkansas, about 100 miles southwest of Little Rock. He was one of 12 children of John Wesley Campbell, a sharecropper, and his wife, Carrie.\u000a\u000aHe recalled in his autobiography a childhood of such poverty that his family was \u201cjust a step above the animals that we ate to stay alive.\u201d He and his brothers would sometimes travel with their father to pick crops as far away as Ohio and Indiana.\u000a\u000aLearning on a three-quarters-size guitar he received as a gift, Campbell was performing with his uncle at schools and churches and on local radio by his eighth birthday. He dropped out of high school in 1952 and moved to Albuquerque, where another uncle lived, and where Campbell played at rowdy evening dances and on television.\u000a\u000aSinatra, Presley\u000a\u000aIn Los Angeles, he wrote for a music publisher before becoming a full-time studio musician, backing recording sessions by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, among others. A guest appearance on \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d led to his own music-and-skits show, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour,\u201d which aired from 1969 to 1972.\u000a\u000aCampbell had five children from his first three marriages, all of which ended in divorce. His 15-month romance with Tucker in 1980-1981 was, in the words of a People magazine cover, \u201cthe Wildest Love Affair in Showbiz Today.\u201d Both later described their relationship as full of alcohol, cocaine and fighting.\u000a\u000aHis fourth marriage, to Kimberly, a former Rockette dancer at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall, produced three children, all musicians who accompanied their father on his farewell tour.\u000a\u000aThey also shared the stage at the 2012 Grammy Awards, where Campbell performed \u201cRhinestone Cowboy\u201d and received a Lifetime Achievement Award.

aVBlue Apron Holdings Inc. on Thursday reported a bigger-than-expected loss in its first quarterly report as a public company as the meal-kit delivery service spent heavily to woo customers, sending shares skidding 19 percent to a record low.\u000a\u000aBlue Apron has spent millions of dollars on marketing to sign up new subscribers, but has struggled to significantly squeeze more revenue from each customer amid stiff competition.\u000a\u000aThe five-year-old company, which competes with dozens of other startups including Hello Fresh and Plated, serves customers who often switch allegiance or cancel subscriptions altogether.\u000a\u000aIn a potential sign of more competition, e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc registered a trademark for a similar meal-kit service last month.\u000a\u000aThat move, along with Amazon's industry-altering deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods Market Inc have weighed on Blue Apron's shares since their market debut in June.\u000a\u000aBlue Apron's shares, which were priced at $10 in the company's initial public offering, have of late slipped below $6.\u000a\u000aBlue Apron said the number of its active customers rose to 943,000 at the end of the second quarter from 766,000 a year earlier. But average revenue per customer dipped nearly 5 percent to $251 as existing customers made fewer repeat orders.\u000a\u000aOperating expenses surged 37 percent, led by an 86 percent increase in product, technology, general and administrative costs to $65.7 million in the second quarter ended June 30. The higher expenses reflected increased hiring as well as the cost of operating two distribution centers in New Jersey.\u000a\u000aTotal revenue climbed nearly 18 pct to $238.1 million, edging past analysts' expectations of $235.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\u000a\u000aBut that increase lagged the 42 percent growth in revenue in the preceding quarter, Blue Apron said, as it cut back on marketing. Marketing spending represented 14.5 percent of revenue in the latest quarter, compared to nearly 16 percent a year earlier.\u000a\u000aBlue Apron reported a net loss of $31.6 million, compared with a net income of $5.5 million a year earlier.\u000a\u000aOn a per-share basis, Blue Apron posted a loss of 47 cents, bigger than the 30 cents analysts on average had expected.\u000a\u000aThe company's shares were down 16.7 percent at $5.20 in early trading on Thursday.

aVNorth Korea said on Wednesday it is considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with "fire and fury".\u000a\u000aThe sharp increase in tensions rattled financial markets and prompted warnings from U.S. officials and analysts not to engage in rhetorical slanging matches with North Korea.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea said it was "carefully examining" a plan to strike Guam, which is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an airbase and a Coast Guard group.\u000a\u000aA Korean People's Army spokesman said in a statement carried by state-run KCNA news agency the plan would be put into practice at any moment once leader Kim Jong Un makes a decision.\u000a\u000aGuam Governor Eddie Calvo dismissed the threat and said the island was prepared for "any eventuality" with strategically placed defences. He said he had been in touch with the White House and there was no change in the threat level.\u000a\u000a"Guam is American soil ... We are not just a military installation," Calvo said in an online video message.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, which is pursuing missile and nuclear weapons programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, also accused the United States of devising a "preventive war" and said in another statement that any plans to execute this would be met with an "all-out war wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the U.S. mainland".\u000a\u000aWashington has warned it is ready to use force if needed to stop North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes but that it prefers global diplomatic action, including sanctions. The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Saturday.\u000a\u000aTrump issued his strongest warning yet for North Korea in comments to reporters in New Jersey on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"BLACK SWAN EVENT"\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has made no secret of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile able to strike the United States and has ignored all calls to halt its weapons programmes, even from lone major ally China.\u000a\u000aPyongyang says its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are a legitimate means of defence against perceived U.S. hostility, including joint military drills with South Korea.\u000a\u000aAsian stocks fell, with South Korea's benchmark index and Japan's Nikkei both closing down more than 1 percent, while gold and the safe-haven yen strengthened.\u000a\u000a"Tensions will continue to mount and could eventually develop into a black swan event that the markets are not prudently considering," Steve Hanke, professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea and the United States remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\u000a\u000aThe South Korean capital, Seoul, is home to roughly 10 million people and within range of massed North Korean rockets and artillery, which would be impossible to destroy in a first U.S. strike.\u000a\u000aTens of thousands of U.S. troops remain stationed in South Korea and in nearby Japan, the only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons. Wednesday marked the 72nd anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city of Nagasaki by the United States.\u000a\u000a"WAR, WAR, WAR"\u000a\u000aA senior official at South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House rejected talk of a crisis on the Korean peninsula, saying Seoul saw a high possibility of resolving the issue peacefully.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy the United Atates, needed to realise that its provocations are making the country more isolated and it should respond to the South\u2019s proposal for dialogue, the official said.\u000a\u000aIn Dandong, a Chinese trading hub across the border from North Korea, residents said they were unperturbed by the escalating rhetoric.\u000a\u000a"North Korea always talks about war, war, war, but it never happens," said a restaurant owner who asked to be identified only by her surname, Yang.\u000a\u000a"We now live in peaceful times. But if war does break out it will be us ordinary people that suffer," she said.\u000a\u000aTensions in the region have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two ICBM tests in July.\u000a\u000aJapanese fighters conducted joint air drills with U.S. supersonic bombers in Japanese skies close to the Korean peninsula on Tuesday, Japan's Air Self Defence Force said.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, two U.S. B-1 bombers flew from Guam over the Korean peninsula as part of its "continuous bomber presence", a U.S. official said, in a sign of Guam's strategic importance.\u000a\u000aDEEPLY TROUBLING\u000a\u000aGuam, popular with Japanese and South Korean tourists, is protected by the advanced U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, deployed in South Korea.\u000a\u000a\u201cI know they\u2019ve not been successful,\u201d Vilma Quichocho, a treasurer at Guam's Department of Administration said of previous attempts to launch missiles from North Korea. \u201cBut now they\u2019re talking about nuclear warheads and it\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\u000a\u000aMadeleine Z. Bordallo, the U.S. Congresswoman for Guam, said she was confident U.S. forces could protect it from the "deeply troubling" North Korean nuclear threat. She called on Trump to show "steady leadership" and work with the international community to lower tensions.\u000a\u000aSeoul resident Kim Sung-un, 29, said North Korea tended to make a lot of threats about missile attacks, but did not follow through.\u000a\u000a"So I am leaning toward going to Guam, but also at the same time, I can\u2019t help feeling from anxious about it," she said.\u000a\u000aRepublican U.S. Senator John McCain said Trump should tread cautiously when issuing threats unless he is prepared to act.\u000a\u000a"I take exception to the president\u2019s comments because you've got to be sure you can do what you say you\u2019re going to do," he said in a radio interview.\u000a\u000aA Japanese government source said Japan was not asking for Trump to tone down his remarks, which were in line with his policy of not letting the other side know what the United States might actually do while keeping all its options on the table.\u000a\u000aFormer U.S. diplomat Douglas Paal, now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington, said Trump should not get into a war of words with Pyongyang.\u000a\u000a"It strikes me as an amateurish reflection of a belief that we should give as we get rhetorically. That might be satisfying at one level, but it takes us down into the mud that we should let Pyongyang enjoy alone," said Paal, who served as a White House official under previous Republican administrations.

aVInvestors pulled $200 million from Jeffrey Gundlach's DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund in July, extending an outflow streak that began in November, according to Morningstar Inc. data.\u000a\u000aThe fund, managed by Gundlach, a closely watched investor, and DoubleLine Capital LP President Philip Barach, has posted outflows of $3.6 billion so far this year. The fund had total assets under management of $53.61 billion as of the end of July, the research service said.\u000a\u000aThe withdrawals are notable given that other bond funds are swimming in new cash from investors and at a time when the DoubleLine fund's performance has been strong.\u000a\u000aSome $203 billion flowed into bond funds in the first half of 2017, and bond funds overall have not recorded a single week of outflows all year, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.\u000a\u000aDoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund's lower-cost institutional shares were up 3.2 percent this year through Tuesday, beating its benchmark, according to data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit.\u000a\u000a"Doubleline Total Return and Core Fixed Income have consistently generated stronger performance records than the Lipper peer average, while incurring below average risk," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, in an email. "Both funds have a top five-star ranking from CFRA Research."\u000a\u000aGundlach, who started discussing his views on Twitter in May, in a tweet early Wednesday said that DoubleLine is a top-ranked fund company by net cash inflows this year through July.\u000a\u000aOverall, the firm pulled $253 million into its mutual funds and ETFs during July and $2.5 billion this year, ranking 24th of 405 fund families, Morningstar data showed.\u000a\u000a"Looks to me DBL Funds are growing significantly," Gundlach wrote on his Twitter account @TruthGundlach.\u000a\u000aGundlach, who as chief executive officer at DoubleLine oversees more than $110 billion in assets, is known on Wall Street as the "Bond King."\u000a\u000aLast month, Gundlach sounded a bearish tone and told Reuters he expected gold prices to rise. He also said he initiated an options trade designed to profit if market volatility ramped up.\u000a\u000aThe CBOE Volatility Index has spiked from 9.4 on July 21 to 11.1 on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said North Korea "will be met with fire and fury" if the nuclear-armed nation threatens the United States.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Federal Reserve is already on a path of raising rates and is expected to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet this year. The tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and other policymakers globally could erode bond prices.\u000a\u000aIn a recent interview with Reuters, Gundlach said DoubleLine was "trying to focus on our strategy: growing our other funds." He was referring to the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund, DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE, DoubleLine Low Duration Bond Fund, DoubleLine Infrastructure Income Fund and DoubleLine Flexible Income Fund. Those six funds have attracted $5.8 billion this year, according to Morningstar.\u000a\u000a"We are marketing our other funds and not DBLTX," Gundlach said. "We are accomplishing exactly what we planned."\u000a\u000aDoubleLine Funds President Ron Redell said in an emailed statement that "as our net inflows show, we continue to execute our business objective of manageable growth firmwide, with increasing diversification of our assets under management into our strong-performing line of equity and fixed income strategies."\u000a\u000aGundlach has said repeatedly that he did not want to grow DoubleLine into a monstrous firm. He told Reuters in 2014, when DoubleLine crossed $60 billion in assets under management, that "most people think the definition of success is more. It's gotta be more all the time. There's a quality-of-life aspect and a way of maximizing the probability of success."

aVMany animal studies have suggested that chemicals added to breakfast cereals and other common products are adding to America's obesity crisis, but showing exactly how the process happens in humans has been difficult. Scientists at Cedars-Sinai have solved the problem.\u000a\u000aThe researchers tested three chemicals that are common in modern life. Butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) is an antioxidant commonly added to breakfast cereals and other foods to protect nutrients and keep fats from turning rancid; perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a polymer found in some cookware, carpeting and other products; and tributyltin (TBT) is a compound in paints that can make its way into water and accumulate in seafood.\u000a\u000aThe investigators used hormone-producing tissues grown from human stem cells to demonstrate how chronic exposure to these chemicals can interfere with signals sent from the digestive system to the brain that let people know when they are "full" during meals. When this signaling system fails, people may continue to eat, thus gaining weight.\u000a\u000a"We discovered that each of these chemicals damaged hormones that communicate between the gut and the brain," said Dhruv Sareen, Ph.D. When the three chemicals were tested together, the result was even more pronounced.\u000a\u000aOf the three chemicals tested, BHT produced some of the strongest detrimental effects, Sareen said. BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is a chemical allowed to be used as a food additive to prevent oxidation.\u000a\u000aBHT is on the Food and Drug Administration's GRAS \u2014 generally recognized as safe \u2014 list. It is used in foods, such as cereals \u2014 although some food manufacturers have eliminated it from their products \u2014 and is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Some studies, however, have indicated that in addition to weight gain, BHT also increases the risk of cancer, and can cause liver enlargement.\u000a\u000aSareem said that while other researchers have shown the compounds can disrupt hormone systems in laboratory animals, the new study is the first to use human pluripotent stem cells and tissues to show how they may disrupt hormones that are critical to preventing obesity in people.\u000a\u000aSareem's research found that the chemical damage occurred in early-stage "young" cells, suggesting that the findings may indicate that a defective hormone signaling system could perhaps impact a pregnant mother as well as her fetus in the womb.\u000a\u000aMore than 80,000 chemicals are approved in the United State for use in everyday items such as foods, personal care products, household cleaners and lawn-care products, according to the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. While the program states on its website that relatively few chemicals are thought to pose a significant risk to human health, it also states: "We do not know the effects of many of these chemicals on our health."\u000a\u000aIt has been difficult to test these chemicals on humans because of the health risks of exposing human subjects to possibly harmful substances, so many widely used compounds remain unevaluated in humans for their health effects, especially to the hormone system.\u000a\u000a"By testing these chemicals on actual human tissues in the lab, we potentially could make these evaluations easier to conduct and more cost-effective," Sareen said.\u000a\u000aEarlier studies have suggested that BHT increases the risk of cancer, and can cause liver enlargement.

aVNorth Korea condemned the latest round of United Nations sanctions and reiterated that it wouldn\u2019t negotiate over its nuclear program until the U.S. ceases "hostile" policies.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s regime said it will "make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country," the Korean Central News Agency reported on Monday. In a separate statement to reporters in Manila, North Korea called President Donald Trump\u2019s "America First" policy dangerous and said its nuclear program was necessary to avoid a U.S. invasion similar to those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\u000a\u000a"We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on negotiating table," North Korea said. "Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves, unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the DPRK are fundamentally eliminated."\u000a\u000aThe response shows that tensions are showing no signs of abating after the UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved measures to restrict North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Trump\u2019s administration has threatened military action if necessary to stop North Korea from obtaining an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the U.S. with a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aChina, North Korea\u2019s biggest ally and trade partner, backed the sanctions in a bid to spur dialogue. It has urged North Korea to halt future ballistic missile and nuclear tests, while also calling on the U.S. and South Korea to cease military exercises.\u000a\u000a"North Korea\u2019s response is expected, because they have their own position," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Manila on Monday night. "The key is that we cannot let the situation to continue to escalate, and we need to find an opportunity to turn things around amid the crisis."\u000a\u000aThe KCNA report came as diplomats in Asia stepped up efforts to get North Korea to resume dialogue during a regional security meeting in the Philippines. Foreign ministers from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan all spoke with their North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho in Manila.\u000a\u000a"North Korea should realize that it will face stronger sanctions and pressure if it doesn\u2019t stop nuclear and missile provocation," Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, said on Tuesday in response to North Korea\u2019s statement. "We urge North Korea to make the right choice and come to the path of denuclearization."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged Ri on Sunday to respond as soon as possible to an offer to resume talks between the two countries, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified foreign ministry official from Seoul. Ri said the offer "lacks sincerity," according to the unnamed official.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s a positive but very small step, and can at least help the two Koreas exchange some views on the current state of affairs," Kim Jin-ho, a professor of political science at Dankook University in South Korea, said of the meeting between foreign ministers. "North Korea would use the talk as a bargaining chip with the U.S., as their goal is to have dialogue with Washington, not Seoul."\u000a\u000aIn a phone call on Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Trump that North Korean issues must be resolved peacefully and diplomatically. He said the countries needed to show Pyongyang that the door to dialogue was open if North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to a Moon spokesman.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is attending the security forum in Manila, said Monday that the best signal North Korea could give that it\u2019s ready for talks with the U.S. was to halt missile launches, the Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re not going to give someone a specific number of days or weeks," Tillerson said. "This is really about the spirit of these talks."\u000a\u000aJoint discussions between six nations \u2014 China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. \u2014 collapsed in 2009.\u000a\u000aMoon, who took office in May, has advocated engaging Pyongyang with dialogue and offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Kim\u2019s first successful ICBM test July 4.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is likely to continue pursuing ballistic missile tests at its current pace of about every three to four weeks despite the sanctions, according to John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at Harvard Kennedy School. He called the sanctions "too little, too late" to cut off financing for the nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"The North Korean program remains an unconstrained one with neither sanctions nor an operational diplomatic agreement holding it back," Park said

aVScientists have the first major evidence that blood tests called liquid biopsies hold promise for screening people for cancer. Hong Kong doctors tried it for a type of head and neck cancer, and boosted early detection and one measure of survival.\u000a\u000aThe tests detect DNA that tumors shed into the blood. Some are used now to monitor cancer patients, and many companies are trying to develop versions of these for screening, as possible alternatives to mammograms, colonoscopies and other such tests. The new study shows this approach can work, at least for this one form of cancer and in a country where it's common.\u000a\u000a"This work is very exciting on the larger scale" because it gives a blueprint for how to make tests for other tumor types such as lung or breast, said Dr. Dennis Lo of Chinese University of Hong Kong. "We are brick by brick putting that technology into place."\u000a\u000aHe led the study , published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine. Lo is best known for discovering that fetal DNA can be found in a mom's blood, which launched a new era of non-invasive testing for pregnant women.\u000a\u000aThe study involved nasopharyngeal cancer, which forms at the top of the throat behind the nose. It's a good test case for DNA screening because it's an aggressive cancer where early detection matters a lot, and screening could be tried in a population where the cancer is most common \u2014 middle-aged Chinese men.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Epstein-Barr virus is involved in most cases, so tests could hunt for viral DNA that tumors shed into the blood in large quantities, rather than rare bits of cancer cells themselves.\u000a\u000aAbout 20,000 men were screened, and viral DNA was found in 1,112, or 5.5 percent. Of those, 309 also had the DNA on confirmatory tests a month later. After endoscope and MRI exams, 34 turned out to have cancer.\u000a\u000aMore cases were found at the earliest stage \u2014 71 percent versus only 20 percent of a comparison group of men who had been treated for nasopharyngeal cancer over the previous five years. That's important because early cases often are cured with radiation alone, but more advanced ones need chemotherapy and treatment is less successful.\u000a\u000aScreening also seemed to improve how many survived without worsening disease \u2014 97 percent at three years versus 70 percent of the comparison group.\u000a\u000aOnly one person who tested negative on screening developed nasopharyngeal cancer within a year.\u000a\u000aThe researchers estimate 593 people would need to be screened at a total cost of $28,600 to identify one cancer case. It may be worth it in Hong Kong, but maybe not in places like the U.S. where the disease is rare, and more people would have to be screened at a greater cost to find each case, said Dr. Richard Ambinder of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who wrote a commentary in the journal.\u000a\u000aStill, "this is showing that liquid biopsies have great promise," he said. "This is an advance that will indeed save lives."\u000a\u000aThe study was sponsored by an Asian foundation and the Hong Kong government. Lo and some other authors founded Cirina, a Hong Kong-based company focused on early cancer detection, and get royalties related to DNA blood tests. In May, Cirina merged with Grail Inc., a California company working on cancer screening blood tests with more than $1 billion from drug companies and big-name investors such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.

aVPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he did the US military a "great favor" by banning transgender troops from the armed forces.\u000a\u000aTrump, speaking to reporters at his New Jersey country club, said the issue of transgender service members had been "complicated" and "confusing" for the military.\u000a\u000a"Look, I have great respect for the (transgender) community," Trump said. "I think I have great support -- or I've had -- great support from that community.\u000a\u000a"I got a lot of votes."\u000a\u000aBut Trump said the issue of transgender troops has been a "very difficult situation" for the US armed forces.\u000a\u000a"As you know, it's been a very complicated issue for the military," he said. "It's been a very confusing issue for the military.\u000a\u000a"I think I'm doing the military a great favor."\u000a\u000aIn a series of three tweets last month, Trump upended an Obama-era policy of more than a year that allowed transgender troops to serve openly.\u000a\u000aHis announcement came with little or no coordination with the Pentagon and landed while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was on vacation, leaving the astonished department scrambling to come up with a coherent response.\u000a\u000aFive transgender women in the US military filed suit against Trump and the Pentagon this week over the ban.\u000a\u000aIn a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, the five plaintiffs from the Air Force, Coast Guard and the Army said they faced uncertainty about their futures, including whether they would be fired or lose post-military and retirement benefits.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit was filed against Trump, Mattis and various other senior military officials by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and GLAAD, a legal advocacy group.\u000a\u000aAll the unidentified "Jane Doe" plaintiffs were previously men who have transitioned to being female.\u000a\u000aThe number of transgender troops among America's 1.3 million active duty service members is small, with estimates ranging from between 1,320 and 15,000.\u000a\u000aIn the two weeks since Trump's tweets, the White House has still not provided the Pentagon with clear directives on how it should implement a transgender ban, so the current policy remains in place for now.

aVJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Directly addressing his nationalist base, a beleaguered leader accuses the news media of obsessively promoting a liberal agenda, conducting a "witch hunt against me and my family," and trying to overturn unpalatable electoral outcomes through sinister legal machinations.\u000a\u000aThis may sound like President Donald Trump. But this time it is Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu has always had a thorny relationship with Israel's prominent media outlets, where top writers, broadcasters and editors are generally more open to peace-seeking concessions to the Palestinians than the prime minister's nationalist Likud Party is. But his comments at a Likud Party rally on Wednesday evening \u2014 days after police revealed he is a suspect in several corruption cases \u2014 were an escalation that could have been lifted directly from Trump's playbook.\u000a\u000aWith hundreds of adoring supporters cheering wildly, Netanyahu launched into a tirade, accusing the media and political opposition of conspiring to topple him when he cannot be defeated at the ballot box. He carefully avoided any mention of the police and prosecutors who are conducting the actual investigation.\u000a\u000a"The thought police in the media work full-time to set the agenda, and woe to anyone who veers away from it," said Netanyahu. "We know that the left and the media \u2014 and we know that it's the same thing \u2014 is on an obsessive witch hunt against me and my family with the goal of achieving a coup against the government."\u000a\u000aThe crowd chanted "Down with the Media," and one member held a large placard with a vulgar English expression against the media in front of the TV cameras. A reporter from the Times of Israel news site said Netanyahu supporters hurled insults and epithets at him, while a Channel 10 TV reporter was surrounded by a group of people who taunted him.\u000a\u000aThe tactic of attacking the media to deflect attention from political and legal trouble also seems part of an emerging zeitgeist in authoritarian-leaning countries these days.\u000a\u000aIn Vladimir Putin's Russia, independent media have been taken over by Kremlin-friendly figures and muckraking reporters have faced dismissals and even death. In Recep Teyep Erdogan's Turkey, scores of journalists are in jail, and in Viktor Orban's Hungary, the independent media is regularly vilified.\u000a\u000aBut the most striking parallel, of course, is with Trump, who has constantly attacked the media, especially after he won the Republican nomination about a year ago and many American media outlets began in earnest to fact-check his statements and frequently conclude he has a penchant for uttering provable falsehoods.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times now keeps a running tally of "Trump's Lies," and Politifact, a fact-checking project operated by the Tampa Bay Times, has classified 69 percent of Trump's statements as either 'Mostly false," ''false," or "pants on fire."\u000a\u000aTrump, in turn, has cast journalists in general as his opposition, taken to broad statements accusing the mainstream media of peddling "fake news," called reporters "dishonest" and repeatedly accused journalists of "making up" stories.\u000a\u000aIn one infamous tweet, on Feb. 17, he wrote: "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCnews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"\u000a\u000aHis White House has engaged in an extraordinarily combative relationship with the media, restricted access to certain briefings and, for a while, blocked video from the daily press briefings, which traditionally had been broadcast live.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu has employed some similar tactics. He rarely gives interviews or holds press conferences, preferring instead staged photo opportunities, handout videos or statements delivered on Facebook and WhatsApp. His government is pushing to close the Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera, accusing it of incitement. And like Trump, Netanyahu has feuded with several prominent TV journalists over their coverage. When Trump visited Israel in May, Netanyahu and his wife Sara commiserated with Trump and his wife Melania about the perceived unfairness of the media.\u000a\u000aThe situation is not clear cut. Just as Trump has the support of some right-leaning newspapers, and conservative radio and TV outlets, there are equivalents in Israel, including newspapers and websites allied with the religious and nationalist camps that support Likud. One newspaper, Israel Hayom, was founded by Netanyahu's billionaire supporter Sheldon Adelson and often serves as a virtual mouthpiece for the prime minister.\u000a\u000aBut when Netanyahu attacks the media, he is referring to Israel's venerable established publications and the main private broadcast channels.\u000a\u000aThe main boogeyman for his supporters is probably the liberal Haaretz newspaper, which is generally critical of Netanyahu. Its editorial line staunchly backs a liberal world order, and it supports far-reaching efforts to reach a deal establishing a Palestinian state and ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank.\u000a\u000aPart of the equation may relate to societal divisions. As in other countries, Israeli journalists disproportionately hail from parts of society \u2014 more secular, more educated, more urban and attuned to other cultures \u2014 than the base that supports insular policies and autocratic leaders, which can lean toward rural, uneducated and religious.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu's base, for example, is heavily populated with Israel's less-privileged: Jews of Middle Eastern descent living in poorer provincial towns alienated from the European-descended "elites" who remain predominant in academia, the legal system, the security establishment and the media.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu's version of "draining the swamp" \u2014 one of Trump's campaign touchstones \u2014 is "changing the elites."\u000a\u000aNetanyahu's own background \u2014 the secular, European-descended, American-educated millionaire son of a professor \u2014 seems to bother his base no more than Trump's wealth and Ivy League background disturbs his voters in rural America and the rust belt.\u000a\u000aIt has all added up to an effective "us versus them" approach that has repeatedly worked for Netanyahu throughout his three-decade political career.\u000a\u000aWhile all Israeli leaders have had difficult relationships with the media, Netanyahu has taken things to a new level, said Eytan Gilboa, a professor of communications and politics at Israel's Bar Ilan University.\u000a\u000aHe called Netanyahu's war on the media a "smart tactic." He said both Trump and Netanyahu realize the public's generally negative image of the media makes it an easy target.\u000a\u000a"These tactics work very well with the base, but they also spill over to the general public," he said. "They both understand they can discredit the media and the result is further mistrust in the media."\u000a\u000aLost in the debate seems to be that the media had nothing to do with the investigations into possible bribery, fraud and penchant for expensive gifts by the prime minister. The scandals were compounded last week with the announcement that a longtime Netanyahu aid, Ari Harow, had agreed to testify against his former boss.\u000a\u000aGilboa said Netanyahu knows it would be crossing a line to go after police or prosecutors. Instead, he seems to be hoping that the public attacks on the media will somehow pressure prosecutors to back down.\u000a\u000a"The left has no connection to the criminal investigations that are gaining momentum against Benjamin Netanyahu. The media is also playing third fiddle in this story. The people running the investigations are public officials whom Netanyahu himself appointed," wrote columnist Ben Caspit in the Maariv daily.\u000a\u000a"The thing that is toppling Netanyahu is his behavior throughout the years," he added.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press writers Ian Deitch in Jerusalem; Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow; Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary; Josh Lederman in Washington and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, contributed to this report.

aVSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea vowed Monday to bolster its nuclear arsenal and launch "thousands-fold" revenge against the United States in response to tough U.N. sanctions imposed after its recent intercontinental ballistic missile launches.\u000a\u000aThe warning came two days after the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions to punish North Korea, including a ban on coal and other exports worth over $1 billion. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, called the U.S.-drafted resolution "the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against" North Korea.\u000a\u000aIn a statement carried by state media, the North Korean government said the sanctions were a "violent infringement of its sovereignty" that was caused by a "heinous U.S. plot to isolate and stifle" North Korea.\u000a\u000aIt said the U.N. sanctions will never force the country to negotiate over its nuclear program or to give up its push to strengthen its nuclear capability as long as U.S. hostility and nuclear threats persist. The North said it will take an "action of justice," but didn't elaborate.\u000a\u000a"It's a wild idea to think the DPRK will be shaken and change its position due to this kind of new sanctions formulated by hostile forces," said the statement, carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\u000a\u000aThe North's statement "rhetorically expresses its anger" against the U.N. sanctions, but the country is not likely to launch a direct provocation against the United States, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. He said the North could still carry out new missile tests or a sixth atomic bomb test in the coming months under its broader weapons development timetable.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea test-launched two ICBMs last month as part of its efforts to possess a long-range missile capable of striking anywhere in the mainland U.S. Both missiles were fired at highly lofted angles and analysts say the weapons could reach parts of the United States including Alaska, Los Angeles and Chicago if fired at a normal, flattened trajectory.\u000a\u000aThe centerpiece of the U.N. sanctions is a ban on North Korean exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood products \u2014 and a ban on all countries importing those products, estimated to be worth over $1 billion a year in hard currency. The resolution also bans countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers, another source of foreign currency for the North, and prohibits all new joint ventures with North Korean companies.\u000a\u000aAccording to a Security Council diplomat, coal has been North Korea's largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year. It was then restricted by the Security Council in November to a maximum of $400 million. This year, Pyongyang is estimated to have earned $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from fish and seafood exports, the diplomat said. The diplomat was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say that North Korea, already under numerous U.N. and other international sanctions, will feel some pains from the new U.N. sanctions but won't likely return to disarmament negotiations anytime soon because of them.\u000a\u000aLim, the North Korea expert, said the North will likely squeeze its ordinary citizens to help finance its nuclear and missile programs. Shin Beomchul of the Seoul-based Korea National Diplomatic Academy said the North won't likely return to disarmament talks unless there are sanctions that require China to stop sending its annual, mostly free shipment of 500,000 tons of crude oil to North Korea and order U.N. member states to deport the existing tens of thousands of North Korean workers dispatched abroad.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.

aVA black teenager who was killed by police outside an emergency youth center in eastern Arkansas pointed a BB gun that looked like a handgun at officers before he was shot, a prosecutor said Wednesday in announcing no charges would be filed against the officers.\u000a\u000aBody camera footage shows 16-year-old Aries Clark raised what appeared to be a pistol but was later determined to be a black BB gun before he was shot on July 25 outside East Arkansas Youth Services in Marion, Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington said.\u000a\u000aEllington said the two officers who fired their weapons, Brannon Hinkle and Wesley Smith, were justified in using lethal force.\u000a\u000aAudio from the footage indicates officers "ordered, encouraged and begged" Clark to drop his weapon, Ellington wrote in a letter to the head of the Arkansas State Police, which investigated the shooting.\u000a\u000a"Clark's actions that day brought about the circumstances that threatened the lives of at least four law enforcement officers had the gun he brandished been a firearm, as was perceived by the responding officers, and I cannot find that the officers acted criminally," Ellington wrote. "Therefore, I find the officers were justified under these circumstances and no criminal charges will be filed in the matter."\u000a\u000aThe prosecutor also released body camera footage and a cellphone video, one of which appears to show Clark holding a pistol and raising it before he was shot. Police recovered a 1911 BB pistol from the location where Clark fell after he was shot.\u000a\u000aClark and Hinkle both fired shots, but only Smith's shots hit the teen, according to Ellington's letter. Hinkle was on the southwest side of the building, while Smith was behind a tree on the building's northwest side.\u000a\u000aThe shelter contracts with the state to provide services to children in foster care or who have been involved in the juvenile justice system.

What resulted is, to put it charitably, incomplete.\u000a\u000aAs a critique by the indispensable Foundation for Resilient Societies makes clear, the National Academies failed to evaluate fully present dangers to our most critical of critical infrastructures \u2013 and to our country \u2013 from sabotage, cyberattacks, electromagnetic pulses, or intense solar storms.

aVBefore Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel feuded with Attorney General Jeff Sessions over federal immigration policy, before sanctuary city politics and long before Donald Trump became president, a man they didn't know was standing at a street corner in Chicago.\u000a\u000aDennis McCann, an insurance broker, was about to cross North Kedzie Boulevard and have dinner with a friend.\u000a\u000a"He was going to meet a friend, a client, Jose Gonzalez, owner of El Cid, a restaurant there," McCann's brother Brian told me Tuesday. "They were close. My brother just wanted to cross the street and see his friend."\u000a\u000aIt was June 8, 2011, and Rahm Emanuel had just been elected a few weeks before on the charms of his former boss, then-President Barack Obama. Jeff Sessions was a senator from Alabama. President Donald Trump was just a rich guy on reality TV.\u000a\u000aMost likely there was nothing on McCann's mind about illegal immigration \u2014 and whether Americans have the right to control their own borders \u2014 issues that would later propel Trump to the presidency.\u000a\u000aWhat was Dennis McCann thinking about? "He was probably thinking the same stuff you and I would think about when we cross the street and a friend is waiting," said his brother, "like what to order, what to drink."\u000a\u000aSo Dennis McCann began crossing the street.\u000a\u000aAnd he was hit by a speeding car.\u000a\u000aAll that was left on the street were his sandals.\u000a\u000aAnd the rest of Dennis McCann was being dragged hundreds of feet down Kedzie.\u000a\u000a"I heard the impact, saw this man go up into the sky and land on the windshield," witness Alberto Aceves told the Tribune at the time, describing how Dennis McCann fell off the hood to roll under the speeding car. "I pull up to the passenger side screaming at him. 'Stop! The guy's under your car.'"\u000a\u000aThe driver finally stopped the car, got out, tried to run and was arrested by police.\u000a\u000aSaul Chavez, then 35, a Mexican immigrant here illegally, had been drinking heavily. The Cook County sheriff's office said Chavez had a blood alcohol content of 0.29 percent, more than three times the legal limit. Chavez had just completed probation after a drunken driving conviction two years before.\u000a\u000aChavez was charged with a felony \u2014 aggravated DUI \u2014 and was given a $250,000 bond. Two days after McCann was killed, federal officials filed an immigration detainer, believing Chavez was living in the U.S. illegally. The form requested that Cook County notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement if Chavez was scheduled to be released.\u000a\u000aBut as Chavez sat in jail, Chicago Democrats on the Cook County Board were playing immigration politics. Led by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Commissioner Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, and catering to the Latino vote, they worked out a new policy:\u000a\u000aThe Cook County Board decided that federal detainer requests would be ignored, and those suspected of being in the country illegally and in jail on criminal charges could make bond without fear of deportation.\u000a\u000aChavez did make bond. Cook County did not notify immigration officials. And within days, what happened?\u000a\u000aChavez fled. He disappeared back into Mexico, where he remains out of reach of the short, stubby arms of Chicago's law.\u000a\u000a"I've talked to the feds recently," said Brian McCann. "They know where he is. Chavez is in Mexico. There is a Mexican warrant out for him. But it hasn't been served."\u000a\u000aMcCann was quiet for a moment.\u000a\u000a"What justice did my brother get? Chicago Democrats got to pander to the Hispanic vote and ignore the rule of law. And Rahm now gets a campaign issue. And my brother? Nothing."\u000a\u000aI first wrote about this case years ago, and called Brian McCann on Tuesday to write about it again, to remind people that politics isn't the only thing at stake here. Lives are at stake. And the confidence in the rule of law is also at stake. Without confidence in the rule of law, a republic collapses into mob rule.\u000a\u000aSessions is threatening to withhold federal law enforcement grants if Emanuel continues with Chicago's sanctuary city policy. Emanuel filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, demanding the federal funds.\u000a\u000a"Chicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming city," Emanuel said.\u000a\u000aOur Chicago values?\u000a\u000aHearing the mayor talk, so forcefully, you almost forget that he was stridently opposed to illegal immigration. And under Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama, he demanded repeated and high-profile federal immigration raids and deportations and crackdowns at workplaces across America.\u000a\u000aBut now he's Mayor Zorro.\u000a\u000aWhat's amusing is that some are so blinded by their hatred of Trump, and so oblivious to how Chicago politics really work, that they're actually applauding Emanuel for standing up to alleged Trump bullying.\u000a\u000aRahm must smirk at such useful idiocy. It all plays into his hands. He's hurt himself with African-Americans, so he drops his sanctuary city card again and again, cozying up to Latinos as he seeks re-election.\u000a\u000a"Under Clinton and Obama, Rahm was against all this," said Brian McCann. "Now he's a sanctuary cities proponent. The rule of law is always compromised by power politics. That's all this is: power politics for Rahm and Preckwinkle. And public safety be damned."\u000a\u000aBig-city Democrats step over people like Dennis McCann, because the Dennis McCanns are in their way. Mentioning the Dennis McCanns runs counter to approved narratives, and they become the forgotten.\u000a\u000aAnd you wonder why Trump won the election?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJohn Kass has covered a variety of topics since arriving at the Chicago Tribune in 1983.

aVTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 The Latest on an investigation of eggs tainted with an illegal pesticide in Europe (all times local):\u000a\u000a4:30 p.m.\u000a\u000aReports of possibly tainted eggs linked to the pesticide scandal in the Netherlands and Belgium are cropping up in several countries.\u000a\u000aLuxembourg's government has said that it received eggs from a Belgian producer whose eggs were found to contain Fipronil. Some eggs were sent back, while others were used in minced meat and luncheon meat. The remaining minced meat has been destroyed.\u000a\u000aIn Denmark, 40 eggs from a farm affected by Fipronil have been found at a baker, Nikolai Kuhn Hove of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration told Denmark's TV2 channel. The eggs were seized Wednesday and the state agency said it would continue to monitor the situation.\u000a\u000aBritain's food safety watchdog says far more eggs from affected farms have been imported than previously thought.\u000a\u000aDutch authorities arrested two men Thursday on suspicion of involvement in the illegal use of the pesticide Fipronil in poultry farms.\u000a\u000a3:30 p.m.\u000a\u000aBritish food safety authorities say far more eggs possibly tainted with the pesticide Fipronil have been imported to the United Kingdom from elsewhere in Europe than previously thought. But they say the number is a tiny fraction of the eggs consumed each year in the country.\u000a\u000aThe Food Standards Agency says it's likely that the number of eggs that have come to the UK is closer to 700,000 than the 21,000 officials previously believed had been imported.\u000a\u000aThe agency has issued a list of recalled processed foods including sandwiches and salads in which the eggs were found, but added that many eggs were mixed with other eggs from unaffected farms, so any Fipronil residues would be diluted.\u000a\u000aThe agency says that 85 percent of eggs eaten in the United Kingdom are laid there and "we have no evidence that eggs laid in the UK are contaminated or that Fipronil has been used inappropriately in the UK."\u000a\u000aMillions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe but no illnesses have been reported.\u000a\u000a2:45 p.m.\u000a\u000aDutch investigators have detained two men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of pesticide at poultry farms that sparked a massive food safety scare in several countries.\u000a\u000aDutch prosecutors said in a statement Thursday that the two men detained during a series of raids are directors of a company that allegedly used Fipronil in egg farms.\u000a\u000aThough no illnesses have been reported, prosecutors said there is evidence that public health has been threatened by "the delivery or application of the biocide Fipronil in poultry houses in the egg sector."\u000a\u000aThe raids in the Netherlands were carried out as part of a joint action with Belgian authorities.\u000a\u000aMillions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves in Germany as well as Belgium and the Netherlands.\u000a\u000a3 p.m.\u000a\u000aDutch and Belgian authorities are carrying out raids as part of a criminal investigation into the illegal use of pesticide at poultry farms.\u000a\u000aMarieke van der Molen of the Dutch National Prosecutor's Office says investigators from the country's food safety watchdog are conducting the raids in the Netherlands. She did not provide details on which companies or individuals were targeted.\u000a\u000aVan der Molen says the Dutch raids on Thursday are part of a joint action with Belgian authorities.\u000a\u000aDozens of producers in the two countries are being investigated for eggs containing Fipronil, which is potentially dangerous. However, no cases have been reported of people falling sick.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the scandal, millions of eggs have been pulled from supermarket shelves in Germany as well as Belgium and the Netherlands.

He has told me this," Graham said in a Thursday interview with Hugh Hewitt.\u000a\u000a"We cannot allow the capability to mature in North Korea that could put every American sitting in the crosshairs of a nuclear attack by a very unstable, provocative leader of North Korea," Graham said.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. has changed its stance on North Korea away from "strategic patience," which is a code word for weakness, Graham said.\u000a\u000aWhile Graham has been critical of the president, he told Hewitt they agree on North Korea policy.\u000a\u000aTrump's outlook on the situation is "deadly serious, very curious," Graham told Hewitt. "Now the question for him is what are the options available to him under the preemption scenario."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea leader Kim Jong Un does not behave rationally, Graham said. "The last person I want to have the capability to strike the American homeland is the leader of North Korea, because he is crazy."\u000a\u000aThe senator, during a CBS News interview Wednesday, called on China to take action against North Korea.\u000a\u000a"You're going to have a war in your backyard," if they do not deal with Kim Jong Un, Graham said.

aVAttorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered the Justice Department to increase the use of civil asset forfeiture, thus once again endorsing an unconstitutional, authoritarian, and increasingly unpopular policy.\u000a\u000aCivil asset forfeiture, which should be called civil asset theft, is the practice of seizing property believed to be involved in a crime. The government keeps the property even if it never convicts, or even charges, the owner of the property.\u000a\u000aPolice can even use civil asset theft to steal from people whose property was used in criminal activity without the owners\u2019 knowledge. Some have even lost their homes because a renter or houseguest was dealing drugs on the premises behind the owners\u2019 backs.\u000a\u000aCivil asset theft is a multi-billion dollar a year moneymaker for all levels of government. Police and prosecutors receive more than their "fair share\u201d of the loot. According to a 2016 study by the Institute for Justice, 43 states allow police and prosecutors to keep at least half of the loot they got from civil asset theft.\u000a\u000aObviously, this gives police an incentive to aggressively use civil asset theft, even against those who are not even tangentially involved in a crime. For example, police in Tenaha, Texas literally engaged in highway robbery \u2014 seizing cash and other items from innocent motorists \u2014 while police in Detroit once seized every car in an art institute\u2019s parking lot. The official justification for that seizure was that the cars belonged to attendees at an event for which the institute had failed to get a liquor license.\u000a\u000aThe Tenaha police are not the only ones targeting those carrying large sums of cash. Anyone traveling with "too much" cash runs the risk of having it stolen by a police officer, since carrying large amounts of cash is treated as evidence of involvement in criminal activity.\u000a\u000aCivil asset theft also provides an easy way for the IRS to squeeze more money from the American taxpayer. As the growing federal debt increases the pressure to increase tax collections without raising tax rates, the IRS will likely ramp up its use of civil asset forfeiture.\u000a\u000aGrowing opposition to the legalized theft called civil asset forfeiture has led 24 states to pass laws limiting its use. Sadly, but not surprisingly, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is out of step with this growing consensus. After all, Sessions is a cheerleader for the drug war, and civil asset theft came into common usage as a tool in the drug war.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump could do the American people a favor by naming a new attorney general who opposes police state policies like the drug war and police state tactics like civil asset theft.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Paul is a physician, author, and former Republican congressman.

aVBeing libertarian is trendy right now, so much so that many actors, activists, politicians, media personalities, financial gurus, professors, scientists, and authors call themselves libertarians, even when they don\u2019t really qualify philosophically and fundamentally.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors defined a libertarian as a consistent advocate of free-market capitalism, minimal government, and social tolerance (thus distinguishing libertarians from conservatives). Their motto might be \u201cKeep government out of the boardroom and the bedroom.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur first effort to rank the 100 most influential libertarians came from a recent survey of libertarians carried out by FreedomFest, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest gathering of free minds.\u201d More than 10,000 people participated in the survey, identifying over 200 individuals whom they deemed most influential within the libertarian sphere. We also combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed libertarians to compile this list.\u000a\u000aStill, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. Moreover, while selecting only 100 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank the entrants in what we believe is a somewhat logical order of influence, but we certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps even some people whose names are on the list!) may take exception to the ranking.\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note that we chose to leave out a few individuals whose credentials as libertarians might be less convincing, such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Howard Stern. We may well change our minds on these omissions, but for now these individuals are left off the list.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and we welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to bestlists@newsmax.com).

aVPresident Donald Trump's "hyperbole and overheated rhetoric" toward North Korea are raising questions about whether he is showing the kind of judgment and temperament that are appropriate for handling the growing tensions between the two nations, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a frequent critic of the president, said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"Not since Harry Truman, in fact, has this kind of 'reign of ruin,' I think those were Harry Truman's words after the Hiroshima attack to pressure the Japanese into surrendering, in effect, a threat of another nuclear attack, has any president used this kind of rhetoric," the Connecticut Democrat told MSNBC's "Andrea Mitchell Reports" program.\u000a\u000aFurther, he said, the fact that Trump threatened North Korea with "fire and fury" without his words being reviewed or vetted by his national security team raises even more questions about the processes being used in the White House.\u000a\u000a"[This is] a process that will involve the most serious decisions about war and peace, and we should all recognize there's no such thing as a quick, easy preemptive strike here," said Blumenthal. "We're not talking about sending a missile or 60 missiles as was done in Syria to wipe out a hangar. A preemptive strike leads to war. And as Gen. [James] Mattis observed so powerfully, it is war that will be more devastating than we've seen many of us in our lifetime."\u000a\u000aBlumenthal said he is also "deeply concerned" about North Korea's capabilities for cyber warfare.\u000a\u000a"The cyber capabilities of the North Koreans and our adversaries are well beyond what the public understands," said Blumenthal. "In some of the briefings we've had in the Armed Services Committee, we've asked what some of the greatest threats are, [and] some military leaders say cyber."\u000a\u000aThe nation needs to be mindful about building its cyber defenses, but also declaring what would construe an act of war on the United States during the course of a cyberattack.\u000a\u000a"Sen. [John] McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I have repeatedly raised with officials of this administration and of past administrations the lack of clear policy to define what is an act of war that will prompt the kind of response that we need to do," he said. "The Russian attack on our election system, in my view was an act of war."\u000a\u000aThat attack used cyber warfare, not a military strike, but it still was an attack, Blumenthal said.\u000a\u000aHe told the program that in his view, if North Korea uses such warfare to attack financial institutions in the United States or South Korea, that "may well" constitute an act of war.\u000a\u000aBlumenthal also commented on the news that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort's home was raided by the FBI last month, calling it a "stunning development."\u000a\u000aHe said he knows as a former U.S. attorney that such tactics are used in the "most serious investigations" when dealing with a target or witness who is uncooperative and not trusted.\u000a\u000a"A judge would demand clear, persuasive evidence of probable cause that a crime has been committed and that the individual, Paul Manafort, is connected with that crime," he said.

Some, in desperation, resort to heroin and synthetic opioids smuggled into the US by Mexican drug cartels.\u000a\u000aNinety people die every day in the United States from opioid overdoses.\u000a\u000aMore than 180,000 have died since 1999, including pop icon Prince, who passed away in April 2016 at age 57 after an accidental overdose of fentanyl, a powerful opioid painkiller.\u000a\u000aDoctors in the United States prescribe more opioids than in any other country -- enough to medicate every American adult.\u000a\u000aWhile those physicians who are prosecuted for overprescribing make headlines, experts say they are not solely to blame, and that the US health care system as a whole must be held accountable for the country's spiralling opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000a"Pharmaceutical companies targeted general practitioner doctors, the ones who see most of the people who have pain," Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, whose state has been hard hit by the crisis, told AFP.\u000a\u000a"I think they certainly were misled, and they were told things that were not true."\u000a\u000aThe problem is not a new one -- it began two decades ago, as doctors were being taught to better manage their patients' pain and drug companies were touting the efficacy of opioid painkillers.\u000a\u000aThe painkillers -- meant only for patients in the most dire need -- started getting into the hands of those with chronic conditions that had been treated with simple over-the-counter drugs like aspirin.\u000a\u000aAnd they didn't know they were addictive.\u000a\u000a"You had people with a simple toothache, or knee surgery, or back surgery, that were on these opioids for too long a period of time or prescribed a higher dosage than they needed," said Robert Ware, chief of police in the town of Portsmouth, Ohio, which became a sort of ground zero for the crisis.\u000a\u000aAs more and more people were getting addicted, "pill mills" began to pop up in Portsmouth and across the nation to meet demand. These clinics were run by doctors who would prescribe opioid drugs to anyone who could pay.\u000a\u000aIn Portsmouth, a struggling Ohio town bordering two other states where the steel industry was once king, Ware was seeing pill mills become part of the economy, as addicts from nearby states traveled there to get their fix.\u000a\u000aEventually, state regulators and local law enforcement shut down the pill mills by arresting doctors and requiring that clinics be associated with established, reputable medical programs.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department has promised a further crackdown on unscrupulous doctors and pharmacists.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump -- hosting a meeting on the crisis during his summer vacation -- suggested more prosecutions as a whole may be necessary.\u000a\u000aBut in Portsmouth, Ware said the community has learned a tough lesson.\u000a\u000a"You cannot arrest your way out of this problem," the chief said.\u000a\u000aThe town's opioid addicts came from a cross-section of society, because most got hooked through legitimate prescriptions.\u000a\u000aAnd addicts needed help to recover over the long run.\u000a\u000aSo Portsmouth beefed up its health care offerings and addiction treatment -- and went from being a haven for pill mills to a refuge for recovery.\u000a\u000aOverdoses there are now trending downward, in contrast to the rest of the country, Ware said.\u000a\u000a"We are kind of ahead of the curve in getting out of the problem," he said.\u000a\u000aAcross the country, overall drug overdose deaths are rising to new highs -- 60,000 estimated fatalities in 2016. Certain states, like Ohio and West Virginia, have been harder hit than others.\u000a\u000aDeWine is fighting the epidemic from another front -- suing the drug companies. According to The Washington Post, at least 25 states, cities and countries are doing the same.\u000a\u000a"These drug companies are primarily responsible for this drug opiate epidemic. They created the problem. It's about time that they did something to help clean the problem up," DeWine said.\u000a\u000aThe federal government has proposed a 20 percent reduction next year in the amount of opioids drug companies are allowed to produce.\u000a\u000aBut physicians still appear to be writing prescriptions with gusto.\u000a\u000aWhile the numbers have declined, doctors still handed out nearly 250 million prescriptions for opioids in 2013 alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\u000a\u000a"Physicians have not fully accepted their roles as individual prescribers in feeding this particular epidemic," said Clark.\u000a\u000a"There was never good evidence that these drugs could reduce pain well," he added, "especially for prolonged periods of time."\u000a\u000anov/sst

aVCivil defense programs include emergency, preparation, and operations to protect citizens from natural disasters or military attacks. Global terrorism has given rise to the greatest concerns about a major attack on the U.S. since the Cold War.\u000a\u000aFears of nuclear or chemical strikes have intensified not only because of terrorist possibilities, but also from the saber-rattling of North Korea with its recent missile launch tests. Smaller countries and terrorist groups might have the ability to acquire nuclear devices that could be planted at ports or in cities.\u000a\u000aThe Emergency Radio Every Family Must Have \u2014 Special FREE Offer\u000a\u000aThough the type of attack is difficult to predict, there are safety measures that can be taken before, during, and after with the following six civil defense tips for a major terror attack in the U.S.\u000a\u000a1. Planning ahead \u2014 An emergency supply kit should include non-perishable food, water, battery-powered radio, flashlights, and batteries. Have a family plan so you know where family members might be and where you can meet afterwards. Get to know your community\u2019s disaster plans and warning systems. Find out if any public buildings can be used as fallout shelters, suggests Ready.gov, the official website for the Department of Homeland Security.\u000a\u000a2. Fallout shelters \u2014 With terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, the devices could cause damage but may be survivable, according to Timothy J. Jorgensen of Georgetown University. The bombs would probably be \u201cthe size that were envisioned when fallout shelters were first proposed for civil defense,\u201d he wrote in The Conversation. Ready.gov has information on building a shelter.\u000a\u000a3. Stay inside \u2014 Scientific research suggests people have an increased chance of surviving a nuclear attack on a major city, if far enough away, by immediately shielding themselves, The New York Times reported. Government officials have recommended that if the unthinkable should happen and people are able to survive the initial blast, they should quickly get inside a stable building, coming out only when officials say it is safe. Even staying in a car or in a basement would help.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Terror Chatter High, Get Your FREE Emergency Radio Now\u000a\u000a4. Take cover if caught outside \u2014 People caught outside during a nuclear blast or chemical attack should take cover with any kind of protection possible to shield themselves. Lie flat on the ground and cover your head if there is no shelter nearby during a nuclear attack.\u000a\u000a5. Follow emergency instructions \u2014 Emergency response personnel will provide you with information on your area as far as taking shelter, evacuating, or leaving for a certain location if there is a threat of a major terror attack.

aVPresident Donald Trump endorsed recently appointed Sen. Luther Strange via Twitter on Tuesday, shaking up Alabama's contentious GOP primary in which all the major candidates have tried to lay claim to Trump's message of disruptive change.\u000a\u000a"Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!" Trump tweeted Tuesday night, The Associated Press reported, as he inserted himself into a slugfest primary for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aStrange's leading opponents are Roy Moore, who was twice removed as Alabama's chief justice, and U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the House Freedom Caucus.\u000a\u000aBrooks said Wednesday that he's more aligned with Trump's agenda than Strange, the candidate of a Washington "swamp" establishment who gets his support from a super political action committee tied to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000a"I respect President Trump, but I am baffled and disappointed Mitch McConnell and the Swamp somehow misled the President into endorsing Luther Strange," Brooks' statement said.\u000a\u000aBrooks said perhaps the president is unaware that Strange was appointed by a scandal-battered governor and that he, and not Strange, supports Trump's idea of changing Senate filibuster rules, which Democrats have used to kill proposals lacking bipartisan support.\u000a\u000aThe endorsement is a welcome boost for the Strange campaign, as all of the top Republican contenders in the Aug. 15 primary have openly tried to woo Trump voters in the state where Trump continues to enjoy heavy popularity.\u000a\u000aStrange, who called Trump's election a "Biblical miracle," said he's honored by the president's support.\u000a\u000a"President Trump's election and hard work has given millions of people hope again and I'm proud to stand beside him to make America great again," Strange said in a statement Tuesday evening.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Leadership Fund linked to McConnell has spent heavily on advertising to fend off firebrand challengers to Strange, including ads that remind voters of how Brook criticized Trump when he chaired Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aHowever, the blitz has been unable to remove an air of unpredictability from this special election. Moore, who was twice removed from duties as chief justice for defying courts on gay marriage and putting a Ten Commandments statue on public display, is strongly supported by some evangelical voters.\u000a\u000aMoore said Wednesday it "remains to be seen" what impact the presidential endorsement will have.\u000a\u000a"People are not voting for President Trump. The people are voting for his agenda, that I firmly believe in," Moore said.\u000a\u000aRandy Brinson, a Montgomery physician also seeking the GOP nomination, echoed that, saying Alabama voters want someone who will fulfill the message of change.

aVMany states in the U.S. have legalized recreational or medical marijuana. It helps to reduce pain and other symptoms for many people, but it also increases the risk of adverse effects.\u000a\u000aA recent study of middle-age individuals suggests that chronic use of marijuana is tied to worse performance on verbal memory tests.\u000a\u000aDr. Reto Auer of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, and his colleagues studied nearly 3,500 volunteers who were part of a 25-year U.S. study that measured marijuana exposure and several cognitive abilities, including memory, processing speed, and executive function.\u000a\u000aReporting in JAMA Internal Medicine, the investigators found a significant association between prior years of marijuana use and worse verbal memory scores.\u000a\u000aThe study did not determine whether marijuana use caused lower verbal memory scores, or whether people with lower scores tended to be the kind of people who engaged in longer-term marijuana use.\u000a\u000aOther research has shown that chronic daily users of cannabis do perform worse on other cognitive tasks compared to their peers who do not use marijuana.\u000a\u000aTaken together, these findings point to the potential mind health benefits of moderation for those who use this drug.

The S&P 500 fell 1 percent, while the CBOE Volatility Index, or fear index, jumped 32 percent to bring its three-day rise to 47 percent.\u000a\u000aEquities globally are having an even worse stretch than their U.S. counterparts. The Stoxx Europe 600 is down 1.6 percent over three days, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Average has fallen 1.6 percent and emerging market shares measured by MSCI are down 1.9 percent, the most since May. In Korea, the Kospi 200 Volatility index jumped 32 percent over two days, hitting a four-month high.\u000a\u000aThe sudden bout of volatility followed three weeks of motionlessness, with the S&P 500 trapped in an 11-point range. To many, the peace was unnerving.\u000a\u000aTake clients of AllianceBernstein. A week ago, with almost every major equity benchmark in America sitting at a record, inquiries to the brokerage about the timing of the next 5 percent or 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 were the most-asked question to its strategists.\u000a\u000aShares are nowhere near a drop of that size, but should the current decline extend to a correction, investors will point to Aug. 8 as its genesis.\u000a\u000aThe S&P 500 erased a 0.4 percent gain Tuesday in the biggest reversal in four months after President Donald Trump said North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat to the U.S. would be \u201cmet with fire and fury.\u201d While the war scare seemed to dissipate the following day, with the index recouping a 0.5 percent loss in the final hour of the session, selling accelerated again Thursday as investors shifted focus to retailer earnings and the weakness in the credit market.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though a single-day spike in volatility and little pullback in the stocks isn\u2019t too alarming, investors are paying a very close attention as they try to figure out where the top of the market is,\u201d said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, said by phone.\u000a\u000aAs usual, tech shares bore the worst of the selling as investors exited this year\u2019s best-performing group. The Nasdaq 100 Index sank 1.5 percent Thursday while the FANG block of tech giants, including Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google, tumbled 2.4 percent.\u000a\u000aTo Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of Marketfield Asset Management, the rout is unlikely to escalate as global economic growth is strengthening, central banks continue to be accommodative and corporate America stays healthy. Despite this week\u2019s earnings disappointments, S&P 500 profits are on course for the back-to-back 10 percent growth for the first time since 2011.\u000a\u000aOther than dreading August, does the past hold any clues? Investors might look to the 1962 episode of Cuban missile crisis for an idea of the potential shock to equities should tensions between North Korea and the U.S. escalate, according to Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of derivatives research at Weeden. During those two weeks when the prospect of a nuclear war grew, the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 30-day volatility almost doubled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe brief decline by global markets is a reasonably measured response to the cross continent saber-rattling, but not in itself indicative of a meaningful change in the overall mood of markets,\u201d Shaoul said. \u201cIt remains possible that we will see another brief lurch downwards, particularly in the technology sector that seems to be the locus of hedging activity, but the chances of this developing into a meaningful correction still looks remote at the current time\u201d

aVA British company hired to help train Afghan intelligence officers billed the U.S. government for more than $50 million in questionable expenses that included luxury cars and exorbitant salaries paid to the "significant others" of the company's top executives, according to a Pentagon audit.\u000a\u000aNew Century Consulting also spent $42,000 on automatic weapons, using cash to get around a prohibition in the contract on purchasing the firearms, and showered other personnel with hefty pay and bonuses they hadn't earned. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill summarized the audit's major findings in a letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that she released on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aMcCaskill, the top ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is demanding to know which Defense Department office was responsible for overseeing the work, what steps are being taken to recover the millions of dollars in disputed payments, and whether the U.S. government has considered prohibiting New Century Consulting from receiving new federal contracts.\u000a\u000a"Whoever approved of this spending should be fired_it's a slap in the face to Missouri taxpayers and the entire contracting process," McCaskill said in a statement.\u000a\u000aMichael Grunberg, chief executive officer of New Century Consulting, said the company strives to follow federal acquisition rules and "other relevant obligations." He said it "is most unfair and is significantly inaccurate" that the executive assistants were paid inappropriate salaries. Grunberg said the audit "questioned solely the use and depreciation treatment of vehicles" and that New Century Consulting "accounted for no more than three vehicles across the entire business at any one time."\u000a\u000aGrunberg also said the purchase of the weapons was done properly and at the direction of the U.S.-led command overseeing the training and equipping of the Afghan security forces.\u000a\u000aMcCaskill's disclosure of the audit's key findings is a rare glimpse into the opaque world of battlefield contracting. Contractors are indispensable in Afghanistan, handling security, transportation, construction and more. Yet the Defense Department has faced widespread criticism that it often fails to perform rigorous oversight of the work and how exactly U.S. dollars are spent.\u000a\u000aThe report also comes amid the tense debate inside the Trump administration over the way ahead in Afghanistan. Two of President Donald Trump's most senior advisers \u2014 chief strategist Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 have been advocating a plan that would have military contractors fight the war there instead of American forces.\u000a\u000aThere are about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Trump has so far resisted the Pentagon's recommendations to send as many as 4,000 more. The Associated Press reported last week that Blackwater Worldwide founder Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was approached by Trump's top advisers to develop proposals to gradually swap out U.S. troops and put contractors in their place.\u000a\u000aThe Defense Contract Audit Agency examined New Century Consulting's invoices between fiscal years 2008 and 2013, when it was a subcontractor to another company, Imperatis Corporation. Among the costs passed on to U.S. taxpayers were expenditures for seven high-end cars \u2014 Porsches, Alfa Romeos, a Bentley, an Aston Martin and a Land Rover, according to McCaskill's letter to Mattis. The actual cost of the vehicles isn't specified.\u000a\u000a"NCC claimed that the vehicles were available to all employees but the vehicles actually were used exclusively by the chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer and the significant others of the CEO and CFO," McCaskill told Mattis. Her letter doesn't identify who the significant others are.\u000a\u000aThese "significant others" also were employed by New Century Consulting as executive assistants and had an average salary in 2012 of close to $420,000 each even though they worked from home and never traveled to customer locations, according to McCaskill's letter. She said the company was unable to show that these individuals actually performed any work.\u000a\u000aThe audit also challenged millions of dollars in compensation for other employees, including the consultants that the company sent to Afghanistan to train the forces there. McCaskill said the consultants were supposed to be paid at a 100 percent rate when deployed overseas, but only at 60 percent when on leave. But New Century Consulting gave its consultants the full rate regardless of where they were.\u000a\u000a"These excessive payments cost taxpayers over $15 million," she wrote.\u000a\u000aNew Century Consulting also gave its consultants more than $3.3 million in bonuses that they either didn't earn or that weren't required by their contracts, according to the senator.\u000a\u000aMcCaskill said the audit, completed last year, was conducted partly in response to concerns she and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, had raised after the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction identified a litany of problems with Imperatis' billing and record-keeping practices. The Defense Contract Audit Agency doesn't publicly release its audits.\u000a\u000aImperatis had a contract dating back to 2007 for intelligence training in Iraq. The work shifted to Afghanistan in 2010. Three years later the Army Contracting Command awarded New Century Consulting a contract all its own to professionalize the intelligence units within the Afghan ministries of defense and interior.\u000a\u000aThe two companies were paid $522.4 million overall, according to contract data compiled by the special inspector general. Army Contracting Command didn't respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aImperatis, formerly known as Jorge Scientific, came under heavy scrutiny in 2012 after a lawsuit filed by two former employees alleged that their co-workers in Afghanistan abused alcohol and drugs, possessed illegal weapons and engaged in appropriate sexual relationships. Imperatis went out of business last year.\u000a\u000aMcCaskill said the Defense Contract Audit Agency is currently auditing New Century Consulting's billings through early 2016 on the contract it received as its arrangement with Imperatis was ending.

aVNewsmax and other conservative media outlets have voiced strong opposition to Sinclair Broadcast Group's proposed acquisition of Tribune Media, citing concerns such a deal would undermine a free press and quash competition, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aNewsmax filed a petition Monday with the Federal Communications Commission asking it deny Sinclair's approval for its proposed nearly $4 billion merger with Tribune Media.\u000a\u000a"A free and diverse press, a bedrock principle of American democracy, will be crippled by this proposed merger," Newsmax said in its filing.\u000a\u000aIf the merger is approved, Sinclair would own stations reaching 72 percent of U.S. households.\u000a\u000aUnder current federal law, no station group can own stations reaching more than 39 percent of homes.\u000a\u000aThis "ownership cap," first instituted in 1985 by the FCC under President Reagan, sought to prevent major networks like ABC, NBC, and CBS from owning local stations throughout the country and controlling local news programming.\u000a\u000aBut recently the FCC under President Trump redefined how homes are counted using a method that applied to UHF stations when technology did not allow those stations to fully broadcast into their markets.\u000a\u000aThe redefinition has been criticized as a political move to help Sinclair, a conservative-leaning station group, bypass the ownership cap.\u000a\u000a"I like Sinclair and think they're great," Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said. "But by making these changes for Sinclair and subverting the ownership cap, the FCC is opening the barnyard door for NBC, CBS, and ABC to do the same thing."\u000a\u000a"If this deal is approved, local news shows, which are quite diverse and much less biased than the major networks, will get marching orders from New York executives," he said.\u000a\u000aSeparately from Newsmax, One America News Network and The Blaze, the channel backed by Glenn Beck, filed petitions Monday with the FCC asking the merger be denied.\u000a\u000a"Regardless of political affiliation, we should agree that robust democracy demands a variety of viewpoints from a myriad of sources," OAN and The Blaze wrote in their FCC filing. "Yet the wave of consolidation across the industry threatens this core value. And the Sinclair-Tribune merger would exacerbate this troubling tendency."\u000a\u000aLiberal organizations have come to accept the ownership cap as a good idea, seeing it as a way to limit corporate influence in Washington.\u000a\u000aIf the Sinclair merger goes through, experts are predicting most television stations could easily end up in the hands of just three major corporations.\u000a\u000a"Even though they may be ideologically aligned, Newsmax and others see Sinclair is going to be so big that they'll swallow up ad dollars and starve the conservative competition," Craig Aaron, the president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press, told the Times.\u000a\u000aSupporters of the Sinclair deal argue the ownership caps are not meaningful due to the Internet, where there is more open competition and access to news.\u000a\u000aBut a recent Pew study found 71 percent of Americans still get their news primarily from their local television station.\u000a\u000aSo far, the Internet has not helped create any significant competition for local news shows.

They vote 50-plus times to repeal Obamacare when they know there's no chance in hell that's going to happen, and then when it really could be done, that coalition falls apart. So I'm not really convinced that the Republican Party, as you and I know it, still exists."\u000a\u000aBrown also addressed reports that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch may have used an alias to conduct official government business, which seemed to go against her sworn testimony to a House committee during which she said she used her official email while she led the Department of Justice.\u000a\u000aBrown said he doubts Republican lawmakers will pursue any sort of perjury charges against Lynch.\u000a\u000a"I don't think that coalition exists strongly enough to now stand on principles and do what it's supposed to do," Brown said. "I'm a lifelong Republican, but I've lost all confidence in these people to do what we elected them to do."

aVRepublican strategist Karl Rove said that "progressive intolerance" is to blame for the Democrats' recent struggles.\u000a\u000aRove, who was deputy chief of staff and senior adviser during the George W. Bush administration, said that even though Republicans have failed to deliver on promises such as repealing and replacing Obamacare, Democrats still have failed to come together on issues.\u000a\u000a"Progressive intolerance was also evident last month after the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, announced the committee would fund pro-life Democratic House candidates," Rove wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece.\u000a\u000aDemocratic issues include struggles with race and class, according to an opinion piece by Franklin Foer in The Atlantic.\u000a\u000a"Two of the party\u2019s largest concerns \u2014 race and class \u2014 reside in an increasing state of tension, a tension that will grow as the party turns toward the next presidential election," according to Foer.\u000a\u000aThe party is also a facing a crisis in fundraising, with Republicans bringing in more than twice as much in the first months of 2017, according to Politico.\u000a\u000aRove noted that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has pushed for Democrats to support a single-payer healthcare system or face losing the support of his following.\u000a\u000a"This trend points to a broader problem for Democrats: their lack of credible, unifying positive message," Rove wrote in the Journal.\u000a\u000aAll Democrats have is opposition to President Donald Trump, Rove wrote.\u000a\u000a"That leaves Democrats with a platform that entirely consists of furious resistance to President Trump. Yet their message of obstructionism has been wholly ineffective so far."\u000a\u000aThe Democrats should be taking their message to middle America, but he predicted that would not happen because "out-of-touch ideologues and radicals have such an iron grip on the party."\u000a\u000aPresident Trump has not been immune from Rove's criticism. In July, he called Trump's criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions "stupid." He made the comment in a Fox Business interview.

Judd, costar in the "Divergent" movie series, said that she tried to set boundaries early while going through the security line, but the airport employee mostly ignored them.\u000a\u000a"I was coming through security and a guy said, 'Hey sweetheart,' and I said, 'I'm not your sweetheart, I am your client,'" Judd said.\u000a\u000a"\u2026 When I was setting my things out, he said, 'Hey nice dress!'

aVMany animal studies have suggested that chemicals added to breakfast cereals and other common products are adding to America's obesity crisis, but showing exactly how the process happens in humans has been difficult. Scientists at Cedars-Sinai have solved the problem.\u000a\u000aThe researchers tested three chemicals that are common in modern life. Butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) is an antioxidant commonly added to breakfast cereals and other foods to protect nutrients and keep fats from turning rancid; perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a polymer found in some cookware, carpeting and other products; and tributyltin (TBT) is a compound in paints that can make its way into water and accumulate in seafood.\u000a\u000aThe investigators used hormone-producing tissues grown from human stem cells to demonstrate how chronic exposure to these chemicals can interfere with signals sent from the digestive system to the brain that let people know when they are "full" during meals. When this signaling system fails, people may continue to eat, thus gaining weight.\u000a\u000a"We discovered that each of these chemicals damaged hormones that communicate between the gut and the brain," said Dhruv Sareen, Ph.D. When the three chemicals were tested together, the result was even more pronounced.\u000a\u000aOf the three chemicals tested, BHT produced some of the strongest detrimental effects, Sareen said. BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) is a chemical allowed to be used as a food additive to prevent oxidation.\u000a\u000aBHT is on the Food and Drug Administration's GRAS \u2014 generally recognized as safe \u2014 list. It is used in foods, such as cereals \u2014 although some food manufacturers have eliminated it from their products \u2014 and is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Some studies, however, have indicated that in addition to weight gain, BHT also increases the risk of cancer, and can cause liver enlargement.\u000a\u000aSareem said that while other researchers have shown the compounds can disrupt hormone systems in laboratory animals, the new study is the first to use human pluripotent stem cells and tissues to show how they may disrupt hormones that are critical to preventing obesity in people.\u000a\u000aSareem's research found that the chemical damage occurred in early-stage "young" cells, suggesting that the findings may indicate that a defective hormone signaling system could perhaps impact a pregnant mother as well as her fetus in the womb.\u000a\u000aMore than 80,000 chemicals are approved in the United State for use in everyday items such as foods, personal care products, household cleaners and lawn-care products, according to the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. While the program states on its website that relatively few chemicals are thought to pose a significant risk to human health, it also states: "We do not know the effects of many of these chemicals on our health."\u000a\u000aIt has been difficult to test these chemicals on humans because of the health risks of exposing human subjects to possibly harmful substances, so many widely used compounds remain unevaluated in humans for their health effects, especially to the hormone system.\u000a\u000a"By testing these chemicals on actual human tissues in the lab, we potentially could make these evaluations easier to conduct and more cost-effective," Sareen said.\u000a\u000aEarlier studies have suggested that BHT increases the risk of cancer, and can cause liver enlargement.

Free Test Shows You When \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here\u000a\u000aThose who are self-employed are wise to make strong choices on how best to save and protect their money in planning for retirement, experts say.Here are the four top retirement plans for those who are self-employed. Forbes recommended a SEP-IRA as its top choice for self-employed people. SEP stands for simplified employee pension. This IRA is a simple way to put money aside, pre-tax, as savings, the magazine noted. Under this IRA, investors can contribute as much as 25 percent of their income \u2014 up to $49,000 annually.This plan is a simple incentive-match plan for employees at small businesses as well as the self-employed, Forbes noted. "If you have a few employees, say, less than 10, who make more than $5,000, but far from six figures, and want to offer a plan for them as a perk, this is probably the one for you. It was designed for firms with no more than 100 employees," Forbes wrote.Small business owners or those who are independently employed may contribute up to $16,500, Forbes reported. "With a solo 401(k), as an employee, you can stash away as much as $16,500. As the employer, you can contribute another 25 percent of compensation, up to a ceiling of $49,000 including your employee contribution. If you\u2019re 50 or older, you can toss in another $5,500 extra."There are two types of Keogh plans \u2014 defined contribution and defined benefit. They are popular for those who are self-employed and earn large incomes, CNN noted . Under a defined benefit plan, you must fund it yourself. Under a defined contribution plan, you have two options \u2014 profit-sharing and money-purchase, CNN said."The profit-sharing version of the Keogh is most like the SEP; there's a ceiling on contributions \u2014 25 percent of compensation \u2014 up to $49,000, and below that limit you can put in whatever you can spare. You also can change your contribution each year. With the money-purchase plan, you pick a percentage of income you'll contribute every year, and stick with it," CNN wrote of the differences.\u000a\u000aThe IRS posts contribution limits for each plan every year.

aVFormer Reagan administration appointee, talk show host, and conservative scholar Mark Levin asks a very pertinent question regarding our leviathan federal government during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), " . . . how are these people experts? They're part of the Civil Service; they're part of a public sector union, some of them have their jobs because of seniority; some of them have them because of affirmative action . . . So the whole myth that government is filled with these experts who are noble, who are going to improve healthcare and education and so forth, it's been a myth, it's been a lie from day one, from their philosophers, to their thinkers, to their current politicians, like Bernie Sanders."\u000a\u000aLevin is convinced conservatives are in a battle of ideas that we are losing.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why he\u2019s written his new book "Rediscovering Americanism," which is already a New York Times bestseller. In his book Levin teaches or rediscovers the philosophy of "natural law" that was the intellectual foundation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\u000a\u000aEqually important, Levin exposes the philosophy of the "expert class" of big government advocates working tirelessly to undermine both documents.\u000a\u000aLevin writes the Founding Fathers believed in the truth of natural law, "There are universal laws, there are universal, eternal truths; right and wrong, good and evil, a moral order. People are to be virtuous, prudential, and be temperate and so forth and so on. What does it mean, these universal truths? These God\u2013given universal truths, man can't make them, man can't take them away, whether it's in the form of a legislature or a dictator or a vote of your community."\u000a\u000aProgressives, or leftists, reject this belief in favor of a system of order built by "experts." Beginning with President Woodrow Wilson, the left has sought to replace the Constitution with an invented "living Constitution" that has its air pumped into it by the political fashion of the day. "The early progressives like Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and these fellows \u2014 they relied on philosophers like Karl Marx and Georg Friedrich Hegel and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, all of whom reject the notion of the laws of nature and nature's God," Levin explained.\u000a\u000aWilson comes in for particular scorn from Levin, "He relentlessly attacked the principles of the Declaration of Independence. He dismissed them and he dismissed the Declaration of Independence as a revolutionary document by pioneers that has nothing to do with a modern and complex society as he had to as a progressive."\u000a\u000aIf you agree with Wilson then this is probably not the book for you. But if you feel that our modern U.S. is missing a coherent philosophical center and you would like to learn more about what Levin feels the Founding Fathers believed and we are missing, then "Rediscovering Americanism" is a great place to start.\u000a\u000aAnd there is no time like now to begin. As Levin warns, ". . . if we do not engage in the battle of ideas \u2014 not so much against elites, but elitism \u2014 we're going to lose because most societies are formed by the elites, by the intellectuals by the academics whether we like it or not."\u000a\u000aMichael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

aVNorth Korea's threat to launch missiles at Guam must be "considered carefully," and it can't be ignored, Rep. Trent Franks, a member of the House Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"We only have a short period of time to ascertain the trajectory, and whether or not the missiles are on track to hit Guam," the Arizona Republican told MSNBC. "If we think that trajectory is on track, we would have to engage our own missile defense capability."\u000a\u000aThe United States should not be where it is, but the decisions of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have left the country in a perilous state with not only North Korea, but also Iran.\u000a\u000a"Bill Clinton had an opportunity to negotiate with the North Koreans, and he made a deal," Franks said. "He paid the ransom but didn't secure the hostage. Barack Obama did the same thing with Iran."\u000a\u000aNow, Franks said, the United States is facing a situation in which its most dangerous enemies could be armed with nuclear weapons, and "that's not good news for children and future generations."\u000a\u000aThe United States, he continued, as two ways to defend itself against intercontinental ballistic missiles bearing nuclear warheads: either to interdict them in flight or to be able to prevent them from being launched.\u000a\u000a"The main predicate for decades now against very dangerous enemies has been deterrence," said Franks. "They have to believe there's no gain in attacking the United States. I think the president is making it clear to North Korea that if they should attack the United States with nuclear weapons, that there will be absolutely no gain to them, and great harm to them if that occurs."\u000a\u000aHe said he does believe that President Donald Trump, with his strong warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, is making it clear that North Korea will meet with no gain should it attack the United States with nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, there has been a great deal of information on North Korea for decades, and the opportunity to deny the country the capability for nuclear weapons, said Franks.

aVAn Atlanta gym owner is not backing down after posting a sign barring cops from the premises.\u000a\u000aJim Chambers, owner of the EAV Barbell Club, got a lot of backlash over the sign, which read, \u201cDo whatever the f*** you want, correctly, except crossfit cultism. No f***ing cops,\u201d 11Alive News reported.\u000a\u000aChambers said he's has had a no police or active military policy since opening because many of those who use the gym are minorities and are uncomfortable with officers being there.\u000a\u000aChambers did take the sign down, but refused to apologize for posting it. He told 11Alive the vulgarity was what people objected to, and that he planned to put a new sign up without the foul language.\u000a\u000a\u201cWere we to respond to an emergency there, this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job,\u201d the Atlanta police department told the news station.\u000a\u000aChambers responded, \u201cIf they have a warrant, they can go anywhere they want, but we\u2019re not breaking the law (by banning police).\u201d Chambers said the gym has never needed police to help them, and he doesn\u2019t think they will ever need police there.\u000a\u000aLawyers told 11Alive that law enforcement officers are not a protected class by law, so only the courts could decide definitively whether the Atlanta gym was violating any laws by banning police and active military.\u000a\u000aTwitter users wondered whether it was wise to alienate police and noted the gym owner's free speech rights to do so.\u000a\u000aPoor choice but his choice.\u000a\u000aHope he doesn't expect a fast 911 response from PD or FD if he ever needs it. \u2014 Cara TXZEAL (@Cara_TXZEAL) August 9, 2017\u000a\u000awas gonna say, guess who's getting robbed by intelligent criminals with a 2 hour police response time? \u2014 Jason Redacted (@Jason_Redacted) August 9, 2017\u000a\u000aHere's some free speech for you today. https://t.co/X6Lrx7Zsyy \u2014 joseph granda (@wildernesspilot) August 9, 2017

aVEarlier this week, the Trump Department of Justice told the mayor of Chicago that it would cease funding grants to the Chicago Police Department that had been approved in the Obama administration because Chicago city officials were not cooperating with federal immigration officials.\u000a\u000aThe DOJ contended that Chicago officials were contributing to lawlessness by refusing to inform the feds of the whereabouts of undocumented foreign-born people, thereby creating what the feds derisively call a "sanctuary city," and Chicago officials have argued that their police officers and clerical folks are not obligated to work for the feds.\u000a\u000aWho is correct?\u000a\u000aThe concept of a sanctuary city does not mean it is a place where federal law is unenforced by the feds. Rather, it is a place where local authorities have elected not to spend their tax dollars helping the feds to enforce federal law. The term "sanctuary city" is not a legal term but a political one. The Trump administration has used the term to characterize the governments of towns and cities that have created safe havens for those who have overstayed their visas by refusing to tell the feds who these folks are and where they can be found.\u000a\u000aCan local authorities refuse to help the feds enforce federal law? In a word, yes. There is no legal obligation on the part of local authorities to help the feds with manpower or resources or data to enforce federal law within the jurisdiction of those local authorities.\u000a\u000aDuring the Clinton administration, when Congress passed legislation that directed local law enforcement to enforce a federal gun registration scheme, the Supreme Court invalidated the statute. It ruled that the feds cannot commandeer local and state officials and compel them to enforce federal laws; the feds can enforce their own laws.\u000a\u000aThe federal compulsion, the court held, violated the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution, which guarantees a representative form of government in every state. If the feds could enter a state and nullify the will of elected state officials not to spend state tax dollars, that would unconstitutionally impair representative government in those states.\u000a\u000aCan the feds withhold federal funds from cities that refuse to cooperate in the enforcement of federal law? Yes and no. In the post-World War II era, Congress began purchasing state compliance with its wishes in areas that the Constitution did not permit it to regulate. Stated differently, since Congress can spend money on any matter it wishes, as long as it is arguably for the general welfare, but it cannot regulate for the general welfare, it has used its power of the purse as a way around the constitutional limitations on its regulatory powers.\u000a\u000aThis is legalized bribery of the states.\u000a\u000aIn the Reagan administration, Congress offered hundreds of millions of dollars to the states to repave federal highways if the states lowered their maximum speed limits to 55 miles per hour. South Dakota objected. Its government wanted the federal cash for the highway repaving but did not want to lower its speed limits.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the feds. It held that South Dakota is free to reject federal dollars, but if it accepts them, it must accept the strings that accompany them, as long as those strings are clearly spelled out before the cash flows and rationally related to the expenditure of the federal funds. Because repaving highways and the maximum speeds that vehicles would travel on them were rationally related, South Dakota had to choose between its cherished liberal speed limits and federal cash. No surprise, it chose the cash.\u000a\u000aNow back to sanctuary cities. When the Obama administration offered Chicago and other cities cash to purchase new police communication equipment, it attached strings to those offers \u2014 but compliance with federal immigration authorities was not among them. Chicago's complaints about DOJ threats are constitutionally sound because federal strings can be imposed only by Congress and they cannot be imposed retroactively.\u000a\u000aThus, federal funds awarded in the Obama administration without the string of cooperation with immigration authorities attached may not be interfered with by the Trump administration. If the feds do withhold committed funds that lack a cooperation condition attached, a court will invalidate that withholding.\u000a\u000aIs the refusal to cooperate with the feds a form of nullification? In a word, yes. Federal law is superior to local law in areas that are primarily or exclusively federal, and immigration is unambiguously federal. Yet having pockets throughout the country without local cooperation with the feds fosters what the courts have called "laboratories of democracy."\u000a\u000aStated differently, if the local government in Manhattan or Chicago or Seattle aggressively protects undocumented immigrants who live there in return for the purchasing power and cultural diversity that immigrants bring, that may relieve social and legal pressure on governments elsewhere and will be a social experiment \u2014 a laboratory of democracy \u2014 worthy of cultural and political scrutiny and perhaps even indifference when it comes to the feds.\u000a\u000aMany Trump supporters see in the president a champion who will rid the country of those they see as unlawfully here, and they also see in liberal big-city mayors politicians pandering to interest groups. But there is a rich history to federalism, and there are two sides to its coin. The rich history is that of state and local resistance to the tyranny of the majority in Washington \u2014 a resistance as old as the country itself. The refusal of Massachusetts authorities to cooperate with the feds in the enforcement of the federal Fugitive Slave Act comes to mind.\u000a\u000aThe other side of the coin is unthinkable to my conservative brethren. If Hillary Clinton had been elected president along with a Democratic Congress and it had offered state and local governments federal funds with strings attached requiring cities to make abortions available on demand, they all would be whistling a very different and very federalism-based tune.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJudge Andrew P. Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of New Jersey. He is Fox News\u2019 senior judicial analyst.

aVSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged Democrats to "park their hatred of Donald Trump" while the threats by North Korea loom.\u000a\u000aGraham's remarks came Thursday during an interview on "The Hugh Hewitt Show."\u000a\u000a"There's nothing in the Constitution limiting the ability to use force to protect America," Graham said. "Having said that, it would be very smart if the Congress could come together and tell the president you have our authorization to use military force to stop the threat to the homeland as a last resort.\u000a\u000a"That would send a signal to North Korea and China that would probably do more good to avoid war than anything I can think of. And to accomplish that task, our Democratic friends would have to park their hatred of [President] Donald Trump and put the country first."\u000a\u000aGraham said the situation with North Korea is growing "increasingly dangerous."\u000a\u000aSo, what I'm trying to do is reinforce a message I think should be delivered forcefully, that is we will not allow North Korea to have an ICBM with a weapon on top to hit the American homeland. We're not going to contain the threat. We're going to deny that capability, and our policy has changed dramatically, and we're trying to make sure that our allies and our enemies know that.\u000a\u000aAnd Graham defended the president's strategy in dealing with the North Korea threat.\u000a\u000a"I think he's made a decision long ago, quite frankly, to try to negotiate the threat with North Korea, to try to find a way through negotiations to end the threat to the American homeland," he said. "But if negotiations fail, he is willing to abandon strategic patience and use preemption."\u000a\u000aTrump has warned North Korea it faced "fire and fury" over its threats, CNN noted.

aVWillem Buiter, the chief economist of Citigroup, reminds savvy investors that despite possibly one more looming interest-rate hike, it won\u2019t be that drastic of an adjustment.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think financial conditions at the moment for the United States are probably too easy. They encourage financial froth and speculative behavior. So taking some of this excess liquidity out of the system is beneficial for financial stability,\u201d he explained to the Epoch Times.\u000a\u000a\u201cLong-term rates are low, the stock market is booming, the currency is relatively weak, and policy rates are edging up in nominal terms very, very slowly. We\u2019ll see one more rate hike, probably at the end of the year. So that is technically tightening relative to a situation we didn\u2019t have, but there is very little absolute monetary tightness. Financial conditions and monetary policy continue to be very supportive of economic activity in the United States,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of the commentators have never seen a rate increase before. The last time the Fed started hiking was nine years ago, so any rate hike looks dramatic, when in fact it is very little on top of almost nothing,\u201d he explained.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, he urged investors to keep a sharp eye on China.\u000a\u000a\u201cChina, against my expectations, actually upped its growth in the first half of this year, and most estimates, our own included, implied a slowdown in the second half. The growth rate for this year is probably 6.8 percent, which is way above what I think is the sustainable growth rate for China,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd then there is excess capacity. It\u2019s been addressed in steel, in coal, and to a certain extent maybe in aluminum. In most other sectors, massive excess capacity is being addressed by adding to it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo it\u2019s unsustainable. It will end. When? They will keep the show on the road almost certainly until after the 19th Party Congress this fall. And then I assume that the authorities, if sufficient consolidation of political power has taken place by then, will move to restructure the bad assets and probably again create asset management companies\u2014bad banks to deal with this overhang of bad assets accumulated since 2008.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor its part, the Fed expects sluggish U.S. inflation to rise over the next several months while the hot labor market gets yet hotter, one of the Fed's most influential officials said on Thursday in comments that reinforce its gradual policy-tightening plan.\u000a\u000aIn a speech calling on the United States to better address factors driving racial inequality of employment and income, New York Fed President William Dudley suggested the central bank was on track to raise interest rates once more and begin shedding some bond holdings this year, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000a"Our outlook anticipates a continued moderate growth trend, with some further strengthening in the labor market and an increase in inflation over the medium term toward our objective of 2 percent," Dudley said in prepared remarks that did not specifically mention monetary policy.\u000a\u000aDudley, a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen and permanent voter on U.S. monetary policy, said "sluggish" productivity growth is behind persistently "modest" wage growth.\u000a\u000aUnemployment has fallen to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, yet wages have risen only at a disappointing 2-to-2.5-percent rate annually. That reflects overall U.S. price readings of about 1.5 percent in recent months, below the Fed's 2 percent goal.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVFertility rates in the U.S. have hit an all-time low with statistics released by the National Center for Health Statistics showing a decline in births since 2015.\u000a\u000aResearchers analysed the total number of births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 and found the rate had dropped from the first quarter of 2016\u2019s 62.5 births per 1,000 women to 61.5 births in the first quarter of 2017, according to the report on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.\u000a\u000aBrady E. Hamilton, lead researcher in the National Center for Health Statistics study, discovered that the number of births in the in 2016 had dropped by 1 percent from 2015.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, birth rates had declined to record lows among women in all age groups under 30 however, there was a noted increase in births rates among women in their 30s and 40s.\u000a\u000aHamilton, a statistician-demographer and expert on fertility data, said the statistics reflected demographics changes in the U.S., adding that experts could merely speculate as to why there was a decline in birth rates over the years, CNN reported.\u000a\u000aHamilton suggested this could be due to a greater importance being placed on women\u2019s education and career choices as well as a shifting economic climate.\u000a\u000aDr. Alan Copperman, director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Mount Sinai Medical Center, added his thoughts.\u000a\u000a"We see more and more women entering the workforce and delaying childbearing," he told CNN.\u000a\u000a"They're having a lower birth rate electively," he said. "But what we worry about is the non-elective birth rate. In other words, the reproductive challenges that are facing women as they try to conceive."

aVPresident Donald Trump's tweet endorsing Luther Strange is welcome news for the recently appointed senator, but it's shaking up Alabama's contentious GOP primary, where all the major candidates have tried to lay claim to Trump's message of disruptive change.\u000a\u000a"Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!" Trump tweeted Tuesday night, inserting himself in a slugfest party primary for the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u000a\u000aStrange's leading opponents are Roy Moore, who was twice removed as Alabama's chief justice, and U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the House Freedom Caucus.\u000a\u000aBrooks said Wednesday that he's more aligned with Trump's agenda than Strange, the candidate of a Washington "swamp" establishment who gets his support from a super political action committee tied to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000a"I respect President Trump, but I am baffled and disappointed Mitch McConnell and the Swamp somehow misled the president into endorsing Luther Strange," Brooks' statement said.\u000a\u000aBrooks said perhaps the president is unaware that Strange was appointed by a scandal-battered governor and that he, and not Strange, supports Trump's idea of changing Senate filibuster rules, which Democrats have used to kill proposals that can't get 60 votes.\u000a\u000aThe endorsement is a welcome boost for the Strange campaign, as all of the top Republican contenders in the Aug. 15 primary have openly tried to woo Trump voters in the state where Trump continues to enjoy heavy popularity.\u000a\u000aStrange, who called Trump's election a "Biblical miracle," said he's honored by the president's support.\u000a\u000a"President Trump's election and hard work has given millions of people hope again and I'm proud to stand beside him to make America great again," Strange said in a statement Tuesday evening.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Leadership Fund linked to McConnell has spent heavily on advertising to fend off firebrand challengers to Strange, including ads that remind voters of how Brook criticized Trump when he chaired Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aHowever, the blitz has been unable to remove an air of unpredictability from this special election. Moore, who was twice removed from duties as chief justice for defying courts on gay marriage and putting a Ten Commandments statue on public display, is strongly supported by some evangelical voters.

aVA new advisory issued by the American Heart Association unequivocally states that replacing foods high in saturated fats with those that contain unsaturated fats can reduce a person\u2019s risk of developing heart disease as much as cholesterol-lowering drugs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels,\u201d states lead author Dr. Frank Saks, leader of the advisory and professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\u000a\u000a\u201cSaturated fat increases LDL \u2014bad cholesterol \u2014 which is a major source of artery clogging plaque and cardiovascular disease,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aSaturated fats are found in meat, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm, and others.\u000a\u000aOther types of fat include polyunsaturated fats found in corn, soybean, peanut, and other oils and monounsaturated fats found in olive, canola, safflower, avocado, and other oils.\u000a\u000aThe AHA advisory is based on clinical trials that found lowering dietary intake of saturated fat and replacing it with polyunsaturated vegetable oils reduced cardiovascular disease by approximately 30 percent. That is roughly the same risk reduction achieved by cholesterol-lowering statins.\u000a\u000aThe advisory board was careful to point out that their fat recommendation should be only a part of an overall healthy diet such as the Mediterranean or DASH plans.\u000a\u000aThe researchers also noted the studies concluded that that replacing saturated fat with refined carbohydrates and sugars did not have any cholesterol-lowering benefits.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, controversial coconut oil, a saturated fat that many consider to be healthy, raised the LDL in carefully controlled studies more than safflower oil or olive oil.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven the lack of offsetting favorable aspects, we advise against the use of coconut oil, said the advisory.\u000a\u000aDr. Kevin Campbell, attending cardiologist at North Ridge Executive Wellness Center in North Carolina and a CBS on-air expert, tells Newsmax Health that not all fats are created equal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the data is clear that a diet that is dominated by lots of saturated fats will promote fat in your arteries, including a mix of nutrients into your diet is a good thing,\u201d he explains.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome lean cuts of red meat, for example, can be part of a healthy diet. Avoiding one type of food will not provide perfect cardiovascular health. We must also take stock in our fitness levels, body weight and overall diet. Together we can use multiple strategies to live a heart healthy life.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Gabe Mirkin, author of \u201cThe Healthy Heart Miracle\u201d tells Newsmax Health that the recent advisory comes as no surprise to experts who have long espoused the idea that a healthy diet and lifestyle can beat medication, when it comes to combatting heart disease.\u000a\u000a\u201cStudies from all over the world are coming to the conclusion that your can prevent heart disease by changing your lifestyle and that this method is at least as effective as taking statin drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more recent data shows that lifestyle may even be more important than drugs.\u201d\u000a\u000aMirkin adds that modern scientists are also discussing the role of anti-inflammatory foods to prevent heart disease instead of focusing solely on saturated fats and cholesterol.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever the rules remain the same whether you blame saturated fat and sugar or blame inflammation,\u201d he says. \u201cYour diet should be based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. You should restrict red meat, and avoid all processed meat and foods with added sugar as well as fried foods.\u201d\u000a\u000aCampbell adds the voice of moderation.\u000a\u000a\u201cSaturated fats are best avoided if you have high cholesterol or are at high risk for heart disease,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever no diet should be completely exclusive of any one food. These diets are doomed to failure.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s far better to focus on moderation and variety as well as taking other preventive measures such as regular exercise and reducing stress to prevent heart disease.\u201d

aVSPECIAL:\u000a\u000aFeeling Down? Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aSymptoms of depression can include sadness, despair, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. But eating the right foods can help brighten the mood for people who are down in the dumps, author and biochemist Shawn Talbott told Everyday Health magazine Here are five foods that can help people beat the blues.Turkey eaters have a biological reason for thanksgiving. Most lean sources of protein help fight depression but turkey is the food that accomplishes that best because of its abundance of the chemical tryptophan, behaviorist and author Robin H-C told Everyday Health.

It said studies have shown that children who eat oatmeal for breakfast stay sharper as the morning progresses.The omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish such as tuna, mackerel, wild salmon and blue fish have \u201cspecific brain boosting properties to fight depression\u201d and also are good for overall health, Talbott told Everyday Health. WebMD reported one scientific study showed people who rarely eat fish are more likely to suffer from depression, while another showed that societies that don\u2019t get enough omega-3 fatty acids may have higher rates of depression than societies that get sufficient amounts of omega-3.Low-fat dairy items such as skim milk, low-fat cheese and yogurt produce peptides, which are proteins that \u201cinduce a sense of well-being and relaxation,\u201d Talbott told Everyday Health. Such foods are also rich in protein, Vitamin D and calcium, which are all great for your body, Everyday Health said.The body also gets help releasing serotonin from the consumption of whole grains, whole wheat pasta, oatmeal, sweet potatoes and brown rice, author and stress management expert Debbie Mandel told Everyday Health. \u201cComplex carbohydrates are wonderful foods to improve mood quickly,\u201d she said.

aVPeople who smoke marijuana have a three times greater risk of dying from hypertension, or high blood pressure, than those who have never used the drug, scientists said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe risk grows with every year of use, they said.\u000a\u000aThe findings, from a study of some 1,200 people, could have implications in the United States among other countries. Several states have legalised marijuana and others are moving towards it. It is decriminalised in a number of other countries.\u000a\u000a"Support for liberal marijuana use is partly due to claims that it is beneficial and possibly not harmful to health," said Barbara Yankey, who co-led the research at the school of public health at Georgia State University in the United States.\u000a\u000a"It is important to establish whether any health benefits outweigh the potential health, social and economic risks. If marijuana use is implicated in cardiovascular diseases and deaths, then it rests on the health community and policy makers to protect the public."\u000a\u000aMarijuana is also sometimes used for medicinal purposes, such as for glaucoma.\u000a\u000aThe study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, was a retrospective follow-up study of 1,213 people aged 20 or above who had been involved in a large and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In 2005\u20132006, they were asked if they had ever used marijuana.\u000a\u000aFor Yankey's study, information on marijuana use was merged with mortality data in 2011 from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, and adjusted for confounding factors such as tobacco smoking and variables including sex, age and ethnicity.\u000a\u000aThe average duration of use among users of marijuana, or cannabis, was 11.5 years.\u000a\u000aThe results showed marijuana users had a 3.42-times higher risk of death from hypertension than non-users, and a 1.04 greater risk for each year of use.\u000a\u000aThere was no link between marijuana use and dying from heart or cerebrovascular diseases such as strokes.\u000a\u000aYankey said were limitations in the way marijuana use was assessed -- including that researchers could not be sure whether people had used the drug continuously since they first tried it.\u000a\u000aBut she said the results chimed with plausible risks, since marijuana is known to affect the cardiovascular system.\u000a\u000a"Marijuana stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increases in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen demand," she said.\u000a\u000aExperts not directly involved in the study said its findings would need to be replicated, but already raised concerns.\u000a\u000a"Despite the widely held view that cannabis is benign, this research adds to previous work suggesting otherwise," said Ian Hamilton, a lecturer in mental health at Britain's York University.

aVRide services company Uber Technologies Inc.'s head of operations, Ryan Graves, a long-time ally of former chief executive Travis Kalanick, is stepping down from his full-time job at the company, according to a copy of a letter from Graves seen by Reuters.\u000a\u000aGraves will continue to serve on Uber's board, it said.\u000a\u000aThe company is looking for a new chief executive after Kalanick was pressured to step down, following a series of business embarrassments for Uber.\u000a\u000aThere has been some speculation that Kalanick could return to the top job, but events this week cast doubt on that possibility.\u000a\u000aGraves said that he preferred to make his own move before the new leader was chosen.\u000a\u000a"It's really important to me that this transition doesn't take away from the importance of the onboarding process of our new CEO, whoever that might be," he wrote.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week another longtime Kalanick ally, co-founder Garrett Camp, sent a memo to employees saying that "Travis is not returning as CEO," according to a copy obtained by tech website Recode.\u000a\u000aKalanick, Camp and Graves together hold a significant voting stake in Uber.\u000a\u000aKalanick's pugnacious style largely defined Uber's approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world.

aVSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., accused members of the Trump administration Thursday of playing "good cop, bad cop" along with the president over North Korea, but instead they are coming off "more like the Keystone cops."\u000a\u000a"There's no coherent strategy," Markey, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, told MSNBC's "Morning Joe," while calling on President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and others to "stop the reckless, dangerous, scary language they are using."\u000a\u000aTrump lead with the threats of "fire and fury" against North Korea, but Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson toned down the rhetoric, by calling for dialogue and possibly a short-term deal.\u000a\u000aMattis then said if North Korea does not stop its activities, that could lead to the destruction of its people and a regime change, Markey noted.\u000a\u000aHowever, regime change is what North Koreans are "most concerned about," said Markey, and such threats will "most likely lead to them continuing to test nuclear weapons and ICBM capacity."\u000a\u000aThe conflicting rhetoric shows Tillerson and Mattis are playing a "good cop, bad cop" strategy, but instead, Markey said, the real strategy should include "urgent diplomacy" and "ever-tightening sanctions around North Korea, much tougher even than the United Nations passed."\u000a\u000aMarkey said he has joined in introducing legislation cutting off any trade coming into North Korea at all, and for sanctions for countries, including China, that engage in trade with North Korea.\u000a\u000a"We need to have negotiations, sanctions, conversations with China, which is where 80 percent of North Korea trade emanates, and begin it right now, rather than seeing this very dangerous escalating language," the senator said. "[It] could, through miscalculation, actually lead to a conventional showdown that could escalate into a nuclear event that would absolutely be catastrophic."\u000a\u000aHowever, Markey admitted he does not know how a measured diplomatic solution could happen, and he indicated Trump's key advisers, as current and retired military leaders, could be a concern.\u000a\u000a"Back in 1962, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, it was the generals who were saying that we should move to a military response," Markey said. "It was a cool, calm, detached President [John F.] Kennedy who kept stepping back to analyze the options to ensure that we did not, in fact, escalate into a nuclear confrontation."\u000a\u000aBut with the Trump administration, it is "just the opposite."\u000a\u000a"We're hoping that the generals around the president control the president, and even with that Gen. Mattis is talking about the destruction of the people of North Korea totally," Markey said. "It's a very dangerous situation."\u000a\u000aMarkey said he is also concerned the White House's language is leaving the impression nuclear weapons can be used, even if the United States itself does not come under a nuclear strike, and "that is completely unacceptable."\u000a\u000aThe legislation Markey and Colorado Democratic Sen. Ted Lieu have introduced, and which is supported by others in the House and Senate, says if the United States is in a conventional weapon conflict with another country, nuclear weapons are not permitted to be used without congressional authorization.\u000a\u000a"In the event of a nuclear attack against the United States, it would be different," he said, "but in a conventional setting, they would not be permitted."\u000a\u000a"It would be a strange world that we would enter that a president would be allowed to use nuclear weapons, unleashing a fury of power that has never been seen in the history of the planet, in response to threats from another country," Markey said.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., the GOP lawmaker under fire for his criticism of Republican leadership in his new book "Conscience of a Conservative," told Newsmax TV on Monday that his party desperately needs a follow a solid governing philosophy.\u000a\u000a"When I started this book . . . I thought that our party was being compromised by concepts like nationalism or extreme nationalism, protectionism, populism," Flake told "Newsmax Now" host Bill Tucker. "Those may win you an election, but they're not much of a governing philosophy.\u000a\u000a"The principles that have animated the movement for generations now [are] limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, free trade. Those things have served us well as a country, and I fear that some of those principles are in danger."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"And I'm concerned about that kind of foreign policy positions that we've taken as a party."\u000a\u000aThe rise of populism is one issue, he told Tucker.\u000a\u000a"As a conservative, you owe honesty to your constituents and my concern is that with populism \u2013 I'm not denying the popularity of populism, it's called populism for a reason \u2013 it's easy for a politicians to point to a shuttered factory and say, for example, hey those jobs were gone because of a trade deal," he said.\u000a\u000a"China took those jobs, or Mexico, when the truth is it's probably more complex than that. We know it's more complex than that, and I'm not denying that you can win some elections that way.\u000a\u000a"What I'm skeptical of is if that is a governing philosophy, and if we can win future elections, because I think it's a bit of a sugar high, populism is, and when you come down it's not very pleasant politically."\u000a\u000aStill, he believes not all is lost, and the GOP can rally.\u000a\u000a"I think we can show progress, and I commend the president for putting a good Cabinet together and filling the administration posts with some good people," Flake said.\u000a\u000a"I put out a press release the other day from my office actually praising the EPA in working with some of the federal regulators that we just haven't been able to lately for years, and so there are some good changes on the regulatory front."\u000a\u000aChange in tax policy is also a must \u2013 and something that will need bipartisan work, Flake added.\u000a\u000a"[We have] to get a hold of our deficit, which could be $1 trillion again in a couple of years and our massive, massive debt, $20 trillion, we're going to have to strike a deal of some type that's going to be required, let's face it, to sitting down with our colleagues across the aisle," he said.\u000a\u000a"The prospect of that happening right now just seems almost nil, and I'm very concerned about that as a conservative that we aren't addressing those issues . . . The deficit is a perfect example.\u000a\u000a"The only good really restraints we've put on spending over the past four years have been when we have divided government, when both parties sat down and said let's share the political risk."\u000a\u000aHe believes, paradoxically, the party of limited government, Republicans, have "a hard time doing that when we're in charge of both chambers and the White House, because the Democrats aren't inclined to help, and they'll just say, 'we'll win in the next election.'"\u000a\u000a"So that makes it very difficult, but I have to say I think it's more difficult when we assume or ascribe the worst motives to our political opponents," Flake said. "If we call them losers or clowns, it's just tough to actually sit down and reach agreements that will fulfill a conservative objective, and that's one thing that concerns me about the administration."\u000a\u000a"Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle" is published by Random House.

aVThe socials are all a-Twitter today over Google\u2019s sacking of James Damore over his leaked \u201cmanifesto\u201d criticizing the company for its blatant leftist bias. In the past few hours every time I glance up at my Twitter feed there are several hundred new tweets flooding in that blast the company for confirming what we all knew: Google is the most radically leftist company in the world today.\u000a\u000aTitled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber,\u201d Damore\u2019s document takes the Mountain View behemoth to task for an intrinsic leftist political bias that equates freedom from offense with psychological safety. He laments the shaming and silencing of dissenting opinions at Google as leading to \u201can ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred to be honestly discussed.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s surprising about Damore\u2019s manifesto (and yes as a woman I was steeled myself to be outraged given the media indignation) is just how profoundly non-threatening it is. Damore admits that bias and sexism exist, writes that he has no patience for stereotypes, and strongly believes in diversity and inclusion.\u000a\u000aDo I agree with everything he wrote? Certainly not. His argument that different personality traits between the sexes may in part explain why there aren\u2019t more women in tech is interesting and may have some kernels of truth to it, but it\u2019s clumsy and not very well-thought out.\u000a\u000aWithout wading further into the gender-equality swamp however, what really struck me was the unhinged reaction of his (now former) colleagues. Just Damore\u2019s mild dissent from Google\u2019s leftist orthodoxy caused a Pavlovian response as Googlers took to their fainting couches. One wrote that the manifesto was \u201cputting Googler\u2019s physical safety at risk.\u201d Other female Googlers (Googlettes?) claimed they were so upset by the contents that they simply couldn\u2019t come to work, thus kind of validating Damore\u2019s clumsy point no?\u000a\u000aIn an interesting twist, the internal nonsense at Google confirms months of suspicion among those of us on the right that the company is blocking, censoring, and blacklisting conservatives online.\u000a\u000aLet me explain: Breitbart\u2019s Allum Bokhari published a fascinating interview today with \u201cHal\u201d an anonymous Googler who confirms that the company\u2019s employees routinely create internal \u201cwrongthink\u201d blacklists to destroy the careers of their colleagues who don\u2019t toe the line with Google\u2019s accepted SJW (social justice warrior) groupthink:\u000a\u000a"Several managers have openly admitted to keeping blacklists of the employees in question, and preventing them from seeking work at other companies. There have been numerous cases in which social justice activists coordinated attempts to sabotage other employees\u2019 performance reviews for expressing a different opinion. These have been raised to the Senior VP level, with no action taken whatsoever."\u000a\u000aThese are the very same engineers who tweak Google\u2019s algorithms on a daily basis. Now ask yourself: Is it reasonable to believe that Google employees who keep internal blacklists of wrongthinkers, sabotage their performance reviews, and even prevent them from finding work at other companies aren\u2019t sneaking their leftist political biases into Google\u2019s completely non-transparent search algorithms? Can we take Google at face value when it claims that blocking outspoken SJW critic Jordan Peterson\u2019s YouTube account was simply a \u201cmistake\u201d? Or that the hundreds of similar examples at other lefty Silicon Valley companies aren\u2019t deliberate attempts to sabotage conservative voices online?\u000a\u000aAs Free Our Internet has warned repeatedly, the day of reckoning for Silicon Valley is coming, and the Damore firing may be the inflection point. New right personality Mike Cernovich announced just this morning plans for a \u201cfreedom rally\u201d outside of Google\u2019s headquarters to protest its blatant censorship of conservatives on YouTube.\u000a\u000aIronically, at the same time Google pinky swears that despite all of the mounting evidence, it would never, ever censor conservatives online, it\u2019s cynically using the same \u201ccensorship\u201d argument to fight new sex trafficking legislation to prosecute websites like Backpage that knowingly facilitate the buying and selling of young girls for sex.\u000a\u000aA group called Consumer Watchdog has all of the gory details here about how the company funded dozens of activist groups, professors, and legal scholars to support Backpage\u2019s legal defense to fight lawsuits filed by underage girls who had been bought and sold like cattle through Backpage\u2019s adult personals section, some hundreds of times.\u000a\u000aAnti-sex trafficking groups are enraged, with groups like the National Center on Sexual Exploitation blasting the company as \u201ccaring more about its bottom line than the victims of serial rape for profit.\u201d\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, an interesting Business Insider story last week kind of puts an exclamation point on the growing outrage over Google\u2019s complete disconnect from the rest of America. The story reported on a new restaurant that Google\u2019s elites are flocking to in Silicon Valley where they casually dine on\u2026 gold-flecked steak.\u000a\u000aChristie-Lee McNally is the founder of Free Our Internet.

aVPresident Trump's \u201cfire and fury\u201d shot Wednesday at North Korea has Republicans nationwide wondering whether his campaign promise of \u201cAmerica First\u201d is finished.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said former Texas Republican Chairman Tom Pauken, an early Trump supporter. \u201cHe has surrounded himself with war hawks and interventionists who are giving him bad advice. He needs to replace [retired Gen. Henry] McMaster at the National Security Council with someone like retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, whose views are more aligned with what Trump ran on in the campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump's controversial remark seems to fly in the face of America's nation-building and his hands-off views.\u000a\u000aBut most of the Republican leaders who spoke to Newsmax gave Trump the benefit of the doubt. They agreed that the Pyongyang regime presents enough of a threat to the world that the U.S. should deal with it and the president is right to use the strong language he did.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I don't see it that way,\u201d said attorney Marc Scaringi, co-chairman of Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania campaign in 2016. \u201cAt this point, Trump is only expressing his anger, and the anger of many Americans, in response to repeated threats from North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s abandoned his base on foreign policy,\u201d former Washington State Republican Chairman Kirby Wilbur told us. Many of Trump's supporters were upset with America not being tough enough with the real bad guys, and North Korea is seen as one of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilbur, now a popular radio talk show host, added his belief that \u201cthe grass-roots will be fine with this. We're not talking about regime change or nation-building, we're talking about massive retaliation if they attack us. And they have publically threatened to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHoly cow North Korea is threatening America not France or Uruguay!\u201d exclaimed California GOP National Committeeman Shawn Steel, a conservative activist since he was a \u201cYouth for Goldwater\u201d volunteer in 1964. \u201cNorth Korea is a cancer metastasis that threatens the civilized world. One way or the other its leadership must be eradicated \u2014 the sooner the better!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat would Hillary have done? Nothing more than talk,\u201d said Hal Daub, former mayor of Omaha, Neb. \u201cAmerican foreign policy has wasted 10 years with North Korea.

aVVeterans have a variety of resources to turn to when they have concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Symptoms of the disorder don\u2019t necessarily indicate PTSD and some reactions to stress and trauma are normal conditions.\u000a\u000aMental and physical distress, difficulty sleeping, and disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams are among the signs.\u000a\u000aThe best way to find out if you suffer from PTSD is through a medical professional, who can then advise treatment options. Doctors and online resources may identify the problem and help with the necessary treatment available.\u000a\u000aHere are six PTSD resources veterans should know about:\u000a\u000a1. VA medical centers and Vet Centers \u2014 Treatment programs are available to veterans through mental health services offered by VA medical centers. Vet Centers, located in the community along with outpatient clinics, provide readjustment counseling services that include PTSD. Services are open to vets and their families at no charge. The VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD has information about these and other programs.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat\u000a\u000a\u200b2. Counseling \u2014 Vets can find therapists, counselors, or mental health care providers that treat PTSD on their own. A family doctor may recommend someone. The VA offers information on finding a provider using the internet. Check with your health insurer to see if it includes mental health services for PTSD if you decide to take the private care route.\u000a\u000a\u200b3. Project Odyssey \u2014 The multi-day, adventure event is sponsored by the Wounded Warrior Project. Through activities such as hiking, rope courses, and rock climbing, veterans with PTSD or combat stress learn readjustment into civilian life by improving confidence, increasing skills, and overcoming fears.\u000a\u000a\u200b4. Psychological health \u2014 The Defense Centers of Excellence, under the military health system, offers programs and resources to treat psychological health and traumatic brain injuries for veterans and their families, Military OneSource explains. The DCoE has an outreach center that provides help for vets online or over the phone with information on its website.\u000a\u000aAlert: 3 Signs Clogged Arteries Are Ruining Your Heart\u000a\u000a\u200b5. Real Warriors Campaign \u2014 The program launched by the DCoE helps vets and their families with care and support for PTSD and other psychological issues. Along with valuable information on getting help through the VA, the campaign\u2019s site also offers tips on reducing stress, managing pain, and managing stress when returning home.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Make the Connection \u2014 The unique website allows vets to read and hear about the experiences of other vets dealing with PTSD and transitioning back into society. Through articles and videos, the site explains symptoms of PTSD and overcoming the challenges.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check

Former FBI director James Comey closed the case last summer, but Klein wrote that the DOJ is considering reopening it.\u000a\u000a"They are seriously thinking of reopening this investigation and therefore if she doesn't take the plea agreement, which I agree with you, she almost certainly won't, I think they will then proceed with this investigation and this is going to drag on for a long time and in a way balance the investigation that's going on with President Donald Trump and his campaign advisers regarding so-called collusion with the Russians," Klein told Khan.\u000a\u000aIn a separate interview on Newsmax TV's "The Schnitt Show," Klein told host Rita Cosby that Clinton is a "battler" and would push back against a plea bargain offer.\u000a\u000a"During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, it was Hillary who said no, we're not going to give an inch," Klein said. "She's not going to give an inch."

aVBitcoin and other "cryptocurrencies" are big money, virtually as big as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Scotland combined.\u000a\u000aThe price of a single bitcoin hit an all-time high of above $3,500 this week, dragging up the value of hundreds of newer, smaller digital rivals in its wake. Now some investors fear a giant crypto-bubble may be about to burst.\u000a\u000aIt has been a year of unprecedented growth for the largely unregulated market, with dozens of new currencies appearing every month in "Initial Coin Offerings" or ICOs. They have achieved value almost instantly, drawing in those who are eager to get in and make a quick buck.\u000a\u000aAt the start of 2017, the total value - or market cap - of all cryptocurrencies in existence was about $17.5 billion, with bitcoin making up almost 90 percent of that, according to industry data firm CoinMarketCap.\u000a\u000aIt is now around $120 billion - around the same value as Goldman and RBS together - and bitcoin makes up only 46 percent.\u000a\u000aBitcoin Cash, a clone of bitcoin that was split off from the original last week by a rival group of developers, was valued at more than $12 billion less than 24 hours after it had started trading.\u000a\u000a"It's just created new value out of nowhere," said Rob Moffat, a partner at Balderton Capital, a London-based venture capital firm who focuses on fintech. "There's no fundamentals behind any of this - it's all based on public perception, so you can start to see some really strange phenomena."\u000a\u000aFor an interactive Reuters graphic of the top cryptocurrencies, click here.\u000a\u000aCryptocurrencies - so-called because cryptography is used to keep transactions secure - allow anonymous peer-to-peer transactions between individual users, without the need for banks or central banks. They use blockchain technology, a shared record-keeping and processing system that means digital money cannot be copied and spent more than once.\u000a\u000aBillionaire U.S. investor Howard Marks likens the market to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century - whose demise he predicted. He said in a recent investor letter that digital currencies were an "unfounded fad ... based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it".\u000a\u000aBut advocates of cryptocurrencies say 2017 is just the beginning of bull run. They argue the finite nature of these currency units - there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin, for example - as well as the technological innovation that underpins them will ensure their enduring value.\u000a\u000a"The idea of this thing being a bubble is silly. We're in the bottom of the first innings," said Miguel Vias of Ripple, the third-biggest cryptocurrency, who was previously global head of precious metals and metal options at CME Group.\u000a\u000aDASH TO ETHER\u000a\u000aWhichever way cryptocurrencies move, they are likely to move together because their values are highly correlated, feeding off each other and magnifying the market effect.\u000a\u000aThat's partly down to investor sentiment, but also because the start-ups issuing new coins in ICOs generally collect money in a more liquid cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin or, more commonly, Ethereum's ether - the second-biggest cryptocurrency in total value.\u000a\u000aThat has driven demand for ether, which has climbed over 3,000 percent so far this year and now has a market cap of around $28 billion.\u000a\u000aBitcoin, which was launched in 2009, was the first successful cryptocurrency and is still easily the biggest, with a market cap of over $54 billion.\u000a\u000aIts price has shot up around 225 percent so this year, and performed better than any conventional, central-bank issued currency in every year since 2010 bar 2014.\u000a\u000aThe blockchain-based currencies that have been built since bitcoin - 842, at last count - vary hugely in terms of their credibility.\u000a\u000aSceptics say bitcoin and its rivals are not particularly useful as currencies, as they are still volatile and not accepted by most merchants. They are mostly just used for speculative trading purposes.\u000a\u000aThere are some signs of acceptance of the biggest players by the establishment, however; Ethereum has been piloted by the United Nations as a way to distribute funds to Syrian refugees. Ripple has been successfully used as a payment method between settlement systems in a Bank of England trial.\u000a\u000aSome other, smaller cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Monero and Z-cash are seen as having real value by some users because they offer an even higher level of anonymity than the likes of bitcoin. Whistle-blowing website Wikileaks this week said it would accept Z-cash for online donations.\u000a\u000a'DARWINISM IN REAL-TIME'\u000a\u000aIt is mainly the new "token" cryptocurrencies that are issued in ICOs with no regulatory oversight, which have exploded since the start of the year, that are causing the most anxiety.\u000a\u000aOne, the "Useless Ethereum Token", which appears to have been set up as a way of showing how worthless many of the ICOs really are, is nonetheless changing hands for 3 cents a unit. "No value, no security, and no product. Just me, spending your money," its website states.\u000a\u000a"It's just so easy to raise money on an ICO right now, it just feels like there's a gold rush going on there," said Moffat. "Some of the new currencies - beyond bitcoin and Ethereum - could crash to zero."\u000a\u000aBy mid-July, about $1.1 billion had been raised in ICOs this year, roughly 10 times more than that in the whole of 2016, according to cryptocurrency research firm Smith + Crown. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ueAWvr)\u000a\u000aThe rapid ascent of ICOs prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to warn last month that some ICOs should be regulated like other securities.\u000a\u000aThis is new digital territory and how the rapidly proliferating cryptocurrency market will play out is anyone's guess.\u000a\u000aWhile critics say the highly correlated nature of the currencies means the weakness of newer entrants could bring the whole house down; others argue market forces will ensure the best players prevail.\u000a\u000a"Will some of these (currencies) go away? Of course," said Vias of Ripple. "We\u2019re going to see Darwinism in real-time here. Only the strong will survive."

Research has found links between low Vitamin D levels and depression. "The big question is still causality. Does one get depressed because of a deficiency of Vitamin D, or does depression lower the vitamin level?" Psychology Today said This weed with small yellow flowers has been used for its healing properties for thousands of years.

They included members of Congress, former members of Congress, congressional staffers, reporters, lobbyists, lawyers, and others. Importantly, we checked with constituents across the nation, asking their views on individual members of Congress.Our survey was not scientific, but was based on solid criteria, including a House member\u2019s commitment to their job, their interest in constituent services and follow-up, their championing of issues and causes important to the national interest, their honesty, and their ability to get things done.Our survey did not include ideological litmus tests, and it comprises a bipartisan roll call of the House\u2019s greatest. We looked at each member\u2019s concern and passion for the public good.Here is our 2016 list of the 25 Hardest Working Members of Congress:\u2014 At 66 and after 16 years in the House, Cole maintains the same pace as the young campaigner who served as secretary of state of Oklahoma and chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. He now serves as deputy majority whip, as well as a member of the Appropriations, Budget, and Rules Committees. Capitol Hill reporters still marvel at how Cole replies unfailing to their requests, whether it is at midnight or on weekends.\u2014 Despite careers as a lawyer, state representative and senator, and U.S. Representative, Lynch\u2019s drive and seemingly unstoppable energy, friends agree, comes from his days as an ironworker. Working on high-altitude structures by day and attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology by nights and weekends, Lynch rose to become the youngest (30) president of the Iron Workers Local 7 union in Boston. In politics, he has been nothing short of a force of nature: unseating an incumbent in the Democratic primary to win his first term as state representative in 1994. At 61 and now a senior member of the Financial Services and Oversight and Government Reform Committees, Lynch shows no signs of slowing down as a passionate advocate for the little guy.\u2014 No argument here: Ryan\u2019s early-morning workout was highly dramatized when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012 (one BBC reporter actually did the \u201cRyan routine\u201d while broadcasting from Ryan\u2019s hometown) and his morning to midnight schedule on weekdays is well-known by colleagues of both parties. Genuinely drafted to be speaker after John Boehner\u2019s resignation last year, Ryan, has an unparalleled passion for public policy, but he still faithfully returns to his wife and three children in Wisconsin every weekend.\u2014 Former San Diego city councilman and California state legislator Vargas works overtime, Hill staffers say, to maintain close ties to the Obama White House (he and the president were Harvard Law classmates) and to work with Republican colleagues. Vargas recently co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) to benefit wounded warriors and is co-chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast with Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.).\u2014 On Capitol Hill, the joke is that "it's not what cause will Peter King take up next, but what cause hasn't he taken up yet?" At 72 and after 24 years in Congress, the Nassau County lawmaker embraces controversial causes that many lawmakers would rather ignore or don\u2019t see much bang for the political buck. King, past chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and has become the key Capitol Hill player in keeping America vigilant in its the war on terror. King serves as an active watchdog of the banking industry as a Member of the House Financial Services Committee.\u2014 The three-term lawmaker\u2019s capacity for hard work was hailed at the recent National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. A U.S. Air Force veteran of Iraq, he worked overtime in 2014 to secure congressional approval for an airstrike against Syrian strongman Assad \u2014 only to have the White House back off. His is a rising leadership star in the GOP.\u2014 The \u201cother half\u201d of the Democrats\u2019 celebrated \u201cCastro brothers,\u201d Joaquin is the identical twin brother of Housing Secretary and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. Moving with ease from state House to U.S. House, Joaquin is considered a prodigious worker on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committee.\u2014 Professional auditor and former Maricopa County Treasurer, Schweikert is considered one of GOP\u2019s best budget authorities. His mastery of detail and understanding of the budget process have made him \u201cthe indispensable man\u201d for small government conservatives in House.\u2014 One of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, Gabbard is admired on both sides of the aisle for her personal drive \u2014 elected to the Hawaii legislature at 21, deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army at 25, elected to the Honolulu City Council at 30, and Congress at 31. Sandwiching her congressional duties with those as a military police officer in the Army National Guard, Gabbard was a vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee until resigning this year to back Bernie Sanders for president.\u2014 At 36, former Miami public relations man Curbelo is fast becoming known as a hard-charging lawmaker in his first term. On the same day that the White House announced plans to lift Cuba\u2019s designation as a terrorist nation, Curbelo became a highly visible opponent to the plan. A favorite of the \u201cTea Party\u201d in his campaign, Curbelo nonetheless drew swatches of publicity for vowing never to vote against lifting the debt ceiling and declaring \u201cAmerica must never, ever default.\u201d\u2014 Even before he got to Congress, onetime Yale baseball team captain and U.S. Navy veteran DeSantis demonstrated what associates call near-superhuman capacity for work. As a first-time candidate in 2012, he raised more than $1.1 million \u2014 almost all by his telephoning and asking people \u2014 and beat five other Republicans in the primary. A Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he has been a House point man on issues ranging from taking a harder line with Putin\u2019s Russia to trying to thwart the Iran agreement.\u2014 Onetime saleswoman and Republican activist Blackburn caught conservative eyes as a state legislator in 2000. That\u2019s when she broke with fellow Republican and then-Gov. Don Sundquist over his effort to bring a state income tax to Tennessee. Having forged a hard-charging band of conservative followers, Blackburn made history in \u201902 by becoming the first woman elected to Congress from Tennessee who did not follow her husband. These days, one only has to name a conservative cause to find the lady from the Volunteer State at the forefront of it \u2014 opposing climate change, investigating Planned Parenthood, and leading the charge against net neutrality.\u2014 The tenacity of Patrick Murphy became evident to those who covered him in 2012, when the first-time candidate unseated Republican firebrand Rep. Allen West in a major upset. Murphy spent $3 million to West\u2019s $12 million and pulled off a win. Now 33, self-styled \u201cBill Clinton Democrat\u201d Murphy occasionally surprises the liberal-leaning House leadership of his party with stands such as those in favor of the Keystone Pipeline and against tighter regulations on for-profit-universities. As a candidate for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Murphy is now leading fellow Rep. Alan Grayson for the Democratic nomination and has the rare pre-primary endorsement of Barack Obama.\u2014 Puerto Rican born immigration lawyer and three-term Rep. Labrador is considered the House GOP's best point man on legislation on the issue of illegal immigration. He also helped organize the monthly "Conversations With Conservatives" meetings in which he and other right-of-center colleagues talk freely with reporters. With all this activity, Labrador still maintains the Monday to Thursday commute from Washington to his Boise district.\u2014 Indiana's former secretary of state and father of its voter identification law, Rokita wrapped up key support for Congress in 2010 within 48 hours of the nine-term incumbent's retirement announcement. These days, Rep. Rokita stays busy as vice chairman of the House Budget Committee and as the GOP's premier spokesman in Congress on voter identification measures.\u2014 He is one of his party\u2019s most high-profile voices on illegal immigration and, from Pat Buchanan in 1996 to Ted Cruz this year, he is almost always a player in someone\u2019s presidential campaign in his state\u2019s quadrennial GOP caucuses. But since he came to Congress in 2002, King has had relatively comfortable re-elections. This is due, congressional staffers say, to his vigorous tours of his district nearly every weekend and his service on the House Agriculture Committee.\u2014 The former teacher and state Capitol staffer got elected to both the New York City Council and later the U.S. House by taking out seemingly unbeatable incumbents. Now 70, and after 24 years in Washington, Maloney, according to the New York Daily News in 2014, \u201cproposed more legislation than any other House Member.\u201d Her list of legislation ranges from a measure to provide compensation to Ground Zero workers who have fallen ill and to creating a database for monitoring of all federal contracts (which passed following exposes of corruption among military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maloney also found time to be a leader outside Congress on diseases that threaten the elderly, serving on foundation boards that seek cures for both Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases.\u2014 Bald, blunt-spoken Brady suddenly became a subject of the national media last fall, when colleague Paul Ryan moved up to the speakership of the House. Almost overnight, 10-termer Brady became his successor as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Had Brady faced a challenge, few congressional correspondents doubted the Texan would emerge with the gavel. He had been key point man for President George W. Bush on passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and wrote a \u201csunset\u201d proposal to require every federal program not written in the Constitution to justify its existence in 12 years or face elimination. Most recently, Brady, 60, gave his blessings to a measure favored by anti-tax activists to sunset the U.S. Tax Code.\u2014 The best proof of Scalise\u2019s tireless knowledge and cultivation of his Republican colleagues as House GOP Whip came last year when several press outlets quoted remarks he allegedly made years before saying he was akin to Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u201cwithout the baggage.\u201d There were widespread press calls for his resignation from the No. 2 position in the House GOP hierarchy but, to remember, Republican colleagues (and fellow Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Democrat and black) rallied to Scalise\u2019s side. In part, it was a tribute to his reputation as someone who knows the needs of his colleagues and serves them.\u2014 In 2002, state legislator Van Hollen caught the eye of Democrats and the national press by winning the all-important Democratic primary in Maryland's 8th District (suburban Washington) over Tim Shriver, son of Sargent and nephew of John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy. Since then, his career has been nothing short of meteoric \u2014 rising to become chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee and then Budget Committee chairman in six years. Van Hollen is now considered the favorite to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski this year.\u2014 In contrast to her husband and predecessor John Dingell (who served a record 60 years in the seat until retiring in \u201914), freshman Rep. Debbie is back in the Dearborn-based district almost every Thursday to Monday. But she also wears the hats of Washington insider as a member of the Democratic National Committee and a top fundraiser for charities and fellow Democrats.\u2014 As far back as 1978, Chris Smith\u2019s capacity for taking on Herculean labor was sensed. Having just reached the constitutionally required age for the U.S. House (25), sporting goods salesman Smith took on powerful House Administration Committee Chairman Frank Thompson (D-N.J.) in a hopeless race. But a memo from the National Congressional Campaign Committee hailed him as one of the hardest-working candidates anywhere. Two years later, however, Smith unseated Thompson and today he is still in Congress \u2014 one of two of the GOP\u2019s 55 \u201cReagan babies\u201d elected to the House with the 40th president and still serving. As passionate as always about the pro-life cause, senior House Foreign Affairs Committee Member Smith also devotes his considerable energy to battling persecution of Christians in the Middle East and slave trafficking worldwide.\u2014 "I saw Fred Upton's high energy level first-hand in 1981," recalled TV commentator Larry Kudlow, referring to the days when he was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald Reagan and the young Upton was an aide to then-Director David Stockman. During the fight over Reagan's historic tax and budget cuts of 1981, said Kudlow, "when email wasn't invented, Fred would go night and day running confidential messages to key Members of Congress. And we won." Five years later, Upton became one of the handful of House Members who got to Congress by defeating a member of his own party. Now finishing the sixth and last year of his "termed out" stint as House Energy Committee chairman, Upton, at 63, shows no signs of slowing down and has signaled he will remain in Congress after relinquishing his chairman's gavel.\u2014 When then-state legislator Mulvaney upset 28-year Rep. John Spratt (D-S.C.) in 2010, the national press was astonished. Not so were reporters in South Carolina who had seen his drive and his flair for attention-getting issues at the State Capitol. Now 47, Mulvaney has freely voted against John Boehner for speaker, opposed lifting the debt ceiling to fund the government, and rallied fellow Tea Party lawmakers \u2014 all the while coming home to the Palmetto State\u2019s 5th District every weekend and winning re-election with ease.\u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re probably asking yourself how a black dude wins in a district that is 71 percent Hispanic, right?\u201d freshman Rep. Will Hurd told Newsmax last year. One of the big upset winners of 2012, former CIA agent Hurd explained that he went \u201cout to go to all 29 counties in the district and engaged with people." It worked, and he won. Maintaining the same discipline as a Homeland Security Committee member, Hurd is widely sought out on intelligence-related issues because, in his words, \u201cI chased al-Qaida for much of my life.\u201d

aVWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The leaders of Poland's Jewish community have written to the country's most powerful politician, urging him to denounce rising anti-Semitism which they say is leaving them on edge.\u000a\u000aAnna Chipczynska, the head of Warsaw's Jewish community, told The Associated Press on Thursday the letter to Jaroslaw Kaczynski was sent last week.

aVPresident Donald Trump's warnings against voter fraud stuck a chord with many Republicans, half of whom would support suspending the 2020 election until this problem is fixed.\u000a\u000aThe Washington Post surveyed over 1,000 American adults, focusing on the 650 voters who identify as or lean Republican, who were asked both about the previous presidential election and the next.\u000a\u000aForty-seven percent believe Trump won the popular vote.\u000a\u000aSixty-eight percent believe millions of illegal immigrants voted.\u000a\u000aSeventy-three percent believe voter fraud happens somewhat or very often.\u000a\u000aFifty-two percent would support postponing the election.\u000a\u000aFifty-six percent support postponing the election if Trump and congressional Republicans called for it.\u000a\u000a"Not surprisingly, beliefs about the 2016 election and voter fraud were correlated with support for postponement," wrote Ariel Malka of Yeshiva University and Yphtach Lelkes of the University of Pennsylvania for the Post.\u000a\u000a"People who believed that Trump won the popular vote, that there were millions of illegal votes in 2016, or that voter fraud is not rare were more likely to support postponing the election. This support was also more prevalent among Republicans who were younger, were less educated, had less factual knowledge of politics and strongly identified with the party."

aVPresident Trump is known for defying authority, the media, and convention in general. Now he is defying another age-old tradition: the one that says that when the economy is booming, presidents enjoy high approval numbers.\u000a\u000aLast week, according to Rasmussen\u2019s Daily Tracking Poll, the president\u2019s job approval rating hit an all time low at 38 percent. This does not make sense. Unemployment is at an astonishingly low 4.3 percent. The stock market has soared to record levels. The president has created over one million jobs, and more Americans are employed than at any time in history. All this, despite massive gridlock in the president\u2019s own party.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been proven time and again that when the economy is solid, people are happy, and they express their happiness by saying \u201cYes I approve\u201d when they\u2019re called by pollsters like Scott Rasmussen. Yet that has not been the case.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, his incredible phase of job growth and economic success is not merely a streak of good luck, or an economic wave. Nor did Barack Obama\u2019s policies help in any way. It is a direct result of President Trump\u2019s policies.\u000a\u000aHe and his administration have been laser-focused on boosting growth and stimulating hiring, by dismantling hundreds of Obama-era restrictions and regulations that have crushed companies, and issuing dozens of executive orders to boost the economy and ease the burden on businesses. If so, why are his approval numbers so low?\u000a\u000aOur natural instinct is to blame the mainstream media for its endless focus on the (non-existent) Russian collusion story. They\u2019ve used every scintillating headline and Nixon comparison they can to discredit the president. And there\u2019s no question, that has been a huge factor. If Trump got the \u201ckid glove\u201d treatment that\u2019s afforded to Obama and the Clintons, his numbers would undoubtedly spike.\u000a\u000aBut while things have gotten uglier, the media attacks are not new. They have been trying to sabotage him for over two years. Throughout the campaign, when he tweeted something \u201coffensive,\u201d voyeuristic cable networks and newspapers dedicated entire staffs to cover it with their so-called \u201canalysis.\u201d Yet the more they attacked, the more he seemed to thrive. What was his \u201cmagic\u201d then, and how can he tap into it now?\u000a\u000aAmazingly, as I discussed on a recent podcast episode, candidate Trump owes some of his remarkable success to the media focusing more on his policies than his optics.\u000a\u000aThe debates during the election were not about Russia, collusion, or Vladimir Putin. For the most part, they focused on trade imbalances, building a wall, repealing and replacing, and defeating ISIS. The media was happy to focus on these things, because they believed the president\u2019s views were so extreme, they could inflict severe damage just by being reported. While there were short-lived scandals about Trump\u2019s comments disparaging Muslims, Trump University, and his infamous Billy Bush interview, those fizzled relatively quickly, and did not define Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aWhen you read the paper these days, you need to sift through endless articles about collusion and tweets, before you find a substantive policy discussion buried deep within. When I watch Sunday morning talk shows and cable news channels, I feel like I\u2019m viewing a gossip channel.\u000a\u000aOther than days when something really big happens \u2014 like the Senate\u2019s failure to repeal \u2014 you rarely hear pundits discussing things that matter. When they do discuss them, they focus on the negative, and somehow ignore the president\u2019s many achievements.\u000a\u000aThe White House has more control than they think. It\u2019s time to stop \u201cplaying defense,\u201d which is a surefire recipe for failure, and shift the focus to the booming economy, the low unemployment rate, the reduction in border-crossing, the weakening of ISIS, the recent conservative rulings by the Supreme Court (thanks to Justice Gorsuch), and the president\u2019s many other achievements which have gone virtually unnoticed. Other than a few hard-core leftist lunatics, the country will be relieved. These are the issues they care about most, and they will thank the president for finally changing the subject.\u000a\u000aThe White House also needs to ignore any question about tweets, Russia, or anything else not directly related to policy. No politician has ever become popular by engaging in minutiae about why he did not obstruct justice or collude. The moment they open their mouths, they\u2019ve already lost.\u000a\u000aDespite the media\u2019s extreme bias, the president has the core elements to enjoy a high approval rating. Now he just needs to remind the country.\u000a\u000aJosh Margulies is the host of "Politics: Clear and Simple," a daily podcast offering analysis with an intellectual, conservative perspective.

aVPresident Donald Trump spoke to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the phone before criticizing him on Twitter Wednesday, The New York Times reports.\u000a\u000aThe Times cites a person who knows about the call as saying Trump talked to McConnell about his comments this week in which he said Trump is new to politics and does not understand the timeline of getting things accomplished in Washington.\u000a\u000a"Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before," McConnell said. "I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process."\u000a\u000aTrump fired back with a tweet Wednesday afternoon, but first he reportedly expressed his distaste for the remark to McConnell himself.\u000a\u000aSenator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so.

aVThe Democratic Party has, for the moment, become a regional party.\u000a\u000aOnly 449 counties across the nation are reliably Democratic. Five times that many \u2014 2,226 \u2014 are reliably Republican. The Democratic counties are generally found along the coasts and in large urban areas.\u000a\u000aNowhere is the party's abandonment of rural America more apparent than in West Virginia. For most of the 20th century, this was a solidly Democratic state. In the first presidential election of the 21st century, however, George W. Bush carried the state and it's voted Republican at the presidential level ever since. Last year, Donald Trump won the state with a crushing 42-percentage point victory over Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aStill, at the state level, West Virginia remained a Democratic stronghold until 2014. In that year, the Mountain State gave Republicans control of the state legislature and elected a Republican U.S. Senator for the first time in more than half a century. Last week, Democratic Governor Jim Justice switched parties to join the GOP.\u000a\u000aThese trends help explain why the midterm election outlook is fairly bleak for Democrats. U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is up for re-election as a Democrat. There's no doubt voters in the state like Manchin, but there's also no doubt they don't like the crowd he hangs out with in Washington. As a result, Manchin is currently considered only a very slight favorite for reelection. Still, it's far from certain.\u000a\u000aBeyond West Virginia, the regionalization of the Democratic Party means that eight Democratic Senators are vulnerable because they are running for reelection in unfriendly territory. Three probably have a 50/50 chance to be reelected: Joe Donnelly in Indiana; Claire McCaskill in Missouri; and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. Manchin and four others are just narrow favorites: Jon Tester in Montana, Bill Nelson in Florida, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin; and, Sherrod Brown in Ohio.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the coin, just two Republican Senators are considered potentially vulnerable: Dean Heller in Nevada and Jeff Flake in Arizona. Both have angered the Trump wing of the GOP and will face primary challenges before getting the chance to compete in a general election.\u000a\u000aPut it all together and the regionalization of the Democratic Party limits the party's upside potential in 2018.\u000a\u000aOn a good night for the Democrats, they would pick up the GOP seats in Arizona and Nevada while not losing any of their own seats. But, even in that scenario, the result would be a 50-50 split in the Senate. With Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote as Vice President, Republicans would still be charge.\u000a\u000aIn contrast, on a good night for Republicans, they might hold on to their two seats and pick up the three toss-ups in Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. That would give them a 55-45 majority in the Senate and a greater ability to advance their agenda. It's even possible to envision the GOP having a better night if they can pick up some of the seats where Democratic incumbents are only slight favorites.\u000a\u000aIt's impossible, of course, to know which way the political winds will be blowing on Election Day in 2018. However, it seems clear that the shrinking of the Democratic Party to a regional base will keep Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aScott Rasmussen is founder and president of the Rasmussen Media Group.

aVWomen undergoing cervical biopsies might have lower odds of repeat tests with a rotating fabric brush than a sharp instrument because the soft device may capture more cells for analysis, a recent study suggests.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, biopsies with the softer tool may be less painful, researchers say.\u000a\u000aCervical biopsies sometimes fail to collect enough cells from the cervix to accurately test for cancer, in which case another biopsy is needed.\u000a\u000aFor the new study, researchers compared data on 9,234 biopsy specimens collected with an older, sharp hooked device that scrapes cells from inside the cervix to data from 774 specimens obtained with a newer, fabric alternative. With the sharp instruments, 4.2 percent of the specimens didn\u2019t have enough cells to adequately test for cervical cancer, compared with 0.6 percent of specimens collected with the fabric brush.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fabric-based device takes a biopsy that is larger which allows pathologists to have a better chance of finding abnormal cells,\u201d lead study author Dr. Justin Diedrich of the University of California, Riverside, said by email.\u000a\u000aAs reported in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, Diedrich and colleagues examined data on lab results before and after 81 doctors and nurses switched from using sharp instruments to a fabric alternative.\u000a\u000aThis included biopsies done in 2010 and 2011 using an older, sharp device known as a Kevorkian curette as well as biopsies done in from 2011 to 2013 using an alternative fabric brush instrument made by Histologics LLC, a tissue-sampling company that provided funding for the study.\u000a\u000aThe fabric hook has material, similar to the rough side of Velcro, that scrapes for tissue samples. This option may be less painful for women than conventional sharp instruments, the study authors write.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether the fabric-based alternative is safer, more effective or more comfortable than sharp instruments. Researchers also didn\u2019t examine outcomes for women after they got the biopsy results to see how many of them actually required repeat biopsies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis paper cannot make a comparison of accuracy between the two different methods,\u201d said Dr. Christina Chu, a gynecologic oncology specialist at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000aBecause the fabric brush is a single-use device, while the sharp instrument can be used repeatedly, costs are different, Chu said by email. While the Kevorkian sharp curette costs $40 to $50, it can be sterilized and used hundreds of times, compared to a $3.75 cost for every single-use fabric brush.\u000a\u000aGetting vaccinated for human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, and getting Pap tests to screen for tumors can help prevent malignancies from developing and improve the odds of catching cancer early if it does develop.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two doses of the HPV vaccine at least six months apart when they are 11 to 12 years old. Teens and young adults who get their first shot at ages 15 through 26 years should get three doses of the HPV vaccine.\u000a\u000aThe United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a Pap test every three years for women aged 21 to 29, and every five years from ages 30 to 65.

You will likely be asked if you want to buy cruise insurance, and before you decline, read these reasons why you might need it.\u000a\u000a1. Trip cancellations \u2013 Cancelling your cruise at the last minute will cost you money, says Cruise Critic. If your elderly mother has been in declining health, cruise insurance will protect you in case you need to cancel your trip unexpectedly to care for her.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Medical emergencies \u2013 What happens if you fall seriously ill during the cruise? If you need medical treatment on the ship, your regular health insurance will not cover you and the costs can be astronomical, says Allianze Travel Insurance. For instance, being airlifted from the ship to a nearby hospital can cost upwards of $100,000. Cruise insurance can provide coverage, just in case.\u000a\u000a3. Missing the boat \u2013 There is always a risk of flight delays and cancellations that can cause you to miss the ship\u2019s departure. Ships do not wait for late passengers. Cruise insurance will reimburse you for hotel stays and even transportation to your ship\u2019s first port of call so you can board at that time, says Allianze.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4.

The right insurance policy will reimburse you for some of the replacement costs for your belongings.\u000a\u000a5. Trip interruption \u2013 Sometimes, mechanical failures onboard or dangerous weather can cause a cruise to be cut short with almost no notice. Cruise lines can assist passengers, says Cruise Critic, but an insurance policy will provide reimbursement should you need to find lodging and make changes to flight plans.\u000a\u000a6.

aVHigh-risk drinking among U.S. adults increased about 30 percent between 2001-2002 and 2012-2013, according to a new study that called the proportion Americans developing alcohol dependence a "public health crisis."\u000a\u000aThe study defined high-risk drinking as regular consumption of four drinks a day for women or five for men. U.S. adults with an alcohol use disorder, defined as a dependence on alcohol, also increased nearly 50 percent during the period studied, researchers found.\u000a\u000aIncreases in drinking were greatest among women, older adults, racial and ethnic minorities and people with low education and income levels, the study found.\u000a\u000a"Light drinking has been shown to be helpful for people\u2019s health overall, but heavy drinking can lead to some harms and impairment," said study's lead author Deborah Hasin, of Columbia University in New York.\u000a\u000aHeavy drinking and alcohol use disorders are risk factors for health issues such as high blood pressure, heart problems, stroke, cancer and infections, Hasin and colleagues wrote in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry.\u000a\u000aPast studies found alcohol use in the United States declined between the 1970s and early 1990s. More recent research, however, has suggested increases in alcohol use between the 1990s and early 2000s.\u000a\u000aThe new findings are based on face-to-face interviews with nationally representative samples of adults in 2001-2002 and 2012-2013.\u000a\u000aThe proportion of adults using alcohol during the previous year increased from about 65 percent to about 73 percent over the study period. Drinking more than four or five alcoholic beverages in one sitting also increased from about 10 percent to about 13 percent, researchers found.\u000a\u000aThe proportion of adults who met the criteria for an alcohol use disorder increased from about 9 percent to about 13 percent.\u000a\u000a"People need to really take some of the information about the potential harms of heavy drinking into account when determining when and how much to drink," Hasin said.\u000a\u000a"Policymakers and health professionals need to be aware of this, too," she added.\u000a\u000aThe study does not explain why alcohol drinking and abuse increased, but researchers suggest some explanations could be changing social norms and its use as a coping device.\u000a\u000a"Researchers will be trying to examine why these changes are happening," Hasin said.

aVThe number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tightening labor market.\u000a\u000aInitial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Aug. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aData for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.\u000a\u000aEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 240,000 in the latest week. With the labor market near full employment, there is probably limited room for claims to continue declining. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 127 straight weeks. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller. The unemployment rate is 4.3 percent.\u000a\u000aLabor market tightness could encourage the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start unwinding its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its policy meeting next month. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors influencing the claims data and that no states had been estimated.\u000a\u000aThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest level since May.\u000a\u000aThe government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs in July. The economy has added 1.29 million jobs this year. That has resulted in the unemployment rate dropping five-tenths of a percentage point.\u000a\u000aThursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell by16,000 to 1.95 million in the week ended July 29. The so-called continuing claims have now been below the 2 million mark for 17straight weeks, pointing to diminishing labor market slack.\u000a\u000aThe four-week moving average of continuing claims edged up 500 to 1.97 million, still remaining below the 2 million mark for the 15th consecutive week.

aVChloe Ayling's kidnapping wasn't a hoax, the British model\u2019s lawyer said after doubts surfaced about her claim to Italian police about captors who wanted to auction her online as a sex slave.\u000a\u000aAyling, 20, told police that two men kidnapped her while she was attending a photoshoot in Italy in July, drugged her and put her in a bag, The Guardian reported.\u000a\u000aAuthorities arrested Lukasz Pawel Herba, 30, after Ayling showed up at the British consulate in Milan six days later.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian said questions arose when news emerged that Ayling reportedly had gone shopping for shoes and groceries with him.\u000a\u000a"There were legitimate doubts [about her story] at the start, which were surpassed," her lawyer, Francesco Pesce told The Guardian. "What Chloe told police during 10 hours, it wasn't easy on her. If the police were convinced [of the story] after that, then I am convinced. What also would be his [the abductor\u2019s] motive [to collaborate]? Twenty years in jail?"\u000a\u000aPesce told the BBC News that Ayling went shopping with her captor because they had threatened to kill her.\u000a\u000a"She was told that people were there watching her and were ready to kill her if she tried anything," Pesce said, per BBC News. "So she thought that the best idea was to go along with it and be nice to her captor, because he told her he wanted to release her somehow and some time."\u000a\u000aThe United Kingdom's National Crime Agency said it was working with the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) and the Italian authorities on Ayling's case.\u000a\u000a"A house in the Oldbury area linked to Lukasz Pawel Herba was searched on 18 July by EMSOU officers with assistance from West Midlands Police," a statement from the agency said. "Computer equipment seized is being forensically examined."

aVAs the world ponders the meaning of President Donald Trump's threat of "fire and fury" on North Korea, it's worth asking why his predecessors never took those steps to stop its nuclear program.\u000a\u000aWhen Bill Clinton was confronted with the threat of North Korea's exit from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he considered military force. But he ended up going for negotiations in what became known as the Joint Framework Agreement. The North Koreans froze their plutonium program in exchange for fuel shipments and a light water reactor from the U.S. Neither side ever fully delivered.\u000a\u000aThen there was George W. Bush. He didn't like North Korea. He put the nation in the original "axis of evil." On his watch, the U.S. discovered Pyongyang had a secret uranium enrichment program, in violation of the spirit of Clinton's deal. Then in 2006, North Korea tested its first nuclear device. By 2007, Bush had lifted crippling sanctions on the regime's elites and entered into new negotiations. And surprise: The North Koreans backed out of those talks at the end, too.\u000a\u000aBy the time Barack Obama came into power, the North Koreans were back to building up their program. They perfected missiles, sunk a South Korean ship and shelled a South Korean island. The current tyrant, Kim Jong Un, ascended to power and proceeded to consolidate his position, killing his uncle and later his half brother. All the while, Obama pursued a policy of "strategic patience," aimed at not rewarding Kim's regime for its provocations and rogue behavior.\u000a\u000aNow Trump has inherited a mess. Not only is Kim testing ballistic missiles at an alarming rate, as the Washington Post reported this week, but also the Defense Intelligence Agency now assesses North Korea can miniaturize a nuclear warhead so that it can fit inside a missile. Game, set, match.\u000a\u000aSo why didn't the last three presidents take out North Korea's nuclear facilities when they had the chance? The answer is Seoul, the thriving capital of South Korea. The North has enough artillery pieces within range of this metropolis to kill hundreds of thousands of people, which could very well begin a world war and throw the global economy into a tailspin.\u000a\u000aPast presidents have understandably feared the North would retaliate in this way. But for some today, that fear is fading. John Plumb, a former director of defense policy and strategy for Obama's National Security Council, told the Atlantic last month: "If I were the Trump administration, I would be looking at the threat to incinerate Seoul and trying to figure out how real it is. Because to me, it\u2019s become such a catchphrase, and it almost \u2014 it starts to lose credibility. Attacking Seoul, a civilian population center, is different from attacking a remote military outpost. It\u2019s dicey, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aIntelligence officials have told me in recent months that this threat remains very real. While there are steps the U.S. can take to mitigate the problem, such as dropping cluster munitions on the big guns, it's an imperfect and high-risk strategy. An attack on North Korea would be unpredictable and could unleash far worse on U.S. forces (which have been stationed in South Korea for more than 60 years), not to mention allies like Japan.\u000a\u000aAll of this gets back to Trump's bluster. At this point we as Americans ought to expect more careful words from the president. At the same time, nothing Trump said was that different from the implicit threat against North Korea, or any power that threatens American cities with nuclear destruction.\u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong: There are few people on the planet more deserving of "fire and fury" than Kim Jong Un. But would such a strike even eliminate its nuclear program? How far is Trump willing to go? Will he order an invasion of North Korea to topple the regime? And if he does, would he commit the manpower, capital and time to stabilize the country once the Kim dynasty falls?\u000a\u000aAccording to retired Admiral William Perry, Clinton's second secretary of defense, the U.S. couldn't even take out North Korea's nuclear infrastructure with military strikes, given how much it has expanded in the last 20 years. What's more, the price paid by South Koreans would be unacceptable. This is what he told a group of journalists this spring at an event sponsored by the Hoover Institution.\u000a\u000aIt's possible that Trump is counting on his reputation as an impetuous novice \u2014 one who Kim just might fear would roll the dice by attacking North Korea. But Trump's ultimatum allows the boy-tyrant in Pyongyang to test the president's mettle. (Already the North Korean state media has threatened Guam.) We can expect more taunts and threats in the coming days, proving Trump's threat was hollow. As hollow as past presidents' pledges to do the same.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEli Lake is a Bloomberg View columnist.

aVA power outage for a few hours may be a minor inconvenience, but the situation gets a little scary when the lights go out for days or even weeks on end. But natural disasters have kept people without power for such long periods, and they\u2019ve managed to prevail.\u000a\u000aSome people worry about foreign or terrorist acts that could keep entire areas of the country off the power grid. State and local governments have emergency preparedness plans to help communities, but sometimes people are left on their own.\u000a\u000aThe Emergency Radio Every Family Must Have \u2014 Special FREE Offer\u000a\u000aThese seven ways to live if the lights go out can help you deal with an uncomfortable situation that lasts longer than usual:\u000a\u000a1. Don\u2019t panic \u2014 If the lights go out for a long period of time, remember that people not too long ago lived just fine without electrical power. Many people continue to do so for fun when camping or hiking. Friends and family in the same situation can help each other get through it.\u000a\u000a2. Protect food sources \u2014 Staying fed is essential, especially if the darkness lingers on. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible the day the power goes off, advises the American Red Cross. Use food from the refrigerator first, then from the freezer, which can keep foods for up to 48 hours. Afterwards, use non-perishable foods. Store food in a cooler with ice when it appears the power outage will last more than a day.\u000a\u000a3. Use candles carefully \u2014 Candles cause hundreds of fires a year when left unattended, according to Uxari. Keep lit candles away from flammable materials such as upholstered furniture and curtains.\u000a\u000a4. Stay safe inside \u2014 Avoid travel and wasting gas as much as possible, especially with the danger of no traffic lights and anxious drivers. Do not use outdoor grills, generators, or other devices that use gas, propane, and charcoal burning inside. They can release life-threatening carbon monoxide. Keep the devices outside, away from doors, windows, and vents that might bring carbon monoxide inside.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Terror Chatter High, Get Your FREE Emergency Radio Now\u000a\u000a5. Have alternative power sources \u2014 Battery-operated gadgets keep you in contact with the rest of the world. Prepare to use battery packs and plenty of AA and AAA batteries for radios, flashlights, and other necessities. A car battery can be a good source of power. A cigarette-lighter adapter can also charge up various gadgets, writes Eric Limer at Gizmodo.\u000a\u000a6. Keep hydrated \u2014 A gallon of drinking water is needed for each person each day. Fill up the tub or buckets when it appears the power may be off for a long time, affecting the water supply. Collect rain water if possible. Water is also needed for cleaning dishes and washing.\u000a\u000a7. Remain active \u2014 Exercise is important for body and mind. Turn to board games and cards to occupy the time with family and friends. Communicate with your neighbors. Cooking with outside grills connects neighbors with each other.

aVPeople in some U.S. cities will see the cost of Obamacare health plans climb as much as 50 percent next year, though subsidies will offset much of the increases, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u000a\u000aKaiser tracks premium increases in 21 U.S. cities, providing a snapshot of how the health law is faring around the country.\u000a\u000aThe cost of mid-level health plans will climb by double-digit percentage rates in 15 of those cities and decline in two, according to an analysis of preliminary rates published Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe estimates don\u2019t include Obamacare\u2019s subsidies, which offset the rate increases for many people with low and moderate incomes.\u000a\u000aInsurers are seeking greater premium increases than in years past because of uncertainty about how the Trump administration will run the Affordable Care Act\u2019s markets, Kaiser found.\u000a\u000aIn Delaware, for instance, the state\u2019s lone ACA insurer proposed raising premiums by 12.8 percent on average to account for those risks.\u000a\u000aSee how Obamacare\u2019s Marketplaces Are Shaping Up for 2018, click here\u000a\u000aRepublicans control the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time since Obamacare passed but have so far failed in their attempts to repeal and replace the health law.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of the Senate\u2019s failure to pass a repeal measure last month, Trump threatened to undermine the law. \u201cAs I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode, then deal. Watch!,\u201d he tweeted on July 28.\u000a\u000aThere are two main ways Trump could do that: asking his agencies not to enforce the individual mandate created under Obamacare; and stopping funds for the subsidies that help insurers offset health-care costs for low-income Americans.\u000a\u000aBoth moves could further disrupt the ACA\u2019s individual markets and lead to higher premiums.

aVWhen 55-year-old Sheila Bartels left her doctor's office in Oklahoma, she had a prescription for 510 painkillers.\u000a\u000aShe died the same day of an overdose.\u000a\u000aHer doctor, Regan Nichols, is now facing five second-degree murder charges -- one for each patient who overdosed after she prescribed them opioid drugs, such as Oxycontin -- prescriptions that can lead to addiction.\u000a\u000a"Doctors bear enormous responsibility for the opioid crisis," said David Clark, a professor of anesthesiology at Stanford University who worked on a government-sponsored panel that studied the crisis, and recommended new training and guidelines for health care providers and regulators.\u000a\u000a"We didn't have (a crisis) until doctors became enamored with what they imagined to be the potential for opioids in controlling chronic pain," Clark told AFP.\u000a\u000aAn estimated two million Americans are addicted to opioid drugs -- many forced to buy pills illegally when prescriptions run out. Some, in desperation, resort to heroin and synthetic opioids smuggled into the US by Mexican drug cartels.\u000a\u000aNinety people die every day in the United States from opioid overdoses.\u000a\u000aMore than 180,000 have died since 1999, including pop icon Prince, who passed away in April 2016 at age 57 after an accidental overdose of fentanyl, a powerful opioid painkiller.\u000a\u000aDoctors in the United States prescribe more opioids than in any other country -- enough to medicate every American adult.\u000a\u000aWhile those physicians who are prosecuted for overprescribing make headlines, experts say they are not solely to blame, and that the US health care system as a whole must be held accountable for the country's spiralling opioid epidemic.\u000a\u000a"Pharmaceutical companies targeted general practitioner doctors, the ones who see most of the people who have pain," Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, whose state has been hard hit by the crisis, told AFP.\u000a\u000a"I think they certainly were misled, and they were told things that were not true."\u000a\u000aThe problem is not a new one -- it began two decades ago, as doctors were being taught to better manage their patients' pain and drug companies were touting the efficacy of opioid painkillers.\u000a\u000aThe painkillers -- meant only for patients in the most dire need -- started getting into the hands of those with chronic conditions that had been treated with simple over-the-counter drugs like aspirin.\u000a\u000aAnd they didn't know they were addictive.\u000a\u000a"You had people with a simple toothache, or knee surgery, or back surgery, that were on these opioids for too long a period of time or prescribed a higher dosage than they needed," said Robert Ware, chief of police in the town of Portsmouth, Ohio, which became a sort of ground zero for the crisis.\u000a\u000aAs more and more people were getting addicted, "pill mills" began to pop up in Portsmouth and across the nation to meet demand. These clinics were run by doctors who would prescribe opioid drugs to anyone who could pay.\u000a\u000aIn Portsmouth, a struggling Ohio town bordering two other states where the steel industry was once king, Ware was seeing pill mills become part of the economy, as addicts from nearby states traveled there to get their fix.\u000a\u000aEventually, state regulators and local law enforcement shut down the pill mills by arresting doctors and requiring that clinics be associated with established, reputable medical programs.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department has promised a further crackdown on unscrupulous doctors and pharmacists.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump -- hosting a meeting on the crisis during his summer vacation -- suggested more prosecutions as a whole may be necessary.\u000a\u000aBut in Portsmouth, Ware said the community has learned a tough lesson.\u000a\u000a"You cannot arrest your way out of this problem," the chief said.\u000a\u000aThe town's opioid addicts came from a cross-section of society, because most got hooked through legitimate prescriptions.\u000a\u000aAnd addicts needed help to recover over the long run.\u000a\u000aSo Portsmouth beefed up its health care offerings and addiction treatment -- and went from being a haven for pill mills to a refuge for recovery.\u000a\u000aOverdoses there are now trending downward, in contrast to the rest of the country, Ware said.\u000a\u000a"We are kind of ahead of the curve in getting out of the problem," he said.\u000a\u000aAcross the country, overall drug overdose deaths are rising to new highs -- 60,000 estimated fatalities in 2016. Certain states, like Ohio and West Virginia, have been harder hit than others.\u000a\u000aDeWine is fighting the epidemic from another front -- suing the drug companies. According to The Washington Post, at least 25 states, cities and countries are doing the same.\u000a\u000a"These drug companies are primarily responsible for this drug opiate epidemic. They created the problem. It's about time that they did something to help clean the problem up," DeWine said.\u000a\u000aThe federal government has proposed a 20 percent reduction next year in the amount of opioids drug companies are allowed to produce.\u000a\u000aBut physicians still appear to be writing prescriptions with gusto.\u000a\u000aWhile the numbers have declined, doctors still handed out nearly 250 million prescriptions for opioids in 2013 alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\u000a\u000a"Physicians have not fully accepted their roles as individual prescribers in feeding this particular epidemic," said Clark.\u000a\u000a"There was never good evidence that these drugs could reduce pain well," he added, "especially for prolonged periods of time."\u000a\u000anov/sst

aVNewt Gingrich on Thursday called it "absurd" and "goofy" that President Donald Trump is blaming Senate Republicans for the failure of healthcare reform, saying the president has to shoulder some of the blame himself.\u000a\u000aThe former House speaker turned Fox News contributor told the "Fox & Friends" morning program that there is only one group to blame for the failure of passing healthcare reform \u2014 the Democrats.\u000a\u000a"This whole thing is absurd," Gingrich said when asked about Trump's tweets and the tension with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000a"For every Republican who voted no, there were 16 Democratic senators who voted no," Gingrich said.\u000a\u000aConservatives should aim their fire on the "10 Democratic senators" from states that Trump carried who voted no, not McConnell.\u000a\u000a"The fact is, with a very narrow margin, Mitch McConnell got 49 out of 52," Gingrich said. "I think the president can't disassociate himself from this. He's part of the leadership team; he's not an observer sitting up in the stands; he's on the field. It was a collective failure; both the Trump administration and Republicans in the Senate failed.\u000a\u000a"But to get involved shooting at each other when there were 16 Democrats voting no for every single Republican who voted no, is goofy."\u000a\u000aGingrich said a bigger loss is ahead for Republicans if they don't learn a lesson from failing on healthcare.\u000a\u000a"What bothers me is, we have a lot of things we need to learn how to do if we're going to be an effective governing majority party, and I'm frankly equally afraid they're going to mishandle the tax cuts exactly the way they mishandled healthcare, and if that happens, we'll be at the end of the year with a disaster," Gingrich said.\u000a\u000aPart of that lesson is a theme Gingrich has been saying all along in a warning to Republicans who are poised to start work on tax reform \u2014 quit setting deadlines.\u000a\u000a"Setting these deadlines, when you don't have a clear plan, when you don't have an absolute majority \u2026 these kind of deadlines create these expectations and then it becomes a crisis and then somebody has to have failed. \u2026\u000a\u000a"Replacing Obamacare \u2026 may take three or four or five years and it may take 10 or 12 different bills," Gingrich said. "I'm not sure anybody's smart enough to write a single bill to replace Obamacare in one giant step, and I'm not sure you'd get a majority in the House and Senate if you could."

aVZAGREB, Croatia (AP) \u2014 Croatia has revoked a decision to drastically raise import fees for fruit and vegetables, avoiding a looming trade war with its Balkan neighbors.\u000a\u000aSerbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro had issued an ultimatum to Croatia to reconsider the decision to raise fees for border sanitary inspections from 12 euros per truck to 270 euros.\u000a\u000aCroatia's Agriculture Ministry said Thursday it agreed with neighboring countries to "fully normalize controls on the borders." It says the inspection fee will be dropped back down to 12 euros.\u000a\u000aCroatian officials have said the measure was imposed on 168 non-EU countries to improve the quality of imports, and wasn't meant to hurt the regional neighbors' economies \u2014 although the four are the main exporters of fruit and vegetables to Croatia.\u000a\u000aThe neighbors had threatened to retaliate.

aVOn Monday, July 24, President Trump addressed the 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree in Glen Jean, W. Va., speaking to a crowd of 40,000 scouts. They enthusiastically received the president, frequently applauding and breaking into cheers of "USA, U.S.A., USA!"\u000a\u000aIt was a heart-warming event, during which the planet's most powerful politician praised scouting, pointing out that 10 members of his Cabinet had been scouts. Two of them, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, had indeed been Eagle Scouts (scouting\u2019s highest rank, attained by only 4 percent of scouts). Zinke showed up in his scout uniform, short pants and all, which must have delighted the crowd.\u000a\u000aThe President, as he does, reveled in the warmth of his audience, as he reminded them of the importance of "hard work and perseverance," of loyalty, of the joy of doing something "that you love" for a living, and the importance of duty, honor, and taking care "of the people God put into your life."\u000a\u000aIt was, in short, just the sort of thing that one might expect the president to do appearing before the Boy Scouts. And yet, instead of praising the speech, the Chief Scout Executive, Michael Surbaugh, issued a subsequent statement that "I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric [that the President] inserted into the jamboree. That was never our intent."\u000a\u000aAccording to an account published in the UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, which called Mr. Trump\u2019s speech "highly politicized," Mr. Surbaugh was responding, belatedly, to "an outcry from angry parents, who responded by condemning Scouts for its initial 'silence' after the speech."\u000a\u000aThis is the same Michael Surbaugh who announced earlier this year that the Boy Scouts would be accepting transgender scouts. "After weeks of significant conversations," he explained, "we realized that referring to birth certificates as the reference point is no longer sufficient."\u000a\u000aSo was the speech really "highly politicized"? Or is it simply that anything President Trump does will be discolored by most of the media? The Independent reported that, "the president criticized former U.S. President Barack Obama, threatened to fire federal employees and denounced the media."\u000a\u000aThe truth is a bit different. The president did remind the scouts that President Obama had never attended a jamboree (which is true, though Mr. Obama did, once, send the scouts a recorded video commemorating their 100 year anniversary).\u000a\u000aPresident Trump, obviously joking, did threaten to fire one federal employee, former scout, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, if he failed to get the votes to repeal Obamacare (so far Secretary Price has failed to get those votes, and he remains in office).\u000a\u000aThe president also reminded the scouts that it was highly doubtful that a media prejudiced against him would show the record-setting crowd he addressed on television, and he did denounce "Fake media. Fake news."\u000a\u000aWas it really inappropriate for the president to point out to the cheering throng of 40,000 scouts that he wanted Obamacare replaced, that he unexpectedly triumphed over his political opponent in the election, and that though his predecessor never attended a scout jamboree it was his (Mr. Trump\u2019s) intention to return? The Independent clearly thought so, declaring that "Donald Trump was the first U.S. president in 80 years to stray from the topics of diplomacy and citizenship, instead choosing to focus on partisan politics."\u000a\u000aThis was a mischaracterization of what President Trump had to say. Most of his address to the scouts was, in fact, the traditional homily emphasizing the famous scouting virtues of patriotism, reverence, responsibility, hard work, and community service.\u000a\u000aOf course, Donald Trump being Donald Trump, did remind the scouts that it was his perseverance in visiting swing states and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failure to do so that got him the presidency. Are we to think that the cheering scouts were so fragile, so removed from the world, so lacking in the scout-like virtues of fortitude, that they needed to be protected from this?\u000a\u000aWhat's significant here, of course, is the purported "outcry" resulting, presumably, from those sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama, because Mr. Trump injected "politics" into his speech. But what if the extreme political division in the country and what if the profound division over values is linked, and is, in fact, the most important issue which ought to be discussed by the president, and shared with the scouts?\u000a\u000aIt was clear to anyone at the event that something extraordinary was happening, just as it is whenever the president leaves Washington, D.C. and gives his campaign-style speech to ordinary Americans.\u000a\u000aIn his speeches, the president reaffirms traditional American values, the values that the scouts have always lived by. Could it be the media and his political opponents are really most upset because they don\u2019t share those values?\u000a\u000aStephen B.

aVSouth Korea and Japan warned North Korea that it would face a strong response if it carried through with a threat to launch a missile toward the U.S. territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aDefense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it would be legal for Japan to intercept a missile aimed at Guam. North Korea\u2019s threats to strike around Guam pose a serious challenge, a spokesman at South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters on Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe give a strict warning,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIf North Korea commits provocations despite our stern warning, it will face a strong response from South Korea\u2019s military and the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Security Council took a softer tone, saying the door for dialogue remained open and it would take all possible steps to ease tensions.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, responding to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s "fire and fury" warning, outlined a detailed plan to fire four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Guam by mid-August. They would fly over southwestern Japan and land as close as 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Guam, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi index fell as much as 1.2 percent as foreigners sold shares, before paring the drop to 0.4 percent at the close. The won weakened 0.6 percent against the dollar, touching the lowest level in almost a month. In the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent at 12:24 p.m. EST.\u000a\u000aMore than 3,000 kilometers southeast of North Korea, Guam is an important strategic hub for the U.S. military. It has air and naval bases, as well as missile-defense launchers on the island.\u000a\u000a\u201cSound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,\u201d KCNA reported, citing a statement in response to Trump by a general of the Korean People\u2019s Army. \u201cThe military action the KPA is about to take will be an effective remedy for restraining the frantic moves of the U.S. in the southern part of the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm tensions after Trump\u2019s remarks, saying \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night.\u201d Later, Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea in a statement it would lose any conflict it initiates.\u000a\u000aFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been an informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview on Fox News that he \u201chopes diplomacy works\u201d but added \u201cwe may need a non-diplomatic solution.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea first fired a missile over Japan in 1998, prompting the Japanese government to initiate its current ballistic missile-defense system with the U.S. While a second attempt failed in 2005, North Korea again succeeded in launching one in 2009 that flew over northern Japan and continued for another 3,000 kilometers before landing in the Pacific.\u000a\u000aMore recently, North Korean missiles have landed in the Sea of Japan, with some falling in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone that stretches as much as 200 nautical miles from its shores.\u000a\u000aJapan passed legislation two years ago allowing it to come to the aid of another country in certain circumstances, under a reinterpretation of its pacifist constitution. Onodera, the defense minister, told parliament on Thursday that an attack on Guam would fall under that legislation because of its importance to Japan\u2019s own defense.\u000a\u000aMissile Defense\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear if Japan could shoot down a missile heading to Guam, according to Lance Gatling, president of Nexial Research, an aerospace consultancy in Tokyo.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy initial impression would be not really,\u201d Gatling said. \u201cA ballistic missile going to Guam is flying very high, going very fast and accelerating by the time it\u2019s over Japan. Without prior knowledge that it\u2019s coming, you are reduced to chasing it, which is a great disadvantage."\u000a\u000aA willingness to shoot down the missile was a politically important move in the relationship between the two allies, Gatling said, adding that Japan might be better placed to provide data to help the U.S. track the missile.\u000a\u000aJapan has a two-layered ballistic missile defense system, consisting of ship-based SM-3 interceptors, which are intended to shoot down missiles outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and land-based Patriot interceptors, which are designed to intercept them in the final stage of their trajectory. It is also looking into the possibility of adding a third missile defense element.\u000a\u000aJapan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also underscored the importance of the alliance, which he said would be further strengthened through a meeting between Tillerson, Mattis and their Japanese counterparts in Washington next week.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s provocative actions, including on this occasion, are a clear threat to the region and the international community and can absolutely not be tolerated,\u201dhe told reporters.

aVA Kentucky couple has sued Amazon, with the man and his transgender wife alleging that they endured sustained discrimination and harassment during a year as co-workers at one of the mammoth online retailer's warehouses.\u000a\u000aA lawyer working with the couple said the case is notable in part because Amazon, one of the nation's largest corporations, has a record of strongly supporting gay and transgender rights.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Covington, Kentucky, alleges that Dane Lane and Allegra Schawe-Lane were targeted with threats, slurs and sexual harassment by numerous colleagues at their shipping facility. Their complaints to superiors led to retaliation in some cases, rather than any effective steps to halt the abuse, the couple contends.\u000a\u000aAt one point, according to the suit, the brake line of their car was severed while parked in a secure lot at the workplace in Hebron, Kentucky.\u000a\u000aAmazon declined to respond to the allegations, saying in an email, "We have a practice of not commenting on active litigation."\u000a\u000aThe plaintiffs' case will be handled by Kentucky lawyers on behalf of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund , a national transgender-rights organization.\u000a\u000aThe fund's executive director, Jillian Weiss, noted that Amazon has intervened in other court cases in support of transgender rights, and that the company's Amazon Studios produced the acclaimed television series "Transparent" with a protagonist who transitions from male to female.\u000a\u000a"We have a company that touts its transgender friendliness," Weiss said. "Yet in Kentucky, when a transgender person comes and says, 'Look, I'm being harassed,' they get no help."\u000a\u000aSchawe-Lane said she sought a job with Amazon in part because of the company's reputation as LGBT-friendly. Its own corporate policy prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\u000a\u000a"I thought we would be safe and accepted," Schawe-Lane said in a telephone interview. "Instead it was like a bad dream. Every day, I'd wish it was 'Candid Camera' and someone would pop out and say it was all a joke."\u000a\u000aThe couple was hired by Amazon in October 2014 and resigned a year later, saying conditions at their workplace were intolerable.\u000a\u000aTwo months before resigning, they filed discrimination charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC declared earlier this year that evidence substantiated some of the couple's allegations and said they had grounds for a lawsuit.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit seeks both compensatory payment and punitive damages, with the amount to be determined by a jury. It also seeks a court order requiring Amazon to implement workplace programs that would ensure respectful treatment of transgender employees.\u000a\u000aSeveral other transgender-rights lawsuits have been litigated recently, with mixed results. The Kentucky case alleges that various abuses suffered by the plaintiffs violated provisions of the U.S. and Kentucky civil rights acts, state and federal labor law, and also the Americans With Disabilities Act. According to Weiss, the ADA comes into play in this case because Schawe-Lane's status as a transgender woman was perceived her employers as a disability.\u000a\u000aAside from their experience at Amazon, the couple said they generally feel accepted in their community and have no desire to leave Kentucky. However, they said they are both undergoing treatment related to the workplace traumas they experienced, and have been advised by their doctors that they are not ready to take new jobs.

aVIt might get lost in today's media climate, but the United States Senate is teeming with hardworking men and women on both sides of the aisle who put in brutally long hours to try and get the job done.\u000a\u000aSome may be plotting their own White House bids in 2020 or beyond. Some may be trying to move up the Senate leadership ladder. And some, believe it or not, may just be trying to deliver on campaign promises for their constituents and the country.\u000a\u000aHere, Newsmax has compiled a list of 15 U.S. senators who are widely considered to be the hardest-working among their colleagues as evidenced by the high regard and esteem shown to them by their peers and voters.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) \u2014 Grassley won a seventh Senate term in 2016 in a landslide over a Democrat who didn\u2019t even try to attack his advanced age. That\u2019s largely because, at 83, he still visits every county in Iowa annually (he calls it \u201cthe full Grassley\u201d) and runs circles around aides barely half his age. He\u2019ll need to pace himself in the Trump era, during which the Judiciary Committee chair burned the midnight oil to get Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch approved.\u000a\u000aTrump vs. Obama: Who is Better? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000a2. Charles Schumer (D-New York) \u2014 He has his share of critics on Capitol Hill, but few can deny the intense work ethic of Schumer, who learned everything he knows about politics growing up on the streets of Brooklyn. Schumer managed to outhustle Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin last year, securing the support he needed to succeed Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as Democratic minority leader. Indeed, the Energizer bunny of the Senate just keeps going and going and going . . .\u000a\u000a3. John McCain (R-Arizona) \u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s Sunday,\u201d the inside-the-Beltway joke goes, \u201cit\u2019s John McCain on 'Meet the Press.'\u201d McCain, 80, has been a front-liner in Washington since the Reagan era and, having won a sixth Senate term last year, he shows no signs of slowing down. If anything, he seems to have found new energy this year by reviving his \u201cMaverick\u201d persona, this time to challenge President Donald Trump on foreign affairs and national security issues. His tough stances might hit Trump where it counts most: McCain is the most popular member of Congress on Twitter with more than 2.2 million followers.\u000a\u000a4. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) \u2014 Cotton is a U.S. Army veteran, Bronze Star medal winner, and Harvard Law graduate. Since moving into the Senate in 2015 from the U.S. House of Representatives, he has sponsored 76 pieces of legislation, in addition to 308 bills he co-sponsored. "His vigor in mastering the nuances of foreign policy and speaking schedule in articulating an internationalist view is well-known and often leaves younger staffers breathless," says Newsmax White House correspondent John Gizzi.\u000a\u000a5. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \u2014 During his career, Portman has developed a reputation of getting results, and his time in the Senate has only bolstered that image as he has used much of it to promote bipartisan legislation, with a third of those bills being signed into law by President Obama. Portman\u2019s longtime legislative priorities have come to the fore in this session, such as removing barriers to job growth and the opioid crisis \u2014 two concerns that have also been championed by President Trump. The senator has already introduced several pieces of legislation in this session to address those two issues.\u000a\u000a6. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) \u2014 Love him or hate him \u2014 and there are certainly plenty of folks in Washington who do \u2014 McConnell is widely considered the senator who sleeps the least, works the most, fights the hardest, and has the scars to prove it. The Senate majority leader has been fighting and working his whole life, dating back to his race for student council president at duPont Manual High School in Louisville \u2014 the first of many races he has won. \u201cAlthough I did feel a bit sorry for him,\u201d McConnell wrote of his opponent in his memoir \u201cThe Long Game.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d simply outworked him.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) \u2014 Reed is a graduate of both Harvard Law and West Point and one of a few cadets in U.S. history to be elected to the Senate. Despite being one of the less visible senators, he is admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Republican Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby once said of Reed: \u201cHe is to be commended for his tenacity, for his never-give-up.\u201d And Sen. Schumer noted that \u201cJack does it in his quiet, steadfast way, and it is extremely effective,\u201d referring to Reed\u2019s deal-making and legislative style.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 12 Ways Trump Could Make You Rich in the Next 24 Months\u000a\u000a8. John Thune (R-South Dakota) \u2014 In addition to serving on three Senate committees \u2014 Finance; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the latter of which he serves as chairman \u2014 Thune claims membership in 32 separate caucuses that tackle a variety of issues and interests.\u000a\u000a9. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) \u2014 As chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Johnson has a full grasp of the impacts of terrorism and immigration, which is why he\u2019s sponsoring a new initiative to hand over the distribution of work visas to states to issue as they see fit. Along with House Republican Ken Buck of Colorado, Johnson sees this potential legislation as a game-changer in immigration reform while allowing states to meet their specific labor shortage needs. This massive policy work also dovetails with his chairmanship of Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European and Regional Security Cooperation\u000a\u000a10. John Cornyn (R-Texas) \u2014 Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate and the party whip, has had his hands full corralling the party\u2019s voting power as discord between establishment and Tea Party Republicans has threatened to fracture the building majority. This tension is most evident, perhaps, in the sometimes perceived divide between both Texas senators: Cornyn, the establishment bellwether, and Ted Cruz, the Tea Party firebrand. But, the senior Texas senator has shown he can lead the Republican Party to major victories in Senate, such as the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000a11. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) \u2014 All you need to know about Graham's work ethic is illustrated by his jam-packed pre-Senate rsum: At 21, his parents died, leaving him to raise his younger sister on his own. He then earned his JD from the University of South Carolina School of Law, joined the United States Air Force, and went on to work as a private practice lawyer before serving one term in the South Carolina House of Representatives and four in the U.S. House. Though sometimes criticized as being one of the more liberal Republicans in the Senate, Graham has remained uncompromising in his willingness to reach across the aisle to get the business of government done.\u000a\u000a12. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) \u2014 McCaskill learned a long time ago that being a woman in politics required her to work harder. \u201cI found that if you are informed and work hard, you can earn credibility,\u201d she wrote in \u201cPlenty Ladylike: A Memoir,\u201d while describing her service in the Missouri Legislature. \u201cI went from being the young blonde with all the hair to being someone whom the senior members approached.\u201d In the Senate, McCaskill has earned a reputation as someone who pulls no punches, speaks her mind and, most importantly, gets things done.\u000a\u000a13. Susan Collins (R-Maine) \u2014 Despite initially being shut out of the Senate Republican working group on healthcare reform, Collins continues to work on the Patient Freedom Act with Louisiana Republican Sen. Dr. Bill Cassidy and other Republican co-sponsors, which they introduced in the beginning of 2017. She hopes that she can attract moderate Democrats to the table to hammer out a comprehensive replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a14. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) \u2014 One of the more prolific senators, Blumenthal sponsors an average of 70 pieces of legislation a year since his move to the Senate in 2011. Additionally, he has co-signed more than 1,700 bills written by his colleagues. Blumenthal has been quite vocal about pursuing an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal as well as an independent investigation into Russia\u2019s possible role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000a15. Mike Lee (R-Utah) \u2014 Lee is a member of the Joint Economic Committee; Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; and the Judiciary Committee.

aVPresident Trump's \u201cfire and fury\u201d shot Wednesday at North Korea has Republicans nationwide wondering whether his campaign promise of \u201cAmerica First\u201d is finished.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said former Texas Republican Chairman Tom Pauken, an early Trump supporter. \u201cHe has surrounded himself with war hawks and interventionists who are giving him bad advice. He needs to replace [retired Gen. Henry] McMaster at the National Security Council with someone like retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, whose views are more aligned with what Trump ran on in the campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump's controversial remark seems to fly in the face of America's nation-building and his hands-off views.\u000a\u000aBut most of the Republican leaders who spoke to Newsmax gave Trump the benefit of the doubt. They agreed that the Pyongyang regime presents enough of a threat to the world that the U.S. should deal with it and the president is right to use the strong language he did.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I don't see it that way,\u201d said attorney Marc Scaringi, co-chairman of Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania campaign in 2016. \u201cAt this point, Trump is only expressing his anger, and the anger of many Americans, in response to repeated threats from North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s abandoned his base on foreign policy,\u201d former Washington State Republican Chairman Kirby Wilbur told us. Many of Trump's supporters were upset with America not being tough enough with the real bad guys, and North Korea is seen as one of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilbur, now a popular radio talk show host, added his belief that \u201cthe grass-roots will be fine with this. We're not talking about regime change or nation-building, we're talking about massive retaliation if they attack us. And they have publically threatened to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHoly cow North Korea is threatening America not France or Uruguay!\u201d exclaimed California GOP National Committeeman Shawn Steel, a conservative activist since he was a \u201cYouth for Goldwater\u201d volunteer in 1964. \u201cNorth Korea is a cancer metastasis that threatens the civilized world. One way or the other its leadership must be eradicated \u2014 the sooner the better!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat would Hillary have done? Nothing more than talk,\u201d said Hal Daub, former mayor of Omaha, Neb. \u201cAmerican foreign policy has wasted 10 years with North Korea. The U.N. finally gets it because we will not be intimidated any longer. President Trump is narrowing the pathway to succeed without strengthening North Korea's only focus \u2014 militarization of the Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aDaub argued that \u201cAmerica First\u201d is actually \u201ca domestic GDP rebuilding initiative that is reducing the regulatory burden of the federal central system and it\u2019s starting to work. The grass-roots isn't seeking war or international conflict but they do want America to stand up against tin-horned bullies and despots like Kim and Venezuelan maniacs.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

aVHarvard economist Kenneth Rogoff warns that a sudden spike in interest rates is the biggest threat to the global economy.\u000a\u000aRogoff explained to the BBC that people have got used to ultra-low interest rates.\u000a\u000aThe former IMF economist also said the economic policies of the Trump administration posed a risk.\u000a\u000a"If something was to happen that pushes interest rates up, we could see a lot of soft spots \u2014 places where there is high debt \u2014 start to unravel," Rogoff said.\u000a\u000aHe also said that the economic policies of the White House were creating uncertainty, without naming specific policies, the BBC explained.\u000a\u000a"The risk is that the White House or the U.S. will do something really irrational. That may seem hyperbolic but we are all holding our breath," Rogoff said.\u000a\u000aRogoff said althought the U.S. had substantially recovered from the downturn of 2007-8, a generation had been "scarred" by the crash and many young people had struggled to find work as a result.\u000a\u000a"I think the crash greatly amplified this wave of populism that the world's feeling right now," he said. "The U.S. would not have had Donald Trump as president without the crash."\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s vow to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d against North Korea sounded a lot like the rhetoric Kim Jong Un uses to threaten America. And it may prove to be just as empty, Bloomberg warned.\u000a\u000aTrump has no good military options in the face of mounting evidence that Kim will soon be able to hit Los Angeles or Denver with nuclear missiles.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s weapons and nuclear facilities "are dispersed and hidden throughout the country\u2019s mountainous terrain. Failing to hit them all would leave Japan, South Korea and U.S. military bases vulnerable to attack -- with either conventional or nuclear warheads." And even if the U.S. managed to destroy everything, Seoul would still be vulnerable to North Korea\u2019s artillery, Bloomberg explained.\u000a\u000aWith reports suggesting that Kim now has up to 60 nuclear warheads, millions could die.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you run any cost-benefit analysis, it\u2019s insanity,\u201d said John Delury, an assistant professor at Yonsei University in South Korea.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, investors have grown cautious over escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe loss of appetite for risk followed North Korea's claim it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam in an unusually detailed threat, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aTrump said on Thursday afternoon that his earlier warnings to North Korea may not have been tough enough.\u000a\u000aThe three major U.S. stock-market indices have sold off this week amid investors' jitters after Trump said on Tuesday that threats from Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000aInvestors bought safe-haven assets such as gold, helping the precious metal touch a two-month high, and the Japanese Yen rose.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re due for a little correction here.

aVSouth Korea and Japan warned North Korea that it would face a strong response if it carried through with a threat to launch a missile toward the U.S. territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aDefense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it would be legal for Japan to intercept a missile aimed at Guam. North Korea\u2019s threats to strike around Guam pose a serious challenge, a spokesman at South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters on Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe give a strict warning,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIf North Korea commits provocations despite our stern warning, it will face a strong response from South Korea\u2019s military and the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\u201d\u000a\u000aLater on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Security Council took a softer tone, saying the door for dialogue remained open and it would take all possible steps to ease tensions.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea, responding to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s "fire and fury" warning, outlined a detailed plan to fire four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles at Guam by mid-August. They would fly over southwestern Japan and land as close as 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Guam, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Thursday.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi index fell as much as 1.2 percent as foreigners sold shares, before paring the drop to 0.4 percent at the close. The won weakened 0.6 percent against the dollar, touching the lowest level in almost a month. In the U.S., the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent at 12:24 p.m. EST.\u000a\u000aMore than 3,000 kilometers southeast of North Korea, Guam is an important strategic hub for the U.S. military. It has air and naval bases, as well as missile-defense launchers on the island.\u000a\u000a\u201cSound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,\u201d KCNA reported, citing a statement in response to Trump by a general of the Korean People\u2019s Army. \u201cThe military action the KPA is about to take will be an effective remedy for restraining the frantic moves of the U.S. in the southern part of the Korean peninsula and its vicinity.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to calm tensions after Trump\u2019s remarks, saying \u201cAmericans should sleep well at night.\u201d Later, Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea in a statement it would lose any conflict it initiates.\u000a\u000aFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been an informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview on Fox News that he \u201chopes diplomacy works\u201d but added \u201cwe may need a non-diplomatic solution.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea first fired a missile over Japan in 1998, prompting the Japanese government to initiate its current ballistic missile-defense system with the U.S. While a second attempt failed in 2005, North Korea again succeeded in launching one in 2009 that flew over northern Japan and continued for another 3,000 kilometers before landing in the Pacific.\u000a\u000aMore recently, North Korean missiles have landed in the Sea of Japan, with some falling in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone that stretches as much as 200 nautical miles from its shores.\u000a\u000aJapan passed legislation two years ago allowing it to come to the aid of another country in certain circumstances, under a reinterpretation of its pacifist constitution. Onodera, the defense minister, told parliament on Thursday that an attack on Guam would fall under that legislation because of its importance to Japan\u2019s own defense.\u000a\u000aMissile Defense\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s unclear if Japan could shoot down a missile heading to Guam, according to Lance Gatling, president of Nexial Research, an aerospace consultancy in Tokyo.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy initial impression would be not really,\u201d Gatling said. \u201cA ballistic missile going to Guam is flying very high, going very fast and accelerating by the time it\u2019s over Japan. Without prior knowledge that it\u2019s coming, you are reduced to chasing it, which is a great disadvantage."\u000a\u000aA willingness to shoot down the missile was a politically important move in the relationship between the two allies, Gatling said, adding that Japan might be better placed to provide data to help the U.S. track the missile.\u000a\u000aJapan has a two-layered ballistic missile defense system, consisting of ship-based SM-3 interceptors, which are intended to shoot down missiles outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and land-based Patriot interceptors, which are designed to intercept them in the final stage of their trajectory. It is also looking into the possibility of adding a third missile defense element.\u000a\u000aJapan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also underscored the importance of the alliance, which he said would be further strengthened through a meeting between Tillerson, Mattis and their Japanese counterparts in Washington next week.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s provocative actions, including on this occasion, are a clear threat to the region and the international community and can absolutely not be tolerated,\u201dhe told reporters.

aVEnough is enough. For decades the world has been dealing with a hostile Iranian regime committed to waging radical Islamist war against the West and sowing the seeds of destruction through sponsorship of terrorism. It is long overdue for that behavior to stop. The unelected mullahs in Tehran need to understand that Iran cannot continue to do as it pleases without any consequences. That important message was sent in recent weeks by the U.S. military, Congress, and President Trump.\u000a\u000aIranian aggression in the Persian Gulf came close to sparking military confrontation that would have pitted the U.S. Navy against the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism. An Iranian ship steered menacingly close to a U.S. vessel, ignoring radio warnings to change course. In the end, the American ship was forced to fire warning shots, ultimately defusing the situation.\u000a\u000aThis was actually the latest in a series of escalations at sea by Iran. In a stunning display of arrogance and antipathy toward the U.S., Iran violated international law in 2016 by taking American soldiers captive and then airing video of the detained soldiers as propaganda.\u000a\u000aIn the latest sign that the United States is taking steps to enforce more accountability on Iran for its nefarious actions, Congress passed an important piece of legislation that President Trump promptly signed into law. The bill strengthens sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and illicit conventional weapons trade. It also aims to pressure Iran to restrain its nuclear development and to deliver penalties for disruption.\u000a\u000aThese were positive steps that demonstrate that President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill understand the threat Iran poses to the United States and the rest of the world. Sanctioning Iran and putting Tehran on notice helps avoid an open confrontation. America does presently not seek or need a military clash with Iran.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Iran has found itself on the front pages of newspapers for the wrong reasons and we should not let down our guard. The American public needs to be aware of what has been happening in the Middle East because of Iran and its bankrolling of terrorism and fomenting of hostilities. Keeping Iran in the spotlight is ultimately likely to prove essential for creating and maintaining stability in the Middle East and around the world.\u000a\u000aA lot has happened worldwide since the United States agreed to the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), the disastrous nuclear deal that has allowed Iran to keep its illicit atomic infrastructure and continue developing its nuclear program without adequate supervision by inspectors.\u000a\u000aIran has also continued apace with threatening missile tests, which are particularly alarming. The development of Iran\u2019s missile program has produced an arsenal with ever-expanding abilities to strike far beyond the Middle East alone. Iran already possesses the ability to launch missiles that can hit anywhere inside Israel. In 2015, Iran unveiled a new long-range missile that has the capability to detonate across large swaths of Europe.\u000a\u000aThat reality makes it deeply puzzling as to why European countries are rushing to do business deals with Iran. French manufacturer Renault just announced the biggest-ever deal to begin production on 150,000 vehicles starting in 2018.\u000a\u000aGiven Iran\u2019s history of deception, the West should proceed with caution rather than rushing headlong into financial arrangements that will pump more money into the Islamic Republic\u2019s coffers. There should be a real fear that Iran could violate the JCPOA or ultimately decide to abandon it altogether, moving full throttle to make the final last leap to nuclear capability. The bellicose rhetoric that is continuously broadcast by Iran demonstrates clearly its desire for confrontation with the United States and its allies.\u000a\u000aAmerica in recent days has sent a clear and united message to Iran, reasserting that its destructive actions will not be tolerated. The new law targets those people working to advance Iran\u2019s missiles and weapons program, and it makes it more difficult for the regime to destabilize the region.\u000a\u000aU.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has correctly and sharply criticized the UN Security Council for the disproportionate amount of negative focus on Israel while ignoring the threat of Iran\u2019s Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. Haley recently reminded the UN Security Council that Hezbollah is the real threat to peace and security in the Middle East, not Israel, which seeks peace with its neighbors.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to Iran, America must continue to mistrust and verify. The world needs to keep a close eye on Iran\u2019s nuclear plants and also its hostile actions in the military arena. Congress and President Trump have shown they understand the very real threat Iran poses and must continue to be vigilant to protect the American people from enemies in Tehran who wish us harm.\u000a\u000aArmstrong Williams is the author of "Reawakening Virtues."

aVLanguage and demeanor are important for presidents, and there is no reason for President Donald Trump to match North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "in being shrill," former NATO Ambassador and State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"All of our nuclear age presidents, going back to [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower, when they talk about nuclear weapons, they have been steely and precise," Burns commented during an MSNBC "Morning Joe" interview. "They have not been bombastic and shrill."\u000a\u000aThere was no reason for Trump, with his "fire and fury" response to Kim, to have matched the dictator's tone, said Burns, but that didn't mean he thinks there should not have been a tough official response to the Asian country's growing aggressions.\u000a\u000a"You don't want the unintended consequence of Kim Jong Un to fly off the handle," said Burns, pointing out that Defense Secretary James Mattis put out a statement that was "extremely tough."\u000a\u000aBut in his statement, the retired general was "precise in linking our actions to their actions, and that's the way to go," said Burns.\u000a\u000aBurns also said he thinks Trump, while giving his comments about North Korea, may have also trying to get the attention of China to let it know that the United States will have to take things in a different direction, unless the Chinese puts more leverage on Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThe former ambassador said he also believes the United States should have an integrated diplomatic and military strategy moving forward.\u000a\u000a"We've seen a lot of military and a lot of threats and we've seen less of the diplomacy," he said. "I would hope that President Trump would basically give the reins here to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson."\u000a\u000aTillerson's "measured, tough Constitution is better suited to the diplomacy of dealing with the Chinese and the North Koreans than President Trump's very open and quite shrill style," Burns said.\u000a\u000aHowever, too many people from the Trump administration are speaking out, and it's making the situation more difficult, he continued.\u000a\u000a"You have four or five different people at the high level speaking for the administration and their messages are colliding with each other," Burns said. "Can you imagine what it's like to sit in Beijing or Tokyo and make sense of what the United States is trying to say to them?\u000a\u000a"They need more discipline. They need a senior career person, there are lots of people that could do it very well, but they don't seem to trust the State Department, and that's hurting them right now."

aVLivestock farms are for people who want to raise animals for business or pleasure. Not everyone is cut out to be a livestock farmer, so knowing about livestock farming helps before starting out.\u000a\u000aLivestock farming may include everything from beef and dairy cattle to pigs, goats, sheep, horses, and even birds. For farmers, it\u2019s a great way to get back into nature, but it also provides the community, the nation, and the world with the products of agriculture.\u000a\u000aHere are six things for farmers to know about livestock farms:\u000a\u000a1. Business plan \u2014 Like any other endeavor, starting a livestock farm means setting goals and developing a plan. This is necessary for hobby or commercial farming. Planning is a way to know how much it will cost for the farm and how much you can charge at a fair price to make it profitable, according to PennState Extension.\u000a\u000aUrgent: Are You Eating These Cancer-Causing Foods?\u000a\u000a2. Love the work \u2014 Raising livestock may be something you want to do, but you\u2019ll have to love it to succeed. Ask farmers about their experiences to learn more. You may have worked on a farm, but knowing all factors involved in livestock farming is essential before making an initial investment.\u000a\u000a3. Know the resources \u2014 The land purchased for a livestock farm can differ, depending on whether you\u2019re raising pigs or cattle. Certain breeds are raised better on certain pastures or land. Stock selection and where a farmer buys livestock also play a part in starting a farm.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Full-time responsibilities \u2014 No matter the size of the farm, a livestock farmer needs to be on hand 24 hours a day. The reasons include everything from feeding a baby animal to retrieving escaped cattle or repairing damage to fencing, Hobby Farms points out. Injured animals are also sometimes in need of round-the-clock care.\u000a\u000a5. Ups and downs \u2014 The agriculture business faces market downturns as with any other business. Aside from their own needs, farmers must be able to take care of their livestock even in bad economic times. Financial resources are needed for the unexpected.\u000a\u000a6. Family and community support \u2014 Some farmers succeed by doing most of the work themselves to curtail costs. Most beginning farmers benefit from family support for labor and advice, explains the University of Wisconsin. Building up credit and community relations also provide much-needed support.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Don\u2019t Make These Mistakes With Allergy Drugs

aVEconomists are growing worried that lawmakers in Washington are getting dangerously close to budget deadlines, which may be negative for financial markets in the next few weeks.\u000a\u000aForecasters in a monthly survey by The Wall Street Journal estimate on average a 22 percent chance that the government will shut down at the end of September, and a 17 percent possibility that the U.S. Treasury will miss payments. Those outlays include federal payrolls and Social Security checks.\u000a\u000aLawmaker returning from the August recess face two important deadlines. Congress needs to decide whether to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, which would give the Treasury the authority to borrow more money. The following day is the end of the fiscal year and the deadline for Congress to approve legislation to keep the government running.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe annual games of Debt Ceiling Roulette and Federal Budget Chicken pose greater risks than ever this year,\u201d Amy Crews Cutts, chief economist of the credit reporting agency Equifax, told the newspaper.\u000a\u000aEconomists estimate a 6 percent chance the U.S. will default on debt payments, a low possibility but still double the risk from a survey earlier this summer.\u000a\u000a\u201cDefault would have quick and severe effects on the economy that no party wants to bear,\u201d said Brian Schaitkin, senior U.S. economist at the Conference Board.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s inability to repeal and replace his predecessor\u2019s healthcare law have cast doubts on other campaign pledges, including tax reform and trillion-dollar spending on roads, bridges and airports.\u000a\u000a\u201cA growth-oriented tax package could lead to a surge in business investment,\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist of Amherst Pierpont Securities, told the WSJ. \u201cIf nothing gets done, disappointment could set in.\u201d

aVThe opioid crisis is getting a lot of attention these days, but the highly-addictive prescription medications aren\u2019t the only class of pain relievers causing serious health problems in the U.S.\u000a\u000aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be an even more widespread threat to the general public. Eaten like candy by millions of Americans to relieve aches and pains, NSAIDs are generally considered to be relatively harmless, especially over-the-counter (OTC) varieties such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). But they pose their own set of risks \u2013 including stomach bleeding, stroke, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular hazards.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think enough attention is given to this problem, especially among patients with an underlying medical problem that could be significantly worsened by even short-term exposure to non-steroidals,\u201d says Dr. Michael Hooten, a pain medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.\u000a\u000a\u201cBecause they are widely available and have been marketed as being safe OTC drugs for so many decades now, we have become callous to their adverse effects. I\u2019d suggest that if those drugs had to face the rigors of testing to be OTC today, they may not be allowed.\u201d\u000a\u000aNSAIDs work by blocking enzymes vital to producing prostaglandins, lipid compounds that sensitize nerve cells to pain due to inflammation. Prostaglandins also affect the fever-control center of the hypothalamus in the brain. That\u2019s why NSAIDs can reduce pain and fever.\u000a\u000aBut prostaglandins also serve as vasodilators to open blood vessels, affect blood clotting and have various other metabolic functions. So when they are inhibited, pain and fever relief aren\u2019t the only results.\u000a\u000a\u201cNon-steroidals have an adverse effect on the kidneys, particularly in people who already have a reduction in renal function due to diabetes or some other disease,\u201d Hooten tells Newsmax Health. \u201cThese drugs also cause erosion of the gastric lining, which can set up gastric hemorrhage, a life-threatening condition. And they can contribute to high blood pressure.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne prescription NSAID, rofecoxib (Vioxx), was pulled from the market in 2004 because it significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Researchers subsequently found that all NSAIDs were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis CV risk was dependent on how long the drugs were taken and the dose,\u201d notes Dr. Bill McCarberg, past president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), on Medscape.com. \u201cThe higher the dose and the longer period of time taken, the more risk.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of NSAIDs for the shortest period of time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe drugs are safer if used intermittently,\u201d says Hooten, director-at-large of the AAPM. \u201cEven in healthy people, problems arise when they\u2019re taken on a regular basis, especially in the gastric tract.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince many NSAIDs don\u2019t need prescriptions, a lot of people take them without consulting their doctor about potentially adverse reactions when used with other medications, such as some blood thinners and antidepressants. And seniors, who are the biggest users of NSAIDs, are more at risk because they are likely to have other health problems that could be exacerbated by the drugs.\u000a\u000a\u201cA safer option is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which has no adverse side effects on the GI tract, kidneys or cardiovascular system when used at a safe dosage,\u201d says Hooten. \u201cBut higher doses are associated with liver toxicity. The recommended maximum dose per day is 3,000 milligrams.\u201d\u000a\u000aYou can also try to ditch the drugs entirely. Pain can be treated with acupuncture, chiropractic care, massage, essential oils, herbal supplements, analgesic salves, and other therapies.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost people take non-steroidals for aches and pains that are muscular and skeletal in nature, so regular daily exercise can help,\u201d says Hooten. \u201cExercise strengthens muscles and helps keep the mobility and range of motion of the joints intact.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe take-home message about non-steroidals is just because you can get them over the counter, don\u2019t forget that they have very serious adverse effects.\u201d

aVChina should listen to what President Donald Trump is saying to North Korea because its fingerprints seem to be on the reclusive nation's weapons program, former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on "America Talks Live," Nunberg was asked about the growing crisis with North Korea and how the U.S. should handle it.\u000a\u000a"If I was China, I would really, really take his words very seriously," Nunberg said. "You know it's interesting, don't think that when they test these missiles they built them on their own. They look like Chinese missiles to me.\u000a\u000a"They look like Chinese technology to me, and I would say that there will be major wrath, Trump wrath, hitting that North Korean peninsula, and it's going to come soon. It's just the reality."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Trump warned the insular country several times this week it would be smart to back off and not attack the U.S.\u000a\u000aNunberg added if the U.S. does nothing and leaves it with Trump's threat to retaliate while North Korea continues to beat its war drums, a bad message would be sent to America's adversaries.\u000a\u000a"It sends a message that you don't have to take our word for it, that you don't have to trust our threats, that you can just end up doing whatever you want, and eventually you're going to be able to take one of these and hit New York City, if you want," he said.

aVGMO salmon is on Canadian dinner tables after a U.S. company gained regulatory approval to sell the meat.\u000a\u000aU.S.-based biotechnology company, AquaBounty, which produces genetically modified (GM) salmon, sold approximately five tons of GM salmon fillets to customers in Canada since Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency granted regulatory approval last year, the company said in a press release.\u000a\u000aAquaBounty said its fish fillets "became the world\u2019s first genetically engineered animal to be approved for human consumption," according to a November post on the company's website.\u000a\u000aCEO Ronald Stotish said the company celebrated two milestones: "The purchase of our first commercial farm site for the production of our eco-friendly AquAdvantage salmon in the United States and the very first sales of AquAdvantage salmon.\u000a\u000a"The sale and discussions with potential buyers clearly demonstrate that customers want our fish, and we look forward to increasing our production capacity to meet demand."\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) decision to approve GM salmon has garnered a mixed reaction from the public.\u000a\u000aMontreal doctor, Christopher Labos, noted that "some think this will lead to the salvation of humanity, and others to its downfall," according to a post on the AquaBounty website.\u000a\u000aOne of the organizations opposing the sale of GM fish is GMO Inside, a campaign dedicated to spreading awareness on the possible implications genetically modified organisms (GMOs) could have on the environment, food systems, economy and public\u2019s health.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, GMO Inside noted that the "salmon has been genetically altered to produce extra growth hormones, allowing it to grow faster and bigger than natural salmon."\u000a\u000aThe organization explained that no independent studies had been funded on the fish\u2019s safety, adding that the FDA formed its opinions upon data provided by AquaBounty, stating that genetically engineered foods were equivalent to natural foods.\u000a\u000a"The FDA ignored the concerns raised by thousands of Americans and dozens of legislators and scientists, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service," noted GMO Inside.\u000a\u000aResponding to concerns, Labos said people were scared of GMOs because they did not understand the technology.\u000a\u000a"They see it as something new and scary," he said. "That\u2019s ironic, because we\u2019ve been genetically modifying our food for thousands of years."

aVThe United States is one of the most charitable countries in the world with Americans donating more than $358 billion in 2014 alone, according to GivingUSA.org. Charity runs deep through the fabric of who we are as a people, so it is little wonder that many U.S. charities celebrate the values that founded this nation. Those values include individual freedom, self-reliance, equality of opportunity, competition, and hard work, to name a few.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list of Newsmax\u2019s Top 50 Charities That Celebrate American Values, our editors combed through reputable online resources such as Charity Navigator, GreatNonprofits, and Philanthropedia.

The Navy SEAL Foundation \u2014 Since 9/11, our Special Operations Forces have been tasked with monumental goals on battlefields around the world.

The Innocence Project \u2014 It is a sad fact that a nation that prides itself on equal justice for all has imprisoned many innocent people. This is due partly to the fact that, until recently, we lacked the technology to perform the DNA testing that could exonerate wrongfully imprisoned inmates. The Innocence Project has done much to bring restitution to those experiencing this injustice.\u000a\u000aTip: Here's How to Never Run Out of Money During Retirement\u000a\u000a26.

Rebuilding Together \u2014 A safe and secure home is a vital part of the American dream. Sadly, too many U.S. families live in substandard housing that is a far cry from what many other families experience.

aVThe uncanny valley is a hypothetical problem in AI and robotics that has persisted since 1970s-era speculations about how human-robot interactions could play out. New research suggests that one possible way to make machines more likable and relatable \u2014 climbing out of the valley, so to speak \u2014 is to make them clumsy and capable of error. But would that simply introduce more problems?\u000a\u000aNow that we\u2019re starting to create realistic conversational (and sometimes physical) interfaces with machines, it\u2019s becoming more important to study and address this potential problem \u2014 both for the sake of increasing user adoption and to advance robotics faster and with fewer ethical dilemmas.\u000a\u000aThe Uncanny Valley\u000a\u000aIn case you aren\u2019t familiar, the uncanny valley is a description for a phenomenon in which an object (such as a doll, toy, or this case, a robot) is associated with positive feelings when it bears no resemblance to human beings. Positive feelings sag down and become negative feelings as the object in question begins to look similar to a human \u2014 but with key, \u201cuncanny\u201d differences that trigger reactions of disgust or discomfort.\u000a\u000aThe best way to understand uncanny valley is to look at examples of robots that attempt to look human and fail. The uncanny valley hypothesis claims it\u2019s better to look nothing like a human than only somewhat like a human, and is a problem for the AI and robotics community because one of their primary goals is to achieve consistently positive interactions between human beings and machines.\u000a\u000aThe uncanny valley is frequently discussed and occasionally studied, but there\u2019s still much we don\u2019t understand about how it works or what, specifically, is triggering those feelings of revulsion that seem so common in the general population.\u000a\u000aThe Study\u000a\u000aThe latest research, published in Frontiers in Robotics and AI, presented test subjects with interactions with one of two different robots. One of them was programmed to communicate and interact flawlessly, while the other was intentionally programmed with certain behavioral flaws. Researchers observed the human test subjects after mistakes were made to gauge their reactions, and followed up with both groups to evaluate how they felt about the robots.\u000a\u000aAmong other variables, they asked participants about the robot\u2019s likability, anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence. Overall, the group with the flawed robot found the robot to be more likable and human-like, and responded to it more positively.\u000a\u000aResearchers document this as an example of the so-called \u201cpratfall effect,\u201d as applied to robotics, which states that people who make mistakes, are clumsy, or otherwise openly display imperfections are more likable than people who don\u2019t.\u000a\u000aProblems and Solutions\u000a\u000aThe new study presents one strong solution to the uncanny valley problem; intentionally imbuing robots and AI programs with errors, flaws, and mistakes to make them seem more realistic. After all, no human beings act perfectly, and if they seem to act perfectly, they\u2019re less likable.\u000a\u000aThere are a few significant problems with this approach. First, intentionally making robots clumsy or accident-prone could make them inferior for applications like home-based medical treatment or surgery.\u000a\u000aSecond, it would be a difficult task to evaluate what qualifies as a \u201clikeable\u201d flaw and what doesn\u2019t, and to determine the best way to apply those flaws to an otherwise functional machine. Still, the study marks an important step forward in advancing the relationship between AI and human beings.\u000a\u000aOnce we understand the nuances of imperfections in positive interactions, we\u2019ll be one step closer to emerging from the uncanny valley.\u000a\u000aLarry Alton is a professional blogger, writer, and researcher.

aVA new children\u2019s trend, the "Hot Water Challenge," has resulted in at least one death and various other serious injuries.\u000a\u000aMost recently, 11-year-old Jamoneisha Merritt from The Bronx, was rushed to the burn unit after friend\u2019s allegedly poured boiling hot water over her. The incident took place Monday during a sleepover, NY1 News reported.\u000a\u000aJamoneisha\u2019s friends were attempting to complete the challenge, which calls for youths to throw hot water on an unsuspecting person.\u000a\u000aJamoneisha Merritt\u2019s mother, Ebony Merritt, told NY1 News that her daughter did not understand why these friends had done this.\u000a\u000a"She's very sad. She's emotionally messed up," said Ebony Merritt.\u000a\u000a"They've been on Snapchat. It's been going on several times. The girl admitted it. 'I don't like her. I wanted to do it.'"\u000a\u000aIn July a 10-year-old Cleveland County boy, Wesley Smith, sustained second- and third-degree burns while attempting the "Hot Water Challenge" with his brother.\u000a\u000aHis mother, Rhonda Daugherty, told WBTV that Wesley had to spend several weeks in a Winston Salem Burn Center and would need skin grafts and multiple surgeries.\u000a\u000aOne incident turned fatal when 8-year-old Florida resident Ki\u2019ari Pope died from burn injuries sustained in March.\u000a\u000aAccording to CBS12, she and her cousins had been watching videos on YouTube and had come across footage of others participating in the "Hot Water Challenge" before Ki'ari drank boiling water through a straw.\u000a\u000aPope\u2019s aunt, Diane Johnson, told CBS that the eight-year-old was prompted by her cousins to do the challenge.\u000a\u000a""They dared her and she said, 'OK, I\u2019m going to show y\u2019all I\u2019m not scared, I\u2019m going to do this.\u2019"\u000a\u000aAccording to reports, Pope had sustained multiple burn wounds to her mouth and throat, which she succumbed to almost three weeks later.\u000a\u000aRelatives of these children are encouraging parents to be vigilant.\u000a\u000a"Tell your kids about these challenges. These challenges are horrific," Johnson said to CBS12.\u000a\u000aWesley Smith\u2019s stepfather, Jimmy Daugherty, told WBTV that parents need to monitor their children.\u000a\u000a"Watch what your kids are doing on the Internet," he said.

Free Test Shows You When \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here\u000a\u000aMany Americans hope \u2014 or dream \u2014 that winning the lottery will bolster their retirement savings. But such a plan is an extreme long shot, and one investment advisers suggest shouldn't be counted upon over real savings.Odds are about 1 in 175 million for winning the Powerball jackpot.Still, some lucky winners manage to win big, and in doing so, must quickly cope with investing and making sure their windfalls are protected.Experts encourage lottery winners to find a quality adviser, not only for investments, but also for insurance, taxes, and accounting, personal finance website Kiplinger said Lottery winners should also carefully decide which is best for them: taking a lump sum payout or annual payments."If you go through the entire payout in the first year, you have 19 more chances to get it right," Don McNay, the author of "Life Lessons From the Lottery," told Kiplinger. "But if you die before your payments end, it could trigger complex tax issues; your heirs may need to pay estate taxes on your remaining winnings before receiving the unpaid portion of your disbursements."Investopedia compared money spent on lottery tickets versus investing that cash for the long term. While the stock market isn't a guarantee of earnings, putting lotto cash into certain investments could yield a stronger divided for retirement."If a person spends $5 per week on lottery tickets, it adds up to $260 per year. Over 20 years (a typical long-term investment horizon for stocks and bonds), the total spent on lottery tickets would be $5,200," Investopedia said . "Putting $260 per year into bonds earning, for example, 3.8 percent, would yield $7,584 after 20 years, or $11,015 on stocks earning 7.3 percent. Therefore, if you just spent the money on lottery tickets and presumably won nothing, you would be out $5,200 after 20 years, as opposed to a profit with either of the investments."Kiplinger said five stronger investments are contributing to your 401K, paying off debt, opening a ROTH IRA, increasing mortgage payments, and investing in a taxable account.

aVPeople all over America want to give back to the veterans responsible for their freedoms. Perhaps no one knows better about how to help than fellow vets. Veterans also enjoy the connection to other vets when giving back.\u000a\u000aThere are many ways to help vets through such programs as the Disabled American Veterans and the Wounded Warrior Project. Vets are unique in that they know what other veterans may need at home.\u000a\u000aThey can help veterans just by being there or giving back in a variety of ways. Simply getting involved in certain programs or organizations for their own benefit can help other vets.\u000a\u000aTIP: The Secret Water Cure for Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aHere are six ways veterans can give back to their fellow vets:\u000a\u000a1. Online education programs \u2014 Many vets return home to advance their education. There are many online education programs that encourage connecting with other veterans and sharing experiences, according to U.S. News. Find other vets by reading their introductions available to classmates or through class discussion boards where they might mention their military service.\u200b\u000a\u000a2. Vets Prevail \u2014 Soldiers returning home can connect with their peers to ease their transition to life after leaving the service. Vets Prevail is an online mental health tool to deal with readjustment challenges by chatting with other vets or getting information about their thoughts and feelings.\u000a\u000a\u200b3. Support veterans\u2019 groups \u2014 Vets can join or support organizations that help returning veterans who may have suffered from traumatic injuries. The Warriors & Quiet Waters Foundation, for example, provides retreats to injured veterans in Montana with recreational activities.\u000a\u000aIMPORTANT: Top Doctor Shares Tricks That Actually Make Your Brain Younger\u000a\u000a\u200b4. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America \u2014 The nonprofit IAVA connects veterans for support. There are some 420,000 members who enjoy family-friendly events, education and employment programs, and get-togethers at communities across the country.\u000a\u000a5. Vets4Vets \u2014 Through groups around the country, Vets4Vets provides free weekend workshops so vets can discuss their experiences or trauma of war with other vets.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Start a vet program \u2014 U.S. Marine veterans Bob Adams and Dirk Enger opened the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Veterans in Wheaton, Illinois in 2007, CNN reported. The nonprofit grew into an organization that provides housing and counseling to some 400 vets a year. Adams, a clinical social worker, had noticed that many homeless people in Chicago were veterans and began envisioning such a program.\u000a\u000aALERT: Suzanne Somers Reveals 'Forbidden' Cancer Cures That Saved Her Life

aV"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function," wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in a series of articles named "The Crack-up" for Esquire in 1936. "One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise."\u000a\u000aIf Fitzgerald's test remains valid today, then I can only conclude that few people with first-rate intelligence are making their voices heard. Instead, firm views from both sides of an argument are more often simply amplified.\u000a\u000aPerhaps that's because it's easier and more entertaining to watch two people debate clearly defined and opposing views than to watch (or read) someone debate with him or herself. But, whatever the reason, purity of thought and clear thinking seem to be valued more highly than are complex, gray thoughts that might more closely reflect reality.\u000a\u000aLast Friday's memo by Google employee James Damore titled "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber, How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion," is an example.\u000a\u000aThe memo led the company to fire him on Monday and resulted in heavy media coverage. While the left and right can each use the paper as an excuse to rally their bases, the rest of us have the opportunity to pause, reflect and see if we have first-rate minds.\u000a\u000aDamore wrote, "At Google, we talk so much about unconscious bias as it applies to race and gender, but we rarely discuss our moral biases. Political orientation is actually a result of deep moral preferences and thus biases. Considering that the overwhelming majority of the social sciences, media, and Google lean left, we should critically examine these prejudices." His paper did just that.\u000a\u000a"Neither side is 100 percent correct," wrote Damore, "and both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society or, in this case, company . . . Google's left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence."\u000a\u000aDamore went on to lay out his argument. "On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. . . . They're exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective . . . Many of these differences are small and there's significant overlap between men and women, so you can't say anything about an individual given these population level distributions."\u000a\u000a"Women, on average, have more: Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas . . . Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness . . . Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance)."\u000a\u000aHe added that his "larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology . . . [We should] treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism)."\u000a\u000aDamore's suggestions to Google included demoralizing diversity, ending the alienation of conservatives, confronting [political] biases, focusing on psychological safety, and being open about the science of human nature.\u000a\u000aGoggle is one of many tech firms in the news recently regarding gender issues. In April, the tech giant Uber was the subject of a New York Times Article titled, "It's Not Just Fox: Why Women Don't Report Sexual Harassment," by Claire Cain Miller. The topic: sexual harassment.\u000a\u000a"In February, a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, wrote that when she reported to the Uber human resources department that her manager had tried persuading her to have sex with him on her first official day on her new team, the department declined to take action. It said she could change teams or accept what would probably be a poor performance review from the manager. Uber has a new human resources executive and is doing an internal investigation."\u000a\u000aUnacceptable behavior, and Uber is currently under an internal investigation regarding its work environment.\u000a\u000aWhile many are focused on today's work environment, Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital, reacted on Twitter to the firing of Damore with a view toward the future. "Dear @Google, Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR. Thx in advance, A dad."\u000a\u000aWeinstein responded to a negative comment that followed his posting with this: "You don't fire a biologist for noting that the SRY protein could result in social/cognitive differences as if he were promoting harassment."\u000a\u000aCan it be true that there is still gender discrimination and harassment, and also true that there are scientific differences between genders?\u000a\u000aThe world is an amazingly complex and interesting place, as are individuals. Maybe our goal should be to encourage first-rate intelligence and see if we can hold two opposed ideas in our head and function at the same time.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJackie Gingrich Cushman is the co-author, along with her father, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, of the book "5 Principles for a Successful Life: From Our Family to Yours."

aVIn Cuba, an acoustic attack may be to blame for severe hearing loss among U.S diplomats last year, though officials are uncertain of the cause the injuries.\u000a\u000aA series of "bizarre" incidents attributed to a "covert sonic device" led to several U.S diplomats experiencing unexplained hearing losses, The Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000aTwo Cuban diplomats have since been expelled from the U.S, confirmed State Department officials on Wednesday, although specific details surrounding the incident remain vague.\u000a\u000a"Some U.S. government personnel working at the embassy in Havana, Cuba, on official duty, working on behalf of the U.S embassy there, have reported some incidents that have caused a variety of physical symptoms," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters.\u000a\u000aShe explained in a video that has been posted on YouTube that the department did not have definitive information on the source or cause of the incidents but could confirm that, on May 23, the State Department took further action and investigations are ongoing.\u000a\u000a"Some of our people have had the option of leaving Cuba as a result, for medical reasons," she said. "I can't tell you the exact number \u2026 but we had to bring some Americans home or some Americans chose to come home as a result of that. And, as result of that, we have asked two Cubans to leave the United States and they have."\u000a\u000aAn official told CNN that some of the employees affected could have suffered permanent hearing loss.\u000a\u000aThey had been reporting physical symptoms resembling concussions since the latter half of 2016 but it is believed that those affected were not at the same place at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe Cuban government had been alerted to the incidents and medical care has been provided to people experiencing these physical symptoms however, the State Department claims it has not been able to establish the exact cause of this.\u000a\u000a"It can be quite serious," one official told CNN. "We have worked with the Cubans to try and find out what is going on. They insist they don't know, but it has been very worrying and troublesome."\u000a\u000aIn a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba said it took the issue seriously and acted in a professional manner in an attempt to clarify facts surrounding the situation by launching an investigation.\u000a\u000a"The Cuban authorities set up an inter-institutional expert committee for the analysis of the facts; expanded and reinforced the protection and security measures of the mission, its staff and diplomatic residences; and new channels were made available for direct communication between the Embassy and the Department of Diplomatic Security," the ministry said.\u000a\u000a"The Ministry categorically emphasizes that Cuba has never, nor would it ever, allow that the Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic agents or their families, without exception. Moreover, it reiterates its willingness to cooperate in the clarification of this situation."

aVThey\u2019re baa-a-ack. Not content to embrace Americans with ties to organizations the left concedes are anti-Semitic \u2014 former Nation of Islam supporter Keith Ellison and Hamas supporter Linda Sarsour come immediately to mind \u2014 the left remains committed to hijacking, mocking, degrading, and downplaying the troubling recent growth of real anti-Semitism by hurling the epithet at anyone who threatens their extremist progressive agenda.\u000a\u000aConspicuously complacent about the demonization of Israel and the ongoing attempts to eject Jews from their own progressive movement, they continue to rail against such dastardly \u201canti-Semites\u201d as Mort Klein (of the pro-Israel Zionist Organization of America) and Steve Bannon (of pro-Israel Breitbart). On August 3, the Forward published \u201cthe most despicable article ever in Jewish media,\u201d in the words of lifelong Democrat and soon-to-be-former liberal icon Alan Dershowitz.\u000a\u000aIn \u201c19 People Jews Should Worry About More than Linda Sarsour,\u201d Steven Davidson \u2014 who self-identifies as a \u201cprogressive, feminist, anti-occupation, Arabic-speaker\u201d manages to lump Klein, Bannon, and President Trump in with Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ali Khameini, Hezbollah\u2019s Hasan Nasrallah, and \u2014 in a laughably clumsy attempt to try to sound mainstream \u2014 the actual leaders of the Nation of Islam and Hamas, Louis Farrakhan and Ismail Haniyeh, respectively.\u000a\u000aPride of place on the Forward\u2019s list, however, goes to the hugely pro-Israel Sebastian Gorka. So feared and reviled is Gorka that he makes the list not once, but a whimsical twice.\u000a\u000aDavidson rehashes the Forward\u2019s fabricated allegation that Gorka is \u201ca member of a far-right group founded by Nazis,\u201d calling him \u201cAN ACTUAL ALLEGED MEMBER OF A NAZI-ALIGNED GROUP\u201d (all caps in the original). Set aside for a moment the disturbing standard inherent in condemning anyone as an \u201cactual alleged member\u201d of anything. This is the same Steven Davidson who \u2014 on July 16 \u2014 asked readers of the Forward \u201cWhen Is it Okay to Call Someone a Nazi?\u201d His purported concern at the time was that overuse of the label \u201cinherently poses risks to our culture.\u201d His considered answer now appears to be \u201cAugust.\u201d It\u2019s also the same Steven Davidson who provided the notoriously anti-Israel website Mondoweiss with a lengthy essay describing his discomfort with the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the equation, Davidson\u2019s target is the same Sebastian Gorka that the Forward smeared with numerous hysterical fabrications (\u201cACTUAL ALLEGATIONS!\u201d) in forty-plus articles between February and May. That phase of the leftist attack came to a screeching halt on May 8, when overwhelming evidence and a withering counterattack forced the Forward to concede that it had been unable to unearth even a single instance of Gorka ever uttering or writing anything even arguably anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.\u000a\u000aAnd so, despite relentless fake news stories (\u201cACTUAL ALLEGATIONS!\u201d) of Gorka being a Nazi sympathizer (he isn\u2019t), being fired (he wasn\u2019t), being disinvited to speak at the Jerusalem Post conference in New York (he appeared to a hero\u2019s welcome and multiple standing ovations from the pro-Israel Jewish crowd), Gorka has emerged over the past six months as a leading White House contact for Jewish leaders and pro-Israel groups \u2014 as well as the Trump administration\u2019s most forceful and effective spokesperson on foreign policy after the president himself. To the dismay of progressives, Gorka, like his boss, is never apologetic about America. His near-daily media presence reinforces the critical messages that the president sent the world through his powerful Riyadh and Warsaw speeches: Trump\u2019s America stands with allies and squares off against enemies.\u000a\u000aWhich explains the radical left\u2019s Gorka obsession. The quixotic campaign to defame as an anti-Semite this man with an impeccable record on all matters pertaining to Israel or Jews was created on the pages of the Forward by Eli Clifton, a progressive operative with ties to radical anti-Israel websites and long denounced for his own \u201crhetoric of Jew-hatred.\u201d The operation may have quieted down since May, but it has never gone away. The attacks continue to come \u2014 emanating exclusively from journalists with ties to rabidly anti-Israel sources like The Nation, Electronic Intifada, Mondoweiss and, tragically, the (formerly Jewish) Forward.\u000a\u000aDavidson\u2019s despicable-cum-ridiculous list may portend a new wave of attacks from leftist Israel haters. A journalist named Bob Dreyfuss is reportedly attempting to revive some of the discredited charges against Gorka, this time on behalf of Rolling Stone. That\u2019s the same eminent publication whose managing editor excused its invented rape story \u2014 a notorious slander that tarnished an entire university \u2014 by explaining that reporters and editors frequently run explosive front-page articles without even attempting to contact the accused perpetrator. Journalistic integrity at its finest.\u000a\u000aAnd who is Bob Dreyfuss? A former acolyte of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist Lyndon Larouche who now writes favorably about Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood for The Nation and other leftist outlets. Indeed, Dreyfuss wrote a glowing review of Max Blumenthal\u2019s disgustingly anti-Israel screed, \u201cGoliath: Life and Loathing in Israel,\u201d for the Middle East Policy Council (formerly the American Arab Affairs Council). That\u2019s the same Goliath the Simon Weisenthal Center included on its list of Top Ten Anti-Semitic/Anti-Israel slurs of 2013 due to its efforts \u201cto equate Israel with Nazis.\u201d Much of Dreyfuss\u2019s work exhibits a comparable concern with Jewish welfare.\u000a\u000aThat journalists like Dreyfuss and publications like Rolling Stone support leftist narratives \u2014 including those that are anti-Jewish \u2014 is disturbing but hardly surprising. They\u2019re leftists, not Jews. Anti-Jewish leftists like Sarsour have demonstrated the political benefits of defaming Jews and Israel to leftist crowds. Rolling Stone is simply following its readership. What is frightening is their purpose: luring the masses of barely affiliated, disaffected, left-leaning American Jews into adopting their overt anti-Israel and anti-Jewish views.\u000a\u000aThese are but a few of the signposts that Jews should attend closely. The Democratic Party has already traveled so far down the anti-Israel path that even pragmatic Democrats with important Jewish constituencies \u2014 Kirsten Gillibrand and Corey Booker come to mind \u2014 have felt compelled to follow. The Iran Deal travesty was not a one-off caused by an anti-Israel president. It was a highly visible marker of where the party has gone \u2014 and is going.\u000a\u000aEven Chuck Schumer \u2014 who fashions himself the \u201cGuardian of Israel,\u201d and who has long relied on the political support of deeply pro-Israel Orthodox Jews \u2014 failed to work against the Iran deal. Instead, he took the lucrative position of voicing his opposition while excusing his colleagues who supported it. How long before the minority \u201cleader\u201d follows his party? Particularly when leftist Jews \u2014 writers like Davidson, publications like the Forward or Mondoweiss, and organizations like J Street and Jewish Voices for Peace \u2014 are urging him to do it?\u000a\u000aThese leftist Jews have made a devastating and dangerous choice. Throughout Jewish history, no group has inflicted greater harm on the Jewish community than Jews who join political movements committed to proving the perfidy of the Jews. We disagree with Alan Dershowitz on most matters of politics and policy, but on this he is correct. And we wonder how much longer he will remain tied to his party \u2014 or tolerated by it. Because, in the end, progressivism cannot tolerate Jews or Israel. Meanwhile, the Forward has indeed moved into despicable territory that should worry every American Jew \u2014 and every American, like Seb Gorka, who sees virtue and strength in Jews and in the Jewish State of Israel.\u000a\u000aThere are indeed groups and people that pose greater dangers to the American Jewish community than Linda Sarsour. Within the United States, nearly all of them are leftists. They are taking over the Democratic Party and the Jewish establishment. And that, more than anything, should worry Jews.\u000a\u000aBruce Abramson is the President of Informationism, Inc., Vice President and Director of Policy at the Iron Dome Alliance, and a Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.

aVGlobal interest in Kiwi-designed anti-aging antioxidant MitoQ has been encouraging, says MitoQ\u2019s chemist chief executive Greg Macpherson.\u000a\u000aGlobal interest in a Kiwi company's anti-ageing drug is ramping up, with three major clinical trials now under way to test it against a range of ailments.\u000a\u000aMitoquinol mesylate, marketed as MitoQ, is a New Zealand owned and developed super-antioxidant that works by penetrating and optimizing the cellular mitochondria, the so-called batteries within our cells.\u000a\u000aIts backers believe the drug holds the potential to increase lifespan by 10 to 15 per cent, while also improving health. Discovered by the University of Otago's Professor Rob Smith and global mitochondria expert Dr. Mike Murphy, of Cambridge University, the drug was launched as a skincare and supplement range in late 2013, and now sells into more than 100 countries.\u000a\u000aAgeing and its associated health issues and lower energy levels is linked to a decline in mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial dysfunction is now known to be associated with more than 200 diseases or conditions.\u000a\u000aVideo \u2013 The Secret behind Mitochondrial Science Revealed In NZ\u000a\u000a"This includes some of the biggest issues affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease and more," said Greg Macpherson, MitoQ's chief executive and the pharmacist who formulated the antioxidant to penetrate mitochondria.\u000a\u000aAs we age, Macpherson said, the levels of antioxidants in our mitochondria deplete reducing their ability to fend off damage caused by free radicals - highly reactive chemicals that have the potential to harm cells in our bodies.\u000a\u000a"Due to this damage our mitochondria decline in function at a rate of around 10 per cent a decade from our early thirties."\u000a\u000aThe MitoQ formulation worked by flooding the mitochondria with antioxidants, improving the level of energy available to a cell and reducing free radical-associated cell damage.\u000a\u000aGot a Health Challenge You Would Like To Beat? Take this quiz and find the solution\u000a\u000a"By improving their function while reducing cell damage, we can slow down the ageing process keeping all of our organs and body healthier and younger for longer."\u000a\u000aMitoQ is currently the subject of a collaborative study with Callaghan Innovation and the University of Auckland, which assesses its effects on blood sugar and cardiovascular health in 20 New Zealand patients.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in the US, University of Colorado researchers are investigating whether it improves physiological function in middle-aged and older adults, and a University of Delaware team is examining its effects on patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.\u000a\u000aInterest in the technology had been boosted by its recent selection for the US Government's National Institute of Aging's\u000a\u000aInterventions Testing Program.\u000a\u000aEach year, a global selection process by two expert panels invites a small number of compounds for testing, with applicants required to demonstrate "significant potential to delay or decelerate the ageing process and improve general health".\u000a\u000aMacpherson said the commercial benefits that came with being picked for the program were enormous.\u000a\u000aBillions of dollars were being poured into mitochondria-targeted anti-ageing therapeutic agents.\u000a\u000aAdvanced CoQ technology revolutionizes U.S. supplements industry\u000a\u000a"We were just lucky enough to be ahead of the curve - and the other big thing we've got is that what we do is quite broad.\u000a\u000a"Should we get proof of life-extension efficacy, then Mitoq.com has a multibillion-dollar market in the states ... so we will have a huge opportunity."\u000a\u000a- NZ Herald

aVMiddle-aged people with risk factors for heart attacks and stroke may be more likely to develop dementia in old age than people with healthy cardiovascular systems, a U.S. study suggests.\u000a\u000aLike previous research, the current study linked so-called vascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, and high blood pressure to higher odds of dementia. However, the study also found an increased risk of dementia for older adults who had only slightly elevated blood pressure in middle age, a condition known as prehypertension.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis study showed associations, but doesn\u2019t prove that treating risk factors actually decreases risk,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Rebecca Gottesman of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat being said, we know that it is important otherwise for your heart and brain health to control obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and to quit smoking,\u201d Gottesman said by email. \u201cIt is likely that controlling these over time is helpful for reducing dementia risk.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe researchers examined data on 15,744 adults living in Maryland, North Carolina, Mississippi and Minnesota.\u000a\u000aAt the start, participants ranged in age from 44 to 66, with an average age of 57.\u000a\u000aRoughly 25 years later, 1,516 people had been diagnosed with dementia, researchers report in JAMA Neurology.\u000a\u000aThe oldest participants were about eight times more likely to develop dementia than the youngest people in the study.\u000a\u000aPeople with a gene, APOE, that\u2019s associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were twice as likely to develop dementia as individuals without this gene.\u000a\u000aSmoking in middle age was associated with 41 percent higher odds of dementia later on, while diabetes was linked to a 77 percent greater risk.\u000a\u000aSo-called prehypertension, when blood pressure is elevated but not high enough to be formally diagnosed as high blood pressure, was tied to a 31 percent higher likelihood of dementia. Full-blown hypertension was associated with 39 percent greater odds of dementia.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove if or how poor cardiovascular health in middle age might contribute to dementia later in life.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that vascular risk factors lead to strokes, which damage the brain and cause cognitive impairment, said Dr. Andrew Budson, chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System and a researcher at Boston University.\u000a\u000aVascular disease might also hasten changes in the brain that contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common type of dementia, Budson, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of these modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes, damage the endothelium - the inside of blood vessel walls - that in time, leads to strokes,\u201d Budson added.\u000a\u000aHealthy blood vessels in middle age may help protect against cognitive decline, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, co-director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center in Kansas City.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese findings underscore the importance of taking action in mid-life to reduce the long-term risk of dementia,\u201d Burns, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000aThis may include quitting smoking or changing diet and exercise habits to reduce the risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, said Hannah Gardener, a neurology researcher at the University of Miami Medical School in Florida who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000aThe American Heart Association recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats, eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry, and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt.\u000a\u000a\u201cPhysical activity and adherence to a healthy diet, like a Mediterranean-style diet, are powerful tools that can help at-risk individuals lose weight, reduce blood pressure and maintain healthy (blood sugar) levels,\u201d Gardener said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cFocusing on these risk factors even before midlife provides patients an opportunity to treat and reverse these risk factors with the goal of reducing their dementia risk before it is too late,\u201d Gardener said.

aVBetsy Duke, a former Federal Reserve official and community banker from Virginia, is likely to become chairwoman of the board of Wells Fargo & Co, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.\u000a\u000aInvestors have agitated for new leadership at the bank's board, as the third largest U.S. lender confronts a sales scandal that has grown beyond millions of unauthorized accounts to harm additional depositors and borrowers.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment.\u000a\u000aDuke became a director in 2015. She was named vice chair last year after the scandal broke and then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf resigned.\u000a\u000aThe Journal reported on Thursday that Stephen Sanger, who took over as chairman in October, will step down by early September, with Duke likely to take over as chairwoman.\u000a\u000aSanger faced a tough shareholder vote this year over the board's stewardship of the company, and has faced calls to step down from some investors.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, investors had told Reuters they wanted Duke to become chairwoman, citing her regulatory and banking experience.\u000a\u000aDuke spent more than three decades as a community banker in Virginia and was a Federal Reserve governor during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. At the Fed, she was a fierce advocate for community banks affected by post-crisis regulations, according to a former colleague there.\u000a\u000aBecause she comes from small-town lenders rather than large Wall Street institutions, Duke has the bona fides of the earnest Main Street banker Wells Fargo had fashioned its image around before the sales scandal erupted, investors, analysts, colleagues and associates told Reuters.\u000a\u000aDuke "has put a lot of leadership and effort into helping us manage a variety of regulatory reform implementations," Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters in an interview last month, adding that she has become "more heavily involved" in those reforms.\u000a\u000aLast Friday, Wells Fargo said it would pay the U.S. government $108 million to settle allegations that it charged military veterans hidden fees to refinance mortgages.\u000a\u000aThe scandal erupted last September when it came to light that bank staff had opened accounts for up to 2.1 million customers without their knowledge.\u000a\u000aRecently, Wells Fargo admitted it may have charged as many as 570,000 auto borrowers for insurance they did not want, potentially leading to 20,000 wrongful repossessions.\u000a\u000aIn its latest quarterly financial report last Friday, the bank said it was examining whether it had caused unnecessary financial harm to customers through mortgage fees, frozen deposit accounts and "add-on" products like identity theft protection.

aVScientists have created gene-edited piglets free of viruses that might cause disease in humans, in a striking breakthrough that could open the door to organ transplants from animals.\u000a\u000aThe experiments, reported on Thursday in the journal Science, may make it possible to transplant livers, hearts, and other organs from pigs into humans, The New York Times reports.\u000a\u000aDr. David Klassen, chief medical officer at the United Network for Organ Sharing, a private, nonprofit organization that manages the nation\u2019s transplant system, said the advance \u201ccould be a real game changer.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbout 33,600 organ transplants occurred last year, with 116,800 patients on waiting lists, according to Klassen, who was not involved in the new study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a big gap between organ supply and organ demand,\u201d he told The Times.\u000a\u000aDr. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard University who led the experiments, said the first pig-to-human transplants could occur within two years.

aVPresident Donald Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric toward North Korea and its leader on Thursday, warning Pyongyang against attacking Guam or U.S. allies after it disclosed plans to fire missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory.\u000a\u000aTrump took specific aim at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying, "He has disrespected our country greatly. He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he's not getting away with it. He got away with it for a long time between him and his family. ... This is a whole new ball game."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's army will complete the plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam, when they will be ready for Kim's order, state-run KCNA news agency said. The plans called for the missiles to land in the sea 30-40 km (18-25 miles) from Guam.\u000a\u000a"I read about, 'We're in Guam by August 15th.' Let's see what he does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody's seen before, what will happen in North Korea," Trump, without offering specifics, told reporters in New Jersey.\u000a\u000a"It's not a dare. It's a statement," Trump said. "He's not going to go around threatening Guam. And he's not going to threaten the United States. And he's not going to threaten Japan. And he's not going to threaten South Korea."\u000a\u000aTension in the region has risen since the reclusive communist country, which staged two nuclear bomb tests last year, launched two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July in defiance of world powers. Trump has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.\u000a\u000aFar from toning down his words after saying on Tuesday that any threats by Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen," Trump said those remarks may have not gone far enough. "Maybe it wasn't tough enough," Trump said.\u000a\u000aTrump's Tuesday comments had unnerved allies in the region and drew criticism from some politicians and foreign policy experts at home as needlessly pugnacious at a time when more measured language would be appropriate.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on a working vacation, Trump also declared the U.S. nuclear arsenal "in tip-top shape, and getting better, and getting stronger."\u000a\u000aAsked if he would consider a pre-emptive strike against North Korea to deny it the ability to launch a nuclear attack against the United States, Trump said, "We'll see what happens."\u000a\u000aTrump during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign complained that key Asian allies such as Japan and South Korea were not paying their fair share of their defense burden and even suggested they might need to develop their own nuclear weapons, a comment that ran counter to decades of U.S. anti-proliferation policy.\u000a\u000aSince taking office, Trump has reaffirmed a commitment to defend those countries against any North Korean threat.\u000a\u000a"If North Korea does anything in terms of even thinking about attack of anybody that we love or we represent or our allies or us, they should be very, very nervous," Trump added.\u000a\u000aThe United States and South Korea remain technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\u000a\u000aTrump also said that new sanctions on North Korea approved by the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 5 that could slash by a third the country's $3 billion annual export revenue probably "will not be as effective as a lot of people think it can be, unfortunately." Trump praised China and Russia for backing the sanctions, but pressed Beijing to do more.\u000a\u000a"I think China can do a lot more, yes. ... And I think China will do a lot more," Trump said.\u000a\u000aTrump said the United States loses a lot of money on trade with China. "It's not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade," Trump added.\u000a\u000aThe tensions between North Korea and the United States spurred a broad market sell-off in U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed with a 1.4 percent loss, marking the biggest one-day drop since May and registering just the third day all year that it closed with a loss of more than 1 percent.\u000a\u000aRISKS GROW\u000a\u000aExperts in the United States and South Korea said North Korea's Guam plans ratcheted up risks significantly, since Washington was likely to view any missile aimed at its territory as a provocation, even if launched as a test.\u000a\u000aIf Pyongyang carries out its threatened show of force and launches missiles toward Guam, it would represent an unprecedented milestone in the already fraught relations between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump said the United States would "always consider negotiations" with Pyongyang, but faulted three of his predecessors, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, on their approach to North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe planned path of North Korea's missiles would cross some of the world's busiest sea and air traffic routes. The North Korean report said the missiles would cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi Prefectures of Japan.\u000a\u000aGuam, a tropical island more than 3,000 km (2,000 miles) to the southeast of North Korea, is home to about 163,000 people and a strategically located U.S. air base, Navy installation that includes a submarine squadron, a Coast Guard group and roughly 6,000 U.S. military service members.\u000a\u000a"Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him," KCNA said, calling Trump's "fire and fury" comment "a load of nonsense."\u000a\u000aFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter rebuked officials in both nations over their threatening language.\u000a\u000a"The harsh rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries, and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the United States and North Korea," Carter said.

aVChina will push on with achieving better results in getting its corporate sector to cut excessive borrowings even though it has made initial progress in lowering debt levels as firms' are still overleveraged, the state planner said on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aPolicymakers have been trying to rein in debt risks and property bubbles amid fears that such problems could derail the world's second-largest economy if not handled properly.\u000a\u000a"We have seen initial results in lowering corporate leverage and debt risks have been effectively controlled," the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on its website.\u000a\u000aBut excessively high leverage ratios of Chinese companies have not been fundamentally reversed, with non-financial Chinese firms' leverage ratios still the highest among the world's top economies, it said.\u000a\u000a"Therefore, we must firmly adhere to the direction of deleveraging, effectively overcome difficulties and achieve greater results in reducing corporate leverage levels," it said.\u000a\u000aThe government will focus on lower debt levels at state-owned enterprises by improving their governance structure, pushing mixed ownership reform, the NDRC said.\u000a\u000aThe state planner did not provide its own data on corporate debt levels, but cited figures from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) that showed China's debt-to-GDP ratio edged up to 257 percent at the end of 2016 from 244.9 percent a year ago.\u000a\u000aOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, the rate of rises in China's debt levels slowed to 1.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter.\u000a\u000aChina will use market-based and legal means including the debt-for-equity scheme to address "zombie companies" by removing various obstacles and promote "euthanasia" of such firms, the NDRC said.\u000a\u000aTotal contract value of China corporate debt-to-equity swaps so far has exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($149.35 billion), it added.\u000a\u000aChina's corporate debt was equivalent to 166.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2016, unchanged from September, the BIS said on its website.

aVSome Americans believe the best way to eat healthy meals is to prepare them at home. In fact, Health Fitness Revolution says the benefits of home-cooked meals include better nutrition, better control of portion sizes, and the confidence of knowing you are using quality ingredients.\u000a\u000aHowever, there may be times when preparing a fresh meal to savor at home is simply not an option. Whether you\u2019re picking up dinner after your child\u2019s soccer practice, ordering lunch with co-workers, or stranded at an airport, your options could be limited to fast food.\u000a\u000aAs Americans become increasingly concerned with their health, many chains have been stepping up their efforts to create more options for everyone. Nowadays, it is easier than ever to find acceptably healthy meals even in the most unlikely of places: a fast-food restaurant.\u000a\u000aAlert: 5 Signs Cancer Is Starting Inside Your Body\u000a\u000aTo compile Newsmax\u2019s list of 10 Healthiest Fast-Food Meals, the nutrition facts, ingredient lists, and sourcing information for many popular fast-food restaurants were thoroughly researched. Meals that have a good balance of protein and carbohydrates, quality ingredients, and limited artificial additives comprise the base criteria for formulating the list. Sodium content and calorie counts factored into the selection process as well.\u000a\u000aThis list is especially handy for New Year's resolution time when most people are looking to make healthier choices.\u000a\u000a1. Chipotle Salad with Sofritas \u2014 Daniel Levine, trends expert and director of The Avant-Guide Institute, tells Food Dive that consumers are focused on fewer processed ingredients, artificial additives, and preservatives. If you need evidence of this trend, check out the long lines you\u2019re sure to find at any Chipotle restaurant during peak business hours.\u000a\u000aSince its humble beginnings, Chipotle has been committed to sourcing quality ingredients. From pasture-raised meats to completely GMO-free ingredients, Chipotle leads the way for sourcing quality ingredients. Most of the menu items contain only easily recognizable, whole-food ingredients prepared on-site daily.\u000a\u000aChipotle has a handy nutrition calculator that shows how your favorite fixings will affect the overall nutrition of your burrito, bowl, or salad. The salad topped with flavorful organic tofu (sofritas), fajita vegetables and black beans for extra fiber, fresh tomato salsa, and guacamole comes in at 550 calories. It has a whopping 24 grams of fiber, 19 grams of protein, and 46 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re watching carbohydrates, skip the black beans and cut the total in half. While the salad does contain almost an entire day\u2019s worth of sodium, the other nutritional attributes combined with the best ingredient quality in the fast-food business make Chipotle a top choice for healthy meals.\u000a\u000a2. Panera Bread Ancient Grain and Arugula Salad with Chicken \u2014 This upscale bakery-caf chain, which includes St. Louis Bread Co., has recently marketed its commitment to eliminating many additives from its menu. This gradual shift to eliminate all artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, and preservatives was completed by the end of 2016. You can download a complete list of the ingredients that Panera Bread eliminated at its website.\u000a\u000aThe restaurants feature a number of relatively healthy options. This 410-calorie salad is featured because it is low in sodium, only 290 milligrams, and has a generous 25 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. Organic grains like farro, barley, and freekeh are combined with zesty arugula, sweet apple and cabbage slaw, and refreshing red grapes. Panera Bread tops the salad with antibiotic-free chicken to make it a complete and satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a3. Elevation Burger single burger with side salad \u2014 This small but growing burger chain began in 2005 with a mission to serve great burgers made of only 100 percent organic, grass-fed beef. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, grass-fed beef is a return to the way beef was traditionally raised, before large-scale beef producers began feeding cattle with low-quality corn. Not only is grass-fed beef naturally lower in calories, but it has a more favorable fat profile and a higher level of healthy omega-3 fatty acids compared to grain-fed beef.\u000a\u000aElevation Burger\u2019s single burger has just 330 calories. It has 23 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates, and about one-quarter of the recommended daily allowance of sodium, just 520 milligrams. Instead of fries, opt for the side salad to get a small dose of greens.\u000a\u000a4. Starbucks Classic Whole-Grain Oatmeal \u2014 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it is also the one most likely to get skipped if you are short on time. It is easy to find breakfast foods at most fast-food restaurants these days, but few of them are nutritious. Coffee giant Starbucks offers a hearty oatmeal that will keep you satisfied until lunch.\u000a\u000aUnlike other fast-food oatmeal, this one contains mostly just rolled and steel-cut oats without the long laundry list of additives and added sugar. When ordered plain, it contains 160 calories with 4 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, 28 grams of carbohydrates, and only 125 milligrams of sodium. For more flavor and some healthy fat, top it with Starbucks\u2019 nut medley and dried fruits toppings.\u000a\u000a5. McDonald's Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich \u2014 This fast-food giant is known for its classic burgers, but it has grown its menu substantially over the years to include many other foods based on changing consumer preferences.\u000a\u000aThe Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich is one of the healthiest options available at McDonald\u2019s in part because of its relatively simple ingredient list. The corporation says it has committed to sourcing only antibiotic-free chicken. The sandwich contains 380 calories, a hefty 37 grams of protein, 44 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, and 960 milligrams of sodium. For a fiber boost and to make it a complete meal, skip the fries but order a side salad instead.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Fix Your Blood Pressure (Do This Every Day)\u000a\u000a6. Subway Rotisserie-Style Chicken Salad \u2014 The Subway chain boasts nearly 45,000 restaurants in 112 countries worldwide, so its \u201csandwich artists\u201d can be found in cities and rural areas alike. While Subway has not taken the same clean food approach to its ingredients as the other chains topping our list, its franchises have plenty of meal options that won\u2019t ruin your diet.\u000a\u000aThis salad features grilled chicken and a customizable array of fresh vegetables. It has just 170 calories, only 4.5 grams of total fat, and 340 milligrams of sodium. It will keep you satisfied with 24 grams of protein and 10 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re adding a salad dressing, the Subway Vinaigrette is your best choice for healthiest salad dressing. Containing 35 calories, 3.5 grams of total fat, and 110 grams of sodium per serving, it is by far lightest option on the menu.\u000a\u000a7. Burger King Veggie Burger \u2014 This vegetarian burger is touted by WebMD as being \u201csurprisingly tasty,\u201d and the Morningstar patty doesn\u2019t taste like a beef substitute. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or not, this is a healthy option if you\u2019re dining at Burger King.\u000a\u000aThe veggie burger is 310 calories if ordered without mayonnaise and has a generous 22 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, 42 grams of carbohydrates but 990 milligrams of sodium. Skip the fries and order a side salad with just a drizzle of salad dressing to make a full meal.\u000a\u000a8. Wendy\u2019s Rich and Meaty Chili and Side Salad \u2014 Wendy\u2019s has made a commitment to providing options to fit the health concerns of all consumers. For example, Wendy\u2019s has an online Meal Builder resource that allows you to customize your meal and preview its nutrition information before you even order.\u000a\u000aOne of the best options for health-conscious eaters at Wendy\u2019s is its chili. A large cup of beef chili is high in protein and low in calories. With 250 calories, 23 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrates, and 5 grams of fiber, the chili is a meal in itself. As is hard to avoid with many fast-food restaurant items, the Rich and Meaty Chili is high in sodium at 1,170 milligrams, and that\u2019s without the crackers or toppings. Pair the chili with a side salad for extra fiber and to make a very satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a9. Taco Bell Fresco Bean Burrito \u2014 For some, this fast-Mexican chain conjures images of late-night taco binges, chalupas, and clever marketing. \u201cMaking a run for the border\u201d doesn\u2019t often come to mind when searching for a wholesome, healthy meal.\u000a\u000aAccording to Taco Bell, it has programs in place to improve the quality of its food ingredients. For example, it is trying to reduce artificial flavors and colors and high-fructose corn syrup in its foods but several items on its menu currently contain these items. If you are looking for a healthier alternative at Taco Bell, try an option from their Fresco menu, with all items containing fewer than 350 calories.\u000a\u000aThe Fresco Bean Burrito is a vegetarian option that has 350 calories, 56 grams of carbohydrates, 13 grams of protein, and 9 grams of fiber but 1,050 milligrams of sodium.\u000a\u000a10. Chick-fil-a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap \u2014 This popular fast-food chain is known for its Southern fried chicken sandwiches, which is not exactly the preferred fare for consumers who are concerned about healthy eating. However, Business Insider points out that the company has made an effort to add a few menu items, such as this light chicken wrap, to cater to this group.\u000a\u000aAccording to Chick-fil-a, the chicken that the company sources is conventionally raised, which means it is not free-range, pastured, or organic. The company\u2019s available information does not specifically mention any initiatives to reduce additives in its prepared foods. However, the Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap does have some favorable nutrition attributes if responsible food sourcing is not your top priority. It totals only 340 calories with a hefty 36 grams of protein, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 15 grams of fiber, and 900 milligrams of sodium. Because the Cool Wrap is relatively low in calories, you might want to add a side for a more substantial meal. Instead of the waffle fries, try the side salad or any of the restaurant\u2019s other healthier sides.\u000a\u000aSpecial: If You Collect Social Security, Please Read This Critical Information . . .\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy , to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday approved Celgene Corp and Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc's oral treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a rare genetic mutation.\u000a\u000aThe drug, Idhifa, will have a monthly list price of $24,872, Celgene said in an email, noting that the median time on therapy for patients was 4.3 months in the trial to secure the FDA's approval.\u000a\u000aThe list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Their 'out-of-pocket' cost is based on their individual healthcare insurance plans and duration of treatment.\u000a\u000aAML is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow and progresses rapidly, resulting in an abnormal increase in white blood cells. It is generally diagnosed in older people, and is uncommon before the age of 45.\u000a\u000aThe drug secured approval for relapsed or refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation. It is to be used along with a diagnostic test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, designed to detect the mutation.\u000a\u000a"While the product isn't expected to be a big needle mover for Celgene, it does represent the first approval for a partnered product," J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said, pointing out that the drug targeted "an area of clear high unmet need."\u000a\u000aNovartis AG's recently approved AML drug, Rydapt, has a list price of $7,495 for a 14-day treatment duration and $14,990 for a 28-day duration.\u000a\u000aHowever, Novartis' treatment is approved for newly diagnosed patients with AML carrying a specific genetic mutation called FLT3.\u000a\u000aIdhifa's approval comes with a boxed warning \u2014 the strongest mandated by the FDA \u2014 designed to call attention to the risk of differentiation syndrome, an adverse reaction that could be fatal if untreated.\u000a\u000aDifferentiation syndrome is characterized by fever, respiratory distress and multi-organ dysfunction.\u000a\u000aIdhifa is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with an IDH2 mutation, a group that accounts for 8 to 19 percent of all AML patients. In the United States, that translates to about 1,200 to 1,500 patients, Celgene said.\u000a\u000aOppenheimer's Leah Rush Cann said in a client note that the drug could generate sales of $1.4 billion in 2021.\u000a\u000aAbout 21,380 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in 2017 and some 10,590 patients will succumb to the disease this year, according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.

aVPresident Donald Trump backed an immigration bill that would both stunt economic growth and reduce jobs in the U.S. by over 1 million, according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school.\u000a\u000aIn ten years, the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy, or RAISE Act, would reduce growth by .7 percent and eliminate 1.3 million jobs, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.\u000a\u000a"The domestic worker participation rate won't increase enough to fill the jobs that would have been held by immigrants who are no longer allowed in the country," the report reads.\u000a\u000aSens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga., introduced the bill, which CNBC reports is expected to reduce legal immigration by half. It would place job skills and other abilities ahead of family connections for those looking to obtain permanent legal residency.\u000a\u000aThe two wrote an op-ed in USA Today Tuesday defending their bill, arguing that it will improve the economy, as it will "reduce our annual immigration levels by half after ten years and reorient it toward high-skilled workers, which is just what our economy needs."\u000a\u000aCotton's communications director Caroline Rabbitt told CNBC that the study "misses nearly half of all green cards," and that "this gross undercounting of green cards is an understandable mistake for people new to immigration, but it's embarrassing for purported 'experts' and shows that their projections are unreliable."

Someone has to do it."\u000a\u000aTrump also warned if Kim followed through on plans to strike Guam, the U.S. response "will be an event the likes of which nobody's seen before.\u000a\u000a"It's not a dare," the president said. "It's a statement."\u000a\u000aRice told Blitzer she was concerned about whether the Trump administration was moving toward "preventative war or preemptive war."\u000a\u000aStory continues below video:\u000a\u000aSusan Rice: A preemptive attack by the US on North Korea would be a poor and dangerous choice https://t.co/7ealp6OUfB \u2014 The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) August 10, 2017\u000a\u000a"Deterrents makes good sense," she said. "It is very essential for us to maintain \u2014 and we don't ever take off of the table the threat of the use of force.\u000a\u000a"But preemptive war, if one was thinking of executing that would be catastrophic for the Korean peninsula," Rice said.\u000a\u000aShe noted more than 200,000 Americans lived in the region and that 26 million people reside in Seoul, the South Korean capital.\u000a\u000a"A preemptive attack is not a good idea," she said.\u000a\u000aMoving forward, "we need to be very measured, careful, and planned in our rhetoric," Rice told Blitzer.\u000a\u000a"I hope we will see more pressure out of the president as he is approaching this challenge."\u000a\u000aBut if Pyongyang does attack Guam, "I have confidence that we have responses that are proportionate to the problem," Rice said.\u000a\u000a"The American people need know that we have and continue to refine advanced missile-defense capabilities to protect our allies and our homeland.\u000a\u000a"We're in a position to respond and to defend ourselves."

aVThe following is an excerpt from 7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less.\u000a\u000aI have a well-deserved reputation as a cheapskate. I brown bag my lunches most days, keep my thermostat at 79 degrees, and \u2014 if my wife doesn\u2019t intervene \u2014 I\u2019ll generally wear my clothes until they\u2019re moth-eaten and threadbare. I\u2019m good with that. As Benjamin Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.\u000a\u000aPerhaps not shockingly, I take the same approach in my investing. I like cheap stocks and, specifically, cheap dividend stocks. I like getting paid in cold, hard cash, after all.\u000a\u000aNow, as a general rule, price and value are two very different things. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) trades for well over $150 per share. But considering it trades for just 14 times estimated 2017 earnings, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s one of a handful of truly cheap dividend stocks to buy in an otherwise expensive market. At the same time, Snap Inc (SNAP) trades for less than $13 per share, barely half its IPO price \u2026 yet I\u2019d argue that the profitless piece of junk is still too expensive.\u000a\u000aBut sometimes a stock that has a cheap share price really is a cheap stock. And today, we\u2019re going to take a look at seven cheap dividend stocks to buy, all of which are trading for less than $20 per share. With a hundred dollar bill, you could buy at least five shares of any of these and still have cash left over.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll start with American auto giant Ford Motor Company (F). Like poor old Rodney Dangerfield, Ford gets no respect these days. The stock trades at a pathetic $11 per share, which amounts to just seven times earnings and 0.29 times sales.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not just cheap \u2014 that\u2019s going-out-of-business cheap. Yet Ford today is, ironically, in its best financial health in decades. Yes, sales are down this year, and estimates have been consistently pushed lower. But you have to remember that last year was a record year and that some sort of pause was inevitable.\u000a\u000aAnd for crying out loud, Ford\u2019s sales are hardly in the dumpster. Sure, unit sales were down 7.5% last month. But this was driven mostly by a drop in lower-margin sedan sales. Higher-margin SUV sales were actually higher for the month. And analysts are still expecting total industry sales to top 17 million for full-year 2017. That\u2019s slightly lower than last year\u2019s number, but very much in line with the boom years the mid-2000s.\u000a\u000aFord yields and attractive 5.4% at current prices, making it one of the cheapest dividend stocks to buy today.\u000a\u000aTo read the full article see 7 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy for $20 or Less.\u000a\u000aDisclosures: Long AAPL, F.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: This material is provided for informational purposes only, as of the date hereof, and is subject to change without notice.

aVGolf lovers might imagine a wonderful trip surrounding the greens, but it takes some planning for the perfect golf getaway. That assures a fun vacation as well as plenty of golf without any drama.\u000a\u000aJust like golfers have intentions for their game, it takes the same kind of thinking to plan an enjoyable golf trip. The destination, wishes, and accommodations should match the desires of everyone in the group.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's Your Favorite Golfer? Vote Now\u000a\u000aThese seven tips to planning the perfect golf getaway will help in making your trip memorable for a long time:\u000a\u000a1. Find a place \u2014 There are popular golf courses in Florida, South Carolina, California, and many other areas. Or choose from clubs in Scotland, England, Australia, and other locations. Research courses online to find the best destination for you and your group, according to Matt Adams at GolfAdvisor.\u000a\u000a\u200b2. Choose your partners \u2014 Whether it\u2019s one other person or a group, make sure all parties have the same goals. Their intentions might include a balance between serious competition and a social occasion for a round of fun golf.\u000a\u000a3. Schedule properly \u2014 Planning for several events in an unfamiliar area might not work out, so be realistic when setting goals over the days. Also, be prepared for planning that doesn\u2019t work out. Plan for sightseeing days in case time off is needed because of stiffness or unexpected injuries.\u000a\u000a4. Reserve early \u2014 The best tee times might need scheduling months in advance, Golf.com points out. You also get better deals on airfare or accommodations by planning early.\u000a\u000aPOLL:\u000a\u000aTiger or Jack? Who Is Better? Vote Now\u000a\u000a\u200b5. Affordable stay \u2014 If your plans include a large group, such as two foursomes, chipping in for a golf villa could be cheaper than several hotel rooms. It also makes for a nice home away from home.\u000a\u000a6. Choose leaders \u2014 Maybe an experienced golf traveler could handle arrangements and take charge of the trip. Another idea is to have two leaders, Kris Hart explains in Nextgengolf. One person might handle the travel and golf days while another takes care of dining and entertainment.\u000a\u000a\u200b\u200b7. Onsite lodging \u2014 Some golf resorts are right near the course to make scheduling a lot easier. If you choose such a resort, you might find other deals or perks, such as free breakfast. Look at all the fees involved when choosing a golf package.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVLegendary rocker Ted Nugent on Monday blasted the "goofball" in the Michigan Republican Party who started the rumor Kid Rock was going to run for the U.S. Senate.\u000a\u000a"Somebody write this down \u2014 Kid Rock ain't running for squat," Nugent told J.D. Hayworth on Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aNugent put to rest any notion Bob Ritchie \u2014 a.k.a Kid Rock \u2014 was going to run against Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the Democrat up for re-election in 2018.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"Some goofball in the Michigan GOP just pulled it out of their ass and said, 'What about Kid Rock?'"\u000a\u000aRitchie "would make a much-improved representative in Michigan and elsewhere . . . but that the GOP and the media continue to milk this nonsense is one of the most embarrassing chapters for the Republican party," Nugent said.\u000a\u000a"They should probably stop and focus their resources on someone who can beat the Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi-wannabe, Debbie Stabenow," Nugent said. "She's bad for Michigan, she's bad for America, and the Republican party better get somebody in there who can be a status-quo crusher like Donald Trump."\u000a\u000aNugent also took umbrage with the notion Michigan, where he was born, is traditionally a blue state.\u000a\u000a"There's no blue states in the nation; there's only high-crime, Democrat-run, blue smudges," Nugent told Hayworth.\u000a\u000a"Every state is a red state. The red states make this country tick. They make this country great. They're not blue states; they're red states with a bunch of manipulative high-crime blue Democrat smudges that we've got to fix ASAP."\u000a\u000aHayworth asked Nugent if he would consider a run at the Senate, something the owner of four platinum records in the U.S. said he has considered.\u000a\u000a"I've given it thought over the years because I love this country," Nugent said. "I've traveled all over the world, and I've gotta tell ya, the whole world sucks, but America still sucks less. And we're on the road to de-sucking because of the great turn of events" that put President Donald Trump in the White House.\u000a\u000a"At this time I have no plans to run for public office," said Nugent, who added he would not say no if he were called by the people of Michigan or Texas, where he currently resides.

aVCNN cut ties Thursday with conservative commentator Jeffrey Lord after he tweeted a Nazi salute at a critic.\u000a\u000aA network spokesperson confirmed that Lord was no longer with the network and said "Nazi salutes are indefensible." The statement came hours after Lord tweeted the Nazi slogan "Sieg Heil!" at the head of a liberal advocacy group, Media Matters for America.\u000a\u000aRetained by CNN in August 2015, Lord was an indefatigable on-air supporter of Donald Trump throughout his candidacy and since his election. A contributor to the conservative magazine The American Spectator, Lord is a former aide to Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan.\u000a\u000aHe had repeatedly clashed with Media Matters president Angelo Carusone, whose group condemned CNN for employing him as a commentator\u000a\u000aFollowing a harsh exchange of tweets with Carusone earlier this week, Lord posted an article for The American Spectator on Thursday morning, calling Carusone's group the "Media Matters Fascists" and casting them as "anti-free speech bigots who, in typical fascist style, make it their mission to shut down speech they don't like."\u000a\u000aDuring the day, the Twitter sparring resumed, with Lord finally responding to Carusone with the tweet: "Sieg Heil!"\u000a\u000aIn subsequent tweets, he insisted he meant to be "mocking Nazis and Fascists."\u000a\u000aBut refusing to back down to a Twitter firestorm, he posted, "Why would I delete something that mocks the Fascists at Media Matters Fascists?"\u000a\u000aHis defiant tweet in his firing's aftermath: "LOL!"\u000a\u000aDuring his presence on CNN's airwaves Lord had frequently riled CNN hosts including Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, fellow commentators, and viewers with many of his statements. During Super Tuesday election night coverage in March 2016, he argued that the KKK was a left-wing organization because of Democrats' support of it many decades before. In April, he called President Donald Trump the "Martin Luther King" of health care.\u000a\u000aAn email message sent to Lord was not immediately returned.

aVWhy do some option trades win or lose?\u000a\u000aAn Austin based trading education firm just released the results of an option trading case study. Starting in January, 2017, John Carter of Simpler Trading placed real-money trades in his account. To date, these positions generated over 98% returns on individual stock options.\u000a\u000aSome were surprised that the rapid account growth did not rely on the market hitting new all-time highs. In fact, John selected stocks that moved independently from the broad market.\u000a\u000aAre you an active stock or option trader? Then you know how frustrating it can be when you\u2019re correct about a stock\u2019s direction but still lose on the trade. According to John Carter\u2019s case study, careful option strategy selection can improve odds of profitability.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the odds of consistent returns and rapid growth may be increased when low probability setups are filtered out. Because of how the value of an option fluctuates, John Carter strives to identify special situations when a greater than expected move is probable.\u000a\u000aJohn Carter has more than 25 years trading experience and has authored several books on his methods.

We're used to this nation that is more Stalinist than Josef Stalin, the Soviet Union ever was. But we're saddened," Gorka told Cosby.\u000a\u000a"Think about the significance of this. This is the most significant, largest sanctions package the international community has ever levied against North Korea.... [It] sends a very clear message, even Russia, even China, we have had enough. You are a menace and you are a great threat to international security."\u000a\u000aGorka, a counterinsurgency and counterterrorism expert and the author of "Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War," added: "Now it is up to Pyongyang to send a clear message that they understand they are going to stand down from their provocation and their escalatory behavior."

aVWhen it comes to the holiday season, some towns pull out all the stops for Christmas celebrations. From parades to elaborate Nativity scenes to Old World shopping markets and visits with Santa Claus, these are the top 25 cities and towns across America to gas up the car and visit this December.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list of Newsmax\u2019s Top 25 Christmas Destinations in America, we specifically chose towns that celebrate the Nativity as part of their holiday celebrations, as well as places that offer a range of events and lodging options.\u000a\u000a1. Leavenworth, Washington \u2014 When winter arrives, the charming Bavarian village of Leavenworth, Washington, transforms into \u201cChristmas Town, USA.\u201d With more than a half-million LED lights strung throughout the town, Leavenworth sparkles during the first three weekends of December when more than 25,000 visitors descend upon the town (with a year-round population of just 1,900) for sleigh rides, sledding, caroling, chestnuts, and spiced wine. Don't leave before dark. The Christmas lights turn on at dusk after the town sings \u201cSilent Night\u201d together in the village center, followed by a live Nativity presentation. Leavenworth also celebrates with a weekend-long Christmas market.\u000a\u000aTell Us: What Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a2. Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \u2014 Christened "Bethlehem" on Christmas Eve in 1741 when missionary Count Zinzendorf of Saxony, Germany, visited a two-room log home that housed both people and animals, today this eastern Pennsylvania town goes all out for the birth of Jesus.

In the style of a traditional German Christmas market, it is held over three weekends in December and features more than 125 artisans and craftspeople selling everything from handmade pottery to jewelry inside heated tents.

During the Nativity story, for instance, visitors watch as blinking lights and voice narration booming from invisible speakers tell the story of the birth of Christ.\u000a\u000a16. Zoar, Ohio \u2014 Take a road trip to Zoar, located around 40 miles south of Akron, to experience an old-fashioned Christmas complete with walking tours that trace the historic village's history back to 1817 when a group of 200 German separatists sought refuge from religious persecution in their homeland. Today, the tiny town (population 169) has been meticulously preserved or recreated, and visitors can shop for unique Christmas presents by local artisans in fully operating traditional blacksmith and tinsmith shops.\u000a\u000a17.

The high point of the festivities is the Dickens and Friends Dinner at the Mirbeau Inn and Spa, where guests enjoy a performance of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d in their midst.\u000a\u000a22. Santa Fe, New Mexico \u2014 Santa Fe is a beautiful destination to spend the holiday season. The city offers dozens of unique events in the month leading up to Christmas that are closely tied to its centuries of diversity, history, and culture.

Nativity scenes can be seen in hotels and many of the northern New Mexico city's beautiful churches. The most famous event, however, is the world famous Canyon Road Christmas Eve Farolito Walk that draws up to 40,000 visitors on the night before Christmas alone. Another popular event in Santa Fe is \u201cLas Posadas,\u201d a centuries-old tradition stemming from the city\u2019s Spanish influence; the one-night event winds its way through downtown Santa Fe as a re-creation of Mary and Joseph\u2019s fateful search for accommodations.\u000a\u000a23.

aVPresident Donald Trump said Thursday the opioid crisis was "a national emergency" and pledged "to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money" battling the epidemic.\u000a\u000a"The opioid crisis is an emergency \u2014 and I'm saying officially right now it's an emergency," Trump told reporters outside his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., as Vice President Mike Pence looked on. "It's a national emergency.\u000a\u000a"We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.\u000a\u000a"We're going to draw it up \u2014 and we're going to make it a national emergency," Trump said. "It is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had."\u000a\u000aTrump held a briefing Tuesday on the crisis in Bedminster, vowing to "fight this deadly epidemic \u2014 and the United States will win."\u000a\u000aThe president's drug commission, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, recently called on him to declare a national emergency to deal with the opioid crisis.\u000a\u000aAn initial report from the commission said that the approximately 142 deaths each day from drug overdoses mean the death toll was "equal to Sept. 11 every three weeks."\u000a\u000aThe White House said it was still reviewing the report's recommendations in the report.\u000a\u000aHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said after the briefing the administration could deploy the necessary resources and attention without declaring a national emergency, though he stressed that "all things are on the table for the president."\u000a\u000aIn his comments to reporters Thursday, Trump likened the opioid crisis to that involving LSD in the 1970s.\u000a\u000a"When I was growing up, they had LSD \u2014 and they had certain generations of drugs," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"There's never been anything like what's happened to this country over the last four or five years."\u000a\u000aHe added opioids are "a worldwide problem, not just a United States problem.\u000a\u000a"This is happening worldwide," he said. "But this is a national emergency \u2014 and we are drawing documents now to so attest."

"And with me, he's not getting away with it.\u000a\u000a"He got away with it for a long time between him and his family. ... This is a whole new ball game."\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's army will complete the plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam, when they will be ready for Kim's order.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Pacific territory is 2,131 miles southeast of North Korea.\u000a\u000aPyongyang's plans call for the missiles to land in the sea within 25 miles from Guam.

aVCostco is being sued after reportedly tainted chicken salad sold to a Utah family made a 20-year-old woman fall critically ill. She is still feeling its effects almost two years later.\u000a\u000aChloe Rodgerson of Highland was one of 19 people taking legal action against Costco for contracting E. coli poisoning after ingesting chicken salad in 2015, Fox News reported.\u000a\u000aShe was put in ICU at the end of October 2015 after vomiting blood.\u000a\u000a\u201c"They were checking me for lupus, they were checking me for Crohn's disease, or a combination of a bunch of different diseases.

She had to eventually undergo kidney transplant and continues to have various health problems stemming from contracting E. coli, Fox News said.\u000a\u000aBusiness Insider reported that Rodgerson has since filed a $2 million lawsuit against Costco in hopes of making up some of the financial losses incurred in hospital bills over the past two years.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t have $2 million and I\u2019m not going to have sufficient resources to keep myself alive going forward in the future," Rodgerson told Fox News on her decision to sue.\u000a\u000aCostco hasn\u2019t commented though both Fox News and Business Insider reached out to it.\u000a\u000aComment, however, is never far away with the social media around.

The victory followed a fierce and highly publicized election in which Trump was scrutinized heavily by the media. Trump\u2019s victory sparked protests \u2014 some violent \u2014 across the country. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)\u000a\u000aHillary\u2019s emails: Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign was haunted by the FBI's investigation into the former secretary of state's private email server. But the probe came to a close over the summer, when Director James Comey announced the agency would not be recommending criminal charges for Clinton. The case was briefly reopened just days before the election when new emails were discovered in the course of the FBI's investigation into former Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is married to Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Again, no criminal charges were recommended.

The most deadly included three simultaneous bombings in Brussels, Belgium (35 killed); a shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Florida, (50 killed); a bus that plowed into a parade in Nice, France (80+ killed); and a truck that ran through a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany (12 killed).

aVU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson told a Chicago radio show he thought John McCain's brain tumor may have affected his Obamacare vote on July 28, CNN reported, a no vote which ended Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aMcCain's vote, along with those of fellow Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 along with Senate Democrats \u2013 sank the so called "skinny repeal," the Senate's last ditch effort to get rid of the ACA, the New York Post noted.\u000a\u000aMcCain had returned to the U.S. Senate after surgery to remove a blood clot over an eye and after he learned he had brain cancer, CNN said.\u000a\u000a"We did get a call from (Speaker of the House) Paul (Ryan) and he assured us that skinny repeal was not going to pass the House it would have to go to conference," Wisconsin\u2019s Johnson told WIND-AM "Chicago's Morning Answer" radio show on Tuesday, per CNN.\u000a\u000a"Again, I'm not gonna speak for John McCain \u2013 he has a brain tumor right now \u2013 that vote occurred at 1:30 in the morning, some of that might have factored in," Johnson said.\u000a\u000aWhen pushed by a radio host to explain his comments, Johnson attempted to clarify, CNN said.\u000a\u000a"Again, I don't know exactly what \u2013 we really thought \u2013 and again I don't want speak for any senator," Johnson said. "I really thought John was going to vote yes to send that to conference at 10:30 at night. By about 1, 1:30, he voted no. So you have talk to John in terms what was on his mind."\u000a\u000aThat triggered a response from Julie Tarallo, McCain's spokesman, who said McCain was firm in his reasons in voting against the skinny repeal, CNN said.\u000a\u000a"It is bizarre and deeply unfortunate that Sen. Johnson would question the judgment of a colleague and friend," Tarallo told CNN. "Sen. McCain has been very open and clear about the reasons for his vote."\u000a\u000aKNOW-TV said Johnson attempted to clear the air on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he was disappointed that he "didn't more eloquently express (his) sympathy for what Sen. McCain" was experiencing. "I have nothing but respect for him and the vote came at the end of a long day for everyone."\u000a\u000aMcCain told a Phoenix talk radio show last week that he was "feeling good" after starting treatment for his brain cancer and promised to return to the Senate for work in September, Politico reported.

aVA threatened lawsuit from illegal immigrant Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno, 33, for \u201cwrongful arrest\u201d has compelled local officials to pay him $190,000. This appalling decision gives the words of acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas D. Homan, deeper resonance:\u000a\u000a\u201cSanctuary cities, in my opinion, are un-American. \u2026 They're a sanctuary city, they're proud of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAh, San Francisco, represented by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aRecall, her stomping grounds were made infamous by the July 1, 2015, slaying of 32-year-old Kate Steinle. Walking along Pier 14 with her father, Ms. Steinle was struck in the back by a ricocheting bullet from a stolen gun in the hands of an illegal immigrant, Juan Francisco Lpez-Snchez: a felon with 7 convictions and 5 deportations.\u000a\u000aLpez-Snchez had been in the custody of the San Francisco Sheriff on drug charges when ICE issued a detainer for him. Instead of turning him over as federal law demanded, this convicted criminal was set free \u2014 and an innocent lost her life.\u000a\u000aOver two years later, things have evolved from the tragic to the farcical.\u000a\u000aToday, San Francisco is apparently so \u201cproud\u201d of their ongoing sanctuary status, they're paying Seor Figueroa-Zarceno six figures for not living up to their federal law-violating \u201cprinciples\u201d! For context, back in December 2015, Figueroa-Zarceno informed police about his stolen vehicle. That caused them to become aware of his DUI conviction and an order for deportation to his home country of El Salvador. Reporting the theft of his vehicle led to his arrest and two month incarceration. Yet, given San Francisco\u2019s sanctuary policies, this outcome was illegal. Per the 1989 \u201cCity and County of Refuge\u201d Ordinance (also known as the Sanctuary Ordinance):\u000a\u000a\u201cCity employees [are prohibited] from using City funds or resources to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.\u201d\u000a\u000aHence, for complying with federal law \u2014 that importantly supersedes local statutes \u2014 San Francisco obliged itself to pay Figueroa-Zarceno from the taxpayer till. What's more absurd: that this two-faced \u201cvictim\u201d claims \u201cwhat happened to [him] was very unfair and it was an injustice,\u201d or cutting him a large government check for his \u201cinconvenience\u201d? Indeed, this outrageous settlement illustrates the schizophrenic nature of sanctuary policies for law enforcement. Which do they honor? The conflicting city policy or the federal mandate? Siding with the former means releasing often violent offenders or risking similar payouts.\u000a\u000aHypocritical Democrats falsely justify sanctuary cities by advocating the straw man argument of \u201ctolerance and multiculturalism.\u201d In truth, Democrats promote these lawless enclaves \u2014 populated by illegal immigrants and criminals \u2014 precisely because these same illegitimate groups overwhelmingly support them politically. Progressives shield these lawbreaking foreigners because their political prospects are tied to them.\u000a\u000aFor this safely ensconced ruling elite, what do they care about perpetuating a dangerous environment? Another Democratic-run city \u2014 like America's murder capital, Chicago \u2014 leaps to mind. Former Obama flunky Rahm Emanuel parrots, \u201cWe want you to come to Chicago if you believe in the American dream.\u201d What of the unrealized dreams of the 423 fatalities \u2014 recorded there in 2017, so far \u2014 Mister Mayor? What of this unending nightmare Democrats universally condone, and encourage? Undocumented aliens hide in plain sight while citizens cower from shadowy, un-American threats to life and limb.\u000a\u000aThis discrepancy is most clearly seen in San Francisco's disbursement of money to \u201cinjured\u201d parties. While illegal Figueroa-Zarceno will be quickly paid for his trouble, last January U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero dismissed the wrongful death suit filed against San Francisco, and then-Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, by Kate Steinle's family. (The lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management \u2014 the source of the Lpez-Snchez's stolen firearm from an agent's car \u2014 is proceeding.) In essence, city leaders have negated a citizen's constitutional rights, Kate's, while championing the \u201crights\u201d of a foreign squatter? What an Orwellian result! In the final analysis, which group demonstrates more contempt for America? Liberals who run San Francisco or illegal immigrants who inhabit it?\u000a\u000aDavid L.

aVGerman biotech group Morphosys expects to receive royalties for its psoriasis drug guselkumab for five months this year, its Chief Executive Simon Moroney said, after its licensee received U.S. regulatory approval.\u000a\u000a"We hope to be able to say in the near future how much the royalties will amount to," Moroney told Reuters.\u000a\u000aLicensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Tremfya, or guselkumab, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\u000a\u000aThat brings Morophosys a step closer to launching its first antibody drug on to the market, pushing its shares as much as 9 percent higher on Friday.\u000a\u000a"While it was largely expected, this approval marks a turning point in Morphosys' story as it prepares to receive its first royalty stream," Berenberg analysts, who recommend buying shares in Morphosys, said in a note.\u000a\u000aThey see the drug taking 15 percent of the U.S. market for moderate to severe psoriasis at the expense of Janssen's existing Stelara, of Novartis's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's Taltz.\u000a\u000aMorphosys has so far not yet said how much Janssen would owe it in royalties, noting only that payments would likely come to a medium single-digit percentage of sales.\u000a\u000aBerenberg's analysts estimate that guselkumab could reach peak annual sales of about 3.2 billion euros ($3.65 billion) eventually, which would mean royalties of up to 185 million.\u000a\u000aMorphosys' stock rose about 9 percent in early trade on Friday and was up 8 percent at 67.41 euros by 1025 GMT, hitting its highest level in almost two years.\u000a\u000aAccording to CEO Moroney, royalties are not yet included in Morphosys 2017 guidance.\u000a\u000aThe group has so far said it expected its loss before interest and tax to widen to between 75 million and 85 million euros this year from about 60 million in 2016 as its costs for research and development rise.\u000a\u000aMorphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer.

aVFormer National Security Adviser Susan Rice acknowledged Thursday that three previous administrations "failed" in stopping North Korea's nuclear ambitions, as President Donald Trump asserted in his stepped-up rhetoric against the regime.\u000a\u000a"That's a very unfortunate outcome," Rice, who also served as United Nations ambassador under former President Barack Obama, told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in an interview from Park City, Utah.\u000a\u000a"You can call it a failure," she said. "I accept that characterization over the last two decades.\u000a\u000a"But we are where we are. And we now need to decide how to proceed."\u000a\u000aPresident Trump told reporters Thursday in Bedminster, N.J., he was open to talking with dictator Kim Jong Un, but "they have been negotiating for 25 years."\u000a\u000a"Look at Clinton," he said, referring to President Bill Clinton. "He folded.\u000a\u000a"He was weak and ineffective."\u000a\u000aAfter noting President George W. Bush was also not successful, Trump said "Obama didn't even want to talk about it.\u000a\u000a"But I talk," the president said. "It's about time. Someone has to do it."\u000a\u000aTrump also warned if Kim followed through on plans to strike Guam, the U.S. response "will be an event the likes of which nobody's seen before.\u000a\u000a"It's not a dare," the president said. "It's a statement."\u000a\u000aRice told Blitzer she was concerned about whether the Trump administration was moving toward "preventative war or pre-emptive war."\u000a\u000aStory continues below video.\u000a\u000aSusan Rice: A preemptive attack by the US on North Korea would be a poor and dangerous choice https://t.co/7ealp6OUfB \u2014 The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) August 10, 2017\u000a\u000a"Deterrents makes good sense," she said. "It is very essential for us to maintain \u2014 and we don't ever take off of the table the threat of the use of force.\u000a\u000a"But preemptive war, if one was thinking of executing that would be catastrophic for the Korean peninsula," Rice said.\u000a\u000aShe noted more than 200,000 Americans lived in the region and that 26 million people reside in Seoul, the South Korean capital.\u000a\u000a"A preemptive attack is not a good idea," she said.\u000a\u000aMoving forward, "we need to be very measured, careful, and planned in our rhetoric," Rice told Blitzer.\u000a\u000a"I hope we will see more pressure out of the president as he is approaching this challenge."\u000a\u000aBut if Pyongyang does attack Guam, "I have confidence that we have responses that are proportionate to the problem," Rice said.\u000a\u000a"The American people need know that we have and continue to refine advanced missile-defense capabilities to protect our allies and our homeland.\u000a\u000a"We're in a position to respond and to defend ourselves."

aVThat the Trump presidency is bedeviled is undeniable.\u000a\u000aAs President Donald Trump flew off for August at his Jersey club, there came word that Special Counsel Robert Mueller III had impaneled a grand jury and subpoenas were going out to Trump family and campaign associates.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe jurors will be drawn from a pool of citizens in a city Hillary Clinton swept with 91 percent of the vote. Trump got 4 percent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhatever indictments Mueller wants, Mueller gets.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks to a media that savages him ceaselessly, Trump is down to 33 percent approval in a Quinnipiac University poll and below 40 percent in most of the rest.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBefore Trump departed D.C., The Washington Post ran transcripts of his phone conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEven Obama administration veterans were stunned.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, it is time to ask: If this city brings Trump down, will the rest of America rejoice?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat will be the reaction out there in fly-over country, that land where the "deplorables" dwell who produce the soldiers to fight our wars? Will they toast the "free press" that brought down the president they elected, and in whom they had placed so much hope?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy guess: The reaction will be one of bitterness, cynicism, despair, a sense that the fix is in, that no matter what we do, they will not let us win. If Trump is brought down, American democracy will take a pasting. It will be seen as a fraud. And the backlash will poison our politics to where only an attack from abroad, like 9/11, will reunite us.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOur media preen and posture as the defenders of democracy, devoted to truth, who provide us round-the-clock protection from tyranny. But half the nation already sees the media as a propaganda arm of a liberal establishment that the people have rejected time and again.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aConsider the Post's publication of the transcripts of Trump's calls with Mexico's president and Australia's prime minister.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen reporter Greg Miller got these transcripts, his editors, knowing they would damage Trump, plastered them on Page 1.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Post was letting itself be used by a leaker engaged in disloyal and possibly criminal misconduct. Yet the Post agreed to provide confidentiality and to hide the Trump-hater's identity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is what we do, says the Post. People have a right to know if President Trump says one thing at rallies about Mexico paying for the wall and another to the president of Mexico. This is a story.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut there is a far larger story here, of which this Post piece is but an exhibit. It is the story of a concerted campaign, in which the anti-Trump media publish leaks, even criminal leaks, out of the FBI, CIA, NSA and NSC, to bring down a president whom the Beltway media and their deep-state collaborators both despise and wish to destroy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDid Trump collude with Putin to defeat Clinton, the Beltway media demand to know, even as they daily collude with deep-state criminals to bring down the president of the United States.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd if there is an unfolding silent coup by the regime Americans repudiated in 2016 \u2014 to use security leaks and the lethal weapon of a special counsel to overturn the election results \u2014 is that not a story worth covering as much as what Trump said to Pena Nieto?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDo the people not have a right know who are the snakes collaborating with the Never-Trump press to bring down their head of state? Is not discovering the identities of deep-state felons a story that investigative reporters should be all over?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf Greg Miller is obligated to protect his source, fine. But why are other journalists not exposing his identity?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe answer suggests itself. This is a collaborative enterprise, where everyone protects everyone else's sources, because all have the same goal: the dumping of Trump. If that requires collusion with criminals, so be it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department is now running down the leaks, and the ACLU's Ben Wizner is apoplectic: "Every American should be concerned about the Trump administration's threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists. A crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThat's one way to put it. Another is that some of these "whistleblowers" are political criminals who reject the verdict of the American electorate in 2016 and are out to overturn it. And the aforementioned "journalists" are their enablers and collaborators.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd if, as Wizner's asserts, protecting secrets is tantamount to a "crackdown on the free press and democracy," no wonder the free press and democracy are falling into disrepute all over the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBy colluding, the mainstream media, deep state, and the special prosecutor's button men, with a license to roam, may bring down yet another president. So doing, they will validate John Adams's insight:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPatrick Buchanan has been an adviser to three presidents, a two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000.

aVPresident Donald Trump said Thursday the opioid crisis was "a national emergency" and pledged "to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money" battling the epidemic.\u000a\u000a"The opioid crisis is an emergency \u2014 and I'm saying officially right now it's an emergency," Trump told reporters outside his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., as Vice President Mike Pence looked on. "It's a national emergency.\u000a\u000a"We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis.\u000a\u000a"We're going to draw it up \u2014 and we're going to make it a national emergency," Trump said. "It is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had."\u000a\u000aTrump held a briefing Tuesday on the crisis in Bedminster, vowing to "fight this deadly epidemic \u2014 and the United States will win."\u000a\u000aThe president's drug commission, led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, recently called on him to declare a national emergency to deal with the opioid crisis.\u000a\u000aAn initial report from the commission said that the approximately 142 deaths each day from drug overdoses mean the death toll was "equal to Sept. 11 every three weeks."\u000a\u000aThe White House said it was still reviewing the report's recommendations in the report.\u000a\u000aHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said after the briefing the administration could deploy the necessary resources and attention without declaring a national emergency, though he stressed that "all things are on the table for the president."\u000a\u000aIn his comments to reporters Thursday, Trump likened the opioid crisis to that involving LSD in the 1970s.\u000a\u000a"When I was growing up, they had LSD \u2014 and they had certain generations of drugs," Trump said.\u000a\u000a"There's never been anything like what's happened to this country over the last four or five years."\u000a\u000aHe added opioids are "a worldwide problem, not just a United States problem.\u000a\u000a"This is happening worldwide," he said. "But this is a national emergency \u2014 and we are drawing documents now to so attest."

Last month Trump took to Twitter to criticize Sessions as being "VERY weak" on going after intelligence leakers.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017\u000a\u000aReagan, the eldest son of Ronald Reagan, said it is the responsibility of Sessions and new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to end the nightmarish breach.\u000a\u000a"I can't believe they have not at this point found anybody who is responsible for the leaks. How many people are in the room when these things are going on?" Reagan told Khan.\u000a\u000a"What people are listening on the phones when these things are going on? And where are the leaks coming from? I can't believe they do not have an area that they are looking into where these might be coming from."\u000a\u000aReagan said the leaks set a "very dangerous precedent" for the nation's highest office.\u000a\u000a"I am sure President Obama, as President Reagan, as President Carter, as President Ford, as President Bush would not have liked to have the conversations, private conversations they were having with world leaders typed up in their entirety and put out for everybody to in fact look at," he said.\u000a\u000a"Because then what happens is you have 320 million people who think they're the president of the United States and they would have made a different decision than what happened in the phone call.\u000a\u000a"They should be allowed to have those private conversations because so many times that will set policy, change policy, and you begin a process of people talking and right now, people are afraid of talking."\u000a\u000aReagan noted that every White House has a "dedicated leaker," somebody who passes information to the press in the guise of an unauthorized scoop, but which is actually planted by the administration.\u000a\u000a"That designated leaker is the person who leaks information to the media about a policy that the White House might be putting out so that they can send it out to see what the reaction's going to be for the public so they can in fact maybe change the policy before it goes any further," Regan said.\u000a\u000a"So they have a designated leaker and every White House has had it that I'm aware of. My father had it, Bush had it. They all had it. [But] this is much different than having a designated leaker leak things out. This is criminal what in fact is going on within this White House."\u000a\u000aReagan is the author of "Lessons My Father Taught Me: The Strength, Integrity, and Faith of Ronald Reagan," published by Humanix.

aVInsurers are seeking double-digit premium increases in light of "uncertainty" surrounding the Affordable Care Act, according to a new, nonpartisan study.\u000a\u000aThe Kaiser Family Foundation released a healthcare study Thursday, which shows insurance premiums being proposed for mid-level or "silver" plans jumping as high as 49 percent.\u000a\u000a"A number of insurers have requested double-digit premium increases for 2018. Based on initial filings, the change in benchmark silver premiums will likely range from -5 percent to 49 percent across these 21 major cities," the study reports, although the figures are not final.\u000a\u000a"In the past, requested premiums have been similar, if not equal to, the rates insurers ultimately charge. This year, because of the uncertainty insurers face over whether the individual mandate will be enforced or cost-sharing subsidy payments will be made, some companies have included an additional rate increase in their initial rate requests, while other companies have said they may revise their premiums late in the process."\u000a\u000aAlthough the study draws a parallel between rates rising and the debate over healthcare in Congress, President Donald Trump shares some of the blame.\u000a\u000a"We still would have seen premium increases in many of these states even without the political uncertainty," Cynthia Cox, the study's co-author and associate director of the foundation's Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance, told The Hill. "But if the Trump administration had been more clear about what the rules were going to be for next year, we would likely have seen much smaller premium increases."\u000a\u000aShe added, "We're likely to see some insurers going back and asking for even higher premium increases from what they initially requested. And if they don't get more clarity soon from Congress or from the administration, we may see more insurers exiting the market later this month or next month."

aVA little information can go a long way in the retirement business, which is something that brothers Mike and Ryan Alfred were able to turn into a thriving enterprise.\u000a\u000aFounded in 2009, their company BrightScope was the first online rating system for 401(k) plans, allowing employees to plug in the name of their company - or a company they were thinking of joining - and find out how a firm's investment options and fees stacked up against others.\u000a\u000aMike, now 36, and Ryan, 34, sold BrightScope last fall to New York-based data company Strategic Insight for an undisclosed amount, but have remained with the company in management roles.\u000a\u000aMike Alfred spoke to Reuters about how they decided it was time to make a change.\u000a\u000aQ: What was your first job?\u000a\u000aA: I sold Cutco knives. I was very good at it and I made $14,000 in seven weeks as a senior in high school. My mom wanted me to work selling cinnamon buns at the mall.\u000a\u000aI put it into an E*Trade account. Then as a freshman at Stanford, I starting trading tech stocks. I turned it into $52,000 at the peak of tech bubble. Then it ran all the way back down to about $20,000. I thought I was really smart and then dumb, but really I was just learning how bubbles work.\u000a\u000aQ: How did you first learn about retirement and money management?\u000a\u000aA: Our parents were really polar opposites, so Ryan and I saw both sides. Our mom was very conservative. She paid all the bills early and saved religiously for retirement.\u000a\u000aMy father was an entrepreneur, he was always swinging for the trees. We had some successes, but he also made some mistakes.\u000a\u000aQ: After running BrightScope for many years, how did you decide it was time to sell?\u000a\u000aA: We thought the market would be a lot bigger than it ended up being. You have these visions in your head of how far you're going to take something. We started to get more realistic.\u000a\u000aWe realized there wasn't enough growth ahead of us to justify running the company with other people's capital. Also, you get a little tired after seven years.\u000a\u000aLuckily, we had already met most of the CEOs of the competitors. We were able to initiate a process ourselves without hiring a banker.\u000a\u000aQ: Did the sale generate a wealth event for you and your brother? And how did you handle it?\u000a\u000aA: We're very different than the average person who has a wealth event, because we managed other people's money before we started BrightScope as registered investment advisers.\u000a\u000aWe never had any temptation to spend money. I drive a Ford pickup truck. I have everything I need. The primary thing I like to do is travel and eat. I had more than enough money to do those things before the wealth event. So to me, it was an opportunity to do more investing.\u000a\u000aQ: BrightScope was always a family business - your parents were investors and another brother worked for you. How will you keep that spirit going?\u000a\u000aA: Ryan and I intend on working together. We stayed on with the parent company and are executives. Our younger brother, Eddie (now 28), left in March and is now working at a startup in the entertainment sector. That's a company that Ryan and I are committed to investing in, but we can't work on it full-time.\u000a\u000aQ: In the past, you and Ryan have given back by teaching financial literacy to kids at your old high school. How do you plan to contribute in the future?\u000a\u000aA: We want to get involved with charity \u2013 not just to give money, but also time. I want to coach and help other entrepreneurs. I like to do practical things to use the skill sets I've developed.\u000a\u000aQ: What legacy do you hope to pass along to the next generation?\u000a\u000aA: A culture of work. I think money by itself without the knowledge and culture and ethic is worthless. It maybe even is harmful. Money by itself without an understanding of what it takes to make it drives people to hurt themselves.

aVCountry legend Glen Campbell will be widely remembered by music fans for such well-known radio hits as \u201cRhinestone Cowboy.\u201d But to advocates for people with dementia, his greatest legacy is his bold decision to become the very public face of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u000a\u000aCampbell died Tuesday at the age of 81, after a six-year battle with Alzheimer\u2019s, his publicist Sandy Brokaw announced.\u000a\u000aThe announcement prompted a spate of tributes from mental health advocates who hailed Campbell, his wife Kimberly, and family for bravely revealing his Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis before embarking on a final \u201cGoodbye Tour\u201d that was documented in the award-winning documentary \u201cI\u2019ll Be Me.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe film is an unflinching portrayal of the progression of Campbell\u2019s disease on the tour, which had to be cut short.\u000a\u000aSince then, Campbell and his family have continued to advocate on behalf of the cause, sharing his story on Capitol Hill and speaking out on behalf of the 5.5 million Americans diagnosed with the memory-robbing disorder.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlen was a courageous advocate on behalf of Alzheimer\u2019s, not only bravely sharing his diagnosis with the world, but continuing to bring joy to his fans through his music while facing the disease so publicly,\u201d said Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cGlen and his family helped to bring Alzheimer\u2019s out of the shadows and into the spotlight with openness and honesty that has rallied people to take action on behalf of the cause. In this spirit, we will continue to work aggressively to pursue greater awareness, provide support to families, and accelerate research to slow, stop and ultimately cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlzheimer\u2019s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and the only cause among the top 10 that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. Without new treatments, the number of Americans with Alzheimer\u2019s is projected to nearly triple by 2050, as the baby boom generation grows into old age.\u000a\u000aSince Campbell\u2019s disclosure that he was struggling with dementia in 2011, he has become the most visible face of Alzheimer\u2019s since Ronald Reagan.\u000a\u000aThe country music legend\u2019s last hit song and video, 2014\u2019s \u201cI'm Not Gonna Miss You,\u201d is a heartrending musical reflection on his battle with dementia \u2014 one that hit home with relatives and advocates of Alzheimer\u2019s sufferers across the country.\u000a\u000aThe song, which went viral shortly after its release, was just one in a series of courageous efforts by the Campbell family to publicize the singer-guitarist\u2019s challenges.\u000a\u000aFew people outside of Campbell's wife and three children felt the pain of his declining mental health as deeply as Jimmy Webb, the legendary songwriter who wrote the rhinestone's cowboy biggest hits, including "Wichita Lineman" and "By the Time I get to Phoenix."\u000a\u000aIn a Newsmax interview shortly after the release of \u201cI\u2019m Not Going to Miss You,\u201d Webb called the Campbells\u2019 decision to go public with his story \u201cdifficult and brave,\u201d adding: "Believe me, if there were a way for me to change this lyric, I would. Glen is one of my dearest friends."\u000a\u000aWebb said the early indications of Campbell's advancing dementia were subtle. For instance, he\u2019d forget the words to some of his favorite songs while the two were performing together, Webb recalled. But only those who knew him well would notice the memory lapses.\u000a\u000a"It just started out with him like maybe forgetting a couple of lines in a song and I'd kind of look at him and I'd think, you know, time to cut back on the red wine or something like that," Webb told Newsmax.\u000a\u000aBut it eventually became clear those little episodes were more than just minor bouts of forgetfulness.\u000a\u000aWebb and his wife, Laura Savini, remained in close contact with the Campbell family through the various phases of the disease.\u000a\u000a"There's certain stages of the disease where \u2014 I don't know how to put this, but \u2014 it's almost like cute. There's an endearing quality to it, almost like having a child, having a very precocious child," Webb said. "But then it goes from there very quickly to a place where it's no longer that, it's something else. And it really requires constant attention."\u000a\u000aWebb called Campbell "a true musical genius" who inspired him from the time he first heard the singer\u2019s voice on the radio as a teen growing up on a farm in Elk City, Okla.\u000a\u000aWebb called "Wichita Lineman," which won a Grammy in 1968, "a perfect record." With Campbell's advancing dementia, the song took on a poignant new meaning \u2014 particularly in the fading walk-off line: "He's still on the line."\u000a\u000aWebb noted that he last collaborated with Campbell on a duet of "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" \u2014 another Grammy winner \u2014 for the songwriter's 2010 duets album, "Just Across the River." It marked both the first and last time that the two sang the track together.\u000a\u000aAlthough Webb's songs have been performed by many artists over the years \u2014 including Frank Sinatra ("Didn't We"), Art Garfunkel ("All I Know\u201d), Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings ("The Highwayman"), the Fifth Dimension ("Up, Up and Away"), Joe Cocker ("The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"), Donna Summer, Richard Harris ("MacArthur Park"), and Brad Paisley ("Galveston") \u2014 Campbell has been the most public voice for his music.\u000a\u000a"We were counting up the other day that he's recorded about 70 or 80 different songs of mine," Webb said. "So basically, he would record everything that I wrote and out of those songs came some hits. But certainly not all of them were hits and some of them are just absolutely gorgeous and nobody ever heard them.\u000a\u000aCampell\u2019s last hit release, \u201cI'm Not Gonna Miss You,\u201d recorded in 2013, may be the song that most cements his legacy.\u000a\u000a"I'm still here but yet I'm gone, I don't play guitar or sing my songs," Campbell begins, then pays tribute to his wife, Kim, singing, "You're the last person I will love, you're the last face I will recall."\u000a\u000aIn the accompanying video, Campbell's moving lyrics are punctuated by personal videos and clips of performances marking his five-decade musical career.\u000a\u000aAmong the film\u2019s most striking images: Footage of a doctor showing Campbell X-rays of his brain and explaining how the disease will steal his memory.

aVAmerica is becoming an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d Fareed Zakaria has warned. The same thing is happening in Poland, writes Anne Applebaum. William Galston and William Kristol, who have often opposed each other in political debates, wrote a joint statement expressing dismay that the \u201cbasic institutions and principles of liberal democracy are under assault.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt may come as a relief, then, to read that illiberalism is not on the rise, and, indeed, does not exist. Yoram Hazony develops that thesis in an interesting essay in the Wall Street Journal. Hazony defines liberalism as the view that it is \u201cpossible and desirable to establish a world-wide regime of law, enforced by American power, to ensure human rights and individual liberties.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe says that supporters of this project have adopted \u201cilliberalism\u201d as a catchall term for its opponents, from authoritarian dictators to traditionalist conservatives. He objects to this usage because it smears the latter with the sins of the former \u2014 and rationalizes bombing campaigns designed to advance a utopian vision of universal liberty.\u000a\u000aHazony is certainly correct that the term \u201cilliberal\u201d can be used too broadly. Reducing immigration levels and placing restrictions on judicial review may or may not be good ideas, but they are not the same as jailing people for expressing political dissent, and we should not use terminology that obscures the differences. He is right, as well, that we will be tempted to ignore these distinctions if we see a battle between liberalism and illiberalism as the central drama of our politics.\u000a\u000aBut Hazony\u2019s usage of \u201cliberalism\u201d stacks the deck, too, just in his favor. He is defining it in an idiosyncratic way, as an example of the kind of \u201carmed doctrine\u201d that Edmund Burke assailed. He claims that the West took military action against Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qaddafi because they were considered illiberal. He also argues that a foreign policy designed to stamp out illiberalism will find it impossible to select its targets: \u201cIn a world full of illiberals, how to choose whether to go after Russia or China? Saudi Arabia or Iran?\u201d\u000a\u000aHe doesn\u2019t notice the tension between these two points. The second one suggests the falsity of the first.\u000a\u000aWe didn\u2019t attack Serbia and the rest just because they were illiberal. We went after them, wisely or not, because we considered their illiberal regimes particularly murderous, threatening to our interests, or both.\u000a\u000aFor Hazony, liberalism\u2019s ambition \u201cto eradicate illiberalism in all its forms\u201d poses even more severe dangers at home. It has no room for the nationalist and religious sentiments that animate many conservatives. \u201cNeither nationalism nor support for religion can be derived from liberal theorizing about universal human rights or individual liberties.\u201d And so, \u201canyone who advocates nationalist and religious ideas in the wrong circles gets tossed straight into the basket of illiberals, with Messrs. Putin, [Erdogan] and Kim.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s overstated, but I believe Hazony is on to something. It would help, though, if he distinguished between two forms of liberalism.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s take liberalism to refer to a set of political ideas held in common by classical liberals, most modern self-described liberals and most modern conservatives: by, let\u2019s say, the early John Stuart Mill, Ted Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. It refers to the ideas that all people have rights that governments should respect and protect, that these rights include the ability to express their views, that the law should aspire to impartiality, and so forth.\u000a\u000aOne form of liberalism \u2014 we could call it a \u201crationalist\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d liberalism \u2014 tends to see it as a set of axioms that were discovered during the Enlightenment and that should govern all of human life. For progressive liberalism, politics consists of working out the implications of liberal principles and acting on them. Another form of liberalism, which we might call a \u201cconservative\u201d liberalism, thinks of itself as a set of practices that we have learned, through many centuries of trial and error, are pretty good at promoting human flourishing.\u000a\u000aThe first kind of liberalism has a totalizing impulse that sets it at odds with religion, as the Jacobin persecutions of the Catholic Church illustrated. The second kind of liberalism, the liberalism of Burke and the Federalist Papers, does not. The first kind of liberalism is impatient with the concept of borders. The second views the nation-state as the indispensable, historically evolved home of liberal democracy.\u000a\u000aThat second form of liberalism concurs with Hazony that nationalism and support for religion cannot be derived from theorizing about human rights, and goes beyond him: It does not think that liberal institutions and attitudes themselves can be derived from such theorizing. They are rooted in a Western tradition that is intertwined with the history of Judaism and Christianity and the lived experiences of nation-states. By treating only the most progressive forms of liberalism as liberal, Hazony sells liberalism short.\u000a\u000aIf we take illiberalism to mean the denial of the core beliefs in equality before the law, free speech and so on, then it is neither an incoherent concept nor a term that is serviceable only for slander. We can hold these beliefs without embracing the kind of dogmatic and aggressive liberalism that worries Hazony. And we can acknowledge that much of our politics consists of arguments about how to act on these liberal ideas rather than about their basic soundness.\u000a\u000aWe can even notice that some of today\u2019s attacks on those core beliefs come from an illiberal Left as well as an illiberal Right. How strong is our commitment to the idea that public speakers should be met with arguments rather than riots? That government should protect the rights of all rather than serve one group of citizens at the expense of another?\u000a\u000aWe should be as precise as we can with our terms, but illiberalism certainly seems to be real, on the rise and worth resisting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRamesh Ponnuru is a Bloomberg View columnist.

aVOn Wednesday, CNN's Jim Acosta unwittingly demonstrated the difference between an unbiased, truth-seeking media and a biased, hostile and advocacy media.\u000a\u000aWe need a watchdog press in this country, but its proper function is to report the news, not become the story. Acosta had displayed his obnoxiousness before, but he descended to a new low this week.\u000a\u000aEarlier in the day, President Trump had appeared with Sens. Tom Cotton and David Perdue to endorse their immigration bill, called the RAISE Act. The bill was the major focus of the White House press briefing, and presidential adviser Stephen Miller outlined its key elements.\u000a\u000aMiller's presentation was hijacked by Acosta, who is apparently on a crusade to establish himself as America's conscience and chief protector against President Trump.\u000a\u000aWe've all seen the give-and-take of White House news conferences, and they sometimes involve feisty exchanges between the administration's spokesperson and members of the media. But there is a difference between a journalist respectfully challenging the White House representative and a militant advocate posing as a journalist and disrespectfully interrupting, disrupting, speechifying and trying to make himself the star of the show.\u000a\u000aAcosta put on a clinic on how not to behave in such settings and illustrated why ordinary Americans are so distrustful of the mainstream liberal media.\u000a\u000aThe proposed legislation would mark a significant overhaul of the nation's legal immigration policy. Currently, our system substantially burdens taxpayers and the economy. More than half of immigrant households receive welfare benefits, whereas only 30 percent of native households receive welfare. Existing policies discourage assimilation and hardly incentivize learning English.\u000a\u000aMoreover, the system has attracted low-skilled and unskilled immigrants into the country. According to the White House, only 1 in 15 immigrants enter the nation because of their skills. The overwhelming majority of the 1 million immigrants who enter each year are low-skilled or unskilled.\u000a\u000aThe RAISE Act addresses these problems directly, by replacing the permanent employment-visa structure with a skills-based system. Applicants would be considered based on their education, ability to speak English, high-paying job offers, past achievements and entrepreneurial initiative. Canada and Australia use similar merit-based approaches.\u000a\u000aWhile continuing to prioritize immediate family members of U.S. residents, the bill would end preferences for extended family members and adult children. It would also limit the number of refugees who get permanent resident status to 50,000 per year.\u000a\u000aThis is a serious proposal and one consistent with President Trump's campaign promises on immigration. It would benefit America and our culture and would reduce the welfare burden imposed under the current system.\u000a\u000aUnsurprisingly, certain liberal and mainstream media members are none too pleased with the plan. Acosta made that quite clear, treating the White House press briefing more like an inquisition than a fact-finding opportunity.\u000a\u000aSneeringly, Acosta attacked Miller, painting the proposal as racist and discriminatory. He implied the policy would violate the welcoming spirit of the Statue of Liberty toward the tired and poor of other nations.\u000a\u000aAcosta seemed outraged that the bill would require immigrants to speak English, saying it suggests the administration is trying to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into the country.\u000a\u000aMiller did not accept this claim passively, countering that it was one of the most outrageous, ignorant, insulting and foolish things Acosta had ever said.\u000a\u000aAcosta was particularly hostile and rude, making pointed statements masked as questions, refusing to allow Miller the courtesy of responding and repeatedly interrupting him. It was as if Acosta imagined himself on the CNN debate show "Crossfire," forgot to do his homework and assumed he would be declared the winner if he monopolized the exchange with rudeness, arrogance, volume and ignorance.\u000a\u000aA less insolent human being, after having thus misbehaved, would be repentant and wish he could erase the horrific episode. Not so with Acosta, who, after reflecting, doubled down in a discussion with Wolf Blitzer, saying the "White House has an unhealthy fixation on what I call the three M's \u2014 the Mexicans, the Muslims and the media. Their policies tend to be crafted around bashing one of those three groups, and we just see it time and again."\u000a\u000aAs a self-righteous liberal, Acosta simply must impugn conservatives in the administration every time he gets a chance. So twisted is he that he apparently believes that those who support assimilation and a common language are bigots. Unless you promote open borders and Balkanization, you must hate people of different ethnicities.\u000a\u000aGiven such toxic biases, it's no wonder Americans rarely have good-faith, constructive debates on pressing issues. With such misguided finger-pointing, it's no wonder most people are appalled at the monolithic mainstream media.\u000a\u000aI don't ordinarily use the term "fake news," but there was nothing remotely authentic about Acosta's disgraceful performance and even less that resembled an unbiased approach to the facts.\u000a\u000aI sincerely hope that Acosta and his like-minded colleagues continue in this posture, further exposing themselves as the preening, demagogic leftist partisans they are.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author, and attorney.

aVDeputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka pushed back on a report Thursday afternoon that seemed to suggest he was admonishing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for discussing military matters.\u000a\u000a"I never said that \u2013 that's fake news 101," Gorka said during an appearance on Fox News. "I have the audio."\u000a\u000aGorka was referring to comments he made during a BBC Radio program, which, according to The Hill, included this soundbite:\u000a\u000a"You should listen to the president. The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical."\u000a\u000aThe Department of State later weighed in, with spokesperson Heather Nauert defending her boss as America's top diplomat.\u000a\u000a"He's a Cabinet secretary," Nauert said, noting she had not yet heard or read Gorka's remarks herself. "He's the fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick."\u000a\u000aGorka explained to Fox News he was referring to the media asking Tillerson about military matters, in this case the situation with North Korea.\u000a\u000a"I said for reporters to force our chief diplomat, the amazing Rex Tillerson, to give details of military options is nonsensical," Gorka said. "He is the secretary of state. That means you don't understand what the words secretaries of state means. It's fake news. Classic example."\u000a\u000a"I was admonishing the journalist or the fake news complex that are forcing our chief diplomat into a position where they're demanding he makes the military case for action when that is not the mandate of the secretary of state," Gorka added. "That's why we have a Department of Defense."

These plans let employees invest part of their paycheck before taxes. That money can grow tax free until retirement. Then the money will be taxed as income when it is paid out. Many companies offer the added benefit and incentive to employees of matching money the employee saves. This is like getting a small raise.There are many circumstances in which a saver can take money out of a 401(k) before retirement, taking a personal loan on money they invested, or paying for certain large expenses, like medical bills, education or buying a house. However, there are several drawbacks to withdrawing money from a 401(k).Money taken early from a 401(k) gets hit with a double whammy tax burden. The IRS can take 10 percent additional tax as a penalty for taking that money before retirement. The money will also be taxed as income.Withdrawals from a 401(k) before age 59  are going to be more costly than you expect, CNN Money said . Aside from the early withdrawal penalties and extra taxes, there is a lost opportunity to have that money grow into the nest egg you will need later in life.Many employers will allow an employee to borrow money out of their 401(k) as a low interest loan. However, most plans have a very short pay-back window. In most cases, if you leave your employment for any reason, that money is due immediately, Bankrate said

aVINDICATOR: July Producer Prices and Weekly Jobless Claims\u000a\u000aKEY DATA: PPI: -0.1%; Goods: -0.1%; Services: -0.2%/ Claims: +3,000\u000a\u000aIN A NUTSHELL: \u201cThe Fed keeps saying inflation will rebound, but right now, there is little hard data to think that will happen soon.\u201d\u000a\u000aWHAT IT MEANS: The members of the Fed are convinced inflation will rebound in the months ahead. Even today, New York Fed President William Dudley repeated that refrain. And I agree that should happen. But it would be nice if there were some data to support that belief. Producer costs went nowhere in July. The weakness in goods costs continued. Yes, food and energy prices declined over the month, but excluding those volatile components, finished goods costs were up only modestly.\u000a\u000aThe big surprise in the report was the drop in services prices. Transportation, warehousing, government, you name it, services costs were down. This decline was so widespread and so odd, given that services had been leading the inflation push, that I am just not certain what is going on. Looking outward, there is not a whole lot of pressure at the intermediate or crude goods levels.\u000a\u000aJobless claims edged up last week, but the level is still quite low, reflecting the tightness in the labor market. This is important because yesterday, the second quarter productivity and labor costs report was released.\u000a\u000aLabor costs rose only moderately in the second quarter after having surged in the first. Adjusting for inflation, hourly wages, while up in the second quarter, are still down compared to last year. While the Fed members think that some temporary factors will unwind that will start the upward trend in inflation, to sustain the higher rate, wages will have to rise faster. The latest data just don\u2019t say that is happening.\u000a\u000aMARKETS AND FED POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Inflation pressures are modest, whether they be producer costs or labor compensation. Job openings are soaring but that hasn\u2019t forced businesses to either raise wages or even increase their recruiting intensity, which DHI reported.\u000a\u000aFirms are hiring, despite their complaints that they cannot find qualified workers, but they are not paying more for either their new employees or upping the wages of their current workers. That is showing up in the generally decent earnings numbers. But how long that can continue given productivity growth is modest is anyone\u2019s guess.\u000a\u000aI have been wrong on the wage issue for so long, I no longer say that compensation is about to surge. (Of course, whenever I back off from a forecast, it usually comes true, so don\u2019t be surprised if wages rise faster in the third quarter.)\u000a\u000aRegardless, inflation, consumer spending and Fed policy all are dependent on wage increases and if they stay low, the Fed will be pressured to go very slowly as it hikes rates and shrinks its balance sheet.\u000a\u000aAs for investors, if earnings stay good, that is all that is needed to keep up the euphoria.\u000a\u000aJoel L.

aVMore than 3.5 million people in the U.S. are registered to vote than are alive among America\u2019s adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to vote fraud.\u000a\u000aThe Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch \u2014 a Washington-based legal-watchdog group \u2014 analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2011 to 2015 American Community Survey and last month\u2019s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states.\u000a\u000aAccording to Judicial Watch, 11 states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvania\u2019s legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.\u000a\u000aMy tabulation of Judicial Watch\u2019s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties.\u000a\u000aJudicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me, "That\u2019s enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut."\u000a\u000aAmong some 2,500 U.S. counties for which Judicial Watch had data, these 462 counties (18.5 percent of those studied) exhibit this ghost-voter problem. These range from 101 percent over-registration in Delaware\u2019s New Castle County to New Mexico\u2019s Harding County, where there are 62 percent more registered voters than living, breathing adult citizens.\u000a\u000aWashington\u2019s Clark County is worrisome, given its 154 percent over-registration rate. This includes 166,811 ghost voters. Georgia\u2019s Fulton County seems less nettlesome at 108 percent over-registration, but for the 53,172 Atlantans who compose that figure.\u000a\u000aBut California\u2019s San Diego County earns the enchilada grande. Its 138 percent over-registration translates into 810,966 ghost voters. Los Angeles County\u2019s 112 percent rate equals 707,475 over-registrations.\u000a\u000aBeyond the official data that it received, Judicial Watch reports that Los Angeles County employees, "informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144 percent of the total number of resident citizens of voting age."\u000a\u000aAll told, California is a veritable haunted house, teeming with 1,736,556 ghost voters. Judicial Watch last week wrote Democratic Secretary of State Alex Padilla and authorities in 11 counties and documented how their election records are in shambles.\u000a\u000aJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said, "California\u2019s voting rolls are an absolute mess that undermines the very idea of clean elections." Fitton added, "It is urgent that California take reasonable steps to clean up its rolls. We will sue if state officials fail to act."\u000a\u000aRonald Reagan\u2019s California has devolved into a reliably far-left stronghold. While pristine voter rolls should be a given in a constitutional republic with democratic elections, even that improvement might be too little to make the Golden State competitive in presidential elections.\u000a\u000aThe same cannot be said for battleground states, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in the following states:\u000a\u000aColorado: 159,373\u000a\u000aFlorida: 100,782\u000a\u000aIowa: 31,077\u000a\u000aMichigan: 225,235\u000a\u000aNew Hampshire: 8,211\u000a\u000aNorth Carolina: 189,721\u000a\u000aVirginia: 89,979\u000a\u000aPresident Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clinton\u2019s margins of victory in Colorado and New Hampshire were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clinton\u2019s fans should know that Trump won Michigan and North Carolina by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.\u000a\u000aPerhaps these facts will encourage Democrats to join GOP-dominated efforts to remove ineligible felons, ex-residents, non-citizens, and dead people from the voter rolls \u2014 for all contests, not just presidential races.\u000a\u000aUnder federal law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2002 Help America Vote Act require states to maintain accurate voter lists. Nonetheless, some state politicians ignore this law. Governor Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., vetoed a measure mandating investigations of elections in which ballots outnumbered eligible voters.\u000a\u000aEven more suspiciously, when GOP Governor Rick Scott tried to obey these laws and update Florida\u2019s records, including deleting 51,308 deceased voters, Obama\u2019s Justice Department sued to stop him.\u000a\u000aWhether Americans consider vote fraud a Republican hoax, a Democratic tactic, or something in between, everyone should agree that it\u2019s past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.\u000a\u000aDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor with National Review Online.

aVOutnumbered and outvoted in hubs of innovation like Silicon Valley and Seattle, conservatives in the overwhelmingly blue industry have faced a challenging political environment for years \u2014 especially during the Obama era when the White House had Google and Facebook chiefs on speed dial.\u000a\u000aBut several deep-pocketed Republicans have managed to carve out a niche for themselves in the tech world, including a few who even backed Donald Trump publicly last year over techie favorite Hillary Clinton. According to Wired, employees at tech firms overwhelmingly supported Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u000a\u000aAlert: Your Drugstore Doesn't Understand Your Thyroid\u000a\u000aNewsmax has selected these 25 high-tech heavyweights who run against the grain in Silicon Valley and beyond, wielding their influence, forward-thinking, and resources to promote Republican candidates and ideals.\u000a\u000a1. Peter Thiel \u2014 The billionaire co-founder of PayPal last year threw his support, and a big chunk of his money, behind Trump, earning him a speaking spot at the GOP convention. Thiel made headlines \u2014 not because of his Silicon Valley ZIP code, but because of his sexual orientation. \u201cI am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican,\u201d he has said. \u201cBut most of all, I am proud to be an American.\u201d Thiel isn\u2019t just a Trump Republican; he\u2019s donated almost $5 million to various GOP candidates and PACs over the past few years.\u000a\u000a2. Larry Ellison \u2014 Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Ellison has donated over the years to Democrats and Republicans, but hosted fundraisers for Sen. Rand Paul in 2014 and Marco Rubio in 2016. In addition to hosting the Rubio dinner, Ellison was reportedly the second-largest donor to the Florida senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid through Conservative Solutions PAC, giving the super PAC $4 million throughout the campaign. The billionaire has continued to support the GOP after the November election, hosting a Republican fundraiser in his Silicon Valley home in April 2017.\u000a\u000a3. Meg Whitman \u2014 The former Hewlett-Packard and eBay executive ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, losing badly after pouring $144 million of her own money into the race. She backed Chris Christie in 2016 but endorsed Clinton over Trump after Christie dropped out. Still, she said, she remains a staunch Republican.\u000a\u000a4. Marc Andreessen \u2014 While funding and supporting Democrats in the past, Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and a director of eBay, Facebook, and Hewlett-Packard made a political shift when he threw his considerable weight, and wallet, behind Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cYou do not get a high-end, professional CEO running for president very often,\u201d the co-founder and partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz told CNBC at the time.\u000a\u000a5. Michael Dell \u2014 The Dell Technologies founder and former CEO has a long history of backing Republicans, including many in his home state of Texas. While he regularly makes smaller donations to (mostly) GOP candidates, he made a whopping $250,000 contribution in 2002 to the Republican National Committee. Even though his company is headquartered near Austin, Texas, Dell has developed strong ties to Silicon Valley by establishing mentors and opening an R&D center there.\u000a\u000a6. Scott McNealy \u2014 The Sun Microsystems co-founder, who self-identifies as a \u201craging capitalist,\u201d is bullish on Trump. "I\u2019ve never seen anybody who actually is a developer and an entrepreneur in charge and understanding what really projects capability in our country,\u201d McNealy told Fox Business. In 2012, he also backed Mitt Romney, with whom he shares a secondary school alma mater in Michigan.\u000a\u000a7. Steve Ballmer \u2014 The former Microsoft CEO has given plenty of cash to Democrats, but he is a self-described Republican who worked on George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and has helped many other GOP candidates. He has offered tempered praise for Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying it\u2019s \u201cimportant to have reasonably secure borders.\u201d And he said Trump\u2019s message about business stimulating jobs inside the country \u201cis not a bad theme at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a8. Paul Otellini \u2014 The former Intel CEO and president tried to work closely with the Obama White House, despite once famously saying the Democrat did not understand \u201cwhat it takes to create jobs.\u201d But Otellini, an executive with Trident Capital Cybersecurity, has made no secret of his preference for Republicans. He publicly backed, and financially supported, both John McCain and Romney in their races against Obama.\u000a\u000a9. Sarah Pompei \u2014 Possessing a lengthy Republican rsum before making the jump to Silicon Valley: Pompei advised Meg Whitman\u2019s gubernatorial bid in 2010, ran Romney's regional press in 2012, and worked briefly in the House GOP leaderships. She then left politics for senior communications roles at Hewlett-Packard and, now, rideshare app Lyft.\u000a\u000a10. Garrett Johnson \u2014 Co-founder of tech startup SendHub, Johnson differs from most other influencers considered among \u201cNewsmax's 25 Most Influential Republicans in Tech\u201d as his impact is more felt at the grassroots level. As executive director and co-founder of the Lincoln Network, he\u2019s a leader in building up and organizing right-leaning thinkers in the tech community in an effort to affect public policy with technological solutions driven toward freedom.\u000a\u000a11. Scott Banister \u2014 A PayPal board member and tech mega-investor, Banister strongly backed Rand Paul last year and supported Paul\u2019s father Ron in 2012. When Rand Paul quit the race, Banister, a marijuana rights activist who describes himself as a Libertarian, threw his support to Ted Cruz. Banister\u2019s wife Cyan is also a Republican super-donor.\u000a\u000a12. Palmer Luckey \u2014 The 24-year-old founder of Oculus Rift took a bare-knuckled approach to the 2016 campaign, helping to finance a pro-Trump group that created harsh anti-Clinton memes. Specifically, the group, Nimble America, ran a billboard campaign featuring Clinton with the caption \u201cToo Big to Jail.\u201d Luckey self-describes as a Libertarian.\u000a\u000a13. Tim Armstrong \u2014 The current AOL Inc. chief executive\u2019s support for Republicans has caused headaches for one of AOL\u2019s big media properties, the left-leaning Huffington Post, which quoted a \u201csource\u201d in 2011 saying Armstrong \u201ccalls himself a libertarian,\u201d but is in fact \u201cone of the most conservative people around.\u201d\u000a\u000a14. Don Scifres \u2014 The president of the tech startup SmartFile, Scifres is a venture capitalist who co-founded the SDL Capital investment firm and Spectra Diode Laboratories. Scifres has been a go-to GOP donor for years; in 2016, he backed Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz.\u000a\u000a15. Aaron Ginn \u2013 An early founder of the growth hacking movement, Ginn specializes in data science and product development. He\u2019s also one of the co-founders of Lincoln Network, formerly Lincoln Labs, an incubator for conservative tech professionals who, according to its website, is \u201cdevoted to building alliance of liberty and technology.\u201d He also worked on Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012.\u000a\u000aTip: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a16. Chris Abrams \u2014 The co-founder and chief technology officer of Matters Media, which he describes as a \u201cdigital publishing holdings company with a tech twist.\u201d Abrams is a self-described technologist and entrepreneur who previously worked with large organizations such as NASA and the Department of Defense, but also worked with dozens of small startups. He also works with Ginn on Lincoln Network.\u000a\u000a17. Brian Krzanich \u2014 The CEO of Intel since 2013, Krzanich agreed to host a Trump fundraiser last year at his California home but canceled it. Amid uproar, he later said he was staying neutral in the 2016 election. But unlike many other tech leaders, he has decided to work very closely with Trump in the White House.\u000a\u000a18. Eric Jackson \u2014 Jackson, a former PayPal executive, is also the co-founder of CapLinked, a group focused on linking tech companies and investors. He has been active in conservative causes for decades and frequently appears as a conservative commentator on radio and TV.\u000a\u000a19. Keith Rabois \u2014 A technology entrepreneur, executive, and investor, Rabois is known for his early-stage startup investments and his executive roles at PayPal, LinkedIn, Slide, and Square. In response to Thiel\u2019s convention speech last year, he tweeted that the \u201ctech industry is primarily out of touch by being too far to the Left.\u201d\u000a\u000a20. Andrew Torba \u2014 According to TechCrunch, Torba \u201cdescribed himself as a lifelong \u2018conservative Republican Christian,\u2019\u201d but is also the co-founder and CEO of Automate Ads and more famously the founder and CEO of Gab, a free speech-minded alternative to Twitter.\u000a\u000a21. Scott Slinker \u2014 The CEO of analytics startup Paradata is a staunch supporter of Trump. Slinker told CNBC that the president is \u201cracist for the American employee . . . He wants to get America back to work, and I think that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d Upon reflection, he stuck by his controversial words. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t edit that out,\u201d he told the \u201cRaw Story\u201d host.\u000a\u000a22. Dr. Susan Amat \u2014 A self-described serial entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in strategic entrepreneurship, Amat is the CEO and founder of Venture Hive, which finances startups and other tech companies. She served as an adviser to Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000a23. John Rampton \u2014 The CEO of Due, a financial advice platform for small-business owners, backed Trump, he told USA Today, because \u201cI like when business people run for president.\u201d He's donated to the Trump campaign because Trump "speaks his mind and doesn't care what people think. That is how you effect change." It's not the most popular stance in the valley where, Rampton told the newspaper, "once a day, I'm asked to f*** myself for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap."\u000a\u000a24. Tim Draper \u2014 The Bitcoin CEO is not overtly partisan and once said he doesn\u2019t \u201cfit into either political party.\u201d Nonetheless, he has been a registered Republican who financed California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other GOP candidates and has spoken out strongly against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. In 2000, he spent $20 million of his own money on a failed effort to support school vouchers.\u000a\u000a25. Tom Siebel \u2014 From 2009 to 2014, the Siebel Systems founder gave almost $350,000 to political candidates. Most of this largesse went to independents, but a big chunk went to GOP candidates and none went to Democrats. He also planned to host a fundraiser for Sarah Palin at his Woodside home in 2008, but the event was canceled.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 2 Warning Signs of Sudden Cardiac Death

aVEaster, and the Holy Week leading up to it, is celebrated differently around the world. Some mark the holiday with egg hunts and chocolates and visits from a giant, mythical bunny, while others choose to also celebrate the Resurrection of the Christ.\u000a\u000aFor this list, Newsmax considered destinations far and wide \u2014 across the United States and around the globe \u2014 where the religious Easter holiday is celebrated with processions, parades, and pageantry that mark the foundation of the Christian faith.\u000a\u000aSince the holiday often coincides with spring break, Easter can also be the perfect time to plan a more extensive cultural family vacation abroad.\u000a\u000aFrom witnessing centuries-old religious processions across Europe to a sunrise Easter service at the Garden Tomb in Jerusalem, Newsmax has curated 25 destinations where you can experience the holy side of Easter.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 270 Ways to Slash Your 2016 Tax Bill\u000a\u000aThe list isn\u2019t focused on international destinations, either. There are plenty of equally engaging places right here in the U.S. to experience the holiday as well, including America\u2019s longest-running passion play in Oklahoma and a pilgrimage to a sacred church in New Mexico.\u000a\u000aHere are Newsmax's top 25 Easter destinations around the world:\u000a\u000a1. Jerusalem, Israel \u2014 It is pretty difficult to think of anywhere more special to celebrate Easter Week than Jerusalem, where the story that led to the first Easter unfolded. Jerusalem\u2019s Holy Week begins with a Palm Sunday parade to commemorate Christ entering the city. The route, which attracts up to 10,000 participants each year, follows the footsteps Jesus took along the Via Dolorosa in the Old City. A Palm Sunday Mass is also held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is the place where Christians believe Christ was buried and then rose from the dead. On Easter itself, a sunrise service is held at the Garden Tomb.\u000a\u000a2. Rome, Italy \u2014 Attending Easter Mass held by the Pope at the Vatican is a sacred experience for Catholics. And Rome is truly a wonderful cultural family destination to celebrate the Holy Week. Events begin on Palm Sunday with a free mass in Saint Peter\u2019s Square. There are also Mass services on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday. Also don\u2019t miss the Stations of the Cross (Via Crucis) parade on Good Friday when a huge cross with burning torches lights the sky as a procession passes each station placed by Pope Benedict XIV at the Colosseum back in 1744.\u000a\u000a3. Chimayo, New Mexico \u2014 In the tiny northern New Mexico town of Chimayo, about a 45-minute drive from Santa Fe, this simple adobe church, known as El Santuario de Chimayo, has been called the \u201cLourdes of North America\u201d for its supposed healing powers. Each year thousands of people come to this rural village to gather the soil from a place in the floor that is associated with a miraculous crucifix discovery in 1810 and is believed to have amazing curative powers. Easter Week is one of the most popular, and special times, to visit Chimayo, with many visitors choosing to make a walking pilgrimage to the church from Santa Fe.\u000a\u000a4. Bloomington, Illinois \u2014 Bloomington puts on America\u2019s oldest Passion play each Easter with a production now in its 94th consecutive year. The \u201cAmerican Passion Play,\u201d held at the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts, differs from other Passion plays in that it follows Jesus\u2019 entire life, rather than just the events surrounding Easter. In this performance, guests are transported back to Palestine in the time of Christ, and follow him on his ministry and life from the Sermon on the Mount to the Resurrection and Ascension. The settings and costumes aim to be as historically accurate as possible, and the script follows passages from the King James Version of the Bible.\u000a\u000a5. Lawton, Oklahoma \u2014 Another one of America\u2019s longest-running Easter Passion plays is performed each year at a remote location inside southwest Oklahoma\u2019s Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge known as Holy City of the Wichitas. The narrated dramatization of the birth, life, death, and Resurrection of Christ has been held outside in what is now a replica of the Holy Land every year since 1926. The story is performed entirely in pantomime with musical backing, while readers also broadcast the script on the radio and to the Easter performance crowd. Over the years, the cast has grown to some 150 members.\u000a\u000a6. Marion, Indiana \u2014 Running since 1937, the Marion Easter Pageant uses no spoken commentary, but instead tells the story of the last week of Christ\u2019s life entirely with pantomime, pageantry, and hymns. The hour-long performance, held at the Memorial Coliseum YMCA, begins with the Palm Sunday entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem and concludes with the "Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Orlando, Florida \u2014 Orlando\u2019s Bible-themed park, known as The Holy Land Experience, is a great, educationally focused family experience. The park is a living, biblical museum that is designed to replicate the city of Jerusalem some 2,000 years ago. From the Garden Tomb to the Wilderness Tabernacle, biblical history comes alive in intricate detail. Although the theme park is open year-round, in the six weeks around Easter (March 14 to April 29, 2017) they put on special Crucifixion and Resurrection re-enactments outside by the tomb.\u000a\u000a8. Lourdes, France \u2014 One of the most-visited religious sites in the world, the village of Lourdes, at the base of the Pyrenees Mountains, is especially magical at Easter. During the Holy Week, France\u2019s second most-visited city sees thousands of pilgrims \u2014 it is the largest Catholic pilgrimage destination in Europe \u2014 carrying torches in a procession through the ancient streets, meditating the prayer of the Rosary. Many companies offer organized tours, which include Mass at the Grotto, a cave-like shrine at the base of Lourdes Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.\u000a\u000a9. Lalibela, Ethiopia \u2014 Ethiopia was one of the earliest countries to embrace Christianity, and very little has changed since the 1st century in the way its practitioners worship there. Easter, known as Fasika there, begins in earnest on its eve, as congregants gather until nearly dawn when Lent fasting gives way to enormous feasting and celebration. Lalibela, named after the 13th-century Ethiopian king who commissioned its building, is the site where about a dozen interconnected churches were carved out of volcanic earth. The purpose of this architectural wonder, according to Ethiopian lore, was King Lalibela founding a \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d after Saladin had conquered the Hebrew city during the Third Crusade. Fasika, which follows the Eastern Orthodox calendar, usually falls a week or two after the Western holiday, so American travelers would not miss celebrating Easter at their home church by experiencing it in the African nation.\u000a\u000a10. Junction, Texas \u2014 The town of Junction, in Texas hill country, also puts on a re-enactment of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ in its annual pageant. It\u2019s held at sunset on the Saturday evening before Easter Sunday in an outdoor theater off Farm Road 2169. The site, known as the Easter Pageant grounds, sits on a pretty hillside beneath a bluff known as Lover\u2019s Leap. The pageant is performed and sponsored by the Men\u2019s Bible Class of Junction, which began as a veterans' ministry.\u000a\u000a11. Denver, Colorado \u2014 Red Rocks Amphitheater, just west of Denver, Colorado, is one of the world\u2019s most famous outdoor concert venues, known for the stunning red rock scenery surrounding the stage, but also its natural acoustics. On Easter Sunday, a sunrise prayer service held here attracts thousands who come to worship in this place of natural beauty. Afterwards, many choose to go for a hike in the park surrounding the amphitheater or continue west into the mountains for a day of reflection in nature.\u000a\u000a12. Florence, Italy \u2014 Another top Easter destination in Europe is Florence, which puts on a parade known as the Explosion of the Cart. The fiery procession is held on Easter Sunday in honor of the Florentine knight Pazzino, who was the first person to plant the banner of the cross at the battle of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1096. The procession, which began in the 17th century, features a float pulled by two white oxen through the streets before fireworks are set off from it before a host of fireworks explode from it.\u000a\u000a13. Seville, Spain \u2014 Holy Week, or Semana Santa in Seville, is one of Spain\u2019s largest religious festivals. The week is filled with parades, led by different religious brotherhoods, who dress in penitential robes, with giant floats featuring lifelike wooden sculptures depicting scenes from the last week of Christ\u2019s life. Many of these floats dates back to the 17th century and are considered religious works of art. The most important parade begins on the evening of Holy Thursday and continues through Good Friday dawn.\u000a\u000aAlert:\u000a\u000aWhen Do You Think Christ Is Returning? Vote Now\u000a\u000a14. Eureka Springs, Arkansas \u2014 Back in the U.S., another Passion play option can be found in the Ozark Mountains at Eureka Springs. Here \u201cThe Great Passion Play\u201d is staged in an outdoor, multi-level amphitheater with special lighting and sound effects, live animals, and a cast of 150 actors dressed in New Testament-era costumes. On Easter morning, there is a sunrise service at the amphitheater. The grounds of The Great Passion Play are also home to a few different museums, including one dedicated to the Bible, as well as a life-sized replica of Jerusalem\u2019s Eastern Gate and hiking trails, which remain open year-round.\u000a\u000a15. Mesa, Arizona \u2014 Held on the west end of the lawn north of the Mesa Arizona Temple Visitors\u2019 Center, the \u201cMesa Arizona Easter Pageant, Jesus the Christ\u201d presents the life, ministry, and mission of Christ through music, dance, and drama. This Church of Latter-Day Saints\u2019 presentation is designed for \u201call religions, ages, and cultures\u201d and takes place over multiple dates in April leading up to Easter. Claiming to be \u201clargest annual, outdoor Easter pageant in the world,\u201d the Mesa Arizona Temple hosts audiences that can exceed 10,000 in attendance.\u000a\u000a16. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2014 In Brazil, Easter falls at the end of summer, which means warm weather and plenty of light. Rio de Janeiro hosts numerous colorful processions throughout Holy Week, and during this time many of the city\u2019s streets are decorated with carpets of flowers.\u000a\u000a17. Oberammergau, Germany \u2014 This village in the Bavarian Alps has been putting on its \u201cPassion Play\u201d for nearly 400 years. This play is produced and performed entirely by Oberammergau villagers, by law, every 10 years, and it is expected to draw nearly half a million visitors to its 100-plus performances in 2020. Born out of war and plague and a promise to God, the manuscript has changed little over the centuries, yet has remained unique in updated presentations. The production is also easily the most exhaustive Passion play, expecting to take the stage for around five hours, with a three-hour dinner intermission. There is a theater tour, led daily in German and English, and an Easter market to add to the experience, as well as the many local and regional sights and delights to add to the experience.\u000a\u000a18. Verges, Spain \u2014 Also in Spain, the medieval city of Verges puts on a traditional \u201cdansa de la mort\u201d on Holy Thursday. The \u201cdeath dance\u201d re-enacts scenes from the Passion, and participants parade through the streets in skeleton costumes. The procession ends with purposefully frightening skeleton dancers carrying boxes of ashes and is followed by a macabre dance that beings at midnight and lasts for three hours.\u000a\u000a19. Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 Charleston is a wonderful city to celebrate Easter on the water. The weather is usually nice, the air scented with jasmine and other spring flowers, and there are a number of different sunrise service celebration options. One favorite is held at White Point Garden on the Battery at 6:45 a.m., and it usually draws a crowd of around 500 people. The views of the harbor as the sun comes up are inspiring.\u000a\u000a20. Dubrovnik, Croatia \u2014 One of Europe\u2019s most religious Easter celebrations takes place in the beautiful Croatian coastal city of Dubrovnik. Here you\u2019ll experience a ceremonious procession of the cross during Good Friday. Other Easter traditions include giving gifts of colored eggs and partaking in a special Easter cake known as pinca.\u000a\u000a21. Indianapolis, Indiana \u2014Christians come from across the country to experience Upon This Rock Passion Play at Pike Performing Arts Center in Indianapolis. The musical theater version of the Passion play includes soulful singing, choreographed dance, spoken words from the Bible, and even a pyrotechnic display as Christ rises from the grave.\u000a\u000a22. New Orleans, Louisiana \u2014 New Orleans is a city that knows how to put on a good parade anytime of year, but on Easter Sunday, it offers a full Easter procession through the French Quarter. Known as the Historic French Quarter Parade, it has been running since 1956, and begins at Antoine\u2019s Restaurant, continues on to Jackson Square, and then comes back to the starting point, following a stop for a mass at the St. Louis Cathedral.\u000a\u000a23. Buenos Aires, Argentina \u2014 Easter Sunday in Buenos Aires sees a number of traditions including consuming and sharing eggs and a special Easter cake, known as rosca de Pascua, with family, friends, and even colleagues. The day also includes Mass followed by big family gatherings with food, usually of the barbecue variety and a government-organized treasure hunt.\u000a\u000a24. Beirut, Lebanon \u2014 In Lebanon, half the country is Christian, and many Lebanese consider themselves quite religious, so Easter is celebrated passionately.

aVThe number of white Americans under 55 dying from colorectal cancer has been increasing since the mid-2000s after decades of downward movement, new research published Tuesday showed, though rates among other races remained static or declined.\u000a\u000aResearchers from the American Cancer Society examined mortality rates among 20-54 year olds between 1970 and 2014 using data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a period in which 242,637 people died of the disease.\u000a\u000aFrom 1970 to 2004, the overall mortality rate decreased from 6.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 before rising again by one percent per year and reaching 4.3 per 100,000 in 2014, according to the study which was published in Journal of the American Medical Association.\u000a\u000aThe increase was limited to whites, among whom mortality rates increased by 1.4 percent per year, from 3.6 in 2004 to 4.1 in 2014.\u000a\u000aFor blacks, the rate of mortality declined steadily from 8.1 percent in 1970 to 6.1 percent in 2014.\u000a\u000aFor other ethnic groups, the combined mortality rate declined from 1970 to 2006 and then stabilized.\u000a\u000aIn the white sample, mortality remained unchanged among 20-29 year-olds between 1988 and 2014 but increased by 1.6 percent per year between 1995 and 2014 among 30-39 year-olds and 1.9 percent annually among the 40-49 age group between 2005 and 2014.\u000a\u000aThe authors noted "that these disparate racial patterns are inconsistent with trends in major risk factors for colorectal cancer like obesity, which is universally increasing."\u000a\u000aThey were also surprised by the progression of colorectal cancer mortality in those aged over 50 because screening starting around age 50 has been recommended for decades. More patients are cured when the disease is detected early.\u000a\u000aThe researchers, led by Rebecca Siegel, added the rising mortality rates "strongly suggests that the increase in incidence is not only earlier detection of prevalent cancer, but a true and perplexing escalation in disease occurrence."\u000a\u000aThey called for more screening across age-groups with a timely follow-up of symptoms.

aVPeople who drink moderately on a regular basis have a better chance of reaching the ripe old age of 85 free of dementia and other age-related cognitive impairments, according to a study led by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aWhile other studies have found an association between drinking alcohol and longevity, the new study examined drinking's link with cognitive health in old age.\u000a\u000a"This study is unique because we considered men and women's cognitive health at late age and found that alcohol consumption is not only associated with reduced mortality, but with greater chances of remaining cognitively healthy into older age," said senior author Linda McEvoy, Ph.D.\u000a\u000aResearchers found that among men and women 85 and older, those who consumed "moderate to heavy" amounts of alcohol five to seven days a week were twice as likely to be cognitively healthy than non-drinkers. Cognitive health was assessed every four years over the course of the 29-year study, using a standard dementia screening test.\u000a\u000a"This study shows that moderate drinking may be part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain cognitive fitness in aging," said lead author Erin Richard. "However, it is not a recommendation for everyone to drink. Some people have health problems that are made worse by alcohol, and others cannot limit their drinking to only a glass or two per day. For these people, drinking can have negative consequences."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\u000a\u000aFor those who do not drink, studies have shown that other lifestyle choices can help keep aging brains healthy. A long-term study at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that seniors who danced regularly showed a 67 percent reduction in the risk of developing dementia.\u000a\u000aA diet rich in healthy oils is also essential. Researchers at Rhode Island Hospital found that the brains of older adults who took fish oil, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, suffered significantly less cognitive decline and brain shrinkage when compared to those who didn't take fish oil.\u000a\u000aAnother study found that a substance in olive oil called oleocanthal helps decrease the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain \u2014 the abnormal proteins that clump together and cause memory loss. Researchers found that oleocanthal increased the protection of two proteins and key enzymes that are critical in removing beta-amyloid from the brain.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Alzheimer's Association, 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, a form of dementia, and the number may triple by 2050.

aVCivil-rights legend Alan Dershowitz has come out swinging at Rep. Maxine Waters, who called him "absolutely racist" for saying the Trump administration is in for an "unfavorable" shake from a Washington D.C. grand jury because the district has an "ethnic and racial" bias.\u000a\u000a"Maxine Waters uses, throws around the term 'racist' to describe anybody she disagrees with," Dershowitz told Rita Cosby, guest host of Newsmax TV's "The Todd Schnitt Show."\u000a\u000a"And it diminishes the power of the word, it dilutes the word. It really doesn't serve the interest of civil rights."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

What he is saying is \u2018all of those black people are there and they don't like Trump and so he's not going to get a fair trial and so they should take it out of that jurisdiction. It shouldn't be there to begin with.' I don't like that, and I'm surprised that Alan Dershowitz is talking like that.... We will not stand for it. We will push back against that because that is absolutely racist."\u000a\u000aBut Dershowitz on Monday strongly disagreed.\u000a\u000a"Look, every criminal lawyer I know, prosecutor, defense attorney, would agree with me that when you take a case from Virginia and put it in the District of Columbia, you are gaining a tactical advantage for the prosecution in a case in which the defendants are likely to come from the Trump administration," he said.\u000a\u000a"Politics matters. Race matters. Ethnicity matters. Every lawyer know that. I learned it from Johnnie Cochran who Maxine Waters praised to the hilt when he died and wanted to have Congress pass a resolution recognizing his greatness. Would she have called Johnnie Cochran a racist?\u000a\u000a"Or does she revere it only for people that are not of her race? It absurdly throws around a word that should be reserved for true racists. When she calls a real racist a racist, nobody is going to believe her. She's crying wolf and it dilutes the meaning of the word 'racism.' So shame on Maxine Waters."\u000a\u000aThe renowned Harvard Law professor emeritus also called out Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, who demanded in a tweet that Dershowitz "stop the racist B.S."\u000a\u000a"He's just dead wrong. And he's been wrong about so many things. He is so determined to find criminal conduct on the part of Trump that he's prepared to make up crimes that don't exist. How he served as an ethics lawyer for any administration is unclear to me," Dershowitz told Cosby.\u000a\u000a"I think he has to look in the mirror and question his own ethics using the word 'racism' to describe what he understands because he's a lawyer. He understands that what I'm saying is factually, absolutely correct.\u000a\u000a"And I challenge him to deny that it's correct, that you'll get a different composition of a jury pool in the District of Columbia than in Virginia and that the different composition will favor the prosecution over what they would've gotten in Virginia."\u000a\u000aDershowitz compared Mueller's probe into Russia and Trump to the characters in Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel, "Moby Dick," in which a vengeful sea captain named Ahab hunts a gigantic whale that chewed off his leg.\u000a\u000a"This is Ahab and the white whale Moby Dick. When you give a special counsel or a special prosecutor a job their job is to come back with something. If Mueller does two years of investigation extraordinary expense to the American public and says there's nothing there, many people will say he failed at his job," Dershowitz said.\u000a\u000a"So there's an incentive to find something. Remember with Bill Clinton. They started out with Whitewater and ended up with Monica Lewinsky. So in practice there's very little constraint on what Mueller can find.\u000a\u000a"Good lawyers don't stumble. They discover something because they're looking for it. I think Mueller will be looking to try to find crime wherever it is and then try to relate it back to the Russia probe."

aVLong before "The Passion of the Christ" became a runaway box office hit, raking in more than $370 million domestically since its 2004 debut, Christian films have had a spot in Hollywood history.\u000a\u000aFaith-based movies have recently enjoyed a resurrection. Audiences looking to see their own beliefs reflected on the big screen turned out in droves for films like 2014's "Heaven Is for Real" ($91.4 million), 2015's "War Room" ($67.7 million), and this year's "Miracles From Heaven" ($61.7 million).\u000a\u000aChristianity is still the most common belief system in the United States, not just the world. For example, more than two-thirds of Americans \u2014 68 percent to 75.2 percent or up to 242.72 million people \u2014 believe in Christianity, Jesus, and miracles, while up to 86 percent (or about 277.57 million people) believe in God, according to Movieguide, the biggest faith-based, family review service. In contrast to this, only 8 percent to 18 percent of America\u2019s 322.76 million people refuse to believe in God or the Jesus of the Bible.\u000a\u000aThat said, movies about Jesus Christ and movies with strong Christian and biblical moral content dominate 90 percent of the top-grossing movies worldwide, not just in Christian countries, because people have hard lives and are looking for the good, the true, and the beautiful to triumph, which usually leads them to want a savior, whether allegorical or christological.\u000a\u000aAlert: Prayer Changes Your Brain in 4 Amazing Ways\u000a\u000aA procession of Christian films paved the way for these modern-day, box-office success stories. Here, the editors of Movieguide and its publisher, Ted Baehr, have compiled for Newsmax a list of what they feel are the Top 25 Christian Movies of All Time.\u000a\u000aThe list is meant as a conversation starter, and not necessarily meant as a definitive list. The list considers the Christological, biblical content of each movie, combined with the movie\u2019s aesthetic and entertainment value, its visual or cinematic quality, its dramatic power, the cohesion and energy behind its narrative structure, its moral and spiritual acceptability for family audiences, and the moral and spiritual depth of its message and themes.\u000a\u000a1. "The King of Kings" (1927- silent), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The famous H.B. Warner played Jesus in Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s "King of Kings," still the classic of all movies about Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a2. "Quo Vadis" (1951), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This very Christian classic places Marcus Vinicius, played by Robert Taylor, between the tyrannical Nero, played by Peter Ustinov, and the beautiful redeemed Christian Lygia, played by Deborah Kerr. The movie includes a great explanation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by St. Peter.\u000a\u000a3. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" (2005), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," based on C. S. Lewis\u2019 popular Christian fable, tells the story of four English children who enter the land of Narnia, where they meet Aslan, the son of the Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea, who rescues the land from the evil White Witch. Despite some minor changes from the book, "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe," retains most of its Christian focus and is tremendously exciting, thrilling, and redemptive.\u000a\u000a4. "The Robe" (1953), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Starring Richard Burton, Jean Simmons, and Victor Mature, this Hollywood Cinemascope spectacle is the story of an Ancient Roman soldier, who turns to Christianity when embracing the robe of Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a5. "Les Misrables" (1934), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Based on the redemptive novel by Victor Hugo, "Les Misrables" tells the redeeming story of Jean Valjean who goes to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister\u2019s child and then comes to Jesus Christ through the sacrificial love of a poor bishop. Jean becomes a new man and dedicates his life to helping others though he is pursued by the unforgiving Javert.\u000a\u000aAlso highly recommended:\u000a\u000a"Les Misrables" (2012), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: The Hollywood film version of the beloved musical play of Victor Hugo\u2019s novel about an ex-convict whose life is redeemed, though is still hounded by a legalistic policeman. "Les Misrables" is a brilliant adaptation of this inspiring, spiritually uplifting Christian story that beautifully depicts God\u2019s transformational powers though the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but it contains some harsh scenes showing the brokenness of humanity without God. "Les Misrables" (1998), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean, a reformed convict pursued his whole life by a legalistic police inspector. Literally overflowing with redemption and grace in the face of horrible legalism, rigidity, and the perils of war, this journey is wonderfully told through a near flawless script, excellent acting, great photography, and wonderful set design with moderate violence and no sex or nudity. "Les Misrables" (1995), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The magnificent movie by Claude Lelouch, "Les Misrables" is not another adaptation of Victor Hugo's redemptive story; instead, the movie is a unique re-telling of Hugo's masterpiece using Hugo's work as a metaphor for life. Henri Fortin travels through life from boxer, to prisoner, to criminal, to a man redeemed through the cruel and miserable experiences in the midst of the German cruel occupation of France during World War II.\u000a\u000a6.

"Lilies of the Field" (1963), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Featuring a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance by Sidney Poitier, this wonderful family movie teaches the Gospel in a winsome, entertaining way that\u2019s unsurpassed by most other movies. In the story, a group of German nuns transplanted to Southwest America convince a young black man to help them build a local church. In the meantime, the young man teaches the nuns the joys of Pentecostal Protestant worship focused on Jesus and His Gospel. Both Jesus and the local church are lifted up.\u000a\u000a8. "Sergeant York" (1941), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Based on the diary of Alvin York, the most decorated soldier in World War I, this moving story tells about a willful man, played by Oscar winner Gary Cooper, who comes to Jesus Christ and comes to terms with war.\u000a\u000a9. "The Passion of the Christ" (2004), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -2: Though the violent R-rated version is too strong for younger teenagers and other susceptible viewers, there is a PG-13 version of this powerful movie by Mel Gibson, with a striking performance by Jim Caviezel and a heartbreaking, but ultimately uplifting ending that stirs the imagination and pierces the heart.\u000a\u000a10. "Ben-Hur" (1959), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Subtitled "A Tale of the Christ," this is an epic story of a young Jewish man, Judah Ben-Hur, played by an Oscar-winning Charlton Heston, who lives at the time of Christ.

"The Lord of the Rings" Trilogy (2001, 2002, 2003), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: The greatest, most redemptive fantasy epic ever written, about Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Fellowship of the Ring, becomes the greatest, most redemptive fantasy epic ever filmed. A spectacular, singular achievement in filmmaking.\u000a\u000a12. "Repentance" (1987 \u2013 subtitled, Soviet Union), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +2: "Repentance" is the one movie credited with helping to overthrow Communism. This magnificent movie exposes the evils of communism, statism, and totalitarianism while lifting up the suffering and the triumphant, eternal Church of Christ Jesus.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000a13. "Chariots of Fire" (1981), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: In this Academy Award-winning Best Picture, Eric Liddell is a Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of Jesus in the 1924 Olympic games and who believes that Christ is his trainer.\u000a\u000a14.

"Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days" (2005), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: In the German movie "Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days," Sophie and her brother, Hans, are part of a small group of Christians who are trying to instigate a student uprising to overthrow Adolf Hitler's National Socialist government in 1943. They are caught by the Gestapo, but Sophie challenges the investigator with a very strong evangelistic, Christian, Trinitarian refutation of the Nazi position. This movie is overtly Christian, but, more than that, it contains tremendous Christian theology as Sophie confronts National Socialism.\u000a\u000a17. "The Ten Commandments" (1956), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: A remake of a movie he did many years previously, this Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic remains a favorite today. Christians like it because it is a Bible story. Jews like it because Moses is one of their heroes. Everybody likes it because it is masterful, engrossing filmmaking. Though not entirely biblically correct, it gives a powerful examination of one of mankind's greatest leaders, superbly portrayed by Charlton Heston.\u000a\u000a18. "Places in the Heart" (1984), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: This movie, which stars Oscar-winning actress Sally Field, clearly shows that faith in Jesus Christ overcomes all obstacles \u2014 even death.\u000a\u000a19.

"It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: Jimmy Stewart plays the beleaguered but good-hearted George Bailey, who finds out what life would be like if he\u2019d never been born. A very slight caution is urged because of the false angelology, although the movie is high on our list because of its emotive revelation of man\u2019s relationship to God, who answers our prayers.\u000a\u000a21. "Lady Jane" (1986), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: This is the powerful story of Lady Jane Grey who was crowned by the Reform Christians in England and ruled for nine days before being martyred for her strong faith in God and His Bible.\u000a\u000a22. "Eleni" (1985), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +2: "Eleni" is the greatest movie about a mother\u2019s love in the face of adversity. It is the true story of a mother who was murdered by the communists during the Greek Civil War.

The best of the Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" adaptations: There are at least 15 movie and 25 television adaptations of Charles Dickens\u2019 "A Christmas Carol," according to the International Movie Database. Here are the best:\u000a\u000a"Scrooge" (1951), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: Starring Alastair Sim, this well-crafted and faithful version of Dickens\u2019 classic is so good it can be watched year-round.

"The Muppet Christmas Carol" (1992), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +3: This is a live-action musical that retells the classic Dickens story with all our Muppet favorites, and actor Michael Caine as Scrooge.

"A Christmas Carol" (2009), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: This 2009 animated version features an excellent motion capture performance by Jim Carrey and overt references to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a24. "A Man Called Peter" (1955), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This fine movie demonstrates a contemporary champion of the faith, Scotsman Peter Marshall, who became clergyman and U.S. Senate chaplain.\u000a\u000a25. "True Grit" (2010), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -2: "True Grit," adapted from the Charles Portis novel by Joel and Ethan Coen, hews a bit more closely to the book but also pays some homage to the 1969 version starring the great John Wayne. After her father is killed in cold blood, spunky 14-year-old Presbyterian farm girl Mattie Ross hires one-eyed U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to track down the killer. "True Grit" has a lot of humor, but it also has some heart-rending moments. There are, however, some strong obscenities and profanities, and one violent scene is extreme, but the movie\u2019s overt Christian, biblical themes and powerful spirit of chivalry and justice are thoroughly stirring.\u000a\u000aTed Baehr is publisher of MOVIEGUIDE(r), a family guide to entertainment, and the chairman of The Christian Film & Television Commission\u2122.

aVThe journal Cancer Research reported on the effects of dietary sugar on breast cancer.\u000a\u000aIn the study, mice were randomly fed one of three diets: the first was a fructose-enriched diet, the second a sucrose-enriched diet, and the third was a starch-controlled diet.\u000a\u000aThe researchers found that sucrose and fructose intake in mice that was comparable with levels in human Western diets led to increased tumor growth and metastasis, when compared with the starch-controlled diet.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the researchers determined that fructose that was derived from the sucrose was responsible for facilitating lung metastasis in breast cancer tumors.\u000a\u000aThe authors hypothesized that the increase in the tumor-forming effect was caused by the overproduction of inflammatory mediators such as 12-lipoxygenase and its metabolites.\u000a\u000aThey concluded, \u201c. . . our data suggested that dietary sugar . . . increase[s] the risk of breast cancer development and metastasis.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis study confirms that some of the most commonly consumed sugars \u2014 fructose and sucrose \u2014 increase the formation of breast cancer tumors.\u000a\u000aFructose is a very large component of the standard American diet. It is found in numerous soft drinks and processed foods, usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup.\u000a\u000aBreast cancer is occurring at epidemic rates: 1 in 7 women in the U.S. currently suffer.\u000a\u000aAnd unless we search for the underlying cause(s) of this epidemic, we will make little progress in stemming the tide.\u000a\u000aI believe the breast cancer epidemic is occurring, at least in part, because of widespread poor diets that consist of too much sugar.\u000a\u000aRefined sugar in the form of sucrose or high fructose corn syrup can disrupt a person\u2019s immune system. In fact, it has been shown to slow white blood cell activity for up to six hours after ingestion.\u000a\u000aWe simply get too much sugar in our diets. I suggest limiting \u2014 or better yet eliminating \u2014 all sources of refined sugar. It\u2019s hard, but it can be done.\u000a\u000aMore information can be found in my book, The Guide to Healthy Eating.

aVSponsored Content\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(Washington, D.C.) -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is unveiling a new \u201cLet\u2019s Get America Working\u201d campaign in advance of the 2016 election that will encourage both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to endorse a pro-worker platform.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the center of the platform is the need for this country to invest in infrastructure, which in turn will create good jobs for everyday Americans. Working on transportation, energy and water projects will put thousands to work in construction jobs across the country. It will also improve roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure, which in turn will help business and improve the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Labor Department\u2019s own statistics support the Teamsters\u2019 initiative. The median union worker earns more than $200 a week more than the median non-union worker. That\u2019s an extra $10,000 a year that goes into the pockets of union workers. These jobs also offer health benefits and retirement security.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile unemployment is down, the vast majority of jobs being created pay low wages,\u201d Teamster General President Jim Hoffa said. \u201cWe can stop this trend and create good-paying union jobs if government invests in our nation\u2019s workforce.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInfrastructure presents an opportunity to break the political gridlock. Congress in late July approved a three-month extension for spending on transportation projects that provides a temporary patch until the end of October for the continuing issue of road and rail funding. But it is not a real solution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 2008, Congress has transferred more than $62 billion from the general fund to keep the Highway Trust Fund afloat, and it has been more than a decade since Congress has passed a highway bill more than two years in duration. Meanwhile, the transportation system continues to crumble and the safety of those who work and travel along the vast network of U.S. roads and rails is being jeopardized. Our nation\u2019s failure to maintain and improve our infrastructure is costing Americans more and more.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere also is a significant need to move forward with a broader agenda that puts U.S. workers first. That means standing up against lousy trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that send American jobs overseas; protecting workers\u2019 rights to form unions and collectively bargain; increasing affordability of college and vocational schools; and ensuring retirement and pension security for working families.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLawmakers need to remember that dollars invested in education, job training and supporting retirement for those who worked hard all their lives helps not only individuals, but our society as a whole. These are promises each generation in this country has made to the next and we can\u2019t forget it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut if this nation is going to improve the lives of its citizens, Congress needs to advance bipartisan policies that will encourage good job growth. And it must put the current and future generations of workers in a position to succeed in the workforce by giving them the skills they need.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere was a time when all these issues weren\u2019t partisan issues \u2013 they were American values, something everyone could support. But government is broken. Partisan bickering has replaced finding solutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential for the Teamsters and like-minded allies all over the country to join together and push this message with lawmakers, colleagues, friends and family.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf elected officials from both parties want to rebuild and repair the trust between government and workers, they need to reinvest in people that have and can continue to make this country great. Better pay will lead to more spending and improve workers\u2019 quality of life. That way everyone wins.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s Get America Working! Now is the time to Build, Repair and Maintain America!

aVImmigration policy is like dating policy: It sets boundaries for how one expects to be treated. Western countries have been in an unspoken competition to come across as the least uptight about immigration. Meanwhile, countries that take a hard-line approach to immigration are viewed like a controlling boyfriend rather than someone who simply refuses to buy into the idea of an open relationship with the rest of the world.\u000a\u000aMaybe it was inevitable that someone who's immune to peer pressure would decide to put his foot down on the subject. That person is U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration announced planned immigration reforms last week that have already prompted whining.\u000a\u000aMuch of the outrage has been directed toward Trump's support of a bill to implement a meritocratic, points-based immigration system that favors professional skills rather than family relations. (Canada and Australia already have such systems, but they're seemingly immune to criticism simply because those nations seem pretty chill.) Some of the points awarded in the new system would be based on salary level, rewarding foreign nationals who have been offered high-paying jobs in the United States \u2014 an attempt to reverse the cheap imported labor trend that has done so much harm to the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000aEssentially, former Miss Universe pageant owner Trump wants to favor perfect 10s with his immigration reforms. This was destined to get some folks riled up, particularly in an era when rewarding the pursuit of excellence is considered anti-democratic at best and bigoted at worst.\u000a\u000aAt a press conference to announce the reforms, CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta recited part of the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."\u000a\u000a"It doesn't say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer," Acosta said.\u000a\u000aAcosta has confused sensible immigration policy with a barfly's late-night dating strategy. While in politically correct company, most people will talk about how everyone is equal and beautiful, and blah, blah, blah, but let's face it: Most people don't just take anyone home. Neither should America.\u000a\u000aAt least Trump's "perfect 10" immigrant-recruitment strategy favors talent over eveningwear. Trump wants to eliminate the shallow, skin-deep Diversity Visa lottery program and supports a Senate bill seeking to do just that. A strictly talent- and merit-based system means applicants with desire, dedication and determination, as proven by their effort to meet the high standards required for immigration, will be rewarded. "Potential" doesn't count, nor should it. Just consider all the guys you knew in high school who boasted of their "potential" to play pro football to understand why.\u000a\u000aI'm a "chronic immigrant" myself (to both the U.S. and Europe), and I've always immigrated in professional categories that require mountains of paperwork to justify one's skills, abilities and revenues. When you have to jump through so many hoops, it can be frustrating to encounter people in your adopted country who did nothing more than marry a native citizen (or who had the good fortune to come from a country with a high immigration quota) to gain their visa or residency status.\u000a\u000aThe version of immigration that Acosta gleaned from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, while poetic, doesn't reflect reality. Worldwide immigration isn't always blind and has long been discriminatory, favoring certain groups over others. A points-based meritocracy puts more power into the hands of the individual applicant, regardless of race or origin.\u000a\u000aTaken a step further, meritocratic immigration allows people to play the globalization game to their own benefit, providing freedom to the individual. When countries drop their immigration barriers in order to compete with one another for foreign talent, immigrants can move around as they please, choosing the countries that deliver the greatest personal benefit. The ideal outcome would be for a large group of such individuals to become powerful enough to influence policy decisions that favor individual freedoms over the whims of special interest groups.\u000a\u000aWhat are the odds that powerful lobbying groups will condone government policies that empower the individual to opt out of the traditional rat race, control their own destiny, and live and work on their own terms anywhere in the world that they choose?\u000a\u000aIf a U.S. president takes steps to empower immigrants to support themselves independently, it's inevitable that there will be pushback from those who thrive on the dependency of immigrants. That's exactly what we're witnessing right now.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRachel Marsden is a Paris-based conservative commentator, political strategist and professor.

aVBillionaire value investor Howard Marks warns savvy investors that the bond market bubble continues to linger while the stock market is way overvalued.\u000a\u000a"There's nothing that's cheap today," the Oaktree Capital co-chairman told CNBC.\u000a\u000a"We're in a bond bubble ... Bonds yield the least they've ever had," he said.\u000a\u000a"P/E ratios are higher than usual," he said. "That is not a position that warrants a full ration of risk."\u000a\u000aHe also warned that certain technology stocks have been "anointed" like "nothing can go wrong" and that makes them a "dangerous place" for most investors.\u000a\u000a"Several times in my career, which spans almost fifty years, I've seen one group of stocks anointed as super stocks. The companies are so great that nothing can go wrong. Because they are so great there is no price too high ... [But] the key to understand the markets, everything of value or truth eventually gets overdone."\u000a\u000a"The willingness of people to say, 'I love the FANGs, there is no price too high,'" is worrisome, he told CNBC, referring to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.\u000a\u000aIf index funds "buy the FANGs regardless of price then that's a risk. There's nobody sitting at the index funds saying let's not buy that today because it's too expensive. They have to buy it," Marks said.\u000a\u000a"And anytime people buy because they have to, then the world is a dangerous place."\u000a\u000aTo be aure, the S&P 500 index had its biggest one-day drop in almost three months on Thursday as investors fled riskier assets, with technology stocks leading the charge, in response to an increasingly aggressive exchange of threats between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aU.S. equities steepened their losses late in the session after President Donald Trump said his earlier warnings to North Korea may not have been tough enough. He also said the nuclear-armed nation should be "very, very nervous" if it even thinks about attacking the United States or its allies, Reuters reported.\u000a\u000aTrump was responding to North Korea's claim it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aInvestors have been jittery about North Korea since Tuesday when Trump said any threats from Pyongyang would be "met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVTom Barrack, a billionaire real estate investor, could become the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, according to Politico.\u000a\u000aWhite House officials and advisers told Politico that Barrack, a close friend of the president, is a leading candidate but he has expressed concerns about the position. "It is his if he wants it," one of the officials said.\u000a\u000aOne White House official said that Barrack would like to have some authority in South America and "really try to set some wider policy," Politico reports.\u000a\u000aBarrack has encouraged Trump to govern in a manner that appeals to more people than just his base supporters.\u000a\u000aTrump "usually leaves his conversations with Barrack on the right track," one of the sources told Politico.\u000a\u000aThe president addressed the ambassadorship in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal interview, in which Trump asked Wall Street Journal reporters if they liked Barrack.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"Call him up, tell him I'm giving it to him," Trump said in the interview to reporters, according to a transcript obtained by Politico.\u000a\u000aBarrack helped introduce Trump to his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, according to an April report in The New York Times.

Not anymore.Groups like Friends of Abe, a conclave of Hollywood and entertainment professionals, are thriving. Actors like the late Charlton Heston, an outspoken Republican and advocate of gun freedom, helped pave the way.One caveat here: The conservative-leaning celebrities listed here may not be going to a Ted Cruz rally anytime soon. They are better described as Hollywood contrarians; they don\u2019t typically advocate any hardcore political agenda.Instead, they are for a new openness in Hollywood, and don\u2019t accept the old industry standard that one has to be a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party to find career advancement.Oftentimes these conservatives are more libertarian than traditional, button-down Republicans.Whatever their stripes, they are a unique and exciting breed changing Hollywood and, we hope, America for the better.Here, Newsmax has compiled a list of 50 influential leaders of this cultural minority who have bucked Hollywood\u2019s liberal establishment and thrived.\u2014 The actor and director famously trashed President Barack Obama in 2012 at the Republican National Convention and stirred up a firestorm of liberal griping with his patriotic film, "American Sniper."\u2014 The star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series of hit movies is not shy about voicing his Christian conservative beliefs.

aVThe women who made this year's list of 100 Most Influential Republican Women often have the word \u201cfirst\u201d next to their names: First female senator from their respective states, first Hispanic female governor, first woman combat pilot, first lady.\u000a\u000aIndeed, they are leading GOP voices at a time when the party is trying to reach women voters through a variety of channels \u2014 politics, media, business, and academics.\u000a\u000aThese women are self-styled pioneers who, despite their varied public roles, share a core set of conservative principles and beliefs.\u000a\u000a1. Betsy DeVos \u2014 A businesswoman and generous GOP donor, DeVos won confirmation as education secretary after a bruising and partisan Senate fight, which President Donald Trump called a "very tough trial and a very unfair trial." But, there\u2019s no disputing that the longtime school choice crusader has the opportunity now to remake the way American kids are taught.\u000a\u000a2. Sarah Palin \u2014 While she is unlikely to run for office again, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee remains influential with a small but active wing of the GOP \u2014 mostly evangelical women and Tea Party voters. She was an early supporter of Trump and remains close to him.\u000a\u000aEditor's Note: Trump Is #MAGA Rearming America. It\u2019s an Investing Opportunity!\u000a\u000a3. Elaine Chao \u2014 Half of a Washington power couple, Chao is the first Chinese-American to serve in a federal Cabinet. She served as Labor secretary under George W. Bush and now serves as Transportation secretary under Trump. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000a4. Susan Collins \u2014 As dean of the Senate GOP moderates, Collins already has had a series of run-ins with Trump; she didn\u2019t vote for him last fall and has opposed his healthcare reform efforts this year. Still, she remains highly influential among centrists, from both parties, and women. Leaving Collins out of the Senate working group on healthcare turned out to have disastrous consequences for Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000a5. Nikki Haley \u2014 Trump tapped the former South Carolina governor to be his United Nations ambassador, making her the only Indian-American to serve in his administration. Haley has struck an aggressive and independent tone at the UN, frequently challenging Russia, Syria, and North Korea.\u000a\u000a6. Marsha Blackburn \u2014 The Tennessee congressman (she prefers to be identified that way) served on Trump\u2019s transition team and is now serving her eighth House term. Blackburn chairs the select committee investigating Planned Parenthood, which she has urged Congress to strip of federal funding.\u000a\u000a7. Lisa Murkowski \u2014 Appointed to her father\u2019s Senate seat by him when he was elected governor in 2002, Murkowski later became the first woman elected to Congress from Alaska. And, in 2010, she became only the second senator ever to win a write-in campaign, defeating a Palin-backed candidate. In the Senate, she frequently aligns with moderates and was one of two female senators, along with Collins, to oppose the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of Obamacare.\u000a\u000a8. Nancy Brinker \u2014 The founder of the breast cancer advocacy organization Susan G. Komen, Brinker also served as the ambassador to Hungary and U.S. chief of protocol under President George W. Bush. Spotted in the West Wing every so often, she\u2019s also an accomplished author, businesswoman, and host of the interview series "Conversations with Nancy Brinker" on Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000a9. Melania Trump \u2014 Though she has maintained a decidedly low profile this year, the first lady is still building a following among Trump loyalists who appreciate her style and grace.\u000a\u000a10. Ana Navarro \u2014 The Nicaraguan-born GOP strategist and TV pundit made a name for herself in 2016 when she became a staunch critic of Trump and his supporters. She has advised the presidential campaigns of Jeb Bush, Jon Huntsman, and John McCain.\u000a\u000a11. Peggy Noonan \u2014 The former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan has written for The Wall Street Journal for years, and she won a Pulitzer Prize this year for, the Pulitzer committee said, \u201crising to the moment with beautifully rendered columns that connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation\u2019s most divisive political campaigns.\u201d\u000a\u000a12. Cathy McMorris Rodgers \u2014 As the House GOP Conference chair, McMorris Rodgers is the party\u2019s highest-ranking woman in Congress. She maintains a staunchly conservative voting record, drawing high scores from the Family Research Council, Chamber of Commerce, and American Conservative Union.\u000a\u000a13. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen \u2014 The dean of the Florida delegation and most senior House GOP woman, Ros-Lehtinen is retiring in 2018.

aVA federal judge on Thursday ordered the writer of an editorial in The New York Times that mentioned former vice presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to testify next week so he can decide whether her defamation lawsuit can proceed.\u000a\u000aU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff set an Aug. 16 hearing. New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an emailed statement that the newspaper will comply with the order. Lawyers for Palin did not immediately comment.\u000a\u000aThe judge said the testimony was necessary to determine whether to grant the Times' request to reject the lawsuit before the newspaper is required to turn over documents such as email records that could be used by Palin's lawyers to develop evidence.\u000a\u000aThe judge called it a "close question" whether there were sufficient allegations of actual malice in the lawsuit to let it proceed.\u000a\u000aPalin, a Republican, sued the Times for unspecified damages in June, citing an editorial that month about gun control published after Louisiana U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, also a Republican, was shot in Washington.\u000a\u000aIn the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 shooting of then-Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.\u000a\u000aThe editorial was criticized by some readers who challenged the notion that the map constituted "political incitement" or that there was any "link" between it and the Arizona shooting, the Times lawyers have said.\u000a\u000aThey said the Times revised the online version of the editorial the following morning to remove those references and to make clear that the crosshairs on the map appeared over Giffords' district rather than over her name or image.\u000a\u000aThe lawyers also noted that the newspaper published a series of corrections and wrote on social media: "We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake."\u000a\u000aPalin, in her lawsuit, said the newspaper had accused her of inciting the mass shooting that severely wounded Giffords and killed six people. Palin's lawyers said the Times "violated the law and its own policies."\u000a\u000aThe judge said the kind of information he wanted to learn at next week's hearing was whether the editorial writer or writers were aware of articles the Times had previously published that conflicted with what was written in the editorial.

aVNorth Korea's threat to launch missiles at Guam must be "considered carefully," and it can't be ignored, Rep. Trent Franks, a member of the House Armed Services and Judiciary Committees, said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"We only have a short period of time to ascertain the trajectory, and whether or not the missiles are on track to hit Guam," the Arizona Republican told MSNBC. "If we think that trajectory is on track, we would have to engage our own missile defense capability."\u000a\u000aThe United States should not be where it is, but the decisions of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have left the country in a perilous state with not only North Korea, but also Iran.\u000a\u000a"Bill Clinton had an opportunity to negotiate with the North Koreans, and he made a deal," Franks said. "He paid the ransom but didn't secure the hostage. Barack Obama did the same thing with Iran."\u000a\u000aNow, Franks said, the United States is facing a situation in which its most dangerous enemies could be armed with nuclear weapons, and "that's not good news for children and future generations."\u000a\u000aThe United States, he continued, as two ways to defend itself against intercontinental ballistic missiles bearing nuclear warheads: either to interdict them in flight or to be able to prevent them from being launched.\u000a\u000a"The main predicate for decades now against very dangerous enemies has been deterrence," said Franks. "They have to believe there's no gain in attacking the United States. I think the president is making it clear to North Korea that if they should attack the United States with nuclear weapons, that there will be absolutely no gain to them, and great harm to them if that occurs."\u000a\u000aHe said he does believe that President Donald Trump, with his strong warnings to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, is making it clear that North Korea will meet with no gain should it attack the United States with nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, there has been a great deal of information on North Korea for decades, and the opportunity to deny the country the capability for nuclear weapons, said Franks.

aVJane Hodgson, who died about a decade ago, was celebrated in liberal circles as a pioneer of abortion rights. She was a master at justifying the killing of human life in the womb.\u000a\u000aWriting about her for the National Right to life News Today (reproduced in lifenews.com, Aug. 3, 2017) Dave Andrusko quoted some of her rationalizations:\u000a\u000a"[T]here is a medical indication to abort a pregnancy where it is not wanted."\u000a\u000a"I am concerned with the quality of life, not physical existence."\u000a\u000a"A medically necessary abortion is any abortion a woman asks for."\u000a\u000a"Is adolescent pregnancy a disease?" Implied is that the answer is "Yes." Pregnancy a "disease"?\u000a\u000aThis gets me to thinking about how the widespread acceptance of a culture of death has jaded the thinking of so many people. The acceptance of abortion has helped lead the way.\u000a\u000aIs the baby inside the womb just, "A product of conception"? "A clump of cells"? A non-person"?\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Supreme Court found in Roe v. Wade ( U.S. 1973), writing, " . . . the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn."\u000a\u000aOr, are we "fearfully and wonderfully made," as the Bible says?\u000a\u000aDavid the psalmist praises God, "For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. . . . all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."\u000a\u000aDavid\u2019s son, Solomon the Wise, would go on to say that life and death are in the power of the tongue. Think about how words can build up or tear down, affirm life, or dehumanize it.\u000a\u000aI remember when Barack Obama said that if his daughter had an unwanted pregnancy, he would not want her to be "punished with a baby." Wait until he has a grandchild, I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll be saying, "What was I thinking?" Words matter.\u000a\u000aThe word "fetus," which some use to depersonalize the baby, is actually just the Latin word for unborn child. Think about even the term "pro-choice." Someone once asked, "What do you choose when you\u2019re pro-choice?" Pro-choice means being pro-abortion. I\u2019m for choices, but not for abortion.\u000a\u000aHumanists love Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. I don\u2019t. Maybe he saw too much blood and guts during the Civil War. He helped ruin America by applying evolutionary principles to the law. As a result, in his view, court precedents outweigh the founders\u2019 intent. As a Supreme Court justice, he famously wrote in favor of mandatory sterilization of a woman who did not want to be sterilized: "Three generations of imbeciles is enough." (Buck v. Bell, U.S. 1927).\u000a\u000aWhat the Nazis did was evil. No one referenced in this column is being compared to them. But they were masters at dehumanizing the victims they killed.\u000a\u000aMany years ago I had the privilege of interviewing Dr. William Brennan, a now-retired professor from St. Louis University. Brennan did a lot of research on the use of words and especially how euphemisms could be invoked to mask killing, including in Nazi Germany.\u000a\u000aDr. Brennan wrote "Dehumanizing the Vulnerable." Note the subtitle of this 1995 book: "When Word Games Take Lives." He provides numerous examples of how dehumanizing takes place before mass killings:\u000a\u000aIn 1913 (on November 13 or 14), Nikolai Lenin (who authorized a wholesale attack against Christians and others), (in writing to Maxim Gorky) said, "Every religious idea, every idea of god, every flirtation with the idea of God is unutterable vileness . . . vileness of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind" . . .\u000a\u000aAdolf Hitler said in a 1923 speech (at the Krone Circus in Munich) "The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but not human."\u000a\u000a"The Jew is a parasite." (Quote is attributable to Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's progaganda minister on March 4, 1944., ed. note.)\u000a\u000aBrennan points out how, in 1920, long before the Nazis, two German authors (a doctor and a lawyer) wrote "Permitting the Destruction of Unworthy Life." These authors spoke about how some human beings, such as the severely handicapped, should not be allowed to continue to live.\u000a\u000aBrennan points out the dehumanizing phrases the authors used to dehumanize people: "mentally dead," "incurably insane," "complete idiots," "empty human shells," "dead weight existences," "defective people," "wholly worthless," "valueless lives," which were "lives not worth living."\u000a\u000aBrennan once told me, "The Nazis never used the word 'kill'when they talked about what they did. They covered it up with an array of code words and euphemisms."\u000a\u000aAnd he added, "Projecting fifty years into the future, when abortion is illegal, and they look back to this point in time, they will probably look back in astonishment, just as we now look back to the Nazi Holocaust and wonder what happened there?"\u000a\u000aEuphemisms happened.\u000a\u000aThe Bible says that God created us in his own image. This miraculous gift of life is something to be cherished by the words used and the actions taken. It\u2019s the difference between a culture of life and a culture of death.\u000a\u000aJerry Newcombe is co-host/senior TV producer of Kennedy Classics.

aVAmerica's need for China to back tougher sanctions against North Korea ended up killing the U.S. effort to strike back at China over intellectual property violations, Asia expert Gordon Chang tells Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration had been looking at enforcing Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, but needed China to support a U.N. Security Council resolution against China's ally, North Korea. The effort appears to have worked, with the sanctions passing the Security Council on Saturday 15-0.\u000a\u000aNow, the effort to punish China for its "predatory, intellectual property rules" is "probably dead for a long time," Chang told "Newsmax Now" host Bill Tucker on Monday.\u000a\u000a"It affects so many U.S. companies," Chang said. "It goes to the heart of U.S. economic strength and we really need to do this."\u000a\u000aThe United States refuses to get firm, he added, because we are "sort of afraid of China."\u000a\u000aAmerica has always wanted to integrate China into the international system so it has placed a much higher priority on that than disarming North Korea, he said.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump doesn't want to cave in to China, but, like previous administrations, still does at critical times, Chang said.\u000a\u000a"Across the board we have deferred acting on trade, which is I think so important to American workers," he said. "The president was elected to help American workers, help American businesses. \u2026 Right now American workers have been used as bargaining chips, they've been traded away, and the president has got to do something because after 200 days, and today is the 200th day of his presidency, there's been very little done on Chinese predatory trade practices."\u000a\u000aAs for North Korea's threats of "thousands-fold" retribution against the United States for the increased sanctions, Chang said the bigger threat is Pyongyang's ability within a year to hit virtually the entire U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile.\u000a\u000a"It may not be a great weapon, it might have a guidance system which means they're a couple miles off, but nonetheless it doesn't really matter when you aim a weapon toward a city like New York," he said. "So clearly this is a time frame for us. If we don't think we can deter the North Koreans, and that's a very important issue, but if we don't think that we can deter the North Koreans, we're going to use force."

aVThe Swiss central bank currently holds over $750 billion in foreign assets, with a massive portion of those based in the United States.\u000a\u000aBut Swiss politicians want to bring that money back inside their borders.\u000a\u000aWhat will happen to the U.S. market if they succeed?\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s why the Swiss central bank is accumulating such massive positions in U.S. equities, and what the consequences could be if they start selling them off\u2026\u000a\u000aWeakening the Franc\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, the Swiss central bank is employing these tactics in order to weaken the franc, their national currency. And the easiest way to do that is by \u201cprinting\u201d francs, converting them to dollars, and using those dollars to buy up foreign assets.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s exactly what the Swiss central bank has been doing for the past several years. But the policy isn\u2019t without consequence.\u000a\u000aSwiss citizens and politicians are becoming increasingly frustrated as their national currency is being manipulated and invested outside the country. And internationally, there\u2019s growing concern about the impact on global markets when the Swiss central bank begins paring down its enormous investments.\u000a\u000aBolstering U.S. Stocks\u000a\u000aSo just how big is the Swiss central bank\u2019s stake in the U.S. stock market? And how quickly is it growing?\u000a\u000aWell, as of February, the bank had amassed a new record of $63.4 billion in U.S. stock holdings. Then in July, that number grew to another new record of over $80 billion.\u000a\u000aTo see the Swiss central bank\u2019s largest U.S. stock positions, you can see a chart at the Wall Street Journal.\u000a\u000aBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. This chart only shows the Swiss central bank\u2019s holdings above $1 billion. It also holds smaller positions in a myriad of other U.S. companies.\u000a\u000aData from the NASDAQ shows the Swiss central bank also holds:\u000a\u000a$942 million in AT&T\u000a\u000a$912 million in Proctor and Gamble\u000a\u000a$801 million in GE\u000a\u000a$797 million in Verizon\u000a\u000a\u2026and the list goes on.\u000a\u000aThis all raises a very important question\u2026\u000a\u000aWhat Happens When the Swiss Start Selling?\u000a\u000aThe U.S. equities market is already grossly overvalued. And as the Swiss central bank continues loading up on U.S. stocks, it will only artificially inflate markets further.\u000a\u000aBut eventually, the Swiss central bank will be forced to wind down all this buying. Swiss politicians are already putting pressure on the central bank to bring money back into their country, and to stop spending it elsewhere through foreign investments. Plus, to avoid destroying the franc entirely, Swiss central bankers will have to stop creating new money to fund U.S stock purchases.\u000a\u000aThat said, even if the Swiss central bank liquidates its positions in the U.S. market slowly, it could put a painful squeeze on stocks. And with prices already heavily inflated, that selling activity may trigger a serious correction.\u000a\u000aPeter Reagan is a financial market strategist at Birch Gold Group.

aVThrough most historical lenses, the tempest in equities over the last three days is barely noticeable. View it next to the market\u2019s eerie dormancy heading into the fraught month of August and it stands out.\u000a\u000aSuddenly at risk is a feat with no precedent in U.S. stocks, the S&P 500\u2019s streak of 15 straight days without swinging 0.3 percent in either direction. Selling picked up Thursday morning to swell the three-day decline to 1 percent -- practically a rout in a market that hasn\u2019t had a peak-to-trough drawdown exceeding 3 percent in nine months.\u000a\u000aEveryone knows August is the worst month for shares. Now the calendar will be tested when valuations are the highest since the dot-com bubble, nobody knows what fiscal and monetary policy hold, and a once-strong earnings season ended badly with disappointments at Walt Disney Co., Mylan NV and Macy\u2019s Inc.\u000a\u000a\u201cA nasty short term combination for volatility is setting up near term if geopolitical risk increases at the same time the U.S. debt ceiling debate is getting underway,\u201d said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio and quantitative strategy at Evercore ISI.\u000a\u000aStocks fell the most since May on Thursday, extending a decline began when President Donald Trump warned North Korea over aggression. The S&P 500 fell 1 percent, while the CBOE Volatility Index, or fear index, jumped 32 percent to bring its three-day rise to 47 percent.\u000a\u000aEquities globally are having an even worse stretch than their U.S. counterparts. The Stoxx Europe 600 is down 1.6 percent over three days, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Average has fallen 1.6 percent and emerging market shares measured by MSCI are down 1.9 percent, the most since May. In Korea, the Kospi 200 Volatility index jumped 32 percent over two days, hitting a four-month high.\u000a\u000aThe sudden bout of volatility followed three weeks of motionlessness, with the S&P 500 trapped in an 11-point range. To many, the peace was unnerving.\u000a\u000aTake clients of AllianceBernstein. A week ago, with almost every major equity benchmark in America sitting at a record, inquiries to the brokerage about the timing of the next 5 percent or 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 were the most-asked question to its strategists.\u000a\u000aShares are nowhere near a drop of that size, but should the current decline extend to a correction, investors will point to Aug. 8 as its genesis.\u000a\u000aThe S&P 500 erased a 0.4 percent gain Tuesday in the biggest reversal in four months after President Donald Trump said North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat to the U.S. would be \u201cmet with fire and fury.\u201d While the war scare seemed to dissipate the following day, with the index recouping a 0.5 percent loss in the final hour of the session, selling accelerated again Thursday as investors shifted focus to retailer earnings and the weakness in the credit market.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though a single-day spike in volatility and little pullback in the stocks isn\u2019t too alarming, investors are paying a very close attention as they try to figure out where the top of the market is,\u201d said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, said by phone.\u000a\u000aAs usual, tech shares bore the worst of the selling as investors exited this year\u2019s best-performing group. The Nasdaq 100 Index sank 1.5 percent Thursday while the FANG block of tech giants, including Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google, tumbled 2.4 percent.\u000a\u000aTo Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of Marketfield Asset Management, the rout is unlikely to escalate as global economic growth is strengthening, central banks continue to be accommodative and corporate America stays healthy. Despite this week\u2019s earnings disappointments, S&P 500 profits are on course for the back-to-back 10 percent growth for the first time since 2011.\u000a\u000aOther than dreading August, does the past hold any clues? Investors might look to the 1962 episode of Cuban missile crisis for an idea of the potential shock to equities should tensions between North Korea and the U.S. escalate, according to Michael Purves, chief global strategist and head of derivatives research at Weeden. During those two weeks when the prospect of a nuclear war grew, the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 30-day volatility almost doubled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe brief decline by global markets is a reasonably measured response to the cross continent saber-rattling, but not in itself indicative of a meaningful change in the overall mood of markets,\u201d Shaoul said. \u201cIt remains possible that we will see another brief lurch downwards, particularly in the technology sector that seems to be the locus of hedging activity, but the chances of this developing into a meaningful correction still looks remote at the current time\u201d

aVVIENNA (AP) \u2014 Production of crude oil across all OPEC countries rose again in July, to above the level the cartel has agreed would be the upper limit \u2014 and above the estimated level of global demand.\u000a\u000aThe cartel said Thursday in a market report that its countries' production rose for a third month in July, by 173,000 daily barrels, to an average of 32.9 million barrels a day.\u000a\u000aThat puts it above the 32.5 million barrels a day that the group had agreed in November would be their limit. The cartel agreed in May to extend the production limit to March next year in an effort to support market prices. But that intention has sometimes been difficult to put into practice because not all countries were observing the commitment.\u000a\u000aJuly's increase in production also puts output above the estimated global demand for OPEC oil this year of 32.4 million barrels a day.\u000a\u000aThe price of crude has largely hovered around or below $50 a barrel in recent months, about half what it was in 2014. On Thursday, the benchmark traded in New York was up 33 cents at $49.89 a barrel.

aVEarly-term babies face health challenges that last long past birth. A new study by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) found that early-term babies \u2014 babies who were not premature but had been born during the early weeks of what is considered full term \u2014 had an increased risk of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases as well as a shortened lifespan when compared to those who were born a couple of weeks later.\u000a\u000a"Early-term" babies are defined as those delivered between 37 and 39 weeks. Although pregnancy is considered at full term when gestation lasts between 37 and 42 weeks, babies born between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation have better outcomes than those born either before or afterward.\u000a\u000aFor the study, researchers investigated hospitalizations of 225,073 children up to age 18 to determine the impact that early-term versus full-term gestation had on pediatric health and hospitalizations.\u000a\u000a"We found that hospitalizations up to the age of 18 involving endocrine and metabolic morbidity were found to be more common in the early-term group as compared with the full-term group, especially at ages five and older," says Eyal Sheiner, M.D., Ph.D. In addition, "Obesity was significantly more frequent among the early term."\u000a\u000aChildren older than five who were born early exhibited significantly higher rates of Type I diabetes than those who were full-term deliveries.\u000a\u000aCesareans were more common in early-term deliveries, and birthweights were significantly less, said Sheiner.\u000a\u000aThe researchers concluded that these diseases could increase the risk of other associated ills that have a long-term negative impact on health, including a shorter lifespan.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\u000a\u000aThe Ben-Gurion study wasn't the first to show differences between early-term and full-term babies. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that early-term babies were at a disadvantage. "Even though we consider babies born at 37 or 38 weeks almost term, they are still, to a large extent, physiologically immature," said lead researcher Shaon Sengupta.\u000a\u000a"We were seeing a significant number of infants born at 37 weeks who looked big and pretty healthy, but who, within a few hours of birth were developing low blood sugar, difficulty in breathing or needed antibiotics, necessitating admission to the neonatal intensive care unit," said senior author Satyan Lakshminrusimha, M.D.\u000a\u000aResearchers also found that their learning ability was also affected years later.

aVMedia organizations and Democratic lawmakers have been trying to bring down the Trump administration since President Donald Trump took office, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aDuring an appearance on "The Joe Pags Show," Johnson said the efforts have drastically slowed the confirmation process for presidential nominees \u2014 and something needs to be done about it.\u000a\u000a"I think there has been a concerted effort to sabotage this administration since day one on the part of many in the media and of course our Democrat colleagues in the House and Senate," Johnson said. "So obviously what they're trying to do is just slow down the confirmation process.\u000a\u000a"That does two things: that clogs the Senate calendar in terms of floor time to bring up other measures for debate. We just end up being almost 100 percent in the personnel business, and it prevents this administration from staffing itself."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

aVNewt Gingrich on Thursday said that the United States had better get serious about ramping up its own military defenses rather than trying to figure out just how serious North Korea is about its threats and capabilities.\u000a\u000a"We need a dramatically better defensive capability because these guys may be serious," the Fox News contributor said on "Fox & Friends."\u000a\u000a"We're not prepared today, either in Seoul, Korea \u2026 or in our own major cities to deal with a possible outcome," Gingrich said.\u000a\u000aGingrich cited a study that said North Korea may have 60 nuclear weapons before issuing a chilling warning.\u000a\u000a"I just think people are not prepared for that reality," Gingrich told Fox News.\u000a\u000a"We need to evaluate, what is an American city worth? It's not about Guam, it's about Seattle or Cincinnati or Chicago or New York. What's an American city worth?" Gingrich asked rhetorically.\u000a\u000a"And we had better build the defensive systems that'll stop any attack on an American city. \u2026 I think this has got to be done on a crash basis, cutting through the red tape much like the Manhattan Project," Gingrich said.\u000a\u000aGingrich said he doesn't "care if they fire missiles in international waters" because the U.S. does it all the time, but severing North Korea from the world and shutting down its economy could put the rogue nation over the edge, resulting in desperation.\u000a\u000a"We're not prepared today for a North Korean attack on a scale they could launch. I'd like to see us dramatically expand our defensive capabilities before we push North Korea to the wall," Gingrich said.

aVThe "overheated rhetoric and statements" from President Donald Trump to North Korea have only aggravated the situation and growing tensions with the Asian country, Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Thursday.\u000a\u000a"They play into the hands of the North Korean leader," the Maryland Democrat told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program. "This is Kim Jong Un's game; this is something the North Koreans have done for 15 years.'\u000a\u000aBy using the same kind of rhetoric, as Trump did with his threats of "fire and fury" coming as a response if North Korea attacks the United States, that elevates Kim, while diminishing the United States, said the senator.\u000a\u000aVan Hollen, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he expects there will be hearings in both his group and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the North Korea situation, and about the country being under sanctions also approved against Russia and Iran.\u000a\u000a"Many of us believe we need to go further in terms of the Iran sanctions model," said Van Hollen. "Remember, the UN passed sanctions on Iran. They didn't really bite."\u000a\u000aThe sanctions against North Korea also "didn't have any teeth," said Van Hollen, until secondary sanctions were added to punish countries such as China for continuing to do business with North Korea.\u000a\u000a"Either you do business with North Korea or you do business with the United States, but you can't do both," said the senator. "That is what got people's attention with the Iran sanctions. That's what we need to do now."\u000a\u000aIn other matters, Van Hollen, as the new chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, commented Thursday that the issues between Trump and key Republican lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, show "they don't have an agenda that brings the country together."\u000a\u000aObamacare repeal, he pointed out, has the support of only 12 percent of Americans, and when that failed to pass in the Senate, people started pointing fingers at each other.\u000a\u000a"This was the president who said he was going to bring to Washington the 'art of the deal,'" said Van Hollen. "Clearly he was not able to do that."

aVThe company that led the failed effort to build two new nuclear reactors in South Carolina paid its executives millions in bonuses, some of it for work on the project, a review of federal records shows.\u000a\u000aA review of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show SCANA Corp. paid executives more than $21 million in performance bonuses over the past decade, including money for work on the V.C. Summer nuclear station north of Columbia, The State newspaper reported.\u000a\u000aThe filings do not say exactly how much of the $21 million was based on the failed project.\u000a\u000aSCANA's South Carolina Electric & Gas Co. and the state-owned utility Santee Cooper last week abandoned plans for new reactors, for which they already paid $9 billion. Much of the money already was paid by customers.\u000a\u000aThe utilities blamed construction delays and cost overruns. The problems came to a head when lead contractor Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy protection.\u000a\u000aSCANA spokeswoman Rhonda O'Banion told the newspaper the company doesn't talk about employees' pay.\u000a\u000aLast year, SCANA's top five executives received $3.3 million in performance based pay, according to the federal filings.\u000a\u000aNearly half of last year's performance pay went to SCANA president and chief executive Kevin Marsh and represents about a quarter of his $6 million in total compensation.\u000a\u000aThe filings said Marsh's $1.4 million performance-based bonus for 2016 was paid, in part, because of his "oversight and support of our nuclear construction activities."\u000a\u000aFor most of the last 10 years, about half of the performance based pay was based on meeting profit goals. The rest was paid for individual and department goals, including construction milestones on the reactors.\u000a\u000aA law passed in 2007 gave the utilities the ability to charge ratepayers for the reactors before they were completed. The same law allows the utilities to charge customers for the project even if it was not completed.\u000a\u000aSome lawmakers are trying to stop the utilities from recovering the money. Lawmakers have been outraged by the failure of the project, whose projected costs ballooned from about $11 billion to more than $20 billion.\u000a\u000aBoth Senate President Pro Tem Hugh Leatherman of Florence and House Speaker Jay Lucas of Hartsville have appointed committees to review how the project failed and what can be done now.\u000a\u000aRep. Russell Ott of St. Matthews is a member of the House review panel.\u000a\u000a"Knowing everything we know now, and knowing that we have a project that has been abandoned, those are pretty staggering numbers," Ott said.\u000a\u000aGov. Henry McMaster has said he is looking for ways for the project can continue to complete at least one of the reactors. One of the ideas under consideration would include the sale of Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility that was responsible for 45 percent of the project.

aVSnap Inc.\u2019s growth again fell short of estimates, feeding fears that aggressive competition from Facebook Inc. is blunting the younger social-media company\u2019s potential just months after its initial public offering.\u000a\u000aThe Los Angeles-based company said daily active users reached 173 million in the second quarter, compared with 166 million in the prior period. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected 175 million on average. Revenue also disappointed, and the shares tumbled in late trading.\u000a\u000aSince its public debut in March, the maker of the Snapchat mobile application for sending disappearing photo and video has said its app would become more popular as the company innovates and adds features. In the second quarter, Snap added a maps function for users to see where friends are, as well as a search section. Yet rival Facebook has been successfully copying some of Snap\u2019s key features on its larger social-media properties, drawing users that may otherwise have downloaded Snapchat \u2014 but now see less use for the standalone app.\u000a\u000aFacebook is also exerting pressure in the mobile advertising market. Snap said quarterly revenue was $181.7 million, missing the $185.8 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. While Snap has been updating its offerings to give advertisers more sophisticated options, the company has been struggling to prove it can secure its position in a market dominated by Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google Inc.\u000a\u000aThis was a \u201cmake or break quarter\u201d for Snap, James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi Hardt & Co., said in a note to investors. \u201cSnap has tremendous potential if it can capitalize on the opportunity in front of it as an alternative platform for advertisers,\u201d but the company is \u201cunder pressure from multiple fronts.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe company has been urging investors to think of it as different from Facebook. For example, its app works more like a messaging product with a curated media section \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have a feed with ads slotted in like Facebook\u2019s namesake network and its Instagram app do. Snap Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel has also said the company isn\u2019t focused on getting as big as possible, like Facebook. Instead, it wants to add users in the most lucrative markets and get them more deeply addicted. Snap reported average revenue per user of $1.05 in the second quarter, with most of its growth coming from North America.\u000a\u000aThe company\u2019s shares slid as low as $11.57 following the report, then recovered to trade down about 4 percent. The stock has slumped 19 percent since Snap\u2019s March 1 IPO at $17 a share, closing at $13.77 on Thursday.

aVPresident Trump's \u201cfire and fury\u201d shot Wednesday at North Korea has Republicans nationwide wondering whether his campaign promise of \u201cAmerica First\u201d is finished.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said former Texas Republican Chairman Tom Pauken, an early Trump supporter. \u201cHe has surrounded himself with war hawks and interventionists who are giving him bad advice. He needs to replace [retired Gen. Henry] McMaster at the National Security Council with someone like retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, whose views are more aligned with what Trump ran on in the campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump's controversial remark seems to fly in the face of America's nation-building and his hands-off views.\u000a\u000aBut most of the Republican leaders who spoke to Newsmax gave Trump the benefit of the doubt. They agreed that the Pyongyang regime presents enough of a threat to the world that the U.S. should deal with it and the president is right to use the strong language he did.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, I don't see it that way,\u201d said attorney Marc Scaringi, co-chairman of Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania campaign in 2016. \u201cAt this point, Trump is only expressing his anger, and the anger of many Americans, in response to repeated threats from North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s abandoned his base on foreign policy,\u201d former Washington State Republican Chairman Kirby Wilbur told us. Many of Trump's supporters were upset with America not being tough enough with the real bad guys, and North Korea is seen as one of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aWilbur, now a popular radio talk show host, added his belief that \u201cthe grass-roots will be fine with this. We're not talking about regime change or nation-building, we're talking about massive retaliation if they attack us.

One way or the other its leadership must be eradicated \u2014 the sooner the better!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat would Hillary have done? Nothing more than talk,\u201d said Hal Daub, former mayor of Omaha, Neb. \u201cAmerican foreign policy has wasted 10 years with North Korea. The U.N. finally gets it because we will not be intimidated any longer. President Trump is narrowing the pathway to succeed without strengthening North Korea's only focus \u2014 militarization of the Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aDaub argued that \u201cAmerica First\u201d is actually \u201ca domestic GDP rebuilding initiative that is reducing the regulatory burden of the federal central system and it\u2019s starting to work.

aVIt may be no coincidence that some of the greatest literary names had a love for alcohol \u2014 think Hemingway, Poe, and Faulkner \u2014 drinking may have given their creativity a boost and helped them plow through mental blocks that stifled their productivity. According to a study from Austria's University of Graz, alcohol relaxes areas in the brain and allows thoughts to be more creative.\u000a\u000aAmounts as small as a glass of wine or beer will do the trick say researchers.\u000a\u000aResearchers gave people either beer or a non-alcoholic beer that tasted the same. They were then given tasks, such as a word association test determining what word linked Swiss, blue, and cake. Those who drank alcohol were much more likely to get the correct answer \u2014 cheese. Those who drank alcohol were also more likely to do better on a creative thinking problem, deciding a tire was used more creatively as a lampshade than as a swing.\u000a\u000a"We wanted to do this study because alcohol is so linked with creativity, and great writers like Ernest Hemingway," lead author Dr. Mathias Benedek told Daily Mail. "Previous research has found almost half of the great writers had a history of drinking.\u000a\u000a"We found that a small drink can indeed help with certain aspects of creativity, although it may make hard, focused work more difficult.\u000a\u000a"So, it might well work for someone who is sitting down to do creative writing or brainstorming ideas in a boardroom," Benedek concluded.\u000a\u000aThere are a couple of theories explaining why alcohol helps with creativity. One is it may give your mind the freedom to explore alternate ways of solving a problem. The other is that alcohol allows you to access your unconscious mind to find alternative solutions, Benedek said.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition.\u000a\u000aOther studies have also found a link between creativity and alcohol, such as a study at the University of Illinois which found that drinkers who were brainstorming ideas outperformed non-drinkers 4 to 1 when given creative tasks.\u000a\u000aHow does alcohol unleash creativity? It could be its ability to help drinkers relax. Researcher Mark Beeman from Northwestern University found that thinking too hard blocked the creative process, but when volunteers were relaxed, they were more likely to have a "Eureka" moment.

aVOn one hand, threats to deter requires convincing the other side not to do something you want it to do; on the other hand, threats to compel necessitate cessation of something it has or is acquiring, i.e., change behavior in your favor. Under a succession of American Presidents, the U.S. minimum objective was and is to compel Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests. The U.S. maximum goal President Trump is to compel Kim Jong-un to destroy his nuclear and ballistic missile stockpile in exchange for something he values even more \u2014 survival of his regime. It is critical to make clear what the objectives are of these two strategies. Too often, there is a focus on means at the expense of purposes. The two go hand-in-hand.\u000a\u000aBreaking News\u000a\u000aDuring the early afternoon of August 8, citing the Defense Intelligence Agency, The Washington Post reported North Korea successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles and Pyongyang had about 60 nuclear weapons. Later that day, President Trump made a deterrent threat, \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Kim Jong-un, speaking via a low-level military officer, promptly countered Trump. The New York Times reported North Korea warned it was considering a missile strike that would create \u201can enveloping fire\u201d around Guam, the western Pacific island where the United States operates a critical Air Force base. Trump\u2019s deterrent threat failed, at least for the time being. Trump\u2019s predecessors used the language of presidential diplomacy. But, when you negotiate with a bully like Kim Jong-un, perhaps it's necessary to speak the language the bully understands.\u000a\u000aAt issue is what is the target of the Trump threat: Beijing, Pyongyang, both? My take is the threat was primarily directed to China, but North Korea also heard it, making the targeting issue less relevant. So, the jury remains in session, and the story is not over.\u000a\u000aThe Backstory\u000a\u000aRegarding Iran, it has exchanged nuclear and missile technology for years, per an Iran expert, Alireza Jafarzadeh. The two rogue regimes complement each other in technical capabilities. Tehran has more ability to enrich uranium than Pyongyang, which has better skills to use spent plutonium from enrichment than its partner. Moreover, North Korea leads in missiles and miniaturized nuclear warheads that can fit inside these delivery systems.\u000a\u000aThe Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) aim is to restrict proliferation of missiles and related technology for systems capable of carrying a 500-kilogram payload at least 300 kilometers, as well as systems intended for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction. MTCR achieves its goals through export controls and licensing, information exchange among its 35 members, and outreach to non-members. MTCR complements The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act: It authorizes the United States to impose sanctions against foreign individuals, private entities, and governments that engage in proliferation activities.\u000a\u000aWhile of great value, these international regimes have been unable to stop Pyongyang and Tehran from exchanging missile technology. Hence, threats and sanctions by American presidents have been a necessary approach to proliferation of missile exchanges between Iran and North Korea. Trump\u2019s deterrent and coercive threats are a necessary complement to the international nonproliferation regimes. But threats of punishment need to be combined with promises of diplomacy for either to succeed. A strategy of threats without diplomacy is like a martini with alcohol but without vermouth.\u000a\u000aSix-Party Talks for Pyongyang; Regime Change for Tehran\u000a\u000aThe nuclear-missile news present an opportunity for the Trump administration to combine diplomacy with threats of force. At the State Department Daily Briefing on August 1, our chief diplomat, Rex Tillerson, spoke the language of diplomacy when he said, \u201cWe have reaffirmed our position towards North Korea, that what we are doing, we do not seek a regime change; we do not seek the collapse of the regime; we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula; we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel.\u201d And returning from Guam on August 9, Tillerson reaffirmed Trump\u2019s tough talk but also spoke reassuring words to Pyongyang, per The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aAssuring Pyongyang that Washington does not seek regime change can be combined with resumption of the Six-Party Talks. That bargain should be a goal of Team Trump. These negotiations should cut a deal with Pyongyang. In exchange for guarantees the Kim Jong-un regime can remain in power, China, Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo, and especially Washington would offer denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while maintaining U.S. nuclear forces in Japan.\u000a\u000aOne route to coercing Iran is to place regime change by the Iranian people on the table. Ayatollah Khomeini is a bully, who should not be reassured his regime is safe from the Iranian people; on the contrary, he should be informed Washington stands with the people of Iran who wish to change their unelected and illegitimate regime, which is also a serial human rights violator.\u000a\u000aUnlike North Korea, with no signs of an active, substantial antiregime movement, regime change from within Iran can be a tool in the administration\u2019s kit, for an organized opposition to the Iranian regime already exists, to include, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) in a principal role. Congressman Ted Poe\u2019s July 31 piece in The National Interest, concurs with this view.\u000a\u000aThe Way Forward\u000a\u000aFirst, the National Security Council interagency review of Iran policy needs to include options for changing the regime in Tehran. Team Trump should signal its willingness to, at a minimum, meet with and listen to Iranians who reject clerical rule of the Ayatollahs and seek to bring about regime change from within.\u000a\u000aSecond, the stick of tough talk, multilateral UN sanctions, and carrots of unilateral conversations as elements for a bargain with North Korea. But forget about changing Pyongyang from within: There is no self-sustaining organized opposition to Kim Jong-un.\u000a\u000aThird, combine threats of punishment with promise of diplomacy to North Korea; continue to build on the Missile Technology Control Regime and The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act as tools used in concert with threats and diplomacy for Pyongyang and Tehran, but only regime change for Tehran.\u000a\u000aProf. Raymond Tanter (@AmericanCHR) served as a senior member on the Middle East Desk of the National Security Council staff in the Reagan-Bush administration, Personal Representative of the Secretary of Defense to international security and arms control talks in Europe, and is now Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan.
