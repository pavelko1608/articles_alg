VE-commerce giant Amazon plans to build a massive warehouse outside Cleveland on the site of a closed shopping mall.\u000a\u000aThe Plain Dealer reports Amazon finalized a lease deal Thursday to build an 855,000-square-foot (79,431-sq. meter) warehouse in North Randall, a village of just over 1,000 people.\u000a\u000aThe newspaper reports Amazon will create more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Construction costs are estimated at $177 million.\u000a\u000aRandall Park Mall was billed as the world's largest indoor mall when it opened in 1976. It closed in 2009 after years of decline.\u000a\u000aThe state hasn't announced any financial assistance for the project. An Amazon warehouse in Columbus that employs 4,500 people received job-creation tax credits.\u000a\u000aStarting hourly rates at Amazon warehouses have varied from $11.50 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to $13.75 in Seattle.

aVWith photographs obliquely showing a new rocket design, North Korea has sent a message that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) more powerful than any it has previously tested, weapons experts said on Thursday.\u000a\u000aIf developed, such a missile could possibly reach any place on the U.S. mainland, including Washington and New York, they said.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's state media published photographs late on Wednesday of leader Kim Jong Un standing next to a diagram of a three-stage rocket it called the Hwasong-13.\u000a\u000aMissile experts, who scrutinise such pictures for clues about North Korea's weapons programmes, said there is no indication the rocket has been fully developed. In any case, it had not been flight tested and it was impossible to calculate its potential range.\u000a\u000aHowever, a three-stage rocket would be more powerful than the two-stage Hwasong-14 ICBM tested twice in July, they said. South Korean and U.S. officials and experts have said the Hwasong-14 may have a range of about 10,000 km (6,200 miles) and could possibly strike many parts of the United States, but not the East Coast.\u000a\u000a"We should be looking at Hwasong-13 as a 12,000-km class ICBM that can strike all of the mainland United States," said Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Seoul's Kyungnam University.\u000a\u000a"It's likely meant to show that they are working on a three-stage design with greater boost and range," said retired Brigadier General Moon Sung-muk, an arms control expert who has represented South Korea in military talks with North Korea.\u000a\u000aHe said the pictures were intended to show that North Korea was refusing to bow to international pressure to abandon its weapons programmes.\u000a\u000a"The North is trying to be in control of the playing field," Moon said.\u000a\u000aTENSIONS EASE\u000a\u000aWednesday's report carried by the KCNA news agency lacked the traditionally robust threats against the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a possible improvement in relations.\u000a\u000aState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said it was unclear if the photos were taken before or after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday welcomed what he called the restraint North Korea had shown recently in its weapons programmes and said he hoped a path could be opening for dialogue "sometime in the near future."\u000a\u000a"We consider it overall a good first step that there haven't been any missile launches or testing for ...three-plus weeks or so," Nauert told a regular briefing.\u000a\u000aHowever Pyongyang needed to do a lot more to show it was willing to negotiate in good faith, she said.\u000a\u000aThe photographs were accompanied by a report of Kim issuing instructions for the production of more rocket engines and warheads during a visit to the Academy of Defense Sciences, an agency he set up to develop ballistic missiles.\u000a\u000a"We're getting a look at it to emphasise domestic production of missiles, and to advertise what's coming next," said Joshua Pollack, a nuclear weapon and missile systems expert who edits the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review.\u000a\u000aThe photographs were published as tensions between North Korea and the United States appeared to have eased slightly since North Korea tested the Hwasong-14 and later threatened to fire missiles toward the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.\u000a\u000aKyungnam University's Kim said the Hwasong-13 appeared similar to the KN-08, a three-stage missile of which only a mockup has previously been seen at military parades. But the new images show a modified design for the main booster stage that clusters two engines.\u000a\u000aAnother picture published by North Korean state media showed Kim Jong Un standing next to a rocket casing that appeared to be made of a material that could include plastic. Experts said if such material were used in the missile, it would be intended to reduce weight and boost range.\u000a\u000aThe photographs also showed the design for the Pukguksong-3, likely a new solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile being developed for submarine launches.

aVThe arrest Tuesday of one of Russia\u2019s most celebrated theatre directors has sparked fresh speculation that the regime of Vladimir Putin is planning a new round of crackdowns on his opponents.\u000a\u000aFor its part, the White House has so far avoided any public comment on the arrest of Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been likened to such legendary American theatre directors as Harold Prince and the late Mike Nichols.\u000a\u000aWhen Newsmax on Thursday asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders for a comment about the arrest, she would only say, \u201cI certainly can\u2019t make an official statement at this time, but I will circle back with you.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Russia, demonstrations against the arrest began last week and there are growing charges of a new Putin offensive against critics within the Russian arts community.\u000a\u000aMikhail Khodorkovsky, formerly a prisoner in Russia and now head of the Open Russia opposition group, told Newsmax, \u201cThe persecution of the famous theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov is another attempt to divert public attention away from real corruptionists among the Putin's circle, as well as to demonstrate to the cultural elite its vulnerability ahead of the elections.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf the mounting protests, Khodorkovsky said \u201cthe reaction of the society shows its unwillingness to accept the official position. However, the [opposition to Putin] still has no readiness for political mobilization."\u000a\u000aSerebrenikov is director of the Gogol Centre, a popular theatre known for dealing with controversial themes in politics and sex. Since May, he has been the subject of a continuing string of harassment by the government over allegations he had embezzled as much as 68 million rubles ($1.5 million) from theatre projects mounted by Seventh Studio (an offshoot of the Gogol Center).\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the prosecutor in Moscow told the TASS news agency that Serebrennikov is charged with telling individuals in the Seventh Studio \u201cto enter into fictitious contracts with controlled entities and private entrepreneurs who allegedly fulfilled the obligations associated with the implementation of activities . . . the money from the Culture Ministry was withdrawn to the accounts of these counterparties [some were called \u2018one-day firms\u2019], cashed and distributed by Serebrennikov among the accomplices.\u201d\u000a\u000aSerebrennikov, who has called the charges against him \u201cschizophrenic,\u201d is scheduled for trial on Oct. 19.

aVBy Tara Lachapelle and Sarah Halzack\u000a\u000aCould it be? Finally some enticing takeover speculation to get us through this end-of-summer M&A lull.\u000a\u000aEstee Lauder Cos., the $39 billion New York cosmetics giant, is the latest to enter the rumor mill -- and the chatter makes a whole lot of sense.\u000a\u000aSome may think of bygone department stores and shoulder pads when they hear the name Estee Lauder, but in fact the company owns hot brands such as M.A.C., Smashbox, Becca and Bobbi Brown, among others. It's been riding a wave of sizzling growth in the prestige beauty business that's buoyed several retailers and brands.\u000a\u000aAnd this week, shares of the 71-year-old company traded at a record high:\u000a\u000aA deal for Estee Lauder may be just what European consumer conglomerate Unilever needs to skirt future courtship by the folks at Kraft Heinz Co. It was just six months ago that Unilever spurned a $143 billion bid from Kraft Heinz and its shrewd sponsors -- 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. -- after the negotiations leaked out and made things awkward. Since then Unilever CEO Paul Polman has been trying to pull every lever he can to primp up the company and put its stock out of Kraft Heinz's reach. But Gadfly's Andrea Felsted noted this week that Unilever's sales growth remains a weak spot, which means it's still vulnerable to overtures.\u000a\u000aEstee Lauder could serve as a poison pill of sorts for Unilever, making it worth the high price. A quick run of the numbers shows that even before synergies, a transaction between Unilever and Estee Lauder would be accretive to earnings, so long as Unilever can put up a minimum of 40 percent of the purchase price in cash. That shouldn't be too difficult given that Unilever doesn't have very high leverage now and is also raising money from selling off certain food businesses.\u000a\u000aIf Estee Lauder is in play, though, things could get competitive and drive up the price. Paris-based L'Oreal SA is another obvious suitor for Estee Lauder and it could make the math work. Others have noted 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway could also emerge for Estee Lauder given their need to find another large acquisition, though we're less convinced this is the target they're after.\u000a\u000aEstee Lauder's margins are also lower than that of Unilever and L'Oreal, meaning that there may be fat to cut so that either suitor could wring out a decent amount of synergies.\u000a\u000aEstee Lauder is appealing because it's made astute moves to adapt to a volatile retailing environment and its e-commerce growth has been strong. As foot traffic to department stores dries up, it's increased penetration in specialty retailers by 40 percent in the last fiscal year, muscling lines such as Jo Malone into Sephora and getting its eponymous brand stocked at some Ulta Beauty Inc. locations. Acquisitions of boutique-y lines such as Too Faced and Becca are helping it cater to the legions of shoppers that are seeking out niche brands.\u000a\u000aEstee Lauder is pretty well-diversified across the beauty business. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, makeup comprises 45 percent of sales, skin care accounts for 37 percent and fragrances 13 percent. That's helpful at a moment when trends are popping and dropping faster than ever. Whether a makeup fad like strobing or a skin-care craze such as micellar water gets traction, Estee Lauder is ready to cash in.\u000a\u000aWill it cash in on a deal next? It'd be a good look for Unilever.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aTara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals. She previously wrote an M&A column for Bloomberg News.\u000a\u000aSarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

aVPhillip and Barbara Butler hadn't given much thought to the man who burned a cross on their front lawn 40 years ago.\u000a\u000aThen they heard the startling news Tuesday that the perpetrator had become a priest and was ministering to Catholics not far from their home.\u000a\u000a"I didn't know what to say. It was unbelievable," Phillip Butler said Wednesday at a news conference.\u000a\u000aThe priest, the Rev. William Aitcheson, went public with his old Ku Klux Klan affiliation Monday, writing a column in the diocesan newspaper.\u000a\u000aHe said his past was not a secret, but he felt compelled to make it more public after seeing images of violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aAitcheson, now 62, described his past actions as despicable: "To anyone who has been subjected to racism or bigotry, I am sorry. I have no excuse, but I hope you will forgive me."\u000a\u000aFor the Butlers, though, his announcement provided more questions than answers.\u000a\u000aThe Butlers' lawyer, Ted Williams, called on Aitcheson to publicly identify his Klan associates as well as anyone who helped him with the cross-burning.\u000a\u000aThe Butlers said the cross was big and heavy, more than six feet tall (1.8-meters), so he must have had help. Phillip Butler said someone also must have identified their home for Aitcheson to target them.\u000a\u000a"What did we do to have them put a cross in our lawn?" he asked. The couple, among the first African-Americans to move into their subdivision, moved on after about eight years.\u000a\u000a"It makes you very afraid of what's going on," Butler said.\u000a\u000aThe Diocese of Arlington initially said that for the good of the parish, Aitcheson is taking a voluntary leave of absence from ministerial duties at St. Leo the Great in Fairfax. Through the diocese, he has declined interview requests.\u000a\u000aIn response to the Butlers' news conference, the diocese released a statement saying Aitcheson "will fully cooperate with law enforcement in addressing details of this case that were not gathered previously."\u000a\u000aWilliams said he believes Aitcheson, who became a priest in Nevada before eventually transferring to Virginia, came forward only because he felt he was going to be exposed.\u000a\u000aHe questioned Aitcheson's statement that the Charlottesville rally prompted his public mea culpa, after so many other racial flash points over the decades.\u000a\u000a"The big question is: why is this just coming out now?" he asked.\u000a\u000aThe diocese, in its statement Wednesday, said a freelance reporter had approached the diocese asking whether Aitcheson had been connected to the cross-burnings, which received press attention at the time.\u000a\u000a"Aitcheson was approached about this, he acknowledged his past and saw the opportunity to tell his story in the hopes that others would see the possibility of conversion and repentance," the diocese said.\u000a\u000aAitcheson was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail in 1977 after he was charged with burning several crosses, including the one at the Butlers' home in College Park, Maryland, and sending a death threat to Coretta Scott King, the widow of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. Authorities at the time said he was a University of Maryland student doubling as a "wizard" of a 12-member KKK lodge.\u000a\u000aYears later, the Butlers won a $23,000 civil judgment against Aitcheson, and received a personal visit from President Ronald Reagan, who with his wife, Nancy, condemned the hate crime.\u000a\u000aBut Aitcheson never apologized to the Butlers, in writing or in person during their time in court, and they said they never received any of the money.\u000a\u000aThe diocese said it only learned of his unpaid restitution this week, and committed to ensuring he fulfills his moral and legal obligations.\u000a\u000aWilliams said he is researching his options in pushing the judgment and calculating possible interest in 35 years of nonpayment.\u000a\u000aBarbara Butler said she doubts Aitcheson could say anything she would be interested in hearing in terms of an apology, and expressed skepticism about his change of heart.\u000a\u000a"Father forgive them for they know not what they do," she said.. Then she addressed the priest: "But you did know."

aVBen Stein is everywhere, it seems, but there are still some things you may not know about the man perhaps best known for his signature monotone voice.\u000a\u000aIn addition to contributing to leading publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and Newsmax, Stein also forged a career in entertainment with the popular \u201cWin Ben Stein\u2019s Money,\u201d and parts in moves and TV shows.\u000a\u000aBut here are five things you may not know about Ben Stein:\u000a\u000a1. He said Donald Trump isn\u2019t a great businessman \u2014 During the 2016 presidential campaign, the Republican economist called the anti-free trade rhetoric of Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders \u201ca disastrous mistake,\u201d according to The Guardian. He also said Trump \u201cis not a great businessman,\u201d but added that he would vote for him anyway.\u000a\u000a2. Stein had celebrity classmates in high school \u2014 While attending Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, his classmates included Sylvester Stallone and Goldie Hawn, according to IMDb. Another classmate was journalist Carl Bernstein, who would later help uncover the Watergate scandal that brought down President Nixon.\u000a\u000a3. He worked for Richard Nixon \u2014 Stein first rose to prominence as a speechwriter for President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Later, he defended Nixon and said he should be remembered as a peacemaker.\u000a\u000a4. He\u2019s appeared in some major films \u2014 Many people remember Stein\u2019s small role in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d in which he repeats \u201cBueller? Bueller?\u201d as a school teacher. But he\u2019s had a wide range of character roles in such movies as \u201cTales from the Crypt,\u201d \u201cThe Mask,\u201d \u201cPlanes, Trains & Automobiles,\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters II\u201d as well as many TV roles, according to his website.\u000a\u000a5. He's friends with Al Franken \u2014 Stein backed liberal Al Franken in his 2008 run for Senate and even donated to his campaign, according to The Associated Press. The men have reportedly known each other for more than 30 years.

aVTexas' undocumented immigrants in the path of Hurricane Harvey will be accepted at evacuation centers and will not be required to show identification before being helped, Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday.\u000a\u000a"It's my understanding from what I saw from the Border Patrol instructions yesterday, that will not be a problem," Abbott told MSNBC. "What everyone is focused on right now is ensuring we do all we can to protect life. We have a high regard for life. We want to insure the safety of all lives. We're prepared to take all measures to do so."\u000a\u000aHowever, the Border Patrol has come under fire after announcing in a statement that it does not plan to close its immigration checkpoints north of the Rio Grande Valley unless the storm poses danger to travelers or patrol agents.\u000a\u000a"Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed on an as-needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local response authorities," the agency said in a statement, reports The Texas Tribune. "The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties."\u000a\u000aCBP public affairs officer Roberto Rodriguez, when asked to clarify the statement, told The Tribune that officers will prioritize public safety, but also plans to follow its own rules.\u000a\u000aThe American Civil Liberties Union in Texas strongly criticized the Border Patrol's plans.\u000a\u000a"Safety should be a priority regardless of immigration status," said ACLU policy strategist Astrid Dominguez. "This is very concerning for the community. It sends a wrong message."\u000a\u000aMany lives have been lost in past hurricanes when people do not have the resources to relocate before a storm, and as locations along the coast are preparing for a 12-foot storm surge, Abbott and other officials on Friday were urging residents to heed evacuation orders.\u000a\u000a"One of the most important things we can and have done is to prepare for water rescue missions," the governor said. "We have multiple teams, whether it be through the 700 state and National Guard that we've activated, whether it be what's called Texas Task Force One or Two, or working with FEMA, we have multiple water rescue teams south of Corpus Christi up to the Houston area to make sure that we will be able to be in the process of saving lives, which is the most important thing we can do."\u000a\u000aIn addition, he said, there are multiple buses leaving areas such as Corpus Christi, taking people to places such as San Antonio or Austin, and people fleeing the storm will not need to worry about the cost.\u000a\u000a"You have other people who will be taking care of you," said Abbott. "You need to find a pathway out. If you're looking for that pathway, contact your local emergency management director, that should be easy to find. If nothing else, call your local police department and they can put you in touch with them. Take haste and use all speed to try to find a pathway out of this storm."\u000a\u000aA cone at the southern end of the storm will hit Brownsville and the Mexican border, including the Rio Grande, and Abbott said Texas is coordinating with Mexican officials concerning the danger. The state also is coordinating with officials and the Border Patrol up and down the Rio Grande Valley, up to north and northeast of the Houston area.\u000a\u000a"This is going to be a massive storm that will have ripple effects up and down the Texas coastline, so this is going to be broad-based coordination by officials at all levels," said Abbott.\u000a\u000aThe governor also said the oil companies also are ready for the storm, as they are experienced in dealing with hurricanes.\u000a\u000a"They get prepared in advance and make sure that they will minimize both the potential damage, but also expedite the process of getting the refineries back up and running," said Abbott. "If there's anybody I have confidence in, it's those refineries because they know how to operate this. They will get it back online as quickly as possible."

aVThe Republican National Committee is headed toward adoption of a resolution condemning white supremacists, at the strong urging of the party's national chairwoman but also with groans from some party activists.\u000a\u000aThe grumbling reflects a difference between RNC leaders concerned about the party's image in light of President Donald Trump's latest rhetorical thicket and newer, more ardently pro-Trump state Republican leaders who say such a statement appears defensive.\u000a\u000a"It's amazing that we have been lured into this argument that we're not racists. It's absurd," said Colorado Republican Chairman Jeff Hays. "Why would we feel compelled to do that?"\u000a\u000aBut make no mistake, this is a priority for Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and committee members who were bothered by Trump's initial resistance to singling out white nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis as the antagonists in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000a"There's no debate. We're affirming we're the party of Lincoln," McDaniel told The Associated Press. "We are showing the moral high ground by disavowing hate and violence."\u000a\u000aDespite the resolution, there doesn't appear to be a softening of support for the president within the party's national organization.\u000a\u000aRather, what was to be a sleepy, pro-forma late summer gathering seemed to spark renewed backing for the president despite a series of recent setbacks: the GOP's stunning failure to repeal and replace "Obamacare"; the furious backlash over his comments about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; and the departure of crowd favorite Reince Priebus, the former RNC chairman, as Trump's chief of staff.\u000a\u000a"The president was not wrong to point out what the media has failed to point out," that counter-protesters also "came for a battle" in Charlottesville, Pennsylvania Republican Chairman Val DiGiorgio said.\u000a\u000aDiGiorgio was standing by the "many sides" comment Trump immediately made after the clash in Virginia, in which a car was driven into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman. The president had been criticized harshly by both Republicans and Democrats because he didn't immediately denounce the white nationalist groups in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aBill Palatucci, a RNC committeeman from New Jersey who sponsored the resolution, said it was important for the committee to formally denounce white supremacists. Palatucci said, "I think he got it wrong a week ago Tuesday, in regards to Charlottesville," when Trump said during a free-wheeling, defiant news conference that there were "very fine people on both sides" at the demonstration.\u000a\u000aBut even Palatucci, who was a devout supporter of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's 2016 presidential campaign, said, "I support the president's agenda." He cited deregulation measures Trump has signed and the president's plan, outlined Monday, to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan to revive the effort to root out terrorist cells.\u000a\u000aThe party's robust $75 million in first-half 2017 fundraising \u2014 more than twice what Democrats raised in the first half of President Barack Obama's inaugural year in office \u2014 has also lifted spirits, as has improving economic confidence.\u000a\u000aThe consensus in Nashville is that the Republican-controlled Congress, not Trump, has let down the party.\u000a\u000a"There is a level of frustration that Congress didn't repeal and replace Obamacare," Ohio Republican Party Chairwoman Jane Timken said. "They want the president's agenda passed. They blame Congress."\u000a\u000a"The president wants to see his agenda passed," McDaniel said. "He's channeling what I'm hearing from the American people, which is, 'We gave you the White House. You have the Senate. You have the House. Why aren't you getting these things done?'"

aVBill O'Reilly tells Newsmax TV that the raging debate over Confederate statues is a symptom of a much deeper problem \u2014 the U.S. is in the throes of a "social civil war" and the aggressors are "far-left extremists" who want to tear down much more than just monuments.\u000a\u000aThey want to destroy the entire legacy of the U.S., the former Fox News host told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

They're the far left, the extremists who believe that the United States from the jump was an evil country," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"They believe that the whole system . . . was designed to keep white men in power and prosperity at the expense of minorities.\u000a\u000a"So to them, destroying all of our legacy, all of it, and rebuilding it in this socialistic, far-left vision is what is necessary," O'Reilly said. "This is how bad this is. So this movement, it's not many Americans, but they're given a pass by the media."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly said there's one defense available to most Americans who want to push back \u2014 "know our history."\u000a\u000aThe timing of O'Reilly's latest "Killing" series book \u2014 "Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence" \u2014 couldn't be more poignant.\u000a\u000aThere's a debate to be had in this country about statues, and O'Reilly said removals of some should be a "case-by-case."\u000a\u000aBut this notion put forth by the far left of tearing them all down should be alarming to the "vast majority of Americans do not want their statues and monuments defaced."\u000a\u000a"The truth is always, when you're dealing with flawed human beings, good and bad. And that's what we're dealing with today in this country," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"But Americans don't know how brutal this eight-year war was. And the savagery that it took to get our freedoms that we are right now exercising and it wasn't pretty," O'Reilly said. "And if you're going to go back and start to demonize, as the far left wants to do, of people who were directly involved in getting us the freedom that we enjoy today, I'm going to come after you."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly said he's in favor of removing the statue of confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, founder of the KKK, in New Orleans, but said monuments of Robert E. Lee should remain.\u000a\u000aForrest "started the Ku Klux Klan after the war and the Klan did a lot of damage and does a lot of damage to this country. Should that statue be up there? And I say no," O'Reilly said. "That's a legitimate, absolutely a strong argument that that guy should not be honored with anything. You want that statue, you put it in a museum and then you tell a story about Nathan Bedford Forrest.\u000a\u000a"But Robert E. Lee is a whole different story," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"Yes, Lee fought for a system that wanted slavery. No question. Yes, Lee committed treason against his own country because he put his state, Virginia, over the union," O'Reilly said. "So Lee is not a hero, per-se, in my opinion.\u000a\u000a"However, he was involved after the war in healing the nation, bringing the nation together as [Abraham] Lincoln wanted. He was deeply involved with that and on the battlefield he was an honorable man. So are we going to wipe out Robert E. Lee's message? That's just stupid," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aPoint is, O'Reilly said, educated discussions are the only way to push back against extremism in our own country.\u000a\u000a"The pressure is going to get worse unless the majority of Americans start to push back. But the only way you can push back is if you really know our history," O'Reilly said. "The American people are struggling to put forth their side of the debate which is why I wrote 'Killing England.'\u000a\u000a"So you know exactly what Washington did right and wrong and then you can make a determination of the totality of the man. The same thing with [Thomas] Jefferson and [Benjmain] Franklin," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"So it becomes very important for individual Americans to stand up and say 'you know what in my town you're not going to do this fascist stuff. You're not going to knock down all this stuff.' This is what ISIS does. We're not going to do that here," O'Reilly said.

aVYou may recall the huge 2003 Opposition Media-generated scandal regarding the \u201couting\u201d or leaking of Valerie Plame\u2019s employment at the CIA. Just the mention of her career status caused a special prosecutor to be appointed and put the OpMedia in the unusual position of hyping a leak of classified information that it published.\u000a\u000aThe high-profile investigation cum witch-hunt went on for weeks. You may wonder why an employment update on a desk officer generated such intense coverage. The reason is Plame was a leftist married to another higher-profile leftist and the leak was used to attack Republican President George Bush.\u000a\u000aThe Plame furor concerned an obscure functionary buried deep in the national security apparatus and had zero impact on the security of the United States, although to be truthful the leak opened up an entirely new, lucrative career option for her \u2014 public speaking.\u000a\u000aThe leak also provided months of employment for investigators and lawyers and reporters covering the investigation of this mouse-sized indiscretion.\u000a\u000aNow compare that to the recent leaks of the entire transcripts of President Trump\u2019s phone calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The OpMedia first reported lying leaks regarding the conversations weeks ago. Then when the complete transcripts came out the OpMedia somehow neglected to report their earlier mistakes, in lieu of leaping on another opportunity to criticize President Trump.\u000a\u000aWhat they did report was totally illegal, as former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova told Fox News, \u201cThe unauthorized release of these documents to the press is a crime. The series of acts involving release of notes of the president\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders, and these transcripts, are a serious threat to national security.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt will also put a serious crimp in U.S. intelligence efforts since what government or individual will take any risks to share information with a security setup that is so porous?\u000a\u000aIn comparison with this egregious breach of security the Plame scandal is what it should have been from the beginning, a sideshow.\u000a\u000aThis time it looks like the sluggish Justice Department may actually get moving and start investigating. There is precedent and I would strongly encourage the investigation to start by issuing a subpoena for the phone records of the editors and reporters at The Washington Post. The fact one is a self-important journalist doesn\u2019t mean one has carte blanche to enter into a conspiracy with someone that would undermine the security of the U.S.\u000a\u000aJust like the fence is liable for selling stolen goods, the journalist should be liable for printing stolen, classified information.\u000a\u000aMichael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

aVPresident Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military on Friday to reject openly transgender people as new recruits but authorized Defense Secretary James Mattis to decide how to handle transgender personnel already serving in the armed forces.\u000a\u000aTrump also ordered the military to stop paying for gender reassignment surgical procedures by March 23 except to protect the health of someone who has already begun the process of reassigning sex, according to a senior White House official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe Defense Department will have six month to consider how to handle openly transgender people currently serving in the military under a memorandum that Trump signed on Friday, official said. The memorandum directs the department to consider unit cohesion, applicable law and resources in making the determination, the official said.\u000a\u000aTrump announced July 26 he would ban transgender people from serving \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the U.S. military, reversing President Barack Obama\u2019s policy to let them serve openly in the ranks.\u000a\u000aThe announcement, in a series of early morning tweets, caught Pentagon officials and key members of Congress off-guard, and the Pentagon said it wouldn\u2019t change its policies until it received a formal order from the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere will be no modifications to the current policy until the President\u2019s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,\u201d the office of Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford said in a statement after Trump\u2019s July tweets. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat formal notification came in a presidential memorandum Trump signed Friday, the White House official said.\u000a\u000aTrump said in July his concern hinged on the additional medical costs and \u201cdisruption\u201d of such troops. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited \u201cmilitary readiness and unit cohesion.\u201d\u000a\u000aCare related to gender reassignment costs the Pentagon $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, the larger number a little more than 0.1 percent of the military\u2019s entire health-care bill, according to a 2016 Rand Corporation study. By contrast, the military spent $84 million on Viagra and other drugs for erectile dysfunction for active-duty troops, eligible family members and retirees in 2014 alone, the Military Times reported.\u000a\u000aTreatment of transgender people has become a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars as social conservatives lead fights in some states to require that students and sometimes adults use school and public restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.\u000a\u000aTrump has attempted as a candidate to thread a needle between the two sides. In his campaign, he cultivated evangelical voters while at the same time promising to \u201cfight for\u201d the gay and transgender community.

aVOutrage over violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is prompting tighter regulation for online sites and services \u2014 affecting even free-wheeling dating apps, the New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aJust days after the Aug. 12 rally, the dating site OkCupid announced on Twitter it had banned a white nationalist, Christopher Cantwell, after a woman user recognized him in a report on the violence. After being contacted by the woman, app officials verified Cantwell's identity and "banned him for life."\u000a\u000aWe were alerted that white supremacist Chris Cantwell was on OkCupid. Within 10 minutes we banned him for life. \u2014 OkCupid (@okcupid) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000aThe Times reported Cantwell eventually surrendered to police on charges related to his alleged illegal use of tear gas during a white supremacist march the night before the larger rally.\u000a\u000a"We do not tolerate anyone who promotes racism or hatred \u2014 it's that simple," said Elie Seidman, OkCupid's chief executive, said in an email to The New York Times. "At OkCupid, our mission is to connect people based on substance \u2014 based on their shared sensibility. The privilege of being in our community does not extend to Nazis and supremacists."\u000a\u000aOKCupid officials also urged site users to report anyone "involved in hate groups," the Times reported.\u000a\u000aAnother dating site, Bumble, also announced it's aiming to ban "all forms of hate" through a collaboration with the Anti-Defamation League.\u000a\u000aOkCupid may have had good reasons to ban Cantwell, Jeremy Littau, an associate professor in the department of journalism and communication at Lehigh University, told the Times.\u000a\u000aBut "once they start policing peoples' beliefs offline it's not unreasonable to ask why they allow people who have other beliefs or behaviors that are repugnant," he told the Times.

aVHearing impairment is already linked to a heightened risk of cognitive decline in old age, and a new study suggests that impaired vision may carry the same risk.\u000a\u000aBased on data from two large studies of older Americans, researchers found those who had problems with distance vision were also two to three times as likely as those with strong vision to be cognitively impaired.\u000a\u000aRegular vision screening of older Americans could help to catch people at greater risk of cognitive problems and dementia, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe potential interactions between neurosensory (vision and hearing) impairment and cognitive impairment are still not very well understood,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Suzann Pershing, chief of ophthalmology at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System and a faculty member at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.\u000a\u000aVision problems affect 1 in 28 Americans older than age 40, according to the Wilmer Eye Institute in Baltimore. The number of people with vision problems could double by 2050, largely due to cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration in the nation\u2019s aging population.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut (these neurosensory interactions) are increasingly relevant given a growing U.S. population of older adults,\u201d Pershing told Reuters Health by email. \u201cWe have greater numbers of individuals who are experiencing diseases and functional limitations of aging as they grow older.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study team analyzed data from nearly 2,975 participants over age 60 in the yearly National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), as well as more than 30,000 participants over age 65 in the National Health and Aging Trends Study.\u000a\u000aBoth studies asked participants about their vision, bothersome vision problems and other health issues, and both assessed cognitive impairment and dementia with special tests. NHANES also assessed eyesight objectively with vision tests.\u000a\u000aAbout one quarter of participants in each of the surveys were found to have cognitive impairment or dementia.\u000a\u000aMost participants in NHANES had good distance vision, with only 9 percent unable to see someone across the street or watch television across the room. And 14 percent had difficulty with near-vision. But 30 percent said they felt hampered by vision problems in their daily lives.\u000a\u000aIn the other study group, just 7 percent and 5 percent of participants, respectively, had distance vision and near vision impairment.\u000a\u000aThe research team found that having distance vision worse than 20/40 and even the perception of having bothersome vision problems were associated with almost three-fold higher odds of cognitive impairment. Near-vision problems were less associated with higher odds of dementia or cognitive impairment.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt makes intuitive sense that vision impairment might lead to social disengagement and speed up cognitive decline,\u201d Pershing said. \u201cSimilarly, cognitive impairment when severe may result in functional visual impairment, even if the eyes are structurally healthy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends regular eye exams in older adults. But the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel that weighs medical evidence, concluded in both 2009 and 2016 that eye screenings don\u2019t lead to enough vision improvement in older adults to recommend them routinely.\u000a\u000aThe study results are \u201ca reminder and another potential reason for patients to monitor and maintain eye health,\u201d Pershing said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBe aware of the potential for vision loss either in yourself or in a family member with dementia or cognitive impairment,\u201d said Jennifer Evans of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK, who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cMuch visual impairment at older ages can be treated, either by a better pair of spectacles or cataract surgery, which is a safe and effective operation,\u201d Evans said.

aVDreamHost must turn over data from an anti-Trump website related to Inauguration Day protests, a District of Columbia Superior Court judge said on Thursday in approving a government warrant, but he added protections to safeguard "innocent users."\u000a\u000aChief Judge Robert Morin said the Los Angeles-based web-hosting company, must turn over data about visitors to the website disruptj20.org, which is a home to political activists who organized protests at the time of Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president in January.\u000a\u000aMorin, who will oversee review of the data, said the government must explain what protocols it will use to make sure prosecutors do not seize the data of "innocent users."\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Justice Department said it sought the records connected to the site because of concerns that it helped facilitate the planning of protests on Inauguration Day, when more than 200 people were arrested for rioting and vandalizing businesses in downtown Washington.\u000a\u000aDreamHost resisted the request, saying the scope of the warrant was too broad and trampled on the rights of 1.3 million visitors to the site, many of whom were simply expressing their political views.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department last week proposed amending the scope of its warrant to exclude the IP addresses of website visitors and limit the search only to records from July 1, 2016, to the Jan. 20 Inauguration Day.\u000a\u000aBut DreamHost said the warrant was still too broad, as it could sweep in people who sent emails to disruptj20 addresses. The company objected to the two-step process that would require it to turn over data in bulk and let prosecutors search for and seize evidence of criminal involvement in the riots.\u000a\u000aMorin said at a hearing on Thursday that he recognized the tension between free speech rights and law enforcement's need to search digital records for evidence. He said he added safeguards to his order granting the government's request for information in an effort to balance those two concerns.\u000a\u000aBesides reviewing the prosecutors' privacy protocols, Morin also shortened the time frame for records to those generated from October to Inauguration Day and instructed the prosecutors to explain why anything they want to seize is germane to the investigation.\u000a\u000a"It's a tremendous step in terms of further limiting what the government can do," said Raymond Aghaian, DreamHost's lawyer.\u000a\u000aBut the company still has concerns about the chilling effect of data being turned over for government review and is considering an appeal, Aghaian said.

aVGiven the range of human behavior and perception, it's a social and romantic myth that \u201copposites attract.\u201d In fact, it's likely a subconscious tendency for people to associate with others based upon superficial commonalities like ethnicity. All value judgments aside, its root is likely an ancient survival instinct. (Something that has nothing to do with hate or racial discrimination.)\u000a\u000aThis impulse emerges from one's family unit, building outward to larger circles of shared interests via common language and cultural experiences. In turn, these \u201cspecialized\u201d factions form the matrix of vibrant communities from the local to the state level and beyond.\u000a\u000aStill, there always remains some psychological tension between the individual desire for independence \u2014 versus any group's desire for uniformity. However, even in the case of identical twins, diversity is still seen in distinctive personalities. Thus, achieving a balance between all of these forces\u2014where difference is as respected as sameness is embraced\u2014is the foundation of any healthy and prosperous society.\u000a\u000aIn the modern age, freedom of thought, lifestyle and religious expression defines the West. Specifically, this is why America is the envy of the world: why people from distant shores \u2014 and diverse backgrounds \u2014 flock to live here. Yet, today, the vital mechanism that makes all of this work is under constant attack by Democrats' progressivism. Their words imply: 'come to the U.S. and impose your origin country's values even when they diametrically oppose our traditions.' Hence, Garrett Hardin, Ph.D. (1915 - 2003), ecologist and social scientist, cautions:\u000a\u000a\u201cDiversity within a nation destroys unity and leads to civil wars. Immigration, a benefit during the youth of a nation, can act as a disease in its mature state. Too much internal diversity in large nations has led to violence and disintegration. We are now in the process of destabilizing our own country. The magic words of destabilizers are \u2018diversity\u2019 and \u2018multiculturalism\u2019.\u201d\u000a\u000aPositive differences \u2014 same as new ideas \u2014 remain wonderful, and necessary things. Indeed, both add \u201cspice\u201d to any human interaction or evolving relationship. But, identity politics preys on those dissimilarities, exploits them for the ruling class's self-centered political ends. So, liberals subtly promote their Big Lie of the \u201cbad American\u201d: the dominant culture (read: white folks) perpetually victimizes minority groups because of their differing external appearance. Scurrilously, Democrats imply a deep-seated intolerance in our daily lives that does not exist. To add insult to injury, they pretend that those they claim to champion are somehow helpless or inferior. In reality, anyone can realize the American Dream with hard work, and a little luck.\u000a\u000aCapitalism is the basis of America's economic strength \u2014 embodied by the good, but often stylistically mercurial President Trump. For context, his attitude of U.S. victory contradicts that of another recent political upstart: socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Unlike Trump's motto of \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2014 based upon private sector investment and expansion \u2014 Sanders peddles big government intrusion as the \u201csolution\u201d to society's woes. In retrospect, as a harbinger of failure, was it any surprise that Bernie was swept into office during the 110th session of Congress: when polarizing Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) became House Speaker, and the legislature fell under total Democratic control?\u000a\u000aSince that time, what of the nation's metastasizing debt \u2014 nearing 20 trillion under liberals' (and RINOs') inept ministrations? Does any clear-thinking person still buy the Washington swamp's narratives? For one, President Ronald Reagan certainly didn't.

aVOne question about B vitamins that may pop into your mind is: Why are there so many of them?\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are eight in all,\u201d says registered dietician Joan Salge Blake. \u201cWhen B vitamins were first discovered in the early 1900s, researchers thought there was only one. After more research, it became apparent that they were not a single substance but several different ones.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey are all water soluble and share many similarities. Together, they function to help the body convert carbohydrates, fats, and protein into glucose to burn for energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven though they each have unique roles, the B vitamins perform a lot of the similar functions,\u201d says Joy Dubost, a registered dietician based in Washington, D.C. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a misnomer to think that B vitamins give you energy. That\u2019s incorrect. What they do is help your food to give you energy.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough B complex vitamins are vital to health, you typically don\u2019t hear much about them. One reason is because most Americans get an adequate amount through their diet, so there\u2019s no need to sound the alarm about great swaths of the population being deficient.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn general, for people to be deficient in the B vitamins, they have to be really malnourished,\u201d says Blake, a clinical associate professor at Boston University's Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. \u201cRefined grains are enriched with thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and folic acid, and all of the Bs are in a wide variety of foods.\u201d\u000a\u000aB vitamins are found in meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy products, beans, leafy green vegetables, asparagus, avocado, nuts, seeds, and a host of fortified grains and cereals.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you eat a well-balanced, healthy diet, you probably don\u2019t need a B-complex supplement,\u201d notes Dubost, former spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cThe problem is that most people don\u2019t eat a well-balanced diet, so supplements are a good insurance policy. Since B vitamins are water-soluble, your body gets rid of the surplus through urine. There\u2019s no risk of toxicity.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere are some of the specific functions of the B vitamins:\u000a\u000aB1 (Thiamine): Among other things, thiamine helps facilitate the transmission of nerve impulses, Blake tells Newsmax Health, adding, \u201cit also plays a role in breaking down alcohol in the body, so alcoholics need more of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aB2 (Riboflavin): B2 is a potent antioxidant that helps fight damaging free radicals. It is also vital for red blood cell production. Due to its pigment, riboflavin turns urine bright yellow when excess is excreted.\u000a\u000aB3 (Niacin): B3 dilates blood vessels, causing the \u201cniacin flush\u201d some people experience from taking supplements. \u201cWhen taken in very high doses, niacin can have a drug-like effect,\u201d says Blake. \u201cIt can lower cholesterol levels, especially that of the \u2018bad\u2019 LDL cholesterol. But it should only be taken in large doses under the care of a physician.\u201d\u000a\u000aB5 (Pantothenic acid): Its name comes from the Greek word \u201cpantothen,\u201d meaning \u201cfrom everywhere.\u201d That\u2019s because small amounts of B5 are found in so many foods. It helps the body produce stress and sex hormones, including testosterone.\u000a\u000aB6 (Pyridoxine): B6 teams up with B9 and B12 to keep in check levels of the amino acid homocysteine, which can contribute to heart disease. It also helps to produce hormones that improve sleep and mood.\u000a\u000aB7 (Biotin): Dubost tells Newsmax Health that \u201cwomen tend to gravitate towards biotin because it\u2019s known as a hair, nail, and skin vitamin. But people are rarely deficient in it.\u201d\u000a\u000aB9 (Folic acid): This vitamin is especially crucial for women. \u201cAll women who are capable of becoming pregnant should make sure they get 400 micrograms of folic acid daily,\u201d Blake says. \u201cIf they become pregnant, it can reduce the risk of birth defects.\u201d\u000a\u000aB12: (Cobalamin): Vegans can become deficient in B12 because it is primarily found in animal products. Blake notes that between 10 percent and 30 percent of people over the age of 50 can also face deficiency issues because they have trouble breaking down the B12 in food. \u201cThey have a better time using a synthetic version,\u201d she says.

aVRetirement is a major, exciting life event, but it can also be stressful if you\u2019re not fully prepared. Here are some things to do well in advance of your planned retirement to make the transition easier.\u000a\u000a1. Define retirement \u2013 The idea of a traditional retirement spent sitting on a porch swing every day is outdated. Today\u2019s retirees are active, and many wish to continue some kind of fulfilling work whether it\u2019s part-time employment or volunteer work. Mark Dorman, CEO of the Dorman Group, tells U.S. News and World Report that retirees should \u201cdefinitely avoid doing nothing.\u201d Give some thought to your expectations.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a2. Cut expenses \u2013 Begin looking for ways to decrease financial obligations. Begin by listing your monthly expenses, be honest, and figure out ways to save money. AARP recommends eliminating as much debt as possible since this will mean less monthly expenses against your retirement income.\u000a\u000a3. Research Social Security \u2013 For many people, Social Security will be needed to supplement retirement savings. AARP says that it pays to wait as long as possible to begin receiving your benefits since the payouts are larger. Waiting until full retirement age can also benefit your spouse if they survive you.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000a4. Visit your doctor \u2013 While you still have employer-sponsored health insurance, visit your doctors and evaluate your overall health. Address any issues you may have been putting off like dental work, hearing tests, and eye exams, advises HuffPost.\u000a\u000a5. Make housing decisions \u2013 You will need to live somewhere, so determine the most practical choice. If you would like to downsize or move to another city, do it before you retire. HuffPost says it may be impossible to get a new mortgage if you can no longer show lenders you have a regular income.\u000a\u000a6. Plan for the unexpected \u2013 You will stress less in retirement if you have already thought about how you will handle the expenses if you suddenly need a new hot water heater or if you become ill, says AARP. Have a plan ready before you quit working.\u000a\u000a7. Stay connected \u2013 Full-time work will no longer provide a social outlet, HuffPost says, so think about ways you can connect with others. For some, hobbies and clubs work well and for others, picking up part-time work is the answer.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack

aVDo you equal-opportunity Trump haters ever listen to yourselves? You sometimes remind me of the people in those movies who live the same day over and over.\u000a\u000aYou must wake up every day \u2014 wholly oblivious to your behavior the day before \u2014 gleefully imagining how you could dismantle Trump with a single tweet, a doleful column or a brief television critique. Even if your criticisms sound new to you, most of us were here yesterday \u2014 and during the days, weeks and months leading up to yesterday. What you are offering is not profound.\u000a\u000aSometimes the absurdity reaches comical proportions. You figuratively subject Trump to rapid machine-gun fire every day and then lay your weapons down, walk over to the camera and castigate Trump for bleeding.\u000a\u000aYes, some of Trump's abrasions are self-inflicted, but anyone under ceaseless fire like him would be hard-pressed not to overreact from time to time.\u000a\u000aThe news media \u2014 almost all on the left and too many on the right \u2014 make every news cycle about Trump. It's not about North Korea's nuclear weapons, Afghanistan, immigration, health care or radical Islam. It's about Trump. Every story is centered on him.\u000a\u000aAnd don't tell me this is only because Trump makes everything about himself. Oh, yes, he personalizes things, but we're not talking about him; we're talking about you. You make it about him \u2014 and about yourselves and your moral superiority for condemning him as a Neanderthal every five minutes.\u000a\u000aWe get it. Republican Trump supporters disgrace themselves. After all, according to many of you, Trump would have no support among conservative commentators and media figures if they listened to their consciences. No, they've all sold out.\u000a\u000aApparently, I can't be a constitutional conservative and support Trump, so I must be doing it for ratings on a show I don't have or Twitter likes, though I've yet to figure out how to monetize my betrayal.\u000a\u000aBut enough about me. How about people who do have shows and make their living through commentary? Well, I know a lot of them personally, and I don't know any who support Trump because they think it will enhance their ratings. It's not that they don't try to get ratings. But they don't support Trump as a means to that end.\u000a\u000aGo ahead and laugh. But your automatic assumption that such conservative support for Trump must be political prostitution possibly reflects a hint of narrow arrogance. Trump is so manifestly egregious there could be no logical reason a bona fide conservative could support him. Right?\u000a\u000aLet me respectfully suggest that Trump hasn't changed in office. He is the same person we saw on the campaign trail and the same person the American people elected as their 45th president. He was every bit as brash, unfiltered and unorthodox as he is now, so the next time you rush to your computer or microphone to declare his instability or unfitness for office, remember that the American people knowingly elected him as just that guy. Therefore, when you are impugning him, you might as well be (and often are) impugning them.\u000a\u000aNow let me further shock you. They didn't elect Trump because they thought he was some panacea or some perfect cult hero. Yes, there are some Trump supporters who appear to be cultlike in their support, but I dare say that even most of them view Trump less as someone who is perfect and more as one who is in the foxhole with them trying to fight the forces determined to dismantle America as founded, piece by piece.\u000a\u000aI acknowledge Trump's uniqueness and that he may have been the only one who could have satisfied the grass roots in 2016. But I think the Trump movement transcends Trump. It preceded him but coalesced in him and will survive him. You won't eradicate the Trump movement by removing Trump \u2014 assuming that's your endgame.\u000a\u000aYou complain that Trump's peculiar mix of policy hodgepodge under the Republican banner is destroying the conservative and Republican brands. I used to be more sympathetic to that argument. But the problem is that Republicans have not been able (and often haven't seemed willing) to fight back against this leftist juggernaut that represents an existential threat to all we hold sacred. So many of them would haughtily scoff at the mere suggestion that we face existential threats in that context.\u000a\u000aConceding that Trump is no conservative ideologue by any stretch and still clinging to my self-identification as a Reagan and Ted Cruz conservative, I think we have a far better chance of thwarting the leftist agenda and recapturing lost territory under someone like Trump \u2014 as opposed to some well-mannered, leftist-appeasing centrist \u2014 who is willing and determined to fight.\u000a\u000aYou can be sure that the calculating left will be just as militant no matter who is in power. In fact, if members of some sordid bipartisan coalition are able to claim Trump's political scalp based on the stuff they're now throwing against the wall against him, there's no telling how emboldened the left will become. If you can live with that, it might be time for you to quit moralizing to us.\u000a\u000aYou might be deluding yourself if you think Trump will implode. You can read the polls and think he's finished or conclude that the latest tweetstorm is the final nail. But you will be wrong.\u000a\u000aSome of you should quit worrying so much about conflating ideologies. The rise of so-called populist nationalism would have far less traction if the right showed much greater solidarity in standing up for the American idea, which is not about ethnicity, race, gender or diversity but about liberty, equal opportunity, a strong and unashamed America, and the rule of law. Advocating all these noble principles in theory alone will no longer be sufficient. We must get in the fight.\u000a\u000aI love pure constitutional conservatism, perhaps as much as anyone, but way too many people who don't love it are pretending they do and using Trump as a scapegoat to cover for their failure to fight for the principles and policies they profess to champion.\u000a\u000aI'm not suggesting that you shouldn't legitimately criticize Trump when he deserves it or that you abandon your principles. But please take your blinders off and get off your high horse.\u000a\u000aIf those of you who can't quit salivating over your next Trump dump would spend just a fourth of that time registering outrage over the stuff regularly spewing from the left \u2014 including the mainstream media \u2014 maybe you would do your part in helping to close the void that was filled by Donald Trump. Until our side recognizes the gravity of our situation and unifies to fight against the left with the same commitment the left brings to this fight, you can be sure that at least a strong plurality of the political right will continue to rally around unorthodox figures who at least have the brass to fight back.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Limbaugh is a writer, author, and attorney.

There's a website that's posted on many of those banners . . . an extreme communist website that these people belong to," Kerik said.\u000a\u000a"These are the same people ripping down these monuments and destroying property.

"I think these people . . . were allowed to go too far. I think there should've been more of an aggressive stance by the local and the state police."\u000a\u000aKerik, who in addition to running the NYPD also served as Iraq interim minister of interior and former senior policy adviser to the U.S. Envoy to Iraq, added:\u000a\u000a"When you let [in] rebel rousers, and you let people engaged in violence . . . It's very dangerous to sit back and do nothing. We've seen that in Baltimore. We've seen it in other places.\u000a\u000a"When the police sit back and do nothing you let these people do what they want. They injure people. They kill people. They destroy property. They commit to acts of violence that is against the law, and it shouldn't happen. So, I think the police probably had learned their lesson in this case.\u000a\u000a"But I also think the FBI, the Department of Justice in this civil rights investigation, they've got to look at both sides. These people are lunatics. Personally, and this is me, my personal opinion, there are lunatics on both sides."\u000a\u000aKerik said he had no objections to peaceful protests.\u000a\u000a"You want to go out there and protest, it's your right to do so by law," he said. "But the second you engage in violence and do something that's criminal, these hate crimes \u2013 you had a guy run people down in a crowd with a car, this is criminal conduct.\u000a\u000a"I think the attorney general has to be aggressive. I think they've got to go after these people. They've got to go after the groups, and they have to go after the people sponsoring the groups, the people that pay for these.\u000a\u000a"You know some of these protesters get paid by the hour to go to these things. Who's doing that? There's a conspiracy to get these people in these positions. Who's doing that? Hold them accountable and lock them up."

aVPANCHKULA, India (AP) \u2014 Hundreds of security forces marched through a northern Indian town on Saturday to maintain calm after supporters of a quasi-religious sect leader protested his rape conviction with violence that left at least 30 people dead.\u000a\u000aAuthorities appealed to thousands of followers of the guru, who calls himself Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insaan, to vacate his headquarters in Sirsa, a town in Haryana state, and go home.\u000a\u000a"There are no instructions to security forces to enter the headquarters and forcibly clear it," said police spokesman Surjit Singh.\u000a\u000aAfter a court declared the sect leader guilty of raping two of his followers 15 years ago, mobs on Friday set fire to government buildings, vandalized bus stations and government vehicles, and attacked police officers and TV journalists in the town of Panchkula, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Sirsa.\u000a\u000aPolice used tear gas and water cannons and fired bullets to control the mobs.\u000a\u000aAuthorities lifted curfew restrictions on Panchkula, the main trouble spot, on Saturday after the night passed relatively peacefully and the area was cleared of protesters, said police officer Pradeep Kumar.\u000a\u000aHowever, Kuldeep Puri, a 45-year-old resident, said people had come out of their homes after three days but were still scared. "Offices are shut today, even private offices are shut. No buses are running on the streets," Puri said.\u000a\u000aTens of thousands of supporters of the sect leader had camped in Panchkula for days waiting for Friday's court verdict.\u000a\u000aHaryana state police chief B.

More than 1,000 of the guru's supporters were detained on charges of arson and destruction of public property, he said.\u000a\u000aPolice said two other people were killed in the town of Sirsa, where the headquarters of the sect is located.\u000a\u000aThe guru, who had denied the charges of raping the two women at his ashram in 2002, was flown by helicopter to a jail in the nearby town of Rohtak because district officials feared they would be overrun by his supporters. His sentence will be announced Monday.\u000a\u000aIndian Home Secretary Rajiv Mahrishi said Saturday that the situation was under control elsewhere in Haryana and the neighboring state of Punjab, as well as in the capital, New Delhi. Railway stations in the towns of Malout and Balluana were ablaze, and two coaches of an empty train parked in New Delhi's Anand Vihar station were set on fire on Friday.\u000a\u000aA curfew was imposed in at least four districts of Punjab, said Amrinder Singh, the state's chief minister.\u000a\u000aThe sect claims to have about 50 million followers and campaigns for vegetarianism and against drug addiction. It has also taken up social causes such as organizing the weddings of poor couples. Such sects have huge followings in India. It's not unusual for their leaders to have small, heavily armed private militias protecting them.\u000a\u000aClashes in 2007 between Dera Sacha Sauda followers and members of the Sikh faith left at least three people dead in northern India.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, six people were killed when followers of another religious leader, the guru Rampal, fought pitched battles with police who were attempting to arrest him after he repeatedly failed to appear in court in connection with a murder trial.

aVRussia special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had been part of an effort to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\u000a\u000aThe report was based on "people familiar with the matter."\u000a\u000aThe effort to obtain Clinton's hacked emails was disclosed by the Journal in June \u2014 and it was led by Peter Smith, a longtime Republican activist who died in May. He was 81.\u000a\u000aSmith, in correspondence and conversations with his colleagues, "portrayed Mr. Flynn as an ally in those efforts and implied that other senior Trump campaign officials were coordinating with him, which they have denied," the Journal reported.\u000a\u000aSmith also named Flynn's consulting firm \u2014 Flynn Intel Group, which has since been disbanded \u2014 and his son, Michael G. Flynn, in the correspondence and conversations.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Journal in May, Smith said he believed that as many as 33,000 emails that Clinton said were personal and had been deleted from her private server had been obtained by hackers.\u000a\u000aHe made contact with what he said were five groups of hackers in the last months of last year's presidential campaign. Two of the groups, Smith believed, consisted of Russians who claimed to have Clinton's emails.\u000a\u000a"We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government," Smith told the Journal in the interview.\u000a\u000aThere was no evidence that Clinton's server was ever hacked.\u000a\u000aAccording to the report, Mueller's investigators were seeking to determine whether the elder Flynn was involved in Smith's effort to obtain the hacked Clinton documents. At the time, Flynn was a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump fired Flynn in February amid concerns about his disclosures to Vice President Mike Pence about his Russia connections. A lawyer for Mr. Flynn and a lawyer for his son declined to comment, the Journal reported.\u000a\u000aPeter Carr, a Mueller spokesperson, declined to comment.\u000a\u000aIn addition, U.S. officials "with knowledge of the intelligence" told the Journal that investigators also have examined reports that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from the Clinton server and providing them to Flynn via an intermediary.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Journal noted that "it is isn't known if those hackers are ones" Smith approached in his effort.\u000a\u000aOn May 14, about 10 days after his Journal interview, Smith asphyxiated himself in a hotel room in Rochester, Minn., according to local authorities.\u000a\u000aHis body was found in a hotel located across the street the Mayo Clinic, according to a medical examiner's report.\u000a\u000aA Smith associate told the Journal that he had recently visited the clinic.\u000a\u000aIn a note found near Smith's body, he apologized and said that "no foul play whatsoever" had occurred with his death, authorities told the Journal.

aVGut bacteria may play a key role in mental health by affecting the way genes are expressed in the brain, scientists have found.\u000a\u000aThe link between gut bacteria and anxiety has been the focus of much research in recent years, but determining how the microbiome affects your mental health has been a mystery until now, International Business Times reports.\u000a\u000aNew research by University College Cork found that anxious mice raised in a microbe-free environment express genes in the brain differently due to changes in their microRNA, according to the study in the journal Microbiome.\u000a\u000a"This is important because these microRNAs may affect physiological processes that are fundamental to the functioning of the central nervous system and in brain regions, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are heavily implicated in anxiety and depression," said study author Gerard Clarke in a statement.\u000a\u000aJust how the gut bacteria are regulating the microRNAs is still not clear. More research is needed before clinical trials can be carried out to assess the impact of changing gut bacteria on mental health.\u000a\u000aBut the new findings suggest that improving your gut health by eating prebiotic foods rich in fiber could well end up being good for your mental health.\u000a\u000a"This is early-stage research but the possibility of achieving the desired impact on microRNAs in specific brain regions by targeting the gut microbiota \u2013 for example by using psychobiotics \u2013 is an appealing prospect," said Clarke.

aVLong-term consumption of tiny amounts of lithium may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, but only if the dose isn't too small, according to a study that looked at levels of the element in drinking water throughout Denmark.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the wrong amount may actually increase dementia risk, researchers report in JAMA Psychiatry.\u000a\u000aLithium, used for years in drugs to treat depression and bipolar disorder, is a naturally-occurring element in drinking water in Denmark but levels vary by location. The team compared the estimated amount found in the water supplies of 275 municipalities to the rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's, in those areas.\u000a\u000aResidents who had been diagnosed with dementia from 1995 through 2013 tended to consume lower levels of lithium in their water than residents whose water had higher levels. However, there was a middle level of consumption where dementia risk was elevated or unchanged.\u000a\u000aCompared to those whose water contained lithium concentrations of 2 to 5 micrograms of lithium per liter, which served as the baseline, the rate of dementia was 22 percent higher when the drinking water concentration was 5 to 10 micrograms.\u000a\u000aLevels of 10.1 to 15 micrograms had no effect on the risk.\u000a\u000aBut at levels of 15.1 to 27 micrograms per liter, the dementia risk seemed to drop by 17 percent compared to places where the levels were 2 to 5 micrograms.\u000a\u000a"It's a really interesting study but you have to be careful about inferring cause and effect," said Dr. Brent Forester, head of the geriatric division of McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts affiliated with Harvard Medical School, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\u000a\u000aIn a telephone interview with Reuters Health, he called the fact that the effect didn't strictly increase or decrease based on the lithium dose "a worrisome sign" and said the non-linear trend "could be a warning that there's another confounding variable. It may not be the lithium itself but something about the mechanism of action might be protecting against developing dementia. The biology of lithium is worth exploring, for sure."\u000a\u000aThe chief author of the study, Dr. Lars Vedel Kessing of the University of Copenhagen, did not respond to requests for an interview. But the researchers cautioned in their paper that "it cannot be excluded that other, unobserved environmental or social care factors related to individuals\u2019 municipality of residence might have confounded the association between lithium exposure and dementia rate."\u000a\u000aThe idea of a link between lithium and Alzheimer's has been around for years, Forester said.\u000a\u000a"Over a decade ago, a pathology study that looked at the brains of patients who had a lifelong history of bipolar disorder and were treated with lithium versus those with a lifelong history of bipolar disorder who were not on lithium showed that those exposed to lithium had about one sixth the rate of Alzheimer's pathology," he said. "It raised a lot of interesting questions and eyebrows about the mechanism."\u000a\u000aOther research has shown that low doses - but doses far higher than found in the drinking water in the Denmark trial - may reduce the odds of Alzheimer's. But research has been limited because drug companies don't stand to make a lot of money from lithium therapy.\u000a\u000aForester said he would not advise people to try using lithium to ward off Alzheimer's because the drug can harm the kidneys, although the levels seen in the drinking water in Denmark are too low to pose a serious risk.

You have owners, you have fans, and you want to honor that if you're making that kind of money.\u000a\u000a"If you have a cause, I think you should organize it, present it in a manner where it's not only you sitting on one knee, but a lot of people that are gonna get behind each other and do something about it.\u000a\u000a"If you're a football player, play football. If you're gonna be a real activist, use your money, use your notoriety."\u000a\u000aBrown said the racism debate has "meaning to me," but he is an American first and would never disrespect the flag or the National Anthem.\u000a\u000a"I'm an American, I don't desecrate my flag and my National Anthem," Brown said.\u000a\u000aKaepernick is currently a free agent after opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers earlier this year. Some have suggested NFL teams refused to sign him because of the baggage he brings.\u000a\u000aNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said earlier this month, however, teams are free to sign who they want based on their needs.\u000a\u000a"Teams make decisions [based] on what's in the best interest of their team ... and they make those decisions individually," Goodell said.

"We are killing terrorists."\u000a\u000aMcMaster told reporters that Trump's strategy also focuses on creating broader peace in the region.\u000a\u000a"He wanted to have a sound regional strategy, not a strategy that lasts a year," he said. "We have had 16 one-year strategies in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a"It gives us the greatest chance largely in support of the Afghan government and their long struggle against groups and the Taliban and to integrate it with what we hope to achieve diplomatically.\u000a\u000a"Afghanistan is connected to broader security concerns across the region," McMaster said.

aVGardening improves health in a variety of ways, affecting physical, mental, and emotional aspects of your life. What\u2019s great about gardening is that it\u2019s a great hobby for people of all ages.\u000a\u000aYou can reap the benefits whether you're focusing on growing houseplants or food. The healthy hobby can be performed in any sized space, such as on the patio or in the backyard. Plant some bulbs, dig holes, or prune bushes and you\u2019ll soon notice the changes that take place throughout your body, mind, and spirit.\u000a\u000aThe following are six ways gardening is good for your health:\u000a\u000a1. Lowers risk of heart disease and diabetes \u2014 The activity involved in gardening reduces stress levels to improve heart health, reducing the risk of heart-related conditions such as diabetes and obesity. The nutritious foods gardeners grow are also heart healthy, according to Rodale\u2019s Organic Life.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Causes weight loss \u2014 Any type of activity helps with weight management and gardening is a good way to burn calories, notes Heather Hausenblas in U.S. News. She adds that the American Council on Exercise reveals that gardening can burn some 300 calories an hour.\u000a\u000a3. Boosts your mood \u2014 Depression, anxiety, and anger are reduced through gardening, which increases the feel-good hormone dopamine and relaxing serotonin, says Sarah Rayner in Psychology Today. Levels of cortisol, which may trigger stress, are reduced.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Provides a sense of responsibility \u2014 Caring for plants brings gardeners respect for all living things and helps teach them how to nurture. It increases self-esteem to know you can assist nature. Working in the outdoors, even in a small garden, improves the skills you have learned.\u000a\u000a5. Great exercise \u2014 Raking and digging are considered high-intensity activities while weeding, mulching, and watering provide moderate-intensity exercise. So, gardening can even encourage you to exercise more for a healthy body and mind.\u000a\u000a6. Makes you eat better \u2014 Just as you\u2019ll want to exercise more, you\u2019ll also have more fruits and veggies in your diet. What\u2019s more, products grown in home gardens are tastier and more nutritious than produce found in stores. Gardeners have easy access to these fresh foods and should integrate them as regular sources of nutrition in their diet.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat

Even the pros have their quirks.\u000a\u000aHere are some of the game\u2019s most unique swings and their proud owners:\u000a\u000a1. Eammon Darcy \u2013 This Irish golfer may have had an unconventional swing, but it earned him four victories on the European Tour, and he competed in the Ryder Cup four times, according to Golf Magazine.

The swing is characterized by a double overlapping grip, a looping takeaway to the outside, and finally a looping drop back to the inside on the downswing.\u000a\u000a4. Moe Norman \u2013 This Canadian champ was shy and eccentric, says the Golf Channel, and while his personality may have limited his pro career, his unorthodox swing earned him two Canadian PGA titles. He was known for how straight he could hit the ball using his rigid arm position and minimal hand and knee action.\u000a\u000a5. Nancy Lopez \u2013 This LPGA superstar won 48 tournaments, four team events, and three majors with her unusual swing that she herself described once as, \u201cno uglier than Arnold Palmer\u2019s\u201d and \u201cthe same ugly swing every time.\u201d Golf Magazine says her swing is characterized by a dramatically inside takeaway and the club pointing well right of the target at the top.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVMohamed El-Erian, Allianz SE\u2019s chief economic adviser, said that investors focused on lower-than-expected inflation shouldn\u2019t overlook the possibility that the Federal Reserve will nonetheless raise interest rates to limit possible disruptions to the economy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI suspect the market is too sanguine when it comes to how much central bankers are thinking about the risk of financial instability down the road,\u201d El-Erian said Friday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing more central bankers talk about the risk of financial instability, and they do care about it because it could undermine future growth.\u201d\u000a\u000aCentral bankers in the U.S., who have gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, are on guard for potential risks after some expressed concern in their June meeting that \u201csubdued\u201d market volatility could leave the economy vulnerable to shocks. Monetary policy makers have been slow to raise interest rates from record low levels, lifting their benchmark only four times in the past two years as inflation failed to meet targets. Still, unemployment is falling and markets have rallied.\u000a\u000aEl-Erian said that investors shouldn\u2019t be \u201cexcessively obsessed\u201d with low inflation, since that may be due more to structural issues. The Fed should consider tightening policy in December, according to the economist, who is also a Bloomberg View columnist.\u000a\u000aLow inflation suggests that policy should \u201cremain looser for longer,\u201d he said in a separate interview on Bloomberg Radio. But \u201cconcern about financial instability says, \u2018take this window and tighten.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aYears of monetary easing have buoyed financial markets, with stocks reaching records in the U.S. That\u2019s lead to distorted asset prices, according to El-Erian. He reiterated his call for fiscal policy makers to take a more active role in promoting underlying economic growth in the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do have distorted markets for good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, they can get validated by better fundamentals that result from a policy hand-off, but the prospects for that are not great right now.\u201d\u000a\u000aFed Chair Janet Yellen addressed stability in remarks Friday at Jackson Hole after El-Erian spoke. She said that any changes to regulations should be \u201cmodest\u201d since they helped make the financial system more resilient.

From their legal and professional troubles \u2014 domestic violence, steroid use, or gambling \u2014 to their over-the-top consumerist lifestyles complete with high-priced luxury vehicles and plenty of bling, the public is privy to every detail.Because of that, we often don't hear about those athletes that make religion their focus. Many of America's top professional sports figures rank God as No. 1 in their lives, and they're not afraid to show their dedication and religious beliefs both on and off the field.Here, Newsmax has assembled a list of the top 50 athletes and coaches who have deep religious faiths and live out their religions as the major light of their lives.\u2014 The Heisman Trophy winner who went on to quarterback for the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, and New England Patriots made it a practice to kneel in prayer before games, so much so that it sparked a new trend \u2014 "Tebowing." But Tebow's deep Christian faith goes well beyond that, from his preaching and supporting Evangelists in the Philippines to maintaining his virginity until marriage. "I still honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, because at the end of the day, that's what's important, win or lose," he has said. "We need to get back to one nation under God and be role models for kids."\u2014 The USA World Cup soccer team captain and Texan is a devout Roman Catholic, who has said, "My faith in Christ is what gives me confidence for the future. I know that through both good times and bad, He is faithful and will watch over me."\u2014 The five-time Major League Baseball All-Star and Texas Rangers outfielder came clean about his struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol in his autobiography "Beyond Belief," and said he credits God for saving his life and career. "It's a God thing," he says.\u2014 The former Dallas Cowboys linebacker turned to God after serious injuries threatened his career. In a video for non-profit group "I Am Second," he said: "God just had a different plan. He blessed me to be the comeback player of the year in the NFL. You have to realize that there is a God and he does show up and do miracles. My faith in Jesus is everything. It is my life."\u2014 The mixed martial arts champion briefly turned to God at the age of 20 after a neck injury nearly halted his career in 2004, but he later backslid. After his sister was kidnapped in Brazil, raped, and murdered, he said, "My heart was hard and getting bitter. I wanted a solution to my pain. I started praying. God spoke to my heart. That was my biggest touch with a true relationship with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Now I have a great family and a great relationship with God."\u2014 The former Brigham Young University star and player for the Sacramento Kings, the Chicago Bulls, the New Orleans Pelicans, and the Westchester Knicks is very open about his Mormon faith. He married his wife, Whitney, in a "sealing" ceremony at the LDS Temple in Denver and has said, "I definitely have grown closer to the Lord since I\u2019ve been in the NBA. I'm not doing all this to put on a show. I\u2019m doing it because I truly believe in the church and believe in the gospel and this is how I want to live my life."\u2014 The top women's tennis professionals and sisters are well known to be devout Jehovah's Witnesses. They were home-schooled by their equally devout mother and do not vote in elections, as their faith teaches them to remain neutral in politics.\u2014 The quarterback of the San Diego Chargers is a devout Roman Catholic and once told Life Teen, "Appreciate the faith. Appreciate what we have and what a great gift the sacraments are. If you're going to be a Catholic man, be it all the way." He often speaks to youth groups about abstaining from sex until marriage, as he did.\u2014 The Major League Baseball player has a Catholic mother and a Jewish father. The second baseman for the Detroit Tigers, Kinsler is a prominent member of the Jewish community and won the Jim Sundberg Community Achievement Award in 2008.\u2014 The San Francisco Giants pitcher, a Cy Young Award winner, has been a devout Christian since childhood. "I knew enough to understand I wanted to be saved and wanted Jesus to be Lord of my life," he once said.\u2014 The Ukrainian-born welterweight boxer is an orthodox Jew who will not fight on the Sabbath or Jewish holidays, keeps kosher, and even enters the ring to the strains of Yiddish rap music.

Terms weren\u2019t disclosed. Spotify, the biggest on-demand streaming service with more than 60 million paying subscribers, plans to skip a traditional share sale and list directly on the New York Stock Exchange late this year or early next, according to people familiar with the matter.\u000a\u000aBy signing Warner, Spotify can assure investors that it has good working relationships with the biggest suppliers of its song catalog.

The labels had previously been working with Spotify without long-term deals in place.\u000a\u000aIn accords with Universal Music, the world\u2019s largest record label, and Merlin Network Group, which represents a consortium of independent labels, Spotify agreed to pay a smaller share of revenue to those partners if it meets certain targets.

aVFlorida on Thursday put a man to death with an anesthetic never used before in a U.S. lethal injection, carrying out its first execution in more than 18 months on an inmate convicted of two racially motivated murders.\u000a\u000aAuthorities said 53-year-old Mark Asay, the first white man executed in Florida for the killing of a black man, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. Thursday at the state prison in Starke. Asay received a three-drug injection that began with the anesthetic, etomidate.\u000a\u000aThough approved by the Florida Supreme Court, etomidate has been criticized by some as being unproven in an execution. Etomidate replaced midazolam, which became harder to acquire after many drug companies began refusing to provide it for executions.\u000a\u000aProsecutors say Asay made racist comments in the 1987 fatal shooting of a 34-year-old black man, Robert Lee Booker. Asay also was convicted of the 1987 murder of 26-year-old Robert McDowell, who was mixed race, white and Hispanic. Asay had hired McDowell, who was dressed as a woman, as a prostitute, and killed him after learning his true gender, prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aAsay was asked whether he wanted to make a final statement. "No sir, I do not. Thank you," he replied.\u000a\u000aThe execution protocol began at 6:10 p.m. About a minute after the first drug was administered, Asay's feet jerked slightly and his mouth opened. A minute or two later he was motionless and subsequently was pronounced dead by a doctor.\u000a\u000aMichelle Glady, a spokeswoman for the corrections department, said there was no complication in the procedure and that Asay did not speak during it.\u000a\u000aThe execution was Florida's first since the U.S. Supreme Court halted the practice in the state after finding its method for sentencing people to death to be unconstitutional. The high court earlier Thursday had rejected Asay's final appeal without comment.\u000a\u000aAsay was the first white man to be executed in Florida for killing a black man. At least 20 black men have been executed for killing white victims since the state reinstated the death penalty in 1976, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. A total of 92 Florida inmates had been executed previously in that time period.\u000a\u000aThe inmate's spiritual adviser, Norman Smith of Cavalry Chapel in Melbourne, Florida spent two hours with Asay before his execution. He said he admitted spouting racial epithets prior to Booker's murder, but said he was drunk and angry, not a racist.\u000a\u000a"Until I heard that I would've never known that this man was tagged as a racist," said Smith, who is black. Asay, he added, was ready and not conflicted as the execution hour approached.\u000a\u000aEtomidate is the first of three drugs administered in Florida's new execution mixture. It's followed by rocuronium bromide, a paralytic, and finally, potassium acetate, which stops the heart. It is Florida's first time using potassium acetate too, which was used in a 2015 execution in Oklahoma by mistake, but has not been used elsewhere, a death penalty expert said.\u000a\u000aState corrections officials have defended the choice of etomidate, saying it has been reviewed. The corrections department refused to answer questions from The Associated Press about how it chose etomidate.\u000a\u000aDoctors hired by Asay's attorneys raised questions about etomidate in court declarations, saying there are cases where it had caused pain along with involuntary writhing in patients.\u000a\u000aBut in its opinion allowing the drug to be used, the state's high court said earlier this month that four expert witnesses demonstrated that Asay "is at small risk of mild to moderate pain."\u000a\u000aExecutions in Florida were put on hold for 18 months after the Supreme Court ruled that the old system was unconstitutional because it gave judges, not juries, the power to decide.\u000a\u000aSince then, Florida's Legislature passed a law requiring a unanimous jury for death penalty recommendations.\u000a\u000aIn Asay's case, jurors recommended death for both murder counts by a 9-3 vote. Even though the new law requires unanimity, Florida's high court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling did not apply to older cases.\u000a\u000aAsay was the 24th inmate executed since Gov. Rick Scott has taken office, the most under any governor in Florida history.

"The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties."\u000a\u000aCBP public affairs officer Roberto Rodriguez, when asked to clarify the statement, told The Tribune that officers will prioritize public safety, but also plans to follow its own rules.\u000a\u000aThe American Civil Liberties Union in Texas strongly criticized the Border Patrol's plans.\u000a\u000a"Safety should be a priority regardless of immigration status," said ACLU policy strategist Astrid Dominguez. "This is very concerning for the community. It sends a wrong message."\u000a\u000aMany lives have been lost in past hurricanes when people do not have the resources to relocate before a storm, and as locations along the coast are preparing for a 12-foot storm surge, Abbott and other officials on Friday were urging residents to heed evacuation orders.\u000a\u000a"One of the most important things we can and have done is to prepare for water rescue missions," the governor said. "We have multiple teams, whether it be through the 700 state and National Guard that we've activated, whether it be what's called Texas Task Force One or Two, or working with FEMA, we have multiple water rescue teams south of Corpus Christi up to the Houston area to make sure that we will be able to be in the process of saving lives, which is the most important thing we can do."\u000a\u000aIn addition, he said, there are multiple buses leaving areas such as Corpus Christi, taking people to places such as San Antonio or Austin, and people fleeing the storm will not need to worry about the cost.\u000a\u000a"You have other people who will be taking care of you," said Abbott. "You need to find a pathway out. If you're looking for that pathway, contact your local emergency management director, that should be easy to find. If nothing else, call your local police department and they can put you in touch with them. Take haste and use all speed to try to find a pathway out of this storm."\u000a\u000aA cone at the southern end of the storm will hit Brownsville and the Mexican border, including the Rio Grande, and Abbott said Texas is coordinating with Mexican officials concerning the danger. The state also is coordinating with officials and the Border Patrol up and down the Rio Grande Valley, up to north and northeast of the Houston area.\u000a\u000a"This is going to be a massive storm that will have ripple effects up and down the Texas coastline, so this is going to be broad-based coordination by officials at all levels," said Abbott.\u000a\u000aThe governor also said the oil companies also are ready for the storm, as they are experienced in dealing with hurricanes.\u000a\u000a"They get prepared in advance and make sure that they will minimize both the potential damage, but also expedite the process of getting the refineries back up and running," said Abbott. "If there's anybody I have confidence in, it's those refineries because they know how to operate this. They will get it back online as quickly as possible."

aVU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signaled Friday that the administration\u2019s goal of completing a tax overhaul by the end of 2017 may not be a firm deadline.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you know earlier in the year I said I\u2019d thought we would get it done by August and I was wrong,\u201d Mnuchin said during a press conference at the White House. \u201cI\u2019m now going to say that I\u2019m very hopeful and I think we can get this done by the end of the year, but we will continue to revisit that.\u201d\u000a\u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has said it\u2019s essential to complete a tax bill by the end of the year or it risks being derailed by political complications surrounding mid-term elections in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn\u2019t committed to finishing legislation by the end of 2017; in May, he declined to put a deadline on it.\u000a\u000aThe so-called Big Six -- made up of White House officials and congressional leaders involved in tax negotiations -- jointly released a two-page statement in July that outlined a broad set of agreed-upon tax principles. Specifics, including such basic matters as where to set the corporate tax rate and how to set up individual tax brackets, have yet to emerge.\u000a\u000aMnuchin\u2019s remarks came as President Donald Trump is preparing to spend the next several weeks leading a public campaign in support of tax legislation. The White House will leave Republican lawmakers to hash out details of the plan, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in an interview with the Financial Times.\u000a\u000aTrump will kick off the campaign next week with a visit to Missouri, according to an administration official familiar with the plans. His trip Wednesday to the state\u2019s southwestern city of Springfield is expected to be the first of several stops around the country in the coming weeks, said the official, who asked not to be identified because the details were still under review.\u000a\u000aCohn said in that interview that he believes the legislation can be written and pass both chambers of Congress by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have been holding hearings for years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they are just starting the process now.\u201d

aVFrench President Emmanuel Macron's makeup cost has drawn widespread criticism after officials confirmed he paid $30,695 on makeup during his first three months in office.\u000a\u000aThese accumulated costs, confirmed by the president's office Friday, included paying a freelance makeup artist to accompany Macros to various television appearances and on trips abroad, The Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000aLe Pont first broke with the news on Thursday with a detailed report looking at how much Macron invested in makeup and for a hairdresser.\u000a\u000aAccording to the report, presidential aides claimed hiring the makeup artist was considered a "matter of urgency." They went on to say that there would be a significant reduction in cosmetic bills in the future.\u000a\u000aAn Elyse Palace official told The Guardian that the amount covered "various services including press conferences and foreign trips where the person concerned has to travel with him."\u000a\u000aThe official added that, although the bill was high, it was still less than what Macron\u2019s predecessor\u2019s spent on makeup.\u000a\u000aLast year The Washington Post reported that former French president, Franois Hollande, reportedly paid his hairdresser $10,000 a month.\u000a\u000aIn an attempt to justify the expenditure, government spokesman Stphane le Foll said, "everyone has their hair done, don\u2019t they? This hairdresser had to abandon his salon and he\u2019s on tap 24 hours a day."\u000a\u000aNews of Macrons cosmetic expenditure has caused a stir on social media as users across the world took to Twitter to air their views.\u000a\u000aOne user likened the French President to Kim Kardashian while another joked that, if Macron had spent so much just on his complexion, the expenses of makeup for eyes and lips would be even worse.

aVDonald Trump staked his presidential candidacy on building a wall along the Mexican border and won. He promised repeatedly throughout the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, a promise he cannot enforce. So now he wants American taxpayers to foot the bill, and this week he threatened to shut down the entire government if Congress doesn't include wall funding in a debt ceiling bill that must be signed into law by Sept. 30, when the government's authorization to spend money runs out. The president issued his warning at a rally in Phoenix this week before a crowd that cheered wildly. I wonder how happy those same people would be if Trump were to follow through on his threat, seeing as large numbers of them, judging from the audience pictures on live TV, wouldn't receive their Social Security checks in the mail.\u000a\u000aBuilding the wall isn't about controlling illegal immigration; there are more effective and cheaper means to do so. And illegal immigration is at historically low rates now anyway. The peak in illegal crossings occurred between 1995 and 2000, when more than 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to enter the country illegally. Since then, the numbers have declined steadily, with a couple of upticks, and declined most dramatically after the Great Recession. In 2016, the number of people caught was about 409,000 (in the same range as the early 1970s). And the figures have dropped even more in the first six months of 2017 \u2014 a fact Trump has repeatedly taken credit for, claiming, misleadingly, a 76 percent decline since he was elected.\u000a\u000aTrump uses immigrants as a convenient scapegoat whenever the need arises, as it did this week after widespread condemnation of his divisive and contradictory statements in the wake of the death of a woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a neo-Nazi drove his car into a group of people protesting a white supremacist march. It is no accident that Trump headed to Phoenix, ground zero in recent immigration battles, when the heat rose. He can always whip up a crowd by invoking Mexican "rapists" and drug dealers. No wonder some 62 percent of Americans say the president is doing more to divide the country, while 59 percent say Trump's actions and behavior have encouraged white supremacists, according to a new Quinnipiac poll.\u000a\u000aTrump's threats and bullying \u2014 especially of members of Congress in his own party \u2014 are getting old. At some point, he must accomplish something concrete for the American people. And by "concrete," I don't mean an ugly, unnecessary barrier between the United States and our third-largest trading partner. The president has promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, reform our tax laws, get rid of counterproductive regulation and rebuild our infrastructure. So far, the only progress he's made is in the regulatory area. He cannot accomplish the rest of his agenda without Congress. That's the way our system works, a lesson he apparently missed when he went to "better schools" and was "a better student" than his critics. ("I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great," he also reminded the rallygoers.)\u000a\u000aCongress returns after the long August recess Sept. 5. The debt ceiling and government funding bills are just the most pressing on the legislative agenda. The president has spent much of the week insulting the very people he needs to move forward, blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan by name for failing to get anything done. But Trump has been the most feckless president in recent memory. Barack Obama assumed office with a thin resume and few accomplishments to his credit, but he managed to get important legislation passed to keep the country from slipping further into economic disaster amid a difficult and lengthy recession. Bill Clinton flailed in his first couple of years, which resulted in his party's losing the House of Representatives in the midterm election for the first time in 42 years. And Jimmy Carter surrounded himself with loyal but inexperienced White House staff members, who alienated many of their needed allies on the Hill, and was largely regarded as a failed president. But Donald Trump is even more hapless.\u000a\u000aTrump needs to stop talking about building walls and focus on building the relationships he needs within his own party. The country doesn't need a government shutdown. It needs a president interested in more than his own ego.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLinda Chavez is chairwoman of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a nonprofit public policy research organization in Falls Church, Va.; a syndicated columnist; and a political analyst.

aVA Catholic boarding school in California is catching heat for removing Catholic statues from public view at its campus.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Marin Independent Journal, the San Domenico School in San Anselmo has moved several statues and other religious artifacts and symbols associated with Catholicism to the basement in order to create a more inclusive atmosphere.\u000a\u000a"Articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenico's 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate one's heritage and beliefs," wrote Shannon Fitzpatrick, whose 8-year-old son is a student at the school, in an email to administrators.\u000a\u000aOne removed statue that has parents particularly upset depicts Mary and Baby Jesus. A parent told the Independent Journal that students would place a crown on Mary during a ceremony. That statue was previously located in the courtyard of the primary school on the campus.\u000a\u000aAmy Skewes-Cox leads the school's board of trustees and told the Independent Journal the removal of statues is in line with the school's forward-looking plan. She added that 18 religious icons are still in place around campus.\u000a\u000aSaid head of school Cecily Stock: "San Domenico is both a Catholic school and an independent school . . . We want to make sure that prospective families are aware that we are an independent school."\u000a\u000aThe majority of American Catholics, meanwhile, did not support President Donald Trump's performance in the White House in a poll taken earlier this summer.

aVU.S. officials are investigating a mystery in Cuba and are trying to determine if sonic weapons were used against diplomats at homes provided to them by the Cuban government, leaving at least 16 with serious injuries.\u000a\u000aThe State Department said Thursday that at least 16 Americans were injured, and an investigation is ongoing to determine the perpetrator, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aDiplomats started complaining about hearing loss, nausea symptoms, headaches, to balance disorders starting in late 2016, CBS News reported. U.S. and Canadian diplomats working in country's capital of Havana have been diagnosed with conditions including mild traumatic brain injury and possible damage to the central nervous system.\u000a\u000aSenior State Department officials told CNN that they believe sophisticated devices that operated outside the range of audible sound were deployed either inside or outside diplomats' residences in Havana.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental factors or human error in surveillance also may be to blame for the injuries, CNN noted.\u000a\u000a"There's 100 percent certainty that American diplomats were under Cuban surveillance. There's nowhere near that certainty that the Cubans were aiming sonic weapons at American diplomats. It could be harassment, but it's kind of weird," James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN, explaining his theory that surveillance equipment "screwed up."\u000a\u000aThe State Department told CBS News that even though they don't know a source of the attacks, it reminded Cuban authorities of their responsibility to protect diplomats. The U.S. expelled two Cuban embassy officials on May 23, the network wrote.\u000a\u000a"We hold the Cuban authorities responsible for finding out who is carrying out these health attacks on not just our diplomats but, as you've seen now, there are other cases with other diplomats involved," Rex Tillerson, the U.S. secretary of state, said earlier, CBS News noted.\u000a\u000aCuba rejected the idea that they have been involved in attacking Americans earlier this month, stating, according to CBS News, that it "has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception."\u000a\u000aDr. Hung Jeffrey Kim, a neurologist at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, told CNN that the diplomats were likely exposed to low frequency sound because it can travel much farther than ultrasound.\u000a\u000aNational Institutes of Health toxicologist Dr. Scott Masten told CNN that, "At certain amplitude infrasound can cause physiological effects -- it can change heart rate, respiratory rates, blood pressure."

The school\u2019s headmaster was alerted to the incident by Rabbi Peter Berg, WSB-TV reported.\u000a\u000aThe five students in the photograph were suspended, and the student who had set up the game and snapped the image was expelled.\u000a\u000a"The fact that someone could even conceive of such a game, and then play it and think it\u2019s funny is beyond words," Berg said, according to WSB-TV.\u000a\u000aHe added that the community and country needed to wrap it\u2019s mind around the issue of hate speech in general in order to understand how horrifying the image was to Jewish people.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson of the school later sent an email to WSB-TV, stating that "character education is at the heart of all we do at Lovett, and we deeply appreciate the individuals and organizations across our community who are helping us to continue to learn and grow from this very troubling incident."\u000a\u000aLovett headmaster William S.

aVJerry Lewis\u2019s death from heart disease marked the end of his long struggle with cardiac problems, which was probably the legacy of his career in show business, a top expert says.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost entertainers die an early death from heart disease because of their hard-driving lifestyle,\u201d Dr. Chauncey Crandall tells Newsmax Health.\u000a\u000aLewis, a comedic icon and philanthropist, died Sunday in Las Vegas. Although his death was originally attributed to natural causes, the coroner on Monday released a statement listing it as \u201cischemic cardiomyopathy," multiple news reports say.\u000a\u000a\u201cIschemic cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes progressively weak and can no longer pump enough blood to keep up with the demands of the body,\u201d says Crandall, chief of the cardiac transplant program at the world-renowned Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.\u000a\u000aLewis was plagued with cardiac problems during most of his life. He suffered his first heart attack in 1960 at the age of 34, and also had at least two more later on.\u000a\u000aThat Lewis had his first heart attack at such a young age does not surprise Crandall, author of the Heart Health Report.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost people in show business die young because they have multiple risk factors for heart disease, including frequent travel, poor sleep, and the stress that comes from being an entertainer,\u201d Crandall says.\u000a\u000aLewis also weathered a number of other ailments throughout his life, including prostate cancer, Type 1 diabetes, and pulmonary fibrosis. He also suffered a major back injury in 1965 that almost paralyzed him, and left him with a lifelong chronic pain problem.\u000a\u000aBut Lewis always fought through his problems, performing and also ultimately raising more than $2 billion dollars for his favorite cause, the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact that he lived to a ripe old age can probably be attributed to his sense of humor, as well as the fact that he felt he was on a mission to do good for others,\u201d adds Crandall.

aVUrgent:\u000a\u000aDo You Support Donald Trump for the GOP Nomination? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aUrgent:\u000a\u000aWho Should the GOP Nominate in 2016? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aWhich GOP Candidate Would You Support in 2016?\u000a\u000aThey may be admired or loathed but one thing staffers and colleagues who requested anonymity agree on is that this \u201cgang of 10\u201d \u2014 senators of both parties \u2014 are the hardest-working of the elected lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Whether it is jetting home on weekends, putting in long hours in Washington or on the campaign trail, or their political rise and survive, these 10, observers agree, have an excess of \u201celbow grease.\u201dEditor\u2019s note: The entrants are listed alphabetically by state.\u2014 When U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions was blocked as George H.W. Bush's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals, observers who wrote him off as "finished" didn't reckon with the prosecutor's ability to rebound. He got elected attorney general of Alabama, then won the seat of the Democratic senator who blocked him (Howell Heflin). These days, Sessions is his party's hardest charger in the Senate on illegal immigration and a top advisor to Donald Trump.\u2014 Love him or loathe him, old and young hands on Capitol Hill almost universally regard McCain \u2014 now 80 and seeking a sixth term \u2014 as the \u201cenergizer bunny of Congress.\u201d He maintains his usual regimen of returning home to Arizona every weekend and becoming a near-omnipresence on Sunday morning (and every morning) TV talk shows. Those who know him best, such as close friend and fellow Vietnam POW Orson Swindle, swear McCain reads a book a week and, in Swindle\u2019s words, \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u2014 After a meteoric rise to the Senate in 2014 after one term in the House, this Harvard Law graduate and U.S. Army veteran of Iraq is already making a reputation for himself as a leading GOP spokesman for aggressive U.S. foreign policy. Cotton helped lead the Senate charge against the Obama administration\u2019s Iran agreement and convinced all but one of his Republican colleagues to sign a letter reminding Tehran\u2019s rulers the Senate would have last say on any agreement.\u2014 Self-styled "farm girl" and Army National Guard Col. Ernst captured imaginations with her 2014 commercials describing how she loved to "castrate pigs" and showing her on a Harley heading to target practice. Nominated to the Senate over four primary opponents and elected in the fall with 53 percent of the vote, Ernst now works hard on pro-life cause, remains an unapologetic climate change skeptic, and still finds time to handle the causes of her fellow "farm folks."\u2014 He routinely leaves staffers and colleagues speechless as he explains complex issues related to healthcare in simple terms. A physician who co-founded a pro-bono clinic with his physician-wife, Cassidy last year crafted a market-based alternative to Obamacare that he trumpeted in whirlwind press conferences and TV appearances until the Supreme Court upheld the controversial plan.\u2014 In 2014, the former Bush administration official and Lutheran college president came out of nowhere to beat three better-known and better funded opponents for nomination to the Senate. Considered an effective spokesman on government reform, Sasse is the first Nebraska senator in memory to commute weekly from what he hails as "the tall and beautiful grass at home."\u2014 Booker\u2019s capacity for long hours and hard work that is now becoming legend among his Senate colleagues and staffers first became evident when he was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Whether it was being on the scene during a fire or making the case for school vouchers, Booker was working at it in a major way. When not in Washington, the freshman senator is usually on the stump for friend Hillary Clinton and is increasingly mentioned as a vice presidential candidate \u2014 or possibly a presidential contender in 2020.\u2014 Like the Republican he unseated in 1998, Sen. Al D\u2019Amato, Schumer is home every weekend dealing with neighborhood problems and holding town meetings. During the week, however, he pays extra attention to colleagues and to the press. One joke often heard on Capitol Hill is \u201cthe most dangerous place in Washington is between a camera and Chuck Schumer.\u201d Schumer\u2019s \u201celbow grease\u201d yielded benefits this year, when he wrapped up enough votes to guarantee his election as Senate Democratic Leader when Harry Reid retires at the end of 2016.\u2014 As much as Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the raspy-voiced Brown embraces and champions the complete left-of-center agenda. But in hailing from a state where Republicans hold every statewide office except his, Brown\u2019s political survivor and stature is especially impressive. Whether the issue is same-sex marriage (he opposed a statewide measure to ban it) or the Iraq War (he fought it from the beginning), Brown outworks opponents and supporters alike, Hill-watchers agree. It is no surprise he is mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for either Sanders or Clinton.\u2014 \u201cThe best place to catch Pat Toomey,\u201d goes the joke on the Senate side of Capitol Hill, \u201cis at Union Station [the Washington, D.C., train station] on Thursday or Monday.\u201d There, the junior senator can be found heading back to Pennsylvania, where he is highly visible meeting constituents over the weekends. In Washington, he is considered a driven lawmaker who embraces small government issues as well as working with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W Va.) on a modest gun control measure (which never got out of the Senate and caused Toomey some discomfort on the right). He is considered one of the more vulnerable GOP senators facing the voters in \u201916, but no one writes him off.

And I've got a copy of it right here."\u000a\u000aWilenchik, whose firm is based in Phoenix, told Berman that Arpaio still believes that he was innocent.\u000a\u000a"To this day, we contend and he actually was innocent," he said. "If not for this, what we're going to do is ask the court to dismiss the case, ask for an acquittal.\u000a\u000a"Had this not happened, we would have spent years fighting for his innocence."

aVPresident Donald Trump, facing his first major test in coping with a natural disaster, pushed federal emergency officials on Friday to be ready to help Gulf Coast residents as Hurricane Harvey bore down on the region.\u000a\u000aTrump said on Twitter he was following the storm's progress from the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, and the White House said he spoke with the governors of Texas and Louisiana and took briefings from emergency experts.\u000a\u000a"His questions aren't about the geopolitical issues or about large political consequences," Tom Bossert, the White House Homeland Security adviser, told a news conference. "His questions are: 'Are you doing what it takes to help the people that are going to be affected by this storm?'"\u000a\u000aThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which coordinates the response to major disasters, said it had sent more than 96,000 liters of water, 306,000 meals and 4,500 tarps to support bases in Texas and Louisiana with additional supplies being readied in case they are needed.\u000a\u000aMajor storms have posed severe challenges to previous presidents. The flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, which killed well over 1,000 people and wrecked parts of New Orleans in 2005, tainted the remainder of George W. Bush's presidency.\u000a\u000aRepublican Senator Chuck Grassley warned Trump on Friday to do better than that. "Keep on top of Hurricane Harvey dont make same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina," he said in a tweet to the president.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration earlier this year proposed cutting billions of dollars in funding for FEMA, and it has not yet filled key posts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, both of which closely track major weather events and coordinate with other government agencies.\u000a\u000aBut the U.S. Congress has mostly rejected the government's proposed cuts to FEMA's budget, and the agency is led by Brock Long, who has considerable experience in disaster management and was overwhelmingly confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June.\u000a\u000aSome critics said Hurricane Harvey might show the administration the importance of maintaining well-financed emergency response agencies.\u000a\u000a"Maybe this will be a moment where they sober up and realize the real-life human impact of those decisions," said Rachel Cleetus, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-based advocacy group.

aVDonald Trump started as the most unpopular new president in the history of modern polling. After seven months, things have only gotten worse.\u000a\u000aPlunging into undesirably uncharted territory, Trump is setting records with his dismally low approval ratings, including the lowest mark ever for a president in his first year. In fact, with four months left in the year, Trump has already spent more time under 40 percent than any other first-year president.\u000a\u000aAt 34 percent, his current approval rating is worse than former President Barack Obama's ever was.\u000a\u000aTrump's early descent in the polls defies some longstanding patterns about how Americans view their president. Such plunges are often tied to external forces that the president only partially controls, such as a sluggish economy or an all-consuming international crisis. In Trump's case, the economy is humming and the foreign crises have been kept to a minimum.\u000a\u000aAmericans also tend to be optimistic about their new leaders, typically cutting them some slack during their early days in office. Not with Trump.\u000a\u000a"Most presidents begin with a honeymoon period and then go down from that, and Trump had no honeymoon," said Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport.\u000a\u000aIt's a jarring juxtaposition for the reality TV star-turned-president who spent months on the campaign trail obsessing about his poll numbers and reading them to massive rally crowds while vowing that he'd win so much as president that Americans would get sick of it. Since he took office, the poll number recitations have stopped.\u000a\u000aTrump is now viewed positively by only 37 percent of Americans, according to Gallup's most recent weekly estimate. (Obama's lowest weekly average never fell below 40 percent.) It's even lower \u2014 just 34 percent \u2014 in Gallup's shorter, three-day average, which includes more recent interviews but can also involve more random variation.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, approval ratings can fluctuate \u2014 sometimes dramatically. Some presidents have seen their positive reviews dip below 40 percent, only to recover strongly. Bill Clinton, whose rating fell to 37 percent in early June 1993 after policy stumbles, quickly gained ground. Later that same month, he climbed to 46 percent, and ended his eight years enjoying approval from 66 percent of the nation.\u000a\u000aTrump has defied the trends before. But if history is a guide, his numbers don't bode well. Low approval ratings hamper a president's ability to push an agenda through Congress and make it more likely the president's party will lose seats in Congress in the midterm elections.\u000a\u000aScott de Marchi, who teaches political science at Duke University, says his research suggests approval ratings tend to affect whether a president can persuade Congress to do his or her bidding. That's primarily true with complex issues like tax reform, where Americans care about the outcome but may not have strongly formed opinions. In those cases, Americans are more likely to support whatever plan the president proposes if they broadly approve of the president himself.\u000a\u000a"The problem with Trump is that on any area like the budget or tax policy or even health care, people need to be led to a position to support," de Marchi said.\u000a\u000aSince Gallup began tracking presidential approval, four presidents \u2014 Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush \u2014 spent significant time below 40 percent during their first four years. Clinton's and Ronald Reagan's forays below the 40 percent mark also came during their first terms. But neither stayed there long.\u000a\u000aOf those who spent at least a few months below 40 percent approval in a first term, only one \u2014 Truman \u2014 recovered enough to win re-election.\u000a\u000aStill, several others reached lows at some point in their presidency that are worse than Trump's, including several who dropped below 30 percent.\u000a\u000aTruman hit 22 percent in February 1952, during a drawn-out Korean War stalemate and accusations of corruption in his administration. Richard Nixon hit 24 percent at the height of the Watergate scandal just before his resignation in 1974. Carter bottomed out at 28 percent in the summer of 1979, amid that year's oil crisis.\u000a\u000aTrump's average approval rating so far: Just 40 percent. That's even lower than the previous average low for a first-term president, 46 percent, set by Carter.\u000a\u000aNewport, the Gallup chief, said Trump's struggles are unusual in that such abysmal numbers can usually be tied to a single, specific issue bedeviling the country. With Trump, Newport said, "it's a more general kind of issue with the man himself and a more general dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country."\u000a\u000aIn July, Gallup posed another question to Trump's disapprovers: Why? Nearly two-thirds cited his personality or character, while less than a third cited issues, policies or job performance.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, when Gallup asked the same question about Obama in 2009 and George W. Bush in 2001, less than 2 in 10 disapprovers cited similar concerns about personal characteristics.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of Republicans support Trump while the vast majority of Democrats oppose him. Such political polarization might be both a blessing and a curse for Trump, preventing him from achieving higher ratings but also keeping him from falling even further.\u000a\u000a"When Trump has done things that have generated an enormous amount of attention and people have anticipated his rating could go down, it has not," Newport said. "And that's because he's being propped up by Republicans."\u000a\u000aIt's unclear whether Trump's most recent bout with controversy \u2014 his response to racially tinged clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 further harmed his approval ratings. It could be he's close enough to bottoming out that the latest dust-up will have little effect.\u000a\u000aIn a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted Aug. 16-20, just 28 percent said they approve of Trump's response to Charlottesville. But 37 percent said they approved of the job Trump is doing overall \u2014 almost the exact same percentage that approved in the same poll a month earlier.\u000a\u000aYet if the famously image-conscious Trump aspires to undo some of the damage, there's reason to hope.\u000a\u000a"The history of presidential job approval ratings shows an enormous amount of fluctuation," Newport said. "There's no historical reason why his ratings couldn't go up."

aVFollowing the recent clashes between the alt-right and the group antifa, some libertarians have debated which group they should support. The answer is simple: neither. The alt-right and its leftist opponents are two sides of the same authoritarian coin.\u000a\u000aThe alt-right elevates racial identity over individual identity. The obsession with race leads them to support massive government interference in the economy in order to benefit members of the favored race. They also favor massive welfare and entitlement spending, as long as it functions as a racial spoils system. Some prominent alt-right leaders even support abortion as a way of limiting the minority population. No one who sincerely supports individual liberty, property rights, or the right to life can have any sympathy for this type of racial collectivism.\u000a\u000aAntifa, like all Marxists, elevates class identity over individual identity. Antifa supporters believe government must run the economy because otherwise workers will be exploited by greedy capitalists. This faith in central planning ignores economic reality, as well as the reality that in a free market employers and workers voluntarily work together for their mutual benefit. It is only when government intervenes in the economy that crony capitalists have the opportunity to exploit workers, consumers, and taxpayers. Sadly, many on the left confuse the results of the \u201cmixed economy\u201d with free markets.\u000a\u000aIronically, the failure of the Keynesian model of economic authoritarianism, promoted by establishment economists like Paul Krugman, is responsible for the rise of the alt-right and antifa. Despite a recent (and likely short-lived) upturn in some sectors of the economy, many Americans continue to struggle with unemployment and a Federal Reserve-caused eroding standard of living. History shows that economic hardship causes many to follow demagogues offering easy solutions and convenient scapegoats.\u000a\u000aLeft-wing demagogues scapegoat businesses and the \u201cone percent,\u201d ignoring the distinction between those who made their fortunes serving consumers and those who enriched themselves by manipulating the political process. Right-wing demagogues scapegoat immigrants and minorities, ignoring how these groups suffer under the current system and how they are disproportionally impacted by policies like the war on drugs and police militarization.\u000a\u000aAs the Keynesian-Krugman empire of big government and fiat currency collapses, more people will be attracted to authoritarianism, leading to an increase in violence. The only way to ensure the current system is not replaced with something even worse is for those of us who know the truth to work harder to spread the ideas of liberty.\u000a\u000aWhile we should be willing to form coalitions with individuals of good will across the political spectrum, we must never align with anyone promoting violence as a solution to social and economic problems. We must also oppose any attempts to use the violence committed by extremists as a justification for expanding the police state or infringing on free speech. Laws against hate speech set a dangerous precedent for censorship of speech unpopular with the ruling elite and the deep state.\u000a\u000aLibertarians have several advantages in the ideological battle over what we will replace the Keynesian welfare model with. First, we do not need to resort to scapegoating and demagoguing, as we have the truth about the welfare-warfare state and the Federal Reserve on our side. We also offer a realistic way to restore prosperity. But our greatest advantage is that, while authoritarianism divides people by race, class, religion, or other differences, the cause of liberty unites all who seek peace and prosperity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Paul is a physician, author, and former Republican congressman.

aVOn Jan. 16, 2017 CNN ran a story, authored by Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, entitled "Donald Trump is 'Gaslighting' All of Us." As Ms. Ghitis explained, the term gaslighting "comes from the 1930s play 'Gas Light' and the 1940s Hollywood movie version ("Gaslight") in which a manipulative husband tries to unmoor his wife, portrayed by Ingrid Bergman, by tampering with her perception of reality."\u000a\u000aMs. Ghitis claimed that as a candidate Mr. Trump had manipulated the public\u2019s perception of what was true and what was not by "saying and doing things and then denying it, blaming others for misunderstanding, disparaging their concerns as oversensitivity, claiming outrageous statements were jokes or misunderstandings, and other forms of twilighting the truth." She declared that unless Mr. Trump radically changed his behavior once he became president, "gaslighting will become one of the words of 2017."\u000a\u000aIn another Ghitis hit piece aired by CNN on July 4, 2017, Ms. Ghitis linked to her earlier gaslighting story when describing what she referred to as President Trump\u2019s "grotesque barrage of attacks on the media." She charged that such attacks reflected his "authoritarian" impulse "to create his own reality."\u000a\u000aThis past Tuesday, finding itself once again under attack by President Trump for its biased reporting at a rally of his supporters in Phoenix, CNN used its platform to engage in its own form of gaslighting by irresponsibly portraying the president as mentally unstable.\u000a\u000aCNN's Don Lemon said of the president\u2019s Phoenix speech that there was "no sanity there," adding every unflattering adjective he could think of. In order to add some gravitas to his rant, Lemon had CNN contributor James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence, on his program to comment on President Trump\u2019s speech. Clapper said, "I really question his ability, his fitness to be in this office." Recall that Clapper had lied under oath to Congress when he denied that the NSA had wittingly collected any type of data on millions of Americans. He is not exactly a reliable character witness.\u000a\u000aCNN political commentator Ana Navarro wrote on Twitter after the Phoenix rally, "Only possible defensible explanation for Trump\u2019s disgusting, unpresidential, narcissistic behavior, would be early-on-set dementia. Maybe."\u000a\u000aCNN host Brian Stelter is quoted as saying that President Trump\u2019s fitness for office often comes up as a topic for discussion among CNN\u2019s supposed journalists, saying, "Questions like these: Is the president of the United States a racist? Is he suffering from some kind of illness? Is he fit for office? And if he\u2019s unfit, then what?" This is according to Fox News.\u000a\u000aCNN, like other Trump hating outlets, are full of individuals who pretend to be psychologists as well as objective journalists.\u000a\u000aWhat provoked the anti-Trump media this time was that fact that President Trump would not accept the media\u2019s post-Charlottesville narrative that he was a racist and a white supremacist sympathizer. He pushed back hard. He chastised the press for distorting what he had said in his response to the tragedy.\u000a\u000aReading from his prior statements in which he had spoken out forcefully against hatred and racism and condemned neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists specifically, President Trump said the media "don\u2019t want to report the facts."\u000a\u000aThe president did omit reference to his more controversial comments, in which he claimed there had been violence "on many sides" during the Charlottesville melee and that there were "very fine people on both sides." But it was those comments over which the media obsessed and took out of context. This was done without any acknowledgement that the bulk of his responses to the Charlottesville tragedy were his calls for unity and respect for one another \u2014 as Americans.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s indignant protest that he had been falsely portrayed as a racist amounts to proof of his insanity as far as the anti-Trump media are concerned. Raising questions as to the president\u2019s sanity often enough is intended to create a false narrative that, if left unchallenged, becomes conventional wisdom.\u000a\u000aThe objective is to build public pressure for President Trump to either resign from office or to be removed under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution. Trump haters simply refuse to accept the results of the election and are determined to see him gone. If gaslighting him does not work, they will move on to their next scheme to take him down.\u000a\u000aJoseph A.

aVU.S. regulators have approved the first drug to treat all forms of hepatitis C in as little as eight weeks.\u000a\u000aThe pill combination from AbbVie Inc. was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for adults without significant cirrhosis, a type of liver disease, and many patients who were not cured by prior treatment.\u000a\u000aMavyret joins two other AbbVie hepatitis C drugs, one from Merck & Co. and four from Gilead Sciences Inc. on the market. That gives doctors and patients more options, and insurers more leverage to wring discounts out of companies to cover the pricey drugs.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually develops slowly over decades, with no symptoms until serious damage is done. Without treatment, the virus can cause liver failure and liver cancer, often requiring a liver transplant or resulting in death.\u000a\u000aFor decades, hepatitis C treatment required a year of grueling shots and pills that gave patients flu-like symptoms and still barely cured half of them. Starting late in 2013, Gilead revolutionized treatment with the first pill-only medicines that brought cures in 12 weeks for more than 90 percent of patients.\u000a\u000aGilead has been raking in billions on the drugs. Insurance plans and government health programs have been straining to cover the huge cost \u2014 up to $94,500 for a course of treatment with its second drug, Harvoni \u2014 and initially limited coverage to the sickest patients.\u000a\u000aAbbvie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, said Mavyret's list price without insurance will be $26,400 for eight weeks' treatment, $39,600 for 12 weeks' treatment and $52,800 for 16 weeks' treatment.\u000a\u000aAs the latest entrant in a competitive market in which commercial insurers mostly have deals giving them discounts of up to 50 percent in exchange for not covering rivals' hepatitis C drugs, Maryvet is priced well below the other approved drugs. AbbVie spokesman Morry Smulevitz said the company initially will focus on getting coverage approved by Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration.\u000a\u000aThe key to how much market share Maryvet can get will depend on the discounts it offers payers, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote to investors.\u000a\u000aMavyret is the latest drug to treat all six forms of hepatitis C, following Gilead's Epclusa. Earlier drugs generally are limited to patients with just one or a few hepatitis C types or at certain stages of the disease.\u000a\u000aIn testing that included 2,300 adult patients, 97.5 percent who didn't have cirrhosis were cured, meaning the virus was undetectable in their blood, in eight weeks after taking Mavyret. Among patients with severe kidney damage, 98 percent were cured after 12 weeks of treatment, according to AbbVie.\u000a\u000aMaryvet combines two hepatitis C medicines, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, taken as three pills together once a day.

aVAging brings a decline in mental and physical fitness, but a new study shows an easy, fun way to reverse the signs of aging in the brain \u2014 dancing. Researchers examined two different fitness routines and found that while both had an anti-aging effect on the brains of the elderly, dancing had the most profound effect.\u000a\u000a"Exercise has the beneficial effect of slowing down or even counteracting age-related decline in mental and physical capacity," says the study's lead author Dr. Kathrin Rehfeld.\u000a\u000a"In this study, we show that two different types of physical exercise (dancing and endurance training) both increase the area of the brain that declines with age. In comparison, it was only dancing that led to noticeable behavioral changes in terms of improved balance."\u000a\u000aFor the study, researchers recruited elderly volunteers with an average age of 68. They were assigned either an 18-month weekly course of learning dance routines, or endurance and flexibility training.\u000a\u000aThe traditional fitness training program mainly comprised repetitive exercises, such as cycling or Nordic walking, but the dance group was challenged with something new each week.\u000a\u000aBoth groups showed an increase in the hippocampus region of the brain, the area that is vulnerable to age-related decline and is affected by diseases like Alzheimer's. The hippocampus also plays a key role in learning and memory as well as the ability to balance.\u000a\u000a"We tried to provide our seniors in the dance group with constantly changing dance routines of different genres (Jazz, Square, Latin-American and Line Dance)," said Rehfeld.\u000a\u000a"Steps, arm-patterns, formations, speed and rhythms were changed every second week to keep them in a constant learning process. The most challenging aspect for them was to recall the routines under the pressure of time and without any cues from the instructor."\u000a\u000aThese extra challenges are thought to account for the noticeable difference in balance displayed by members of the dancing group.\u000a\u000a"I believe that everybody would like to live an independent and healthy life, for as long as possible," said Rehfeld. "Physical activity is one of the lifestyle factors that can contribute to this, counteracting several risk factors and slowing down age-related decline.\u000a\u000a"I think dancing is a powerful tool to set new challenges for body and mind, especially in older age."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.\u000a\u000aOther research has also found dance to be an effective way to reduce the risk of dementia.\u000a\u000aA study at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that seniors who took part in brain-stimulating activities such as reading, writing, and doing puzzles, lowered their risk of dementia by as much as 47 percent. Although the study found no significant reduction in the risk of dementia among those who exercised regularly in activities such as bicycling, swimming, and team sports, one physical activity \u2014 ballroom dancing \u2014 reduced the risk of developing dementia by an astonishing 67 percent.\u000a\u000aExperts believe the key is dance's combination of intense mental and physical activity. "Dancing is a complex activity," said researcher Dr. Joe Verghese of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "You have to remember the steps and how to dance them, you have to move in time with the music, and you have to adapt to the actions of your partner."\u000a\u000aAmong additional studies is one from Korea which found that seniors with metabolic syndrome who learned to dance the cha-cha, a popular ballroom dance, improved their memory and cognitive function within six months when compared to controls. And a Canadian study found that seniors who danced tango twice a week improved their scores on cognitive tests.

aVGardening is an enjoyable hobby, but it is also a wonderful way to reduce your dependence on store-bought food, which is often not grown locally or organically. Even if you don\u2019t have a lot of space or time, these tips will help you make the most of your garden and provide your family with as much high-quality food as possible.\u000a\u000a1. Start with great soil \u2013 Your growing medium will be your plants\u2019 home for as long as it is producing for you. Natural Living Ideas suggests adding plenty of compost to garden soil as an amendment. Healthy plants grow stronger and produce a bigger harvest.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Extend the seasons \u2013 Mother Earth News says to \u201cstart early, end late.\u201d Pushing your harvest time window earlier in the spring and later into the fall or winter means using cloches to protect plants from frost or cloth row covers for larger areas.\u000a\u000a3. Plant perennial crops \u2013 Many gardeners overlook perennials, but they can bring big harvests that just return and get bigger every year, advises Mother Earth News. Fruits like blackberries, blueberries, and rhubarb produce every year, and an asparagus patch, when properly maintained, will produce for decades.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Succession planting \u2013 According to Earth911, this method of staggering the timing of your plantings will produce more food over a longer period of time. For example, you might plant an initial crop of lettuce from seed in early April and then plant again three weeks later. Then, you\u2019ll have your new lettuce maturing just as the first crop is finishing up. When one crop is finished, remove it and plant something new in its place.\u000a\u000a5. Harvest early and often \u2013 Natural Living Ideas says that most gardeners get lazy about harvesting crops later in the season. They recommend harvesting vegetables as soon as they are ready; don\u2019t wait. They also say regular harvesting keeps the plant producing better than if you leave vegetables on plants for too long.\u000a\u000a6. Cut-and-come-again crops \u2013 These are crops that produce more than one harvest, says Mother Earth News. For example, Swiss chard can be harvested just a few leaves at a time while leaving the plant in the ground. It will continue to produce over a long period of time. Broccoli will often produce side shoots and smaller heads once the main head is harvested.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVTen civilians, including three children, were killed in a raid by foreign and Somali forces on a farm in southern Somalia, a deputy governor said Friday as officials displayed victims' bloodied bodies in the capital. The U.S. military confirmed it supported a Somali operation in the area.\u000a\u000aThe farmers were killed "one by one" after soldiers stormed the farm in Barire village early Friday, the deputy governor of Lower Shabelle region, Ali Nur Mohamed, told reporters in Mogadishu.\u000a\u000aThree children aged 8 to 10 and a woman were among the dead, the official said, calling the attack a "real genocide." Their blanket-wrapped bodies were laid out in a grassy courtyard for display. Bodies of civilians, especially those killed in misdirected attacks, often are taken from remote areas to Mogadishu to draw media attention.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Africa Command confirmed that U.S. forces were supporting the Somalia National Army while it conducted an operation in the area. It gave no details about the operation. The U.S. military has stepped up efforts this year against the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab, often in support of Somali forces.\u000a\u000a"These local farmers were attacked by foreign troops while looking after their crops," the deputy governor told reporters. "The troops could have arrested them because they were unarmed but instead shot them one by one mercilessly."\u000a\u000aA statement by Somalia's information ministry said the raid on the farm killed eight al-Shabab fighters and that extremists began shooting at Somali forces after they entered. "No civilians were harmed or killed in this operation," the statement said.\u000a\u000aAl-Shabab, which has become the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, continues to hold vast areas of rural Somalia after being chased out of major cities in recent years by a multinational African Union force and Somali forces. The group continues to threaten the fragile central government and carry out deadly attacks in neighboring countries, notably Kenya.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, President Donald Trump approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, including more aggressive airstrikes and considering parts of southern Somalia areas of active hostilities.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and Somalia in recent weeks said strikes have killed al-Shabab leaders responsible for planning and executing deadly attacks in Mogadishu, where high-profile areas such as hotels and military checkpoints are often targeted with deadly bombings.

aVJerry Lewis\u2019s death from heart disease marked the end of his long struggle with cardiac problems, which was probably the legacy of his career in show business, a top expert says.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost entertainers die an early death from heart disease because of their hard-driving lifestyle,\u201d Dr. Chauncey Crandall tells Newsmax Health.\u000a\u000aLewis, a comedic icon and philanthropist, died Sunday in Las Vegas. Although his death was originally attributed to natural causes, the coroner on Monday released a statement listing it as \u201cischemic cardiomyopathy," multiple news reports say.\u000a\u000a\u201cIschemic cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes progressively weak and can no longer pump enough blood to keep up with the demands of the body,\u201d says Crandall, chief of the cardiac transplant program at the world-renowned Palm Beach Cardiovascular Clinic in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.\u000a\u000aLewis was plagued with cardiac problems during most of his life. He suffered his first heart attack in 1960 at the age of 34, and also had at least two more later on.\u000a\u000aThat Lewis had his first heart attack at such a young age does not surprise Crandall, author of the Heart Health Report.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost people in show business die young because they have multiple risk factors for heart disease, including frequent travel, poor sleep, and the stress that comes from being an entertainer,\u201d Crandall says.\u000a\u000aLewis also weathered a number of other ailments throughout his life, including prostate cancer, Type 1 diabetes, and pulmonary fibrosis. He also suffered a major back injury in 1965 that almost paralyzed him, and left him with a lifelong chronic pain problem.\u000a\u000aBut Lewis always fought through his problems, performing and also ultimately raising more than $2 billion dollars for his favorite cause, the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact that he lived to a ripe old age can probably be attributed to his sense of humor, as well as the fact that he felt he was on a mission to do good for others,\u201d adds Crandall.

This tax-advantaged plan provides incentives for long-term savings. But there are some advantages to withdrawing money from an IRA.Here three times to consider withdrawing money from an IRA:IRA distributions specifically for buying your first house avoid the early withdrawal penalty from the IRS. This benefit can also be used to help a child or grandchild buy a home, Charles Schwab adviser Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz said . The maximum withdrawal without penalty is $10,000. Because a house is generally considered an investment, some advisers say taking money from your IRA might be a good idea.There are several circumstances in which the IRS recognizes that you might need the money now rather than later. In these situations, the 10 percent penalty does not apply. It may be an advantage to withdraw money from your IRA to pay for high medical bills or education. These are among the expenses exempt from penalties. Any money that comes out of an IRA, even if it is penalty free, will be considered as income.At age 70  you must start taking a withdrawal from your IRA. If you do not, the IRS will take a penalty tax. A delay on taking your distribution past April 1 of the year after you turn 70  may result in extra income tax, CBS News reported . The exact timing is best figured by a financial professional.

Making a family emergency plan can help your family be prepared for the next disaster, and could even save the life of a family member. Here are some steps to creating a family emergency plan.If you aren\u2019t together when a disaster hits, you will want to have a way to contact each other. Teach your children your cell phone numbers and address, and write the information on a card that all family members can keep with them. This way, the Centers for Disease Control Emergency Preparedness and Response division says , family members can be contacted even if children are too young to memorize phone numbers or if someone is incapacitated for any reason.Having a set location near your home where all family members know to meet up will allow you to be sure everyone is safe and accounted for in case of a fire, flood, or other disaster. You can also have a meeting location outside your neighborhood in case some or all of you are away from home, FEMA recommends If you are at home when a large-scale disaster strikes, you may lose power and running water, without the ability to buy more food and water. Stores may be destroyed or closed indefinitely. Having nonperishable food and water stored in your home may give you peace of mind and the ability to endure until basic services can be secured, says Ready.gov. While it\u2019s a bad idea to keep large amounts of cash in your home, disasters can shut down banks and prevent access to your money for a period of time. Go Banking Rates advises having $1,000 in cash at all times to tide you over until banks reopen.Sure, your 5 year old may be way too young for a cell phone, but a simple phone can be configured to allow kids to text or call you in an emergency without having access to more sophisticated abilities kids aren\u2019t ready for.Having a few drills can ensure that family members know what to do in the heat of the moment, when it would be easy to forget the plan, according to the CDC.

"At Breitbart, I had power."\u000a\u000aBannon was referencing Breitbart News, the right-leaning website he ran before joining Trump's team. He is slated to return to the news outlet soon.\u000a\u000aBannon's role in the White House involved keeping the president on track with hitting his campaign promises. Some of Bannon's ideas, such as a travel ban for people from countries with a terror presence and a push to withdraw the United States from NAFTA, have fallen short.\u000a\u000aThe Economist noted that Trump eventually began to rely on input from other aides, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, which seemed to diminish Bannon's role.\u000a\u000aBannon told the news outlet, however, that Breitbart will continue to support Trump.\u000a\u000a"I am an ideologue, that's why I am out," he said.

aVThursday, the Gulf of Mexico storm dubbed Harvey had officially gained hurricane status -- and forecasters say it could deliver a devastating blow to East Texas by late Friday.\u000a\u000aIn fact, high storm surges and winds up to 115 miles per hour could make Harvey the first Category 3 or higher storm to make landfall in the United States in 12 years, says the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The last such storm was Hurricane Wilma back in 2005.\u000a\u000a"Trying not to be dramatic, but I fear epic flood catastrophe," Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, said in a tweet.\u000a\u000aComputer model predictions from the hurricane center have Harvey making landfall in Texas Friday night, somewhere between Port Mansfield and San Luis Pass, with the major city of Corpus Christi very nearby.\u000a\u000aRainfall could exceed 20 inches, experts say, in a storm that might take four to six days to expend itself. Storm surges could be 6 to 10 feet high in coastal areas.\u000a\u000a"Somebody is going to get a rainstorm to tell their grandkids about," Bill Read, a former director of the National Hurricane Center, told the Washington Post.\u000a\u000aAnd Houston, America's fourth-largest city, may also be in peril.\u000a\u000aHouston could see anywhere from 10 to 20 inches of rain -- especially on Saturday and Sunday -- in an inundation that could prove "devastating" for the city, according to local meteorologist Matt Lanza.\u000a\u000aA sudden onrush of this amount of rain falling northwest of Houston would mean that "all that water has to push through the Bayou networks across the city into Galveston Bay," he explained to the Post.\u000a\u000aWinds clocked at 80 mph were already being recorded by 1 p.m. Thursday.

President Trump did not understand that and it has hurt him," O'Reilly wrote then.\u000a\u000aDenounce Nazis first, then go after far-left extremists, said the former prime-time stalwart and host of "The O'Reilly Factor" on Fox News.\u000a\u000a"Then the day after, say this Antifa movement, they're becoming very, very dangerous to the country and lay out that case but separately," O'Reilly told Newmax TV. "When he didn't do it separately and he brought them both in together, that gave the Trump haters the license to brand him a sympathizer. Disgusting, despicable, it's a lie, but that's what the Trump haters did."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly was then asked about how Trump should handle Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, who came out critically of Trump's reticence to denounce the alt-right in an interview Thursday.\u000a\u000a"I would say, 'I've spoken to Gary, he's a close friend, he's doing a great job and I respect his point of view. And I've learned some lessons in this case and going forward, we're going to do it differently,'" O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aWhether Trump takes that tack isn't as important as recognizing the what the long view is of Democrats and the media.\u000a\u000a"There's only one bottom line on Donald Trump: get him out of office; that's what's happening here," O'Reilly said. "And the media has invested in that, the far left has invested in that, the Democratic Party has invested in that.\u000a\u000a"That's a lot of people trying to get him out of office. So you're not going to get any honesty on this level. So President Trump has got to understand that. He knows his base is still with him but he's got to be very careful going forward and be as magnanimous as possible," O'Reilly said.

Up until the last few years, the majority of Americans did not believe in it either \u2014 nor did Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton \u2014 according to their public statements up until 2012.\u000a\u000aYet, according to the SPLC, we\u2019re "haters." The irony that I\u2019m supposedly a hater is that I am anything but. Daily I strive to pray the Prayer of St. Francis, "Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me replace it with love." And so on.\u000a\u000aFormer Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore lost his office twice, in part because of actions by the SPLC. First, they joined with other liberal groups to sue him for a public display of the Ten Commandments.\u000a\u000aThen in 2012, he won the election as Chief Justice again for Alabama, but the SPLC filed a legal complaint against him for his stance in favor of traditional marriage \u2014 a stance that 81 percent of the voters in Alabama took in 2006 to amend their Constitution accordingly.\u000a\u000aI got to interview Chief Justice Moore recently for our television program, "Profit$ of Hate," about the Southern Poverty Law Center. Moore accused the SPLC essentially of psychological projection.\u000a\u000aMoore, who is now running for the U.S. Senate, said, "The Southern Poverty Law Center has had Ben Carson [the renowned neurosurgeon] on their hate list. They\u2019ve had Tony Perkins and his organization [the above-mentioned Family Research Council] on their hate list. The truth is: they\u2019re the ones that hate. They hate God, and they hate the acknowledgment of God; and [yet] they call other people haters."\u000a\u000aThe SPLC likes to fancy itself as doing the unfinished work of the civil rights movement \u2014 which they have now linked to same-sex marriage and transgender rights, and so on.\u000a\u000aFor our program, I also got to interview Ricardo Davis, an African-American who is the president of Georgia\u2019s Right-to-Life and is also the State Chairman of the Constitution Party of Georgia, which is on the SPLC\u2019s hate list as an alleged anti-government group.\u000a\u000aDavis commends the SPLC for the good work they did in the waning days of the civil rights movement. But he notes that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s movement was undergirded by faith in God and in the Bible. In contrast, what the SPLC is promoting today is often in contradiction to faith in God and in the Bible.\u000a\u000aDavis told our viewers, "If I could say something to [SPLC co-founder] Morris Dees right now, what I would say is, 'Morris, you came alongside my father\u2019s generation to help them get out from under injustice, and it was unjust because it violated God\u2019s Word . . . but now, you\u2019re on the wrong side of history.'"\u000a\u000aCritics note that even many of the actual hate groups on the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Hate Map (such as the Ku Klux Klan) have been on the wane for decades. But Morris Dees and the SPLC manage to make huge profits by scaring people into thinking that behind virtually every bush in America is a hate-monger.\u000a\u000aDavis added, "What did Jesus say? What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world \u2014 if he keeps his mailing list up to date, if he rakes in millions and millions of dollars \u2014 yet loses his soul? And The Southern Poverty Law Center in particular is an organization that has lost the soul and energy behind the civil rights movement. The honorable thing to do would be to repent and believe the gospel."\u000a\u000aWe should all work to end true hate in America. But defining the politics of someone you merely disagree with as "hate" just muddies the waters and further divides us as a nation.\u000a\u000aJerry Newcombe is co-host/senior TV producer of Kennedy Classics.

aVAn estate planning technique that has garnered a lot of attention is the use of an intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT). A grantor trust is a trust in which the grantor, or in some cases, a beneficiary, is treated as the owner for income tax purposes; that is, all income tax consequences will fall upon the grantor of the trust. Since the estate and gift tax rules are inconsistent with the income tax rules, it is possible to create a trust that is irrevocable and a completed gift for gift and estate tax purposes without removing the income tax benefits and burdens from the grantor. Thus, the shift of wealth to the next generation(s) is complete when the trust is funded, but the income tax on the trust income remains the grantor's responsibility. Because of this tax structure, transactions, such as a sale of property, between the grantor and the IDGT are ignored for income tax purposes and income-tax consequences, such as capital gains, can be avoided. Another often favorable result is that the grantor receives the benefit of all tax deductions and credits attributable to the trust.\u000a\u000aWhat Makes The Trust "Defective" For Income-Tax Purposes?\u000a\u000aA trust is defective for income tax purposes for either the grantor or a beneficiary of the trust as a result of falling into the grantor trust provisions of Internal Revenue Code Secs. 673-679. In most of the estate planning uses of the IDGT technique, the grantor will become the owner of the trust for income tax purposes. Some examples of trust terms that would make an irrevocable trust defective for income tax purposes include the power held by the grantor to (1) borrow from the trust without adequate interest or security, (2) borrow trust funds without the obligation to repay principal in the same tax year, or (3) replace trust property with property of equal value while holding such powers in a nonfiduciary capacity. Other powers that would create a defective trust include the ability of the grantor to control beneficial enjoyment, enjoy the income of the trust, or if trust income could be used on premiums for life insurance covering the life of the grantor or the grantor's spouse. This discussion was intended only as a brief overview of the rules for grantor trusts. There are some pertinent details that have not been discussed. The terms of the IDGT must be designed by a qualified professional and tailored to meet the goals that are intended to be accomplished in the specific situation.\u000a\u000aMaking the IDGT Effective For Gift and Estate Taxes\u000a\u000aThe IDGT technique is generally intended to be a completed gift (and removed from the grantor's gross estate) for estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer tax purposes. For this reason, the IDGT must be irrevocable and the grantor should not have powers to change the initial terms, control beneficial enjoyment, or have income used for (or payable to) the grantor or his or her spouse. Thus, the IDGT is funded with the intent to make a completed "no strings attached" gift. Again, this is intended only as an abbreviated summary of the estate and gift tax rules.\u000a\u000aThe Sale of Property to IDGTs as a Wealth Transfer Technique\u000a\u000aEstate and Gift Tax Consequences. A sale of the grantor's property to an IDGT is designed to transfer appreciating property to a trust for the benefit of the next generation. If the transfer is designed as a sale for full and adequate consideration, there should be no gift or estate tax consequences as a result of this transfer.\u000a\u000aLet's look at the steps in planning the sale to an IDGT. First, the grantor creates an irrevocable trust and transfers property as a completed gift. It is generally recommended that an initial gift be made to create the trust to provide legitimate independent planning goals for the IDGT. The initial contribution should be substantial. Otherwise, it is possible that the IRS would attack the sale transaction as having no substance since the trust had no other funding or purpose. The size of the gift will generally be equal to the grantor's available gift-tax or generation-skipping tax (GST) exemption of $5.49 million. If the grantor is married and also has the spouse's gift-tax and GST exemptions available, the size of the initial contribution could be double these amounts. Any gifts in excess of $5.49 million ($10.98 million if the grantor's spouse splits the gift) would result in current gift taxes since the gift-tax exclusion amount is $5.49 million for each individual on lifetime cumulative taxable gifts.\u000a\u000aIn the design of the terms of the IDGT, the grantor will retain no powers that cause estate or gift tax problems after the trust is funded. However, the grantor will retain a power that will make the trust defective for income tax purposes. For example, the grantor might retain the power to-borrow from the trust without adequate security or interest or have no obligation to repay the loan within the tax year. Of, course, any proceeds or installment note received by the grantor in the sale transaction will be includible in the grantor\u2019s estate if he or she continues to hold such assets at the time of death.\u000a\u000aIn the second step, the grantor then sells an asset expected to appreciate to the IDGT's trustee in exchange for an installment note. For example, the grantor might create a family limited partnership (FLP) with appreciating assets and sell the FLP interest at an appropriate discount to the trust. By using the discounting potential of an FLP, the grantor has the ability to shift larger amounts of family wealth to the IDGT for the specified sale price. The installment note will be \u201cinterest only\u201d, and a balloon payment will be provided for the principal at the termination of the trust. Another advantage is that the interest rate required will generally be lower than the valuation interest rate provided by Sec. 7520 for grantor-retained annuity trusts (GRATs) or similar transactions. If the appreciation on the property exceeds the interest rate paid back to the seller, the appreciation escapes estate or gift taxes.\u000a\u000aThe current economic situation makes this transaction particularly favorable due to lower interest rates and depressed asset values. For example, the applicable federal interest rate for a mid-term installment note this month is only 1.95 percent. The underlying asset sold to the IDGT must appreciate in excess of this rate for the technique to yield the greatest wealth transfer benefits. This excess appreciation would seem to be much more likely with assets that have currently reduced values due to the economic conditions.\u000a\u000aOne important income-tax feature of the IDGT is that transactions between the IDGT and the grantor are not recognized for income tax purposes. Thus, the grantor will not have capital gains tax consequences when his or her appreciated property is sold to the IDGT. In a private ruling, the IRS held that the sale of property between two grantor trusts for a promissory note is ignored for income-tax purposes. (Ltr. 200434012)\u000a\u000aAn additional wealth-shifting advantage is the requirement that the grantor be responsible for the trust's income tax liability. Due to the nature of the gift, estate and income tax structure of the IDGT, the grantor is able to pay the income taxes out of other assets and not cause the IDGT to be diminished each year by income taxes. This creates a greater wealth shift to the IDGT's beneficiaries without gift or estate tax consequences. In fact the IRS approved the payment of income taxes by the grantor in a published Revenue Ruling. (2004-64, 2004-27 IRB 7)\u000a\u000aLife Insurance Could Enhance the Wealth Transfer. The IDGT's assets could be supplemented by the purchase of life insurance on the grantor's life. The trustee could use the cash flow from the property sold to the trust along with the initial gift proceeds to provide for premium payments. Since the sale of property to the trust avoids gift taxes, there should be no further gift tax consequences for the purchase of the life insurance by the IDGT's trustee. This solves some of the gift-tax problems created by a traditional life insurance trust since the size of the annual premium does not have to be limited to the grantor's available annual gift-tax exclusions (currently limited to $14,000 per beneficiary).\u000a\u000aUsing an IDGT to Escape an Existing Irrevocable Trust\u000a\u000aAn obvious concern of any grantor is the inability to amend an irrevocable trust. To achieve the goals of removing death benefits from a life insurance policy from an insured's gross estate, an irrevocable trust is often used as a policy owner and benefit distribution vehicle. A number of private rulings have addressed the use of a newly created IDGT as a method to transfer life insurance from an irrevocable trust that no longer meets the grantor's goals. For example, the grantor may have created an irrevocable trust that provides benefits to one or more individuals that the grantor no longer wishes to benefit from the death proceeds. Or, perhaps, the grantor may desire to change the manner in which the beneficiaries benefit. In the private rulings, the taxpayers have funded a new life insurance trust with the desired terms and used the new trust to purchase the policy from the existing trust for the policy's fair market value as provided by the tax regulations. If both trusts are grantor trusts, no adverse income tax consequences occur. Of course, the funding of the new trust has gift tax consequences that must be addressed through the use of the grantor's annual exclusions and, if necessary, his or her $5.49 million applicable gift tax exclusion amount. In addition, the terms of the original trust will continue to provide for the distribution of the purchase price received for the life insurance policy.\u000a\u000aRichard S.

aVA future trivia question and historical footnote, the spectacular 10-day flameout of Anthony Scaramucci qualifies as the most entertaining episode yet of the ongoing reality show that is the Trump presidency. (Working title: "The Pompadours of 1600 Pennsylvania.") But even as the cocksure sycophant's gobsmacking spectacle stole the show, something of real importance took place a bit lower on the radar.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt five separate junctures, the sinews of our democracy held against the careening recklessness of this presidency. Consequently, Donald Trump's worst week proved a particularly fine hour for American democracy:\u000a\u000a1) The military says no to Trump on the transgender ban.\u000a\u000aWell, not directly \u2014 that's insubordination \u2014 but with rather elegant circumspection. The president tweeted out a total ban on transgender people serving in the military. It came practically out of nowhere. The military brass, not consulted, was not amused. Defense Secretary James Mattis, in the middle of a six-month review of the issue, was reportedly appalled.\u000a\u000aWhat was done? Nothing. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs simply declared that a tweet is not an order. Until he receives a formal command and develops new guidelines, the tweet will be ignored.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the military told the commander in chief to go jump in a lake. Generally speaking, this is not a healthy state of affairs in a nation of civilian control. It does carry a whiff of insubordination. But under a president so uniquely impulsive and chronically irrational, a certain vigilance, even prickliness, on the part of the military is to be welcomed.\u000a\u000aThe brass framed their inaction as a matter of procedure. But the refusal carried with it a reminder of institutional prerogatives. In this case, the military offered resistance to mere whimsy. Next time, it could be resistance to unlawfulness.\u000a\u000a2) The Senate saves Sessions.\u000a\u000aTrump's relentless public humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was clearly intended to get him to resign. He didn't, in part because of increasing support from Congress. Sessions' former colleagues came out strongly in his defense and some openly criticized the president's shabby treatment of his first and most fervent senatorial supporter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIndeed, Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned Trump not to fire Sessions because he wouldn't get another attorney general \u2014 the committee's entire 2017 schedule was set and there would be no hearings to approve a new AG. That was a finger to the eye of the president. Every once in a while, the Senate seems to remember that it is a coequal branch.\u000a\u000a3) Senate Republicans reject the Obamacare repeal.\u000a\u000aThe causes here are multiple, most having nothing to do with Trump. Republicans are deeply divided on the proper role of government in health care. This division is compounded by the sea change in public opinion as, over seven years, Obamacare has become part of the fabric of American medicine, and health care has come to be seen as a right rather than a commodity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the stunning Senate rejection of repeal was also a pointed rejection of Trump's health care hectoring. And a show of senatorial disdain for Trump craving a personal legislative "win" on an issue about whose policy choices he knew nothing and cared less.\u000a\u000a4) The Boy Scouts protest.\u000a\u000aIn a rebuke not as earthshaking but still telling, the chief executive of the Boy Scouts found it necessary to apologize for the president's speech last week to their quadrennial jamboree. It was a wildly inappropriate confection, at once whining, self-referential, partisan and political.\u000a\u000aHow do you blow a speech to Boy Scouts? No merit badge for the big guy.\u000a\u000a5) The police chiefs chide.\u000a\u000aIn an address to law enforcement officials, Trump gave a wink and a nod to cops roughing up suspects. Several police chiefs subsequently reprimanded Trump for encouraging police brutality \u2014 a mild form, perhaps, but brutality still.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was all a joke. Nonsense. It was an ugly sentiment, expressed coyly enough to be waved away as humor but with the thuggish undertone of a man who, heckled at a campaign rally, once said approvingly that in the old days "guys like that" would "be carried out on a stretcher."\u000a\u000aWhatever your substantive position on the various issues involved above, we should all be grateful that from the generals to the Scouts, from the senators to the cops, the institutions of both political and civil society are holding up well.\u000a\u000aTrump is a systemic stress test. The results are good, thus far.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCharles Krauthammer is a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist, published weekly in more than 400 newspapers worldwide.

"To see them proud, they were so emboldened with their hatred. They wanted you to hear them. They wanted you to see them, to be intimidated. That was the scary part."\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's fault is this comes because he "destroyed all the taboos," Foxman added.\u000a\u000a"I think they feel emboldened by the last election because some of the themes they have for differences is anti-immigrant, xenophobic, this is part of the social discourse in the country,"Foxman said.\u000a\u000a"In the last campaign when the president ran for office, he destroyed all the taboos. You want to be a bigot, our constitution allows you to be a bigot in your head, heart, home, but when you act it out, that's a consequence to pay.\u000a\u000a"This breaks every taboo. There's no consequences. So the people in Charlottesville, the bigots, feel they are emboldened. It's okay now to publicly demonstrate."\u000a\u000aFoxman does not believe President Trump to be supportive of hate groups, and those standing out against them now are a positive, but Trump does need to admit his mistakes \u2013 "something I'm not sure he's capable of doing," Foxman said.\u000a\u000a"I don't believe he's a racist, no," Foxman said. "It's all about Trump. The crescendo is growing, people are standing up, and one by one, that's the beauty."\u000a\u000aFoxman concluded with a call for President Trump to delegitimize the resurfaced hatred all over again.\u000a\u000a"He needs to say I made a mistake, something I'm not sure he's capable of doing," Foxman said. "He needs to apologize, not from prompters, but from his gut.\u000a\u000a"He needs to fix it because he's part of the reason we're in this mess now of giving and emboldening Nazis and bigots to say, 'this is our message, it's out there, it's legitimate.'

aVA novel called "Handbook for Mortals" had a very brief reign at the top of a New York Times best-seller list.\u000a\u000aThe paper confirmed Friday that it had pulled Lani Sarem's book from its young adult hardcover list for Sept. 3 because of "inconsistencies" in the reporting of sales. The announcement came after online complaints that "Handbook for Mortals" had benefited from so-called "bulk sales," when hundreds or thousands of copies are ordered by a single buyer. On Twitter, young adult author Phil Stamper and others had questioned how a book they knew little about could reach No. 1 on the Times list.\u000a\u000a"After investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for 'Handbook for Mortals' did not meet our criteria for inclusion," the Times said in a statement issued through communications director Jordan Cohen. "We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017, which does not include that title."\u000a\u000aPublished Aug. 15, "Handbook for Mortals" is billed as the first of a fantasy series about a young woman with supernatural powers. It's also billed as the first release through the publishing arm of a Los Angeles-based web site, geeknation.com, which calls itself "an online entertainment destination serving up a fresh, daily dose of news, opinion, lifestyle and community." Requests for comment from Sarem and from her publisher were not immediately returned Friday.\u000a\u000aPlacement on a Times best-seller list is highly valued by authors and publishers, and efforts to manipulate sales through "bulk" purchases have occurred over the years. An "About the Bestsellers" note on the paper's web site reads that "Institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases, if and when they are included, are at the discretion of The New York Times Best-Seller List Desk editors."

aVGrowing your own food provides many benefits including saving money, enjoying chemical-free foods, the enjoyment of working with nature, high food quality, and more. If you\u2019ve always dreamt of keeping a vegetable garden but your home doesn\u2019t sit on acres of sunny land, don\u2019t fret. You can grow your own healthy food in small spaces with these tips.\u000a\u000aAlert: Heart Surgeon's Secret to Healthy Blood Pressure\u000a\u000a1. Break convention \u2013 If you have nothing more than a sunny front stoop in the city, take after Gayla Trail of You Grow Girl, and plant containers you might otherwise use for annual flowers with edibles instead. Besides the obvious choice of growing herbs and greens, Gayla recommends dwarf varieties of cherry tomatoes and hot peppers.\u000a\u000a2. Square foot gardening \u2013 This ingenious method of planting was developed by gardener and author Mel Bartholomew and involves planting with minimal spacing between plants in raised beds. According to Olivia\u2019s Solutions, a square foot garden requires 80% less space than a traditional row-planted garden.\u000a\u000a3. Go vertical \u2013 Just as building a skyscraper in a crowded city maximizes space, so too does planting vertically. By growing crops that can be trellised or trained to go up a structure such as cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, and peas, you can maximize food from each precious inch of your garden, says Mother Earth News.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a4. Plant small varieties \u2013 If you don\u2019t have abundant space, you may have to forgo your dreams of planting pumpkins or winter squash. However, in the world of plants, there are seemingly endless different varieties, many of which require only a small sunny space. For instance, Mother Earth News says \u2018Ophelia\u2019 eggplant needs only a container to grow, \u2018Bush delicata\u2019 squash is a compact summer squash that won\u2019t take over the garden, and \u2018Totem\u2019 tomato plants top out at just 2 feet.\u000a\u000a5. Try edible landscaping \u2013 According to Rosalind Creasy, this means integrating edibles in to your otherwise ornamental landscape. That could mean planting colorful Swiss chard among the colorful annuals that flank your front walkway or tucking pollinator-friendly dill or mint into a perennial border.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Secret Water Cure to Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVAlec Baldwin returned to "SNL" Thursday to portray President Donald Trump in an effort to get a few laughs over his controversial Charlottesville comments, his Phoenix, Arizona, rally, and firing of chief strategist Steve Bannon.\u000a\u000aBaldwin, who received an Emmy nomination for his comical take on the president on "Saturday Night Live," returned in the "SNL" spinoff "Weekend Update: Summer Edition" in character to go over the week's events, NBC News noted.\u000a\u000aIn front of the mock Arizona rally, Baldwin had fun with Trump's evolving comments on the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, NBC News wrote. The president was criticized by Democrats and Republicans for saying that white nationalists and counter-protesters were both to blame for the violence.\u000a\u000a"There was a tragic victim that came out of Charlottesville: Me!" Baldwin's Trump told the cheering mock crowd.\u000a\u000a"I wanted to set the record straight about exactly what I said and I have the transcript right here," he said, pulling out a piece of paper but began repeating the remarks he made during the 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape that nearly derailed his presidential campaign last year, NBC News noted.\u000a\u000aThe show took one more stab at Bannon, who was portrayed during "Saturday Night Live" last season as the Grim Reaper, NBC News noted.\u000a\u000a"You've only made me more powerful," the Grim Reaper Bannon told Baldwin's Trump.\u000a\u000aBaldwin then added: "Steve is going on to Breitbart.

aVOne of the fastest growing racial groups in the United States, Latinos will make up about a quarter of the population by 2050, according to the Pew Research Center.\u000a\u000aAfter Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in the 2012 presidential election, the Republican National Committee commissioned the Growth and Opportunity Project to ascertain what had gone wrong. Among its findings, it said that it was \u201cimperative that the RNC changes how it engages with Hispanic communities to welcome in new members of our party.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans have struggled to win a large minority of Latino voters. In 40 years, George W. Bush fared the best, winning 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004. Donald Trump won only 28 percent of Latinos in 2016, just one point better than Romney.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000aWith that in mind, it's obvious that the GOP still has work to do in winning over Latino Americans, especially with the group's sizable presence in several swing states, specifically Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.\u000a\u000aHowever, Republicans have a strong corps of Latino leaders in their ranks. Here, Newsmax has chosen the 50 most influential Latino Republicans based on two criteria: the importance of their positions and the prominence of their platforms.\u000a\u000aTed Cruz \u2014 A Cuban-American, Cruz is the firebrand junior senator from Texas, which has the second largest Latino population of any state. He served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department and made his own run for the Oval Office in 2016. While Cruz\u2019s presidential bid was cut short, he was Donald Trump\u2019s fiercest competition in the Republican primary.\u000a\u000aMarco Rubio \u2014 Florida, where Rubio is the junior senator, has the third largest Latino population of any state. The West Miami native\u2019s fast political ascent began as a city commissioner in 1998 and crested in 2011 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016 but was re-elected to his second term as senator. This son of Cuban immigrants is still one of the youngest senators with plenty of politics ahead of him.\u000a\u000aIleana Ros-Lehtinen \u2014 Born in Cuba, Ros-Lehtinen is the first Latina ever to be elected to Congress.

aVSix House lawmakers, including two Republicans from the Miami area, are urging President Donald Trump to keep in place a law that allows people who arrived to the United States illegally as minors to stay in the country.\u000a\u000aThe Tampa Bay Times published a copy of a letter signed by Republican Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo that asked the president not to end the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program. A report earlier Friday claimed Trump was considering ending the 2012 law.\u000a\u000a"Children brought to the United States at a young age did not have a choice in the matter," the letter reads. "They did not willingly seek to violate American statutes when they traveled with their families across our borders, as the alternative was often life without primary caregivers.\u000a\u000a"Such cases require careful and thoughtful analysis about what is in the best interests of our country. For many, the United States is the only country they know or remember."\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration has tried to crack down on the nation's illegal immigration problem in recent months. Several raids have been conducted, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) insisted were simply part of the agency's job regardless of who occupies the Oval Office.

aVThe slow pace of President Donald Trump to fill political appointments is likely a "sign of neglect," The Washington Post explained Friday in an opinion piece.\u000a\u000aThe Senate has confirmed less than half of the president's nominees to fill vacancies throughout the administration, the article explained. Trump has nominated 277 people for the more than 1,100 requiring Senate confirmation. To date, the Senate has confirmed 124. These numbers represent the slowest pace in 40 years, according to the Post.\u000a\u000a"We doubt Mr. Trump wants to gut his own administration. More likely the slow pace is a sign of neglect. He should put renewed effort into turning the lights on in management offices all over town, simply out of interest in advancing his own agenda," the article read.\u000a\u000aTrump's cabinet has numerous vacancies, with fewer than ten percent of "key political appointees in place" at the Labor, Agriculture and Energy Departments. Eight other agencies have less than 25 percent.\u000a\u000aOne exception is the Department of Health and Human Services, which has "82 percent of its political appointees nominated and 42 percent filled."The Post noted a sense of urgency in filling the positions, which it explained had the responsibility to "hammer out policy and then execute it." The article maintained the pace of the Senate to approve nominees was "now on a par with those for previous presidents," citing the nonpartisan White House Transition Project.\u000a\u000a"Surely in this nation of 323 million people there are good candidates for top government positions. They need to be found, nominated and confirmed," the Post concluded.

aVIn a perfect world, the largest expenses in retirement would be for fun things like travel and entertainment. In the real world, retiree healthcare costs can take an unconscionably big bite out of savings.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $275,000 to cover health-care costs throughout retirement, Fidelity Investments said in its annual cost estimate, out this morning. That stunning number is about 6 percent higher than it was last year. Costs would be about half that amount for a single person, though women would pay a bit more than men since they live longer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aYou might think that number looks high. At 65, you\u2019re eligible for Medicare, after all. But monthly Medicare premiums for Part B (which covers doctor\u2019s visits, surgeries, and more) and Part D (drug coverage) make up 35 percent of Fidelity\u2019s estimate. The other 65 percent is the cost-sharing, in and out of Medicare, in co-payments and deductibles, as well as out-of-pocket payments for prescription drugs.\u000a\u000aAnd that doesn\u2019t include dental care \u2014 or nursing-home and long-term care costs.\u000a\u000aRetirees can buy supplemental, or Medigap, insurance to cover some of the things Medicare doesn\u2019t, but those premiums would lead back to the same basic estimate, said Adam Stavisky, senior vice president for Fidelity Benefits Consulting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe 6 percent jump in Fidelity\u2019s estimate mirrors the average annual 5.5 percent inflation rate for medical care that HealthView Services, which makes healthcare cost projection software, estimates for the next decade. A recent report from the company drilled into which healthcare costs will grow the fastest.\u000a\u000aIt estimates a long-term inflation rate of 7.2 percent for Medigap premiums and 8 percent for Medicare Part D. For out-of-pocket costs, the company estimates inflation rates of 3.7 percent for prescription drugs, 5 percent in dental, hearing, and vision services, 3 percent for hospitals, and 3.4 percent for doctor\u2019s visits and tests.\u000a\u000aCost-of-living-adjustments on Social Security payments, meanwhile, are expected to grow by 2.6 percent, according to the HealthView Services report.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s really sobering is the impact of inflation on Fidelity\u2019s retiree health-care cost estimates over the years. From 2002, when Fidelity first did an estimate, to its latest projection, the number is up 70 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s the power of compounding,\u201d Stavisky said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for investing and brutal for healthcare costs.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn its 2017 statement, Fidelity brings up a fairly hot topic in healthcare circles \u2014 health savings accounts, or HSAs \u2014 as a way employers are helping workers manage costs. (Others might describe the plans as shifting more of the rapidly rising costs of healthcare onto employees.) HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts to which employees can contribute a certain amount of pre-tax dollars each year to use for medical costs. Employers usually kick in some money, too. The 2017 contribution limit for singles is $3,400, and $6,750 for a person with a family.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHSAs usually accompany high-deductible health plans, which are becoming far more common. (For a good comparison of healthcare savings account providers, see Morningstar\u2019s 2017 Health Savings Account Landscape.) In return for low premiums, employees have high deductibles to cover before insurance kicks in. In 2017, annual deductibles are at least $1,300 for a single person, with a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $6,550. For a family, the minimum deductible is $2,600, with an out-of-pocket cap of $13,100.\u000a\u000aPart of the logic behind HSAs is that employees will be better healthcare consumers under such plans. And they might, if being an informed, effective consumer weren\u2019t extremely difficult and time-consuming in the murky world of American healthcare pricing.\u000a\u000aOn the bright side, financial planners love that HSAs are \u201ctriple tax-advantaged.\u201d Money goes in pre-tax, earnings on that money aren\u2019t taxed, and the money can be used, without being taxed, for qualified medical expenses. If people have the means to pay for healthcare costs out of pocket and leave the HSA money growing tax-free, it can be another tax-advantaged way to save for retirement.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHealthcare costs will likely keep climbing, so one of the best investments anyone can make is to work at staying healthy, if possible. For a sense of how much health care could cost you in retirement, and how staying healthy can lower those costs, try AARP\u2019s health-care costs calculator. It provides a rough cost estimate based on your height, weight, gender, and state. Users can add in various health conditions to see how much they might add to projected health-care costs in retirement, or subtract from them if, for instance, an overweight person slimmed down.\u000a\u000aWhether you're 60 or 25 or somewhere in between, the prospect of retirement should be more inspiring \u2014 cities to visit, languages to learn, books to read, or to write \u2014 than the anxious business of war-gaming what your health will be like 10 or 20 or 30 years out. But if paying closer attention to your body and mind now means more money for travel and growth and relaxation after a long hard working life, it\u2019s not a bad trade-off.\u000a\u000aAnd it's not available to everyone. In the real world, high costs and steep deductibles discourage many people from using the health care they've bought, starting a cascade of ills. Staying healthy can be expensive.

Later, however, a White House official said, "Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House."\u000a\u000aGorka, who has been linked to far-right groups in Hungary, blasted the Trump administration's new Afghanistan policy in the letter reported by the Federalist.

"As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People's House."\u000a\u000aGorka was a close ally of Steve Bannon, Trump's strategist who was forced to resign last week.\u000a\u000a"Regrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will 'Make America Great Again,' have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months," Gorka wrote. "This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week."\u000a\u000aGorka also objected that the Afghanistan policy -- which marks an escalation of the 16-year-old conflict -- lacked strategic focus.

After eight years of Obama, who tilted U.S. policy toward Iran and gave Israel a cold shoulder, many are breathing a sigh of relief.\u000a\u000aA recent Jerusalem Post poll found that 61 percent of Israel's Jews believe Trump is "pro-Israel" and a Pew survey of all nations found Israel to be the second strongest supporter of Trump, with 56 percent saying they had full confidence in him. (The first was the Philippines with 69 percent expressing support.)\u000a\u000aSenior Israeli officials I spoke with say President Trump has been the most supportive of any U.S. president in recent memory, including George W. Bush, who also was quite popular.\u000a\u000aIsraelis are on the front line of freedom. They are surrounded by hostile states. In their mind, appeasement is dangerous and there is little margin for error when their security is at stake.\u000a\u000aOne high-ranking Israeli official told me that the equation for Israel has changed because of three key Trump officials: Jared Kushner, the president's special adviser, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.\u000a\u000aKushner, to whom the president has given the task of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict, understands that Israel is the cornerstone of regional stability.\u000a\u000aPrevious administrations typically began their peace process by blaming Israel. Kushner took a different approach by affirming Israel as a U.S. ally.\u000a\u000aBoth Mattis and McMaster, the official said, grasp the strategic role Israel has played for U.S. security in the region and they have been stalwart in their support.\u000a\u000aToday, under Trump, ISIS is being crushed.\u000a\u000aQatar, a Gulf state that has "played both sides" but consistently helps fund the bad guys, including the Muslim Brotherhood, is being contained.\u000a\u000aTrump is also taking Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism as a great threat to the region. Trump has been praised for being willing to tackle the Iranian problem as he is tackling North Korea.\u000a\u000aTrump's outreach to Putin could be crucial in dealing with Iran and North Korea, one official said.\u000a\u000aI first came to Israel at the age of 19 as a college student.\u000a\u000aIsrael was then just over three decades old, a scrawny teenager on the world stage. Now Israel is a muscular adult, not only the military power of the region, but a global hub for technology and culture.\u000a\u000aLife in Israel was challenging for its citizens back in those student days of mine. Today Israelis enjoy a first world standard of living.\u000a\u000aThrough the years the people haven't changed.

Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aResearch has shown that certain exercises may help to ease depression. The reason is chemical. Exercise boosts endorphins, which offer powerful boosts to your sense of well-being, according to Everyday Health "Your favorite fitness routine can be an excellent addition to your depression treatment plan," Everyday Health noted.Among the top exercises for helping with depression is yoga. One study found that women who took a yoga class twice weekly showed a significant drop in symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to Everyday Health.\u201cEastern traditions such as yoga have a wonderful antidepressant effect in that they improve flexibility; involve mindfulness, which breaks up repetitive negative thoughts; increase strength; make you aware of your breathing; improve balance; and contain a meditative component,\u201d noted Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine.Weight-lifting is also good for those suffering with depression, according to BodyBuilding.com . It is especially helpful for women.The website cited research at Harvard University that determined that 10 weeks of weight training cut clinical symptoms of depression better than counseling.\u201cStrength training is about mastery and control,\u201d clinical psychologist Leslie Seppinni told Everyday Health. \u201cIt requires full attention and concentration. More importantly, people can see the results, the outline of the muscles forming, from dedication and training.\u201dRunning not only is a good aerobic exercise, but it also offers mental health benefits. Starting with a walk and continuing that daily, building up to a run, could help cut back feelings of depression, WebMD reported \u201cThe days you feel least like exercising are the most important days to get out and do it,\u201d author Keith Johnsgard, a psychology professor at San Jose State University, told WebMD. \u201cThose are the days when you will feel best after doing it.\u201d\u201cTo date, the strongest evidence seems to support aerobic exercise,\u201dDr. David Muzina told Everyday Health, which noted that studies found no correlation between exercise intensity and its benefit.\u201cThe most tangible example of exercise stimulating certain brain chemicals is the runner\u2019s high that many athletes report experiencing once crossing a certain threshold of exertion while running,\u201d explained Muzina said.

aVEarlier this week, CNN news anchor Don Lemon stated that the president \u201cis clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.\u201d In response to Lemon\u2019s words, historian and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an interview on "Tucker Carlson Tonight": \u201cI think we should take the threat of civil war very seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aReferencing Dennis Prager\u2019s piece, \u201cAmerica's Second Civil War,\u201d Gingrich added, \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing with Antifa, what you\u2019re seeing on college campuses, what you\u2019re seeing, to some extent, in the bureaucracy, is a real division of the country. \u2026I wish we could all sing Kumbaya and come together but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. \u2026As a historian, my view is pretty straightforward: one side or the other wins.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmerica is already so rife with extremists on both sides of the political aisle that many people see war not only as imminent, but as virtually inevitable. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d better get busy digging ourselves bunkers\u2026 and graves.\u000a\u000aAnd not just in the U.S. A civil war in America will not end in America. If the country plunges into battle, many will be vying for the loot. China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and others will destroy whatever the war doesn\u2019t, the American empire will become history, and a third world war, with multiple nuclear powers, will follow. There will be no winners because, to quote Machiavelli, \u201cWars begin when you will, but they do not end when you please.\u201d\u000a\u000aIs there really no alternative?\u000a\u000aI think there is, or I wouldn\u2019t be writing here. In my previous column, I noted that President Trump needs to take a more appeasing tone in order to start building national cohesion. It\u2019s great to state, \u201cNo matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are ALL AMERICANS FIRST,\u201d but doing so right after the Charlottesville murderous car ramming is the epitome of poor timing. Such statements should be part of the president\u2019s routine, not rare occasions.\u000a\u000aTrump excels in using social media. If he uses it to broadcast a constant stream of unifying messages, notwithstanding the cynicism of the press, he will win over the American people\u2019s hearts regardless of their political affiliation.\u000a\u000aI wholly agree that America requires massive infrastructure projects. But the real infrastructure of the country is its people, not its asphalt roads or railroads. The administration needs to implement ASAP solidarity programs that will create a uniform American identity. People need to learn that an ideology that undermines freedom of speech, freedom of religious practice, and freedom of the press, cannot use the First Amendment to legitimize itself.\u000a\u000aEven more importantly, people need to learn that plurality of views is not a recipe for war; it is precisely what has made America great in the first place. When people of different approaches and views strive for the same goal, they are far more likely to achieve it. If the goal is the well-being of all Americans, the entire country will benefit from it, and this goal should top the priority list of every American.\u000a\u000aIt might not seem possible to patch up the divided United States, but 1) no one has ever sincerely tried, and 2) the other option is war.\u000a\u000aWith my students, I have developed simple and easily applicable techniques that create a sense of unity and connection even among the most unlikely populations, such as Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, ultra-Orthodox and devout agnostics, and affluent and needy. These techniques work wonders wherever we have tried them: North America, Western and Eastern Europe, and in Israel.\u000a\u000aToday\u2019s world is pushing toward connection. The interconnectedness of reality requires that we learn how to work in a world where everyone is dependent on everyone else. When we think in terms of \u201cone side or the other wins,\u201d we cannot succeed because we are perpetuating a mindset of separation. This will inevitably create unions of extremists that will feed on hatred of the other side, which in turn will lead to war. The only way to avoid this route is to make unity mainstream.\u000a\u000aIf this seems unrealistic, think of your own body. Without the unity of radically different organs all working in unison for the common cause of sustaining you and keeping you healthy, you would not exist. Therefore, unity is not unrealistic; it is the only realistic option for society.\u000a\u000aThe sooner we make American solidarity the prime value of America, the better it is for the entire country. Any decision that Trump\u2019s administration and Congress make from here on should first and foremost promote unity and solidarity because this is truly the only realistic option.\u000a\u000aMichael Laitman is a global thinker living in Israel.

Free Test Shows You When \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here\u000a\u000aThose hoping for a second career in retirement must do their homework in determining if such work will cause tax disadvantages.For some, working longer can help them to continue investing, growing their retirement accounts for a day in the future when they need to tap them. For others, however, it could create a financial problem."Generally speaking, overstaying your welcome at work could have some serious health care, Social Security and pension ramifications," Bankrate said Some older workers could be propelled into a higher tax bracket by staying longer and earning more salary and benefits, Bankrate said."Working seniors can find themselves in a higher tax bracket in one of two ways \u2014 by taking pension distributions on top of a regular salary or by taking Social Security benefits while they continue working," Kevin Seibert, managing director of the International Foundation for Retirement Education in Lubbock, Texas, told Bankrate. "It's taxable, just like their regular salaries."Older workers might also lose some Social Security benefits as well. In 2015, workers could earn up to $15,720 before. For earning above that limit, $1 of Social Security benefits are withheld for every $2 earned, according to the Social Security Administration "While it's not a permanent loss \u2014 the Social Security Department will repay all withheld benefits in monthly increments after you officially leave the working world \u2014 those relying on a fat check from the government may have to work with a significantly reduced one while they stay on the job," Bankrate said.Working in retirement could affect the amount of Social Security benefits that is taxable, which is determined by combined income, Time magazine explained \u201cTake a retiree in the 15% federal tax bracket who is taxed on 50% of his Social Security. When he earns another $1,000, his so-called combined income rises by that much too, subjecting another $500 of Social Security income to taxes. So the tax bill on that $1,000 won\u2019t be $150 (15% of $1,000) but $225 (15% of $1,500), for an effective rate of 22.5%,\u201d Time said.

aVA novel called "Handbook for Mortals" had a very brief reign at the top of a New York Times best-seller list.\u000a\u000aThe paper confirmed Friday that it had pulled Lani Sarem's book from its young adult hardcover list for Sept. 3 because of "inconsistencies" in the reporting of sales. The announcement came after online complaints that "Handbook for Mortals" had benefited from so-called "bulk sales," when hundreds or thousands of copies are ordered by a single buyer. On Twitter, young adult author Phil Stamper and others had questioned how a book they knew little about could reach No. 1 on the Times list.\u000a\u000a"After investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for 'Handbook for Mortals' did not meet our criteria for inclusion," the Times said in a statement issued through communications director Jordan Cohen. "We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017, which does not include that title."\u000a\u000aPublished Aug. 15, "Handbook for Mortals" is billed as the first of a fantasy series about a young woman with supernatural powers. It's also billed as the first release through the publishing arm of a Los Angeles-based web site, geeknation.com, which calls itself "an online entertainment destination serving up a fresh, daily dose of news, opinion, lifestyle and community." Requests for comment from Sarem and from her publisher were not immediately returned Friday.\u000a\u000aPlacement on a Times best-seller list is highly valued by authors and publishers, and efforts to manipulate sales through "bulk" purchases have occurred over the years. An "About the Bestsellers" note on the paper's web site reads that "Institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases, if and when they are included, are at the discretion of The New York Times Best-Seller List Desk editors."

aVIf you are overweight and have a sexual problem, make sure that your physician takes your complaints seriously and runs the appropriate tests to evaluate possible medical causes of your sexual issues.\u000a\u000aRecent research presented at the 125th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association shows that physicians taking care of overweight people tend to discriminate and have negative stereotypes about them. That that can take a toll on your health.\u000a\u000aAnd that study was not an outlier. A steady stream of research is showing the same phenomenon.\u000a\u000aThe research on physician discrimination against overweight people is disturbing. In one study of more than 300 autopsy reports, overweight people were 1.65 times more likely to have undiagnosed and often serious medical conditions such as endocarditis, ischemic bowel disease, or lung cancer. That is evidence of misdiagnosis or inadequate access to healthcare.\u000a\u000aI can only assume that the same processes will be in play when an overweight person goes to see a physician because of a sexual concern. If you are overweight, knowing this phenomenon, you are going to have to be a very strong advocate for yourself.\u000a\u000aDo some reading about your sexual problem before you go to see the physician. What are the medical issues that might be involved, and what are the tests that might be ordered to evaluate you?\u000a\u000aIn some cases, erectile dysfunction is a sign of another medical condition, like diabetes. Abdominal pain that interferes with sexual pleasure in a woman could be the sign of certain kinds of cancer.\u000a\u000aPerhaps you should see a certified sex therapist before you see a medical professional. The sex therapist who listens to your problems can refer you to a physician who specializes in sexuality. The sex therapist can collaborate with the physician share his or her perspective on your case.\u000a\u000aAnd if any physician\u2019s advice to you is simply to lose weight, screw up your courage and respectfully ask what kinds of tests would the physician recommend to evaluate your sexual problem if you weighed less than you do.\u000a\u000aEven if you are heavy, you can still enjoy sex. Touch still feels good. An intimate connection to another person is life-affirming and good for your immune system.\u000a\u000aYour sexual life is a quality-of-life issue; it\u2019s very important to your overall happiness and relationship success.\u000a\u000aIn the case of physical illness, doctor prejudice can literally be life-threatening. Having a good sex life is not a life and death issue. But sex is very important, and if you are unhappy with your sex life, you deserve to get the appropriate medical help.

aVPeople who get less than seven or eight hours of sleep at night are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. Worse yet, researchers now say this can happen in just one week.\u000a\u000aThere are two types of cholesterol that circulate in the blood: LDL cholesterol, which is the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol that builds up in the heart\u2019s coronary arteries, causing heart disease; and HDL cholesterol, which can help whisk it away, reducing cardiovascular risk.\u000a\u000aResearchers from the University of Helsinki analyzed people sleeping in a laboratory. They looked at the impact of sleep deprivation on genes regulating the transport of cholesterol around the body, and on the actual levels of cholesterol in the blood.\u000a\u000aThey found that the genes regulating the transport of cholesterol around the body are less active in sleep-deprived people than those who get a good night\u2019s rest.\u000a\u000aThey also found that these people had higher levels of LDL cholesterol in their blood and lower levels of HDL cholesterol.\u000a\u000aMost importantly, they discovered that such changes occurred only after one week. The study appeared in Scientific Reports.\u000a\u000aSleep disorders like insomnia are a serious problem in the U.S., but many of us shortchange ourselves on sleep by choice, going out too late or staying up watching late-night television.\u000a\u000aTry turning in an hour early every night \u2014 you\u2019ll see how much better you feel in the morning and you\u2019ll be conquering heart disease as well.

aVSamsonite International SA CEO Ramesh Tainwala likened M&A to a teenager seeking a girlfriend, telling Gadfly on Thursday, "it comes when it comes."\u000a\u000aPatience is a virtue. Tainwala has proven to be a savvy dealmaker, with purchases like Tumi, the high-end luggage maker, and the online category leader eBags.com padding earnings in the first half. Knowing when to pounce is key, too, and the takeover prospects in bags and luggage brands couldn't be better for a buyer like Samsonite.\u000a\u000aConsolidation is afoot among makers of bags, shoes and accessories, as retail sales slow and companies struggle with challenged outlet and department stores.\u000a\u000aIn the last three months, we saw Michael Kors Holdings Inc. buy Jimmy Choo Plc and Coach Inc. acquire Kate Spade & Co. in what's started to feel like musical chairs among luxury labels.\u000a\u000aFashion brands that used to depend on distributors in Asia and Europe are having a harder time covering the costs of these middlemen as smarter consumers, helped by internet transparency, refuse to pay premium prices in key markets like China. Coach, Kate Spade and others are trying to find new ways to charge more, including recasting themselves as higher-end brands.\u000a\u000aThat's a big reason why Samsonite went after Tumi in the first place. The company had tried to move upmarket for years but never had the street cred with people who spend serious money on luggage like Tumi. That brand also came with access to 2,000 distribution points in 75 countries.\u000a\u000aTumi had an outsized impact on growth in the last half-year, particularly in Samsonite's direct-to-consumer business, where revenue rose 89 percent from the year before. Excluding Tumi, the increase was 20 percent.\u000a\u000aIt's clear Samsonite's strategy relies on growth through acquisition. It's made 10 purchases since 2012, broadening its brands to offer products at every price point. It makes sense to keep the luxury streak going while the timing is hot, with companies like Salvatore Ferragamo SpA, Prada SpA, Canada Goose Holdings Inc., Burberry Group Plc and Furla SpA potentially in play.\u000a\u000aSome of those might be too expensive for the Hong Kong-listed retailer, especially as Samsonite still carries more than $1.8 billion in debt from recent purchases.\u000a\u000aAnother wise option would be along the lines of the most recent acquisition. Samsonite's $105 million cash purchase of web-only eBags.com helped address an area where it lacked mettle: e-commerce.\u000a\u000aTainwala told Bloomberg TV on Thursday he hopes to take the eBags business to $1 billion in annual sales, and to boost Samsonite's online sales to 25 percent of the total, from around 10 percent today. Those goals probably aren't ambitious enough.\u000a\u000aEbags sales goal: $1 billion\u000a\u000aAs more consumers shift their purchases online, Samsonite will need an even bigger web presence. It should consider other online businesses, including startups like Toronto-based Heys International Ltd. and Away of the U.S., which recently raised $20 million in Series B funding for its line of tech-connected suitcases.\u000a\u000aSamsonite is already developing its own version of tech-connected luggage, but as with eBags, the century-old company could probably benefit from exposure to the kind of expertise and culture that comes with these startups.\u000a\u000aSensibly, Samsonite is taking the time to integrate Tumi and eBags, but it shouldn't spend too long on past relationships. Another one could be right around the corner.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aShelly Banjo is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering industrial companies and conglomerates.

aVSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort, NBC News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\u000a\u000aThis is the first indication that Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russia, is beginning to compel witness testimony before the grand jury, NBC said.\u000a\u000aRussia's government has denied interfering in the election and the president has denied collusion took place.\u000a\u000aOne executive whose firm received a subpoena told NBC Mueller's team is looking at the lobbying campaign, which ran from 2012 to 2014. Some of the firms involved in the campaign received subpoenas for documents weeks ago, and Mueller's team is now seeking testimony, NBC quoted him as saying.\u000a\u000aManafort, whose Virginia apartment was raided by FBI agents last month, is a key figure in the Mueller probe. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Mueller's work have said.

aVPresident Donald Trump's former deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka said it was "disappointing" someone in the White House wanted to "spin" his resignation on Friday into suggestions the decision to leave wasn't his, the Washington Examiner reported Friday.\u000a\u000a"How disappointing. I resigned," he said in texts to the newspaper. "It's very disappointing that someone wished to spin this."\u000a\u000aHe also said in his text he told Trump's Chief of Staff John Kelly "today and emailed him today" about his resignation.\u000a\u000aHowever, a White House official said otherwise in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House," the statement read.\u000a\u000aNews of Gorka's departure was revealed Friday by The Federalist, which claimed to have details of his resignation letter where he reiterated his support for the president, but said, "It is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are \u2013 for now \u2013 ascendant within the White House."\u000a\u000aA source familiar with the situation said Gorka, who had been working on national security matters, began to be shut out of security-related meetings after White House chief strategist Steve Bannon left his position earlier this month and returned to head Breitbart News. Gorka at one time worked for Bannon at Breitbart.\u000a\u000aGorka said he's on vacation until Monday.

aVThe U.S. levied additional sanctions on Venezuela on Friday, but one of the nation\u2019s largest bondholders may be breathing a sigh of relief.\u000a\u000aGoldman Sachs Asset Management, which bought $2.8 billion of notes issued by the state oil company in May, has faced sharp criticism for a deal that appeared to supply fresh funds to President Nicolas Maduro. (Read the full story here and here.)\u000a\u000aWhile observers thought the securities would be a prime target for new penalties, they were exempt from the order. In fact, the only bonds covered by the trading ban are notes due in 2036 that appear to never have been sold outside Caracas.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was somewhat surprising,\u201d said Francisco Rodriguez, the chief economist at Torino Capital in New York. \u201cI guess the logic is that those bonds are already in the hands of bondholders, so you wouldn\u2019t be really blocking new financing.\u201d\u000a\u000aInvestor reaction across the board was fairly muted Friday, with both sovereign bonds and notes from Petroleos de Venezuela SA registering slight gains. The new executive order seeks to ban Venezuela from raising cash with new debt offerings, and prohibits transactions in older bonds held by government officials and entities. These sanctions will likely force the oil-rich nation to reduce imports to conserve cash, thus deepening the already severe economic contraction in the country, according to Rodriguez.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is also the concern that the order may push Venezuela over the brink and lead them to default,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cCertainly the more restrictions on financing that you place, the harder you make it for them to pay.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe gains on Friday -- with most notes up less than half a cent -- show investors\u2019 relief after the Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the week that U.S. officials were considering a blanket ban on all trading in Venezuelan debt. Such a move would have left investors stuck holding debt that is considered among the world\u2019s riskiest.\u000a\u000aGoldman Sachs\u2019s investing arm is the largest holder of bonds from Petroleos de Venezuela and the seventh-largest holder of Venezuelan sovereign debt as of June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Andrew Williams, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., declined to comment.

aVThe attorney for former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Friday praised President Donald Trump's pardoning of his client, saying that "we're just very proud to see the president has done the right things."\u000a\u000a"We're very excited," the lawyer, Jack Wilenchik, told John Berman on CNN. "This is the culmination of a lot of hard work and something that's been very tough for the sheriff to deal with."\u000a\u000aWilenchik said that White House Counsel Don McGahn talked with Arpaio, 85, last week and that McGahn told him Friday that Trump had signed the pardon at 6 p.m. Eastern time.\u000a\u000a"Today, I was contacted by White House counsel, and he indicated the president had already signed it at approximately 3 p.m.," Wilenchik said.\u000a\u000a"So, around 6 o'clock Eastern. And I've got a copy of it right here."\u000a\u000aWilenchik, whose firm is based in Phoenix, told Berman that Arpaio still believes that he was innocent.\u000a\u000a"To this day, we contend and he actually was innocent," he said. "If not for this, what we're going to do is ask the court to dismiss the case, ask for an acquittal.\u000a\u000a"Had this not happened, we would have spent years fighting for his innocence."

aVSpotting elusive tumors just got a lot easier, thanks to \u201cnanodots\u201d \u2014 tiny particles that attach themselves to cancer cells and emit intense fluorescent signals when exposed to light.\u000a\u000aThe nanodots (the research identifies them as \u201cquantum dots\u201d) are delivered intravenously, but some leave the bloodstream and cross membranes, entering cancer cells. These illuminated nanodots shine bright and guide doctors to cancerous areas, providing better diagnoses than ever before.\u000a\u000aThe illuminated particles that are left behind in the bloodstream lose their fluorescent ability when scientists inject a special compound \u2014 an \u201cetching\u201d compound \u2014 which remains in the bloodstream away from the illuminated cancer cells and cannot block the fluorescent ability of the nanodots.\u000a\u000aResearchers stress the entire process is done with zero toxic effects on patients.\u000a\u000aThe new technology is the brainchild of researchers at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, who published their results in the journal Nature Communications.\u000a\u000a"Tumor imaging is an integral part of cancer detection, treatment, and tracking the progress of patients after treatment," said Dr. Sugahara, a lead developer of the technology. "Although significant progress has been made in the last two decades, better and more sensitive detection, such as the method we are developing, will contribute to more personalized and potentially more effective interventions to improve the clinical outcomes of cancer patients."\u000a\u000aDr. Gary Braun, another leading developer, credited the etchant process as the basis for the illumination\u2019s success: "The novelty of our nanosystem is how the etchant works. Because the etchant can't cross membranes to reach tumor cells, the quantum dots that have reached the tumor remain fluorescent. Thus, the entire process eliminates background fluorescence while preserving tumor-specific signals.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe researchers employed mice with human breast, prostate, and gastric tumors. The quantum dots effectively sought out the tumors and illuminated the cancer cells.\u000a\u000aSugahara outlined the practicality of the technology and how it could be used in real-world applications: "Moving forward we will focus on developing our novel nanosystem to work with routine imaging tests like PET scans and MRIs."\u000a\u000aA new company is formed to further develop the platform for human use.

aVPresident Ronald Reagan would have had a dramatically different response to the horrific violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville than President Donald Trump did, his son Michael Reagan told Newsmax TV on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"Absolutely it would've differed from President Trump's response," Reagan, a veteran political commentator, told host Miranda Khan on "America Talks Live." ". . . My father would be appalled by the white nationalists.\u000a\u000a"He would've said the same thing today he would've said back then. He would not have fixed blame all over the building. That would've been for another day, another time. He would've said exactly what needed to be said against the white nationalists, against the KKK.\u000a\u000a"And he would've been absolutely appalled that a David Duke would stand up and pretend to speak on his behalf.

aVReforms put in place after the 2007 to 2009 crisis have strengthened the financial system without impeding economic growth and any changes to these rules should remain modest, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Friday in her fullest defense yet of the regulations enacted after the Great Recession.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth,\u201d the Fed chair said at an annual central bank research conference.\u000a\u000aYellen\u2019s remarks amount to a broad defense of the existing regulatory framework, and an implicit rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to drastically lighten the oversight of the financial sector in a bid to boost the economy.\u000a\u000aThey also may amount to her parting view on financial rules, as Trump considers whether to renominate Yellen to another four-year term as head of the central bank, with her current term expiring in February.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is sort of putting a stake in the ground here in terms of this regulation issue, which is the one sort of sticking point between her and Trump right now,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.\u000a\u000aYellen acknowledged some possible changes to individual regulations may be warranted, specifically mentioning possible relaxation of the Volcker rule limit on banks\u2019 equity trading, and further relaxation of rules that apply to medium-sized and smaller banks.\u000a\u000aSteps may be needed, she agreed, to improve liquidity in parts of the bond market, though that system remained \u201crobust.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut she also defended several financial rules that have come under scrutiny by top Trump administration officials and leading Republicans in Congress. Specifically, Yellen defended the annual stress testing of large banks, allowing regulators to assign stricter oversight to firms critical to the financial system, and permitting regulators to step in and wind down failing financial institutions.\u000a\u000aRepublicans have long argued that the raft of new financial rules put in place as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law are hindering lending and the overall economy. An intense partisan divide in Congress will likely hinder any broad legislative rewrite of existing rules, but the Trump administration is slowly replacing regulators who drafted the initial post-crisis rules with new officials much more sympathetic to a lighter regulatory touch.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s nominee as vice chair of the Fed for regulatory issues, Randal Quarles, has been an advocate of such changes. And Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s top economic adviser and a reported favorite to replace Yellen, would also likely pursue more aggressive deregulation.\u000a\u000aOverall, Yellen said, \u201cany adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience\u201d in a financial system she said is now better able to weather future shocks.\u000a\u000aShe did not mention monetary policy in her prepared remarks, disappointing some investors who had hoped she might offer hints on the Fed\u2019s path on interest rates.\u000a\u000aU.S. stocks rose and the dollar fell, while Treasury yields dipped slightly.\u000a\u000aYellen said she and other current Fed members are not averse to revisiting how different regulations are working in practice, \u201cand considering appropriate adjustments.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut she cautioned against putting the events of a decade ago too far in the rear view mirror."Already, for some, memories of this experience may be fading - memories of just how costly the financial crisis was," she told an audience of Fed staff and central bank colleagues from around the world.\u000a\u000aThe stability of the current system guards against a repeat, she said, while outside analysts have noted that it could also free central bankers to leave interest rates lower instead of worrying about the impact of those low rates on financial markets.\u000a\u000a"The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and where improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system," she said.

aVQantas hopes to schedule the world's longest nonstop flight in commercial travel aviation with a 20-hour flight from Sydney to London \u2014 that is if Boeing or Airbus can actually create a plane that can carry passengers continuously for that long.\u000a\u000aQantas, based in Australia, has promised to add the routes within the next five years, USA Today reported. The airline has already announced a 17-hour, 9,010-mile nonstop flight from Perth to London, making it one of the longest continuous flying routes in the world and the first nonstop from Australia to Europe.\u000a\u000aA source told Reuters that Qantas' Sydney-to-London flight will take a northern polar route on most days rather than the usual western crossing over Asia and Europe.\u000a\u000aThe polar route is longer than the 9,200 nautical miles western route but benefits from a strong tailwinds rather than powerful headwinds on a more direct western route, the wire agency reported.\u000a\u000a"The smart way is not to fight the winds. Use them," Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in a note to clients speculating about a 10,000-nautical-mile polar route in June, Reuters noted.\u000a\u000aThe Qantas planes would greatly expand the capabilities of commercial airlines flying nonstop. Emirates currently has the distinction of having the longest nonstop flight by distance, with its daily flight to Auckland, New Zealand, taking 16 hours outbound and 17 hours and 15 minutes on the return flight, according to CNN.\u000a\u000aThe longest current route in relationship to distance is the Air India flight to San Francisco, which travels 9,408 miles, via a Pacific Ocean route rather than the polar route it used to take, according to CNN. The network stated that the new route takes advantage of high-altitude jet stream, giving it a tailwind boost all the way to San Francisco.\u000a\u000aThat means while it takes about 1,000 more miles to fly, the trip actually shaves two hours off the journey at 15 hours.

aVThursday, the Gulf of Mexico storm dubbed Harvey had officially gained hurricane status -- and forecasters say it could deliver a devastating blow to East Texas by late Friday.\u000a\u000aIn fact, high storm surges and winds up to 115 miles per hour could make Harvey the first Category 3 or higher storm to make landfall in the United States in 12 years, says the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The last such storm was Hurricane Wilma back in 2005.\u000a\u000a"Trying not to be dramatic, but I fear epic flood catastrophe," Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society, said in a tweet.\u000a\u000aComputer model predictions from the hurricane center have Harvey making landfall in Texas Friday night, somewhere between Port Mansfield and San Luis Pass, with the major city of Corpus Christi very nearby.\u000a\u000aRainfall could exceed 20 inches, experts say, in a storm that might take four to six days to expend itself. Storm surges could be 6 to 10 feet high in coastal areas.\u000a\u000a"Somebody is going to get a rainstorm to tell their grandkids about," Bill Read, a former director of the National Hurricane Center, told the Washington Post.\u000a\u000aAnd Houston, America's fourth-largest city, may also be in peril.\u000a\u000aHouston could see anywhere from 10 to 20 inches of rain -- especially on Saturday and Sunday -- in an inundation that could prove "devastating" for the city, according to local meteorologist Matt Lanza.\u000a\u000aA sudden onrush of this amount of rain falling northwest of Houston would mean that "all that water has to push through the Bayou networks across the city into Galveston Bay," he explained to the Post.\u000a\u000aWinds clocked at 80 mph were already being recorded by 1 p.m. Thursday. On Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had declared a state of emergency for 30 counties in the southeast portion of the state.\u000a\u000a"Harvey has intensified quickly this morning, and is now forecast to be a major hurricane at landfall, bringing life-threatening storm surge, rainfall, and wind hazards to portions of the Texas coast," the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. discussion.\u000a\u000aGet prepared\u000a\u000aSo what can average Texans do to protect themselves? On its Ready.gov homepage, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security offers up this guidance:\u000a\u000aFind out where to go. Determine now from your local emergency management agency where the hurricane evacuation center(s) in your area are located, and the routes to get there. Information for many communities can be located by searching on the internet under keywords "[your town] alerts."\u000a\u000aKeep your car in good running order, with a full tank of gas. Cars should contain emergency supplies and extra clothes.\u000a\u000aOrganize your "go-bag." This is your disaster supply kit: Things like a flashlight, batteries, cash, first-aid supplies, medications, and copies of your critical information in case evacuation is needed.\u000a\u000aGather home supplies. In case you're not told to evacuate, make sure you stock up at home in the event of many days of power outage -- things like water, food and lighting.\u000a\u000aWhen the storm is only a few hours away, listen to storm reports every 30 minutes via radio, TV or the internet.\u000a\u000aMake a family communications plan. This includes discussing beforehand with family members details on how you plan to receive official emergency alerts and warnings, what your plan is for shelter, evacuation routes and other issues specific to your household. As the hurricane approaches, stay in touch via text or social media -- phone lines are often overloaded. Make sure your phones are fully charged before the storm hits.\u000a\u000aBolster your home against the hurricane's onslaught\u000a\u000aYou can do this by:\u000a\u000aTrimming damaged trees and their branches to minimize the odds they'll break off and damage your home.\u000a\u000aClearing and secure rain gutters.\u000a\u000aStrengthening vulnerable areas such as windows and doors, including garage doors. Cover all windows, ideally with shutters or 5/8-inch grade plywood.\u000a\u000aTrying to obtain a portable generator in case of power outages. Keep these devices at least 20 feet away from windows and doors and protect them from moisture. NEVER try and power the house by plugging a portable generator into a household wall socket.\u000a\u000aBringing in loose objects that could fly around and damage your home or people nearby things -- such as garbage cans, propane tanks, patio furniture.\u000a\u000aAs the storm approaches turn your fridge to the coldest setting. If you lose power, food will last longer.

aVVitamins B6 and B12, among the most popular supplements on the market to boost energy, have been linked to an increased risk for lung cancer in men. A new study by Ohio Stae University found men who take too much of the vitamins face far greater cancer risks, especially if they smoke.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we found was that men who had used dietary supplements, in particular B6 and vitamin B12, at high doses for 10 years, were at significant increased risk of developing lung cancer,\u201d said Dr. Theodore Brasky, who led the study at OSU's Comprehensive Cancer Center.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn fact, all men who used these supplements in high doses for a decade had approximately double the risk developing lung cancer, and in men who smoked, the risk was three to four times as great.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe researchers found no increased risk of lung cancer in women who took high-dose vitamin B6 and B12 supplements long-term, only men.\u000a\u000aThe recommended daily allowance for vitamin B6 for men is only about one and a half milligrams, and for vitamin B12, it\u2019s less than two and a half micrograms per day.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut if you look at these supplement bottles, they\u2019re being sold in pill form at up to 5,000 micrograms per dose, which is much, much higher than the daily recommended amount,\u201d said Brasky. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to get all the vitamin B you need in this country, from eating meats, chickpeas and foods like cereal that are fortified with them, so there really is no reason to supplement your vitamin B intake at these levels, and certainly not for years on end.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study tracked more than 77,000 patients for more than a decade.

aVNeuralink Corp., the startup co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk, has taken steps to sell as much as $100 million in stock to fund the development of technology that connects human brains with computers.\u000a\u000aThe San Francisco-based company has already gotten $27 million in funding, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk said via Twitter on Friday that Neuralink isn\u2019t seeking outside investors. A spokesman didn\u2019t respond to questions about the source of the funds.\u000a\u000aMusk, 46, is the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has several other pet projects, including a venture to bore tunnels for roads or tube-based transportation systems known as the hyperloop, and another project for the responsible development of artificial intelligence.\u000a\u000aIn June, Musk said Neuralink is a priority after much more demanding commitments to his automotive and rocket companies. \u201cBoring Co. is maybe 2 percent of my time; Neuralink is 3 percent to 5 percent of my time; OpenAI is going to be a couple of percent; and then 90-plus percent is divided between SpaceX and Tesla,\u201d said Musk at the electric-car maker\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\u000a\u000aFew details are known about Neuralink. The company\u2019s sparse website says it\u2019s \u201cdeveloping ultra-high bandwith brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.\u201d It\u2019s also recruiting engineers and scientists to join the effort.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo neuroscience experience is required: talent and drive matter far more,\u201d the company says on the site. \u201cWe expect most of our team to come from other areas and industries.\u201d

aVWatching from outside of the Washington Beltway, it seems to me that the Republican leadership in congress is incapable of organizing a two car funeral, let alone enacting major reform or pass significant legislation.\u000a\u000aExhibit number one are the pathetics attemps by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aAs we all know, Republicans ran for 7 years on repealing Obamacare.\u000a\u000aBut after seven years and a surprise trump victory, the GOP was caught flat-footed, without a healthcare plan that a majority of congress could get behind.\u000a\u000aRyan led with a top down approach . . . a binary choice for his caucus where he essentially stated \u2014 you\u2019re either with me or against me. Predictably, many members of the Republican caucus balked \u2014 as politics especially is about inclusion in the making of legislation \u2014 not exclusion.\u000a\u000aThe House process was painful to watch and for the entire world reminded us of a silent movie with Republican members of the House shuttling back and for to microphones and with virtually the same message . . . "we\u2019re trying to get to yes."\u000a\u000aFinally, after painful negotiations and countless media appearances to explain "how hard it was to get something like this done," they passed a bill that nobody liked . . . with the hope was it would be sorted out in conference.\u000a\u000aNow enters Senate Majority Leader McConnell \u2014 who went through some of the same machinations \u2014 but ultimately failed to get the Senate on board when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., just said thumbs down and no.\u000a\u000aLater McConnell weighed in and stated that President Trump had "excessive expectations" which went over like a lead balloon with the president and caused a firestorm of tweets.\u000a\u000aClearly Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell were no fans of the Trump candidacy for president or \u2014 for that matter \u2014 much of his agenda and, in the opinion of this writer and others, have deliberately slow-walked much of what the Trump White House wants to achieve.\u000a\u000aCase in point is one of the president\u2019s signature issues and a goal embraced by the base that elected Trump \u2014 and that\u2019s the wall or the fence which neither McConnell, Ryan or their allies at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce want to see happen.\u000a\u000aRecently in his speech in Arizona, the president threatened to shut down the government if funding for the wall is not included in the upcoming budget, and he also called on Majority Leader McConnell to end the legislative filibuster that requires 60 votes. President Trump wants a simple majority to pass legislation. That seems to me to reasonable request \u2014 especially during these hyper partisan times.\u000a\u000aAnd can anyone doubt if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., became the Democratic majority leader \u2014 he would immediately end the legislative filibuster in order to enact his team\u2019s big government, progressive agenda?\u000a\u000aA lot is at stake this fall \u2014 including tax reform or at the very least, tax cuts for businesses, families and small businesses.\u000a\u000aCan Speaker Ryan and Senate Majority Leader McConnell pull it together and drive the president\u2019s agenda through their respective caucuses?\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ll see.

aVBody shaming by Toronto orchestra management sparked backlash, leading to the resignation of management and the shutdown of the organization.\u000a\u000aSheraton Cadwell Orchestra management sent an email to performers asking vocalists who are not "physically fit and slim" to refrain from wearing "tight-fitting dresses," the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\u000a\u000aThe email singled out two performers, saying "although almost all of our vocalists are fit and slim \u2014 the way our boutique orchestras would like our front line artists to be \u2014 two of our featured singers were not." It went on to say that "only singers who are physically fit and slim (or, at the very least, those who know how to dress strategically/appropriately in order to not bring attention to their temporary physical/dietary indulgences) would be showcased."\u000a\u000a"The first thing that came to my mind when I read it was, 'Is this directed towards me?'" vocalist Victoria Leone said, according to the CBC.\u000a\u000aLeone sent an email to management.\u000a\u000a"In their response, they said it was a privilege and pleasure to have me in their company and if I could re-read the text in red ... and essentially they sent the same email back to me and highlighted some points," she said.\u000a\u000aAnother email from management asked the singer "to kindly accept our sincere apology," CBC noted.\u000a\u000aIt was unclear how many of the orchestra board's 11 members resigned, CBC said, but another email from management said: "We sincerely apologize for any embarrassment/harassment that you may experience from media representatives or other individuals/parties as a result of misconstrued/malicious allegations and extremely negative/destructive/evil intent."\u000a\u000aLeone said she was disappointed at the outcome, according to Global News.\u000a\u000a"It was very disappointing to hear that they feel our discussion about the body-shaming situation was a 'malicious and evil' attempt at shutting down the organization," she said.

aVIt has long been thought that a high level of "good" cholesterol in the blood, also known as HDL, is better for health. However, new European research is challenging this belief, suggesting that those with extremely high levels of good cholesterol have a higher mortality rate than people with normal levels.\u000a\u000aCarried out by researchers from the University of Copenhagen, the study looked at data for 116,000 subjects from the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study, in combination with mortality data from the Danish Civil Registration System.\u000a\u000aParticipants were followed for an average of 6 years, and the study was based on just over 10,500 deaths.\u000a\u000aFrom the mortality rate based on these deaths and medical information on the participants, the team found that for men with extremely high levels of HDL in the blood, the mortality rate was 106 percent higher when compared to those who had normal levels.\u000a\u000aIn addition, men in the next group, with very high levels, also had a 36 percent higher mortality rate.\u000a\u000aFor women with extremely high levels, the mortality rate was 68 percent higher.\u000a\u000aHowever, the team also found excessive mortality for people with extremely low levels of HDL in the blood. Those with medium levels of HDL in the blood had the lowest mortality. For men, this level was 1.9 mmol/L. For women, it was 2.4 mmol/L.\u000a\u000aPrevious US studies have also shown similar correlations between levels of HDL cholesterol and excessive mortality but in specific population groups. This is the first time excessive mortality has been shown in a more general population.\u000a\u000aHowever, because the study only looked at a statistical correlation between mortality and HDL levels, it doesn't give any reasons why those with extremely high or low HDL levels have higher mortality.\u000a\u000aThough it may prompt more questions than answers, study author Brge Nordestgaard noted that "These results radically change the way we understand 'good' cholesterol. Doctors like myself have been used to congratulating patients who had a very high level of HDL in their blood. But we should no longer do so, as this study shows a dramatically higher mortality rate."\u000a\u000aProfessor Nordestgaard now believes that we need to adjust our thinking about levels of good cholesterol, commenting that, "It appears that we need to remove the focus from HDL as an important health indicator in research, at hospitals and at the general practitioner. These are the smallest lipoproteins in the blood, and perhaps we ought to examine some of the larger ones instead. For example, looking at blood levels of triglyceride and LDL, the 'bad' cholesterol, are probably better health indicators."\u000a\u000aThe results can be found in the European Heart Journal.

aVMAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Boko Haram extremists killed at least 27 people by shooting them and slitting their throats as they attacked several villages in northern Nigeria's Borno state in the past week, residents said.\u000a\u000aSuch deadly attacks in recent months have pressured Nigeria's government to increase its efforts against a homegrown Islamic extremist group it last year declared to be "crushed."\u000a\u000aBoko Haram fighters entered villages in the Nganzai area on Wednesday, slitting throats and using guns to kill at least 15 people while injuring two others, said Modu Jialta, a member of a local self-defense group. The attackers also burned homes.\u000a\u000aResidents weren't able to get to the bodies for burial until Friday, Jialta said.\u000a\u000aSuspected Boko Haram fighters also attacked in the Guzamala local council area on Wednesday, killing 12 people and injuring at least four, said Mai Abatcha Monguno, the commander of the council's citizen defense forces.\u000a\u000aNorthern Borno state is the birthplace and stronghold of Boko Haram. Bunu Bukar, secretary of the hunters' association there, said more government support and better equipment is needed to combat the extremists.\u000a\u000aBoko Haram's eight-year insurgency has displaced millions in Nigeria and neighboring countries and killed more than 20,000 people.\u000a\u000aIn a speech to the nation on Monday, President Muhammadu Buhari vowed to "reinforce and reinvigorate the fight" against Boko Haram, which he accused of "attempting a new series of attacks on soft targets."

aVThe slow pace of President Donald Trump to fill political appointments is likely a "sign of neglect," The Washington Post explained Friday in an opinion piece.\u000a\u000aThe Senate has confirmed less than half of the president's nominees to fill vacancies throughout the administration, the article explained. Trump has nominated 277 people for the more than 1,100 requiring Senate confirmation. To date, the Senate has confirmed 124. These numbers represent the slowest pace in 40 years, according to the Post.\u000a\u000a"We doubt Mr. Trump wants to gut his own administration. More likely the slow pace is a sign of neglect. He should put renewed effort into turning the lights on in management offices all over town, simply out of interest in advancing his own agenda," the article read.\u000a\u000aTrump's cabinet has numerous vacancies, with fewer than ten percent of "key political appointees in place" at the Labor, Agriculture and Energy Departments. Eight other agencies have less than 25 percent.\u000a\u000aOne exception is the Department of Health and Human Services, which has "82 percent of its political appointees nominated and 42 percent filled."The Post noted a sense of urgency in filling the positions, which it explained had the responsibility to "hammer out policy and then execute it." The article maintained the pace of the Senate to approve nominees was "now on a par with those for previous presidents," citing the nonpartisan White House Transition Project.\u000a\u000a"Surely in this nation of 323 million people there are good candidates for top government positions. They need to be found, nominated and confirmed," the Post concluded.

aVTo describe the different Donald Trumps we saw in the last 72 hours: an impressive commander-in-chief Monday, giving a prime time teleprompter address on Afghanistan, at Ft. Myer, Virginia; a rambling candidate Tuesday, reprised in vintage, troubling, stream of consciousness, at a campaign-style rally in Phoenix, Arizona; and, yesterday, an inspirational unifier, back on teleprompter, at the American Legion convention in Reno, Nevada.\u000a\u000aAbout all this schizophrenia, CNN exclaimed:\u000a\u000a\u201cWhiplash!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe media have repeatedly used this word to describe Donald Trump. In the campaign last year, the Associated Press described a \u201csoftening\u201d of his immigration stance as \u201cpolitical whiplash.\u201d In April of this year, MSNBC described Trump\u2019s \u201cdramatic reversal\u201d on Syria as \u201cwhiplash.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd "Whiplash!" is the title of my new blog here at Newsmax, this column its introduction.\u000a\u000aAnd now there is my new book "Whiplash! From JFK to Donald Trump, A Political Odyssey."\u000a\u000aIn Phoenix, President Trump inelegantly re-litigated Charlottesville. I won\u2019t, except to say: (1) The violence and death ten days ago provided him with an opportunity to confront the white supremacists, KKK, and neo-Nazis, and he blew it, at best, with obfuscation; (2) he recovered the high ground two days later, only to (3) inexplicably regress, the next day; (4) finally, about history and heritage, Trump now is the wrong messenger.\u000a\u000aAnd (5) the media are wrong: the publicity last year about David Duke, Richard Spencer, et. al \u201csupporting\u201d Trump did not gain votes for Trump, but lost them; indeed, President Trump was right to say, as he did in Phoenix, that the media continue to encourage discord and division, agitation and bigotry, extremism and violence.\u000a\u000aThis country is not in an epidemic of racism or anti-Semitism. But the media frenzied coverage of racists does not forewarn; it emboldens these thugs with credibility, spreads their message of hate, and gets them new recruits. As a Jew, I am more afraid of anti-Semitism among the many \u201ceducated\u201d faculty and students at Harvard or UC Berkeley than among the relatively few ignorant rabble-rousers on the streets. Trump was right to describe these white supremacists as \u201closers.\u201d\u000a\u000aConsider how the media agitate. Huff Post, for which I have written, headlined the departure of President Trump\u2019s strategist Steve Bannon with the headline \u201cGOY, BYE!\u201d The word \u201cgoy\u201d is a Yiddish term and, as used by Huff Post, it seems to refer derisively to a non-Jew. The headline conjures up a stereotype of Jews in control, a Jewish conspiracy against Bannon. Where is the condemnation of the \u201cprogressive\u201d Huff Post?\u000a\u000aCaroline Graham for the Daily Mail was more specific in her story, incredibly headlined, \u201cHow Jewish convert Ivanka got \u2018Bannon the Barbarian\u2019 to go.\u201d Graham quotes her \u201csource\u201d as saying about Bannon: \u201cJared and Ivanka helped push him out. They were concerned about how they were being viewed by the Jewish community.\u201d The article says, that Breitbart, Bannon\u2019s website, \u201chas rallied against Jews.\u201d\u000a\u000aFact check(s): Before Charlottesville, Bannon agreed to resign, at the behest of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a general asserting his hegemony. Jewish liberals have pilloried Ivanka and Jared for months. And where is the condemnation of the \u201cJewish convert Ivanka\u201d irrelevant and even inflammatory headline you would expect in a neo-Nazi publication? As for Breitbart being anti-Jewish, the late Andrew Breitbart was Jewish, as are many of its top editors and writers, and not secular, but observant Jews.

aVAetna has revealed the HIV status of at least 23 of its customers by mailing details of their medication prescriptions which were visible through the clear windows of the envelopes, said lawyers seeking to stop the practice.\u000a\u000aAttorneys said the mail had been seen by recipients\u2019 family members, roommates and even neighbors, CNN reported.\u000a\u000aThe Legal Action Center and the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania said the health care company sent the mail to nine states. The two legal organizations have teamed up with attorneys from eight other organizations in a bid to represent these customers.\u000a\u000aThe AIDS Law Project said the information was devastating after neighbors and family learned of customers\u2019 intimate health information.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey also were shocked that their health insurer would utterly disregard their privacy rights,\u201d the organization said.\u000a\u000aA cease-and-desist letter was submitted to Aetna on Thursday, calling for an immediate end to the letters in the current form and demanding the health insurer to develop a plan to correct its practices and procedures.\u000a\u000aRonda B. Goldfein, executive director of the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, said the casual way in which Aetna disclosed its customers HIV status and use of HIV medication was far more technical than a violation of the law.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt creates a tangible risk of violence, discrimination and other trauma.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Legal Action Center said that while medical advances may have helped transform HIV into a chronic yet manageable condition, there was still a widespread stigma against people living with HIV, leading to discrimination and violence in the workplace, the home and the school system.\u000a\u000aRelated stories:

aVThe election of President Donald Trump and Republican control of Congress meant the National Rifle Association could probably rest easy that gun laws wouldn't change for at least four years. But the NRA has begun a campaign not against pending legislation but what it sees as liberal forces bent on undoing the progress it's made \u2014 and the political powerhouse is resorting to language that some believe could incite violence.\u000a\u000aUsing the hashtags #counterresistance and #clenchedfistoftruth, the NRA has put out a series of videos that announce a "shot across the bow," and say the gun-rights group is "coming for you" and that "elites ... threaten our very survival," terms that suggest opponents are enemy combatants.\u000a\u000a"The times are burning and the media elites have been caught holding the match," NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch says in one video aired on NRATV, the gun lobby's web video site, as it shows footage of people fighting police, breaking storefront glass and burning the American flag.\u000a\u000aLater, she specifically calls out The New York Times: "We've had it with your narratives, your propaganda, your fake news. We've had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life. And we've had it with your tone-deaf assertion that you are in any way truth or fact-based journalism," Loesch says. "Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow. ... In short? We're coming for you."\u000a\u000aKathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the tone and language is "overwrought rhetoric" that, viewed by the wrong person, could lead to violence. The kicker on one of the videos \u2014 "We're coming for you" \u2014 is straight out of the movies, she said, and "that phrase means that violence is imminent and we will perpetrate it."\u000a\u000aThe NRA is taking a page from the Trump playbook.\u000a\u000aThe friction between the gun lobby and the media isn't new. But critics of the NRA contend the organization is relying on the "fake news" mantra started by Trump to whip up its followers after a dip in gun sales that has taken place since Trump succeeded President Barack Obama, who favored stricter gun-control laws.\u000a\u000a"They're not inventing this hyperangry, nasty partisan tone but piggybacking on Trump's approach. Of course, NRA voters by and large are Trump voters, so they would be sympathetic to that kind of message," said Robert Spitzer, chairman of the political science department at State University of New York at Cortland, who has examined the firearms industry and Second Amendment issues extensively.\u000a\u000aSpitzer, a member of the NRA as well as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said it's a pattern the NRA has exhibited as the group evolved from an almost exclusive focus on gun safety into a political beacon for conservatives who fear changes to the Second Amendment and the gun industry.\u000a\u000a"It was Bill Clinton in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, it was John McCain. It was Hillary Clinton. It was the United Nations. They've held up the U.N. as ready to swoop in and take everybody's guns," Spitzer said. "The focus of their ire has changed, but the basic message has been the same."\u000a\u000aThe NRA declined to comment on the videos to The Associated Press. But the NRA has produced videos saying the left and the media are out of control and feeding a false narrative that tea party conservatives are racists and Trump supporters are "toothless hillbillies."\u000a\u000aWayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, said this month: "There is no longer any difference between our politicians and the elite media who report on them. ... These elites threaten our very survival, and to them we say: We don't trust you, we don't fear you, and we don't need you. Take your hands off our future."\u000a\u000aErich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said it's been a longtime frustration with journalists who, he contends, "ignore the violence and harsh rhetoric on the left while magnifying and twisting the words of those on the right."\u000a\u000aThe NRA videos prompted Mike Nelson, a Democratic congressional candidate in Arkansas and self-described hunter and gun-rights supporter, to label them as "hate speech." Nelson, whose website lists the NRA among more than two dozen organization he's supported, said he can no longer back the NRA.\u000a\u000aIn a Facebook post, Nelson wrote: "If the NRA does not stop their hate campaign, I will call them out on sedition. Sedition is the willful undermining of the legal authority, the Incitement of Violence."\u000a\u000aSome gun owners have cheered the videos and said they give voice to conservatives weary of media attacks on Trump; others say the videos stray from the NRA's original mission and that the NRA is inviting violence.\u000a\u000aJoe Plenzler, a Marine veteran who served overseas and sometimes had reporters accompanying his unit, joined two other veterans in writing an opinion piece for The Daily Beast criticizing the videos.\u000a\u000a"The NRA props up the Second Amendment by undermining and vilifying the protections afforded in the First, and paints everyone who may disagree with the current administration, our country's justice system, or the NRA's partisan political position with a very dark and unjust broad brush," Plenzler wrote with Marine veterans Craig Tucker and Kyleanne Hunter.\u000a\u000aPlenzler, who has since dropped his NRA membership, said he was disturbed by the videos.\u000a\u000a"Lately, it seems like they've gone well out of the bounds of any sort of sane responsible behavior. If you want to advocate for the Second Amendment, which I unapologetically believe in, that's fine," he said. "But I think at the point where you are going to demonize half the American population in a recruitment effort to get more members, I've got a big problem with that."

aVWhen you have a hard time distinguishing between a ludicrous late-night comedy sketch and a game on ESPN, you know that things are out of hand.\u000a\u000aThis Tuesday, the website "Outkick the Coverage" ran this story: "MSESPN Pulls Asian Announcer Named Robert Lee Off UVA Game To Avoid Offending Idiots." The reporter, Clay Travis, broke the news that ESPN had reassigned announcer Robert Lee from the opening football game to be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, between the University of Virginia and the College of William and Mary, to the Youngstown State at Pittsburgh game.\u000a\u000aThe reason for the change? The announcer's name: Robert Lee, evidently too close to the name of the Confederate general, Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aIn an update on the site later in the day, Outkick published the official ESPN statement: "We collectively made the decision with Robert to switch games as the tragic events in Charlottesville were unfolding, simply because of the coincidence of his name. In that moment it felt right to all parties. It's a shame that this is even a topic of conversation and we regret that who calls play-by-play for a football game has become an issue."\u000a\u000aThe reason it's a topic of conversation is that the ESPN decision is truly mind-boggling. Moving an announcer because of his name? Yes, I, too, thought it was a joke when I first read the headline.\u000a\u000a"In a story that seems made for The Onion, but is actually true, according to multiple Outkick fans inside ESPN," wrote Travis, "MSESPN decided to pull an Asian [American] college football announcer named Robert Lee off the William and Mary at University of Virginia college football game because they were concerned that having an ASIAN FOOTBALL ANNOUNCER NAMED ROBERT LEE would be offensive to some viewers."\u000a\u000aTravis mused that ESPN must "believe people are this dumb or that having an Asian announcer named Robert Lee is too offensive for the average TV viewer to handle."\u000a\u000aMany of those college football fans have been waiting for a new season since the end of the 2016 season when the Clemson Tigers' walk-on wide receiver, Hunter Renfrow, caught a pass from Deshaun Watson with one second left in the game to win 35-31 over Alabama. For them, this distraction from the sport must appear ludicrous. Many viewers look at this all-American sport as a chance to focus on teamwork and outcomes rather than politics.\u000a\u000aIt's a way to escape the ongoing realities of our lives.\u000a\u000aThe game itself is physically demanding and aggressive. For the networks to be so worried about offending the delicate sensibilities of their viewers is laughable.\u000a\u000aAs Brian Stelter wrote on CNN Money, "By trying to avoid an embarrassing ordeal, ESPN has embarrassed itself . . . the network confirmed that its management moved an Asian-American announcer, Robert Lee, off the University of Virginia's home opener football game 'simply because of the coincidence of his name.'"\u000a\u000aIt is possible there could have simply been a disclaimer that scrolled on the bottom of the screen during the game, clarifying for any confused viewers noting, as Travis wrote, that "the Asian man on the right is not long deceased Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He's a different person entirely, one that is still alive and did not fight in the Civil War."\u000a\u000aThere may be a good side to all this: as the reactions to possible reactions become more ludicrous, maybe we will stop worrying so much about offending other people and quit being so offended ourselves.\u000a\u000aIt reminds me of the strategy on how to win against a team of two: create an argument between the two, step back and let them beat each other up and do the work for you. Just a bit of patience and you can win, simply by begin igniting a spark. If they are instead able to put the spark out \u2014 join together \u2014 well, then it's a different story.\u000a\u000aMaybe, if we recognize that these are simply distractions driven by those who don't want to talk about policies and progress, we can instead figure out a way to work together and create a better country for all Americans.\u000a\u000aJackie Gingrich Cushman is the co-author, along with her father, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, of the book "5 Principles for a Successful Life: From Our Family to Yours."

aVLast October, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called U.S. accusations that it meddled in the 2016 elections \u201cflattering.\u201d Though denying the accusation, he was saying the 2016 hacking was small potatoes if you compare Russian meddling with U.S. meddling. Noam Chomsky put it this way: \u201cBy U.S. standards, the Russian efforts are so meager as to barely elicit notice.\u201d In a research database created by Dov Levin of the Institute for Policy and Strategy at Carnegie Mellon University, between 1946 and 2000, Russia/USSR meddled in 36 elections, while the U.S. easily beat them, meddling in a total of 81 elections. The two superpowers interfered in one out of nine elections around the world.\u000a\u000aI sincerely hope Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller puts his investigation in the context of a long history of U.S. interference in foreign elections over the years:\u000a\u000aThe U.S. helped organize the 1955 campaign for Ngo Dinh Diem in a Vietnam election that appears to have been rigged. We supported Diem again in 1961. But we grew tired of the man, and a CIA operative provided funds to local coup plotters who overthrew him in 1963, and he was executed in the back of an armored personnel carrier.\u000a\u000aIn 1964, the CIA put $4 million behind Eduardo Frei Montalva in his campaign against Salvador Allende for the presidency of Chile. The CIA got behind Frei again in 1966, but this time Allende won. Undaunted, the U.S. launched an aggressive effort to undermine Allende\u2019s presidency. In 1973, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\u2019s orders were conveyed: \u201cIt is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened, and a handy AK47 put an end to Allende\u2019s life.\u000a\u000aThe 1976 congressional Pike Report asserted that between 1948 and 1970, the U.S. spent over $65 million on elections in Italy, helping maintain the Christian Democrats\u2019 grip on power for eight successive elections. The CIA officer who ran this for 25 years said, \u201cWe had bags of money.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith up to $5 million at his disposal, CIA agent Edward Lansdale actually ran Ramon Magsaysay\u2019s hugely successful 1953 campaign for the presidency of The Philippines, earning him the nickname \u201cAgent Landslide.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven better than having the campaign chief on the U.S. payroll is to have the candidate himself \u2014 as was Joaquin Balaguer, who with U.S. help won the presidency of the Dominican Republic in 1966.\u000a\u000aThe CIA also had members of the Haitian military junta which ousted popular President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 on its payroll.\u000a\u000aIn 2000, Congress appropriated $40 million in funding and training to support Vojislav Kostunica\u2019s successful bid for the presidency of Serbia.\u000a\u000aAlthough Russia was spiraling downwards during Boris Yeltsin\u2019s first term, with surging poverty and unemployment, life expectancy falling sharply, and oligarchs gaining vast power, President Bill Clinton endorsed a $10.2 billion IMF loan to Russia which ensured Yeltsin\u2019s 1996 re-election, leading to further chaos. And in the run-up to Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2012 re-election, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her influence to condemn his United Russia Party\u2019s Parliamentary victory: \u201cThe Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. interference in foreign elections has not always been about geopolitical imperatives. Sometimes it is driven by naked business relationships, for example the future British Petroleum in Iran 1953, British sugar companies in Guiana the same year, and the notorious United Fruit Co. coup in Guatemala the following year.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. helped the Shah of Iran, Aldo Moro in Italy, Violeta Chomorro in Nicaragua, Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia, Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak in Israel, Manuel Zelaya in Honduras, and Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, and also meddled in elections in Macedonia, Argentina, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, Greece, Lebanon, Bolivia, the Congo, and even France, Germany, Japan, and Australia. Borrowing a line from President Trump, \u201cYou think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\u000a\u000aDistinguished historian Mark Trachtenberg, UCLA Professor Emeritus, writing in Public Affairs, put it this way:\u000a\u000a\u201cThe assumption is that while we have the right to intervene in the internal political affairs of all kinds of countries around the world, it is outrageous if any of them try to do the same thing to us. We have the right to eavesdrop on the private communications of the leaders of foreign countries, but it is outrageous that they should try to hack into the email accounts of American leaders and their associates.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmerica is the \u2018indispensable nation,\u2019 and the rules that apply to other countries simply do not apply to us. Those are the unspoken assumptions, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine how foreigners react to the sort of behavior they lead to. Does the word \u2018arrogant\u2019 come to mind here?\u000a\u000a\u201cMy own feeling is that a double standard of this sort is morally repulsive and politically counterproductive. I don\u2019t think we should arrogate to ourselves rights that we would not grant to others. But what that means is that, given the way we behave, we should not get too upset if other countries behave the same way.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we approach the recent email hacking affair with those thoughts in mind, we should be able to take what the Russians did in stride. It was in line with the way the world works \u2014 a world that is in large part of our own making.\u201d\u000a\u000aExcellent reading for Special Prosecutor Mueller.\u000a\u000aHenry Seggerman managed Korea International Investment Fund, the oldest South Korean hedge fund, from 2001 until 2014.

aVIs early morning, midday, or after dinner the best time to work out? The answer varies widely, based on individual preferences. But experts say some times of day are better than others for exercise \u2013 depending on whether your goal is to lose weight, build muscle, or boost cardiovascular fitness.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe optimum time for a workout is specific to the individual,\u201d fitness expert Robert Fletcher, member of the 1995 world champion U.S. kickboxing team, tells Newsmax Health. \u201cEveryone is different. The optimal time to exercise factors in day to day activities, your energy level and what\u2019s best for your schedule.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome people prefer to energize their day with an early morning workout, which many others would dread. Some people find after work or later at night is what works for them. Consider targeting a time and experiment with what works best for you,\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough exercise preferences should guide decisions about when to hit the gym, new research published in the Journal Of Strength and Conditioning Research suggests most people would do well to avoid very early workouts or late-night routines.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the researchers found we tend to perform our best at exercise later in the day, with both strength and flexibility peaking later in the afternoon.\u000a\u000aIn addition perceived exertion \u2013 how hard you think your body is working \u2013 is lowest in the late afternoon. Scientists say this phenomenon can be traced back to our circadian rhythm, the body\u2019s 24-hour clock. The circadian rhythm caused body temperature to rise throughout the day and peak in the late afternoon.\u000a\u000aA common misconception is that exercising in the evening can impair sleep. Overall, that misconception doesn\u2019t prove empirically sound. A small study of young adults in the Journal of Sleep Research found that exercising two hours before bedtime, even if the exercise was vigorous aerobically, did not impair their ability to fall asleep or sleep soundly.\u000a\u000aAn additional study conducted for the Journal of Sleep Research found older people who did low-impact aerobic workouts between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. reported improved quality of sleep.\u000a\u000aEarly risers, don\u2019t despair. Consistent early morning exercise can eliminate the morning performance gap. Researchers found that those who exercised consistently in the morning improved their performance to levels seen in the afternoon.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s also some evidence that \u201cfasted cardio,\u201d or working out on an empty stomach, can burn more fat.\u000a\u000aExperts also say that if you have trouble with consistency, a morning exercise routine may be right for you.\u000a\u000a\u201cResearch suggests in terms of performing a consistent exercise habit, individuals who exercise in the morning tend to do better,\u201d Dr. Cedric Bryant, Ph.D., chief science officer with the American Council on Exercise in San Diego, tells Web MD.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe thinking is that they get their exercise in before other time pressures interfere,\u201d Bryant says. \u201cI usually exercise at 6 a.m. because no matter how well-intentioned I am, if I don\u2019t exercise in the morning, other things will squeeze it out.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe recommends allowing more time to warm up if you exercise in the morning to allow your body temperature to rise.\u000a\u000aLara Carlson, associate professor of applied exercise science at University of New England, says that some studies show morning exercise is better if you\u2019re looking to lose weight.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor weight loss, it\u2019s more controversial, but there\u2019s research that has looked at people engaging in morning versus afternoon exercise, and those who exercise in the morning have lower blood pressure throughout the day and get better sleep,\u201d she tells Web MD.\u000a\u000a\u201cSleep is when your body repairs itself, and sleep also reduces stress, which may affect your weight \u2013 and I think future research will begin to tie the benefits of morning exercise together better.\u201d\u000a\u000aEveryone is different, so it\u2019s important to find an exercise regime that works for you. It\u2019s better to get a workout at a less-than-optimal time than no workout at all.

Research courses online to find the best destination for you and your group, according to Matt Adams at GolfAdvisor.\u000a\u000a\u200b2. Choose your partners \u2014 Whether it\u2019s one other person or a group, make sure all parties have the same goals. Their intentions might include a balance between serious competition and a social occasion for a round of fun golf.\u000a\u000a3. Schedule properly \u2014 Planning for several events in an unfamiliar area might not work out, so be realistic when setting goals over the days. Also, be prepared for planning that doesn\u2019t work out. Plan for sightseeing days in case time off is needed because of stiffness or unexpected injuries.\u000a\u000a4. Reserve early \u2014 The best tee times might need scheduling months in advance, Golf.com points out.

It also makes for a nice home away from home.\u000a\u000a6. Choose leaders \u2014 Maybe an experienced golf traveler could handle arrangements and take charge of the trip. Another idea is to have two leaders, Kris Hart explains in Nextgengolf. One person might handle the travel and golf days while another takes care of dining and entertainment.\u000a\u000a\u200b\u200b7. Onsite lodging \u2014 Some golf resorts are right near the course to make scheduling a lot easier. If you choose such a resort, you might find other deals or perks, such as free breakfast. Look at all the fees involved when choosing a golf package.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVObamacare plans will be sold in every part of the U.S. next year after an insurer agreed to do business in a small Ohio county, overcoming predictions that some Americans wouldn\u2019t have access to coverage under the law in 2018.\u000a\u000aOhio announced Thursday that health insurer CareSource will offer Affordable Care Act coverage next year in Paulding County. The county, in the northwest corner of the state, had been left without ACA coverage for 2018 after Anthem Inc. said in June it would pull out.\u000a\u000aState regulators have been negotiating with insurers to sell plans in counties where other plans, including many of the large, publicly traded companies, pulled back from the law. While people in places without Obamacare plans would have been able to buy health insurance, they wouldn\u2019t have access to the subsidized coverage that\u2019s available under the law.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur decision to offer coverage in the bare counties speaks to our mission and commitment to the marketplace and serving those who are in need of health care coverage,\u201d said CareSource Chief Executive Officer Pamela Morris, in a statement with the state announcing the expansion.\u000a\u000aOhio\u2019s insurance regulators have found insurers to cover about 20 counties that could have been left without Obamacare coverage. Without new plans, about 11,000 people who bought Obamacare coverage in the counties would have been unable to in 2018, according to the state. Regulators in states including Nevada, Indiana and Missouri have also persuaded insurers to enter new counties to ensure counties wouldn\u2019t stand empty.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty facing consumers when it comes to health insurance and these announcements will provide important relief,\u201d Ohio Department of Insurance Director Jillian Froment said in the statement.\u000a\u000aFew Choices\u000a\u000aEven though all counties are now covered, consumers still face few or no choices in some places because of the pullbacks. About 23 percent of Obamacare customers, or 2.5 million people, live in counties where only one insurer plans to offer coverage next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Another 26 percent are in counties with two options.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration, which has backed efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, had pointed to the potentially bare counties as evidence the law was falling apart. Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the law has still \u201cfailed to deliver.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOn Obamacare\u2019s exchanges premiums continue to surge, insurers continue to abandon wide swaths of the country, and choices continue to vanish,\u201d he said by email.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, for example, the New York hospital system Northwell Health said it would wind down its CareConnect Insurance Co. business, which offered individual and small-group Obamacare plans. Northwell started the business in 2013 to serve people in Obamacare.\u000a\u000aThe health system -- New York State\u2019s biggest -- blamed the federal government for failing to stabilize the law\u2019s markets. Many insurers have said the Trump administrations threats to let Obamacare wither have caused them to raise rates or reconsider their participation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has become increasingly clear that continuing the CareConnect health plan is financially unsustainable, given the failure of the federal government and Congress to correct regulatory flaws that have destabilized insurance markets and their refusal to honor promises of additional funding,\u201d said Michael J. Dowling, Northwell\u2019s chief executive officer.\u000a\u000aDowling said Northwell saw \u201cno viable path to profitability in the foreseeable future\u201d for the business.

aVMany U.S. Hispanics are venturing out only to buy essential goods and are cutting back on discretionary spending, worried about possible harassment by immigration or law enforcement officials since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, according to community groups, research firms and retailers.\u000a\u000aThis change in consumer behavior by the country's second-fastest-growing ethnic group has recently been cited as a cause for worry by already-struggling consumer companies, from big-box retailers to auto parts makers.\u000a\u000aO'Reilly Automotive Chief Executive Gregory Henslee told analysts earlier this month that many of the company's stores with weak second-quarter sales were in Hispanic-dominant areas of the United States. "It's not just something that we've seen. It's something that most retailers have seen," Henslee said.\u000a\u000aIn late July, Target Corp Chief Executive Brian Cornell at a conference referenced a report by retail consultants NPD Group that cited a decline in discretionary spending by Hispanics.\u000a\u000a"They are staying home. They are going out less often, particularly around border towns in the United States," Cornell said at a conference in Aspen, Colo.\u000a\u000aTrump's surprise election win last November came partly on campaign promises to deport undocumented foreigners en masse and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. These pledges - along with Trump's claim that Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States - sparked outrage within the American Hispanic community.\u000a\u000a"For our own president to call us criminals, thieves and rapists - it's terrible ... we live in fear of doing those simple things like going for groceries," said a 19-year-old Chicago college student, Juan F., who did not want his full name used out of concern for family members who are undocumented.\u000a\u000aJuan, a U.S. citizen, said he has been shopping for his household since Trump's presidency began because family members are afraid to leave the house.\u000a\u000a"People are squirreling money away and don't want to leave their houses to go to stores," said Eric Rodriguez of Latino advocacy group UnidosUS, which has been critical of Trump's proposals on immigration.\u000a\u000a"They're afraid local law enforcement or immigration officials are going to harass or embarrass them," he said in an interview.\u000a\u000aNot all consumer categories, however, are experiencing a significant decline in Hispanic spending. The purchase of essentials such as food and basic household goods is still on the rise, but at a much slower rate than in recent years, according to research firm Nielsen.\u000a\u000aNone of the reports specified any changes to first-half online spending by Hispanics, which make up about 18 percent of the U.S. population, according to research firm Nielsen Holdings Plc.\u000a\u000aTRUMP EFFECT\u000a\u000aThe lower spending by Hispanics has been hurting certain retailers since the start of the year, according to reports by brokerage firm Jefferies and analytics firm NPD Group.\u000a\u000aCornell, citing a more detailed version of the NPD report than one that has been publicly released, said late last month that shopping visits among Latinos were down about 11 percent in November and December. The "concerning" trend had been noticed particularly around U.S. border towns, Cornell said.\u000a\u000a"Their buying power is undeniable, as is their influence on everything from fashion and food to music and entertainment," Cornell said.\u000a\u000aBig-box retailers have for years invested heavily in courting the Hispanic community's substantial spending power, which reached $1.4 trillion in 2016, according to data by the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business.\u000a\u000aLuis Fitch, founder of Minneapolis-based Hispanic marketing company UNO Branding, whose clients have included Target and Best Buy Co Inc, said several small clients across different cities had posted declining sales since Trump took office, and that this had to be affecting big-box retailers, too.\u000a\u000a"It's very common to have a Mexican married to an American, but if that Mexican is undocumented, he's really afraid of going out and looking for work," Fitch said. "And if only one person is working, obviously their budget is cut in half and that's a problem if they were going to buy a house or car this year."\u000a\u000aDEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS\u000a\u000aOn average, Hispanics are younger than non-Hispanics, have more children, and spend more on each child, according to Jeff Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the Terry College of Business. Humphreys also said Hispanics tend to spend more on apparel, making their buying choices crucial to many retailers.\u000a\u000aAs the slowdown has mainly hit discretionary spending, retailers that deal in apparel and footwear \u2014 two sectors already feeling pressure - are hurting the most.\u000a\u000aNPD said makers of athletic wear popular with Hispanics, including Nike Inc, Skechers USA Inc and Vans , would take a big hit.\u000a\u000a"It's certainly a good litmus test of how the holiday season is going to shake out," NPD analyst Marshal Cohen said, pointing to a double-digit decline in back-to-school footwear sales, compared with a double-digit increase last year.\u000a\u000a"That's how powerful certain segments are, certainly the Hispanic market."\u000a\u000aNielsen said sales of consumer essentials to Hispanics rose only 0.6 percent in the year ended July 1, compared with a 2.9 percent increase the prior year, and a 6.2 percent in the year before that.\u000a\u000aSome restaurants and food companies have remarked on signs that the worst is over for them.\u000a\u000a"The Trump effect just on Hispanic foot traffic into the convenience store seems to have also dropped off a little bit," Rodney Sacks, chief executive of Monster Beverage Corp, told analysts on an earnings call earlier this month.

aVArizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Friday that he would have "preferred" that President Donald Trump allow the judicial process to "take its course" instead of pardoning former Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\u000a\u000aFlake, who has slammed Trump and his policies in recent weeks, took to Twitter:\u000a\u000aRegarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course. \u2014 Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) August 26, 2017\u000a\u000aBut two other Arizona GOP members of Congress, Reps. Paul Gosar and Rep. Andy Biggs, praised Trump's decision.\u000a\u000aGosar told John Berman on CNN that the president upheld the "rule of law" in pardoning Arpaio.\u000a\u000a"He asked for a jury trial," the fourth-term Gosar said. "From that standpoint, this was railroaded all the way through.\u000a\u000a"When you talk about a justice system that was so negligent, the Obama administration set up Joe Arpaio on day one \u2014 and that's hardly an application of the rule of law.\u000a\u000a"When you politicize the law, forbid the individual from a jury trial, you have got a big problem in the efficacy in regards to the rule of law \u2014 the way it is applied."\u000a\u000aBiggs said in a statement that President Trump "brought justice to a situation where the Obama administration had attempted to destroy a political opponent.\u000a\u000a"Sheriff Joe Arpaio made many enemies in the judicial system, the media, and the left because he enforced laws that the federal government ignored," the first-term Biggs said.\u000a\u000a"He did right by the law \u2014 even as the political consequences continued to mount.\u000a\u000a"America owes Sheriff Arpaio a debt of gratitude and not the injustice of a political witch hunt.

aVMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are important leaders in many fields, including government, economics, entertainment, science, education, and sports. Most would agree Mormons \u201cover index\u201d in many fields that affect millions throughout the world.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed Mormons. Still, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. And, while picking only 50 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank them in what we believe is a somewhat logical order, but certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps people on the list!) may take exception with the ranking.\u000a\u000aAlso, there are many more members of the U.S. Congress than are listed. They easily could have all been listed. We opted instead, however, to list only those with particular influence, such as committee assignments, caucus leadership, etc.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Leading Heart Doctor Reveals Proof of an Afterlife\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note we opted to not list the most obvious influential Mormon, namely the Church\u2019s beloved president, Thomas S. Monson, who faithful Mormons revere as a living prophet. Monson, like the other \u201cGeneral Authorities\u201d are clearly the most influential Mormons, certainly on the members of the Church. Nonetheless, for purposes of this list, we opted to look outside the Church hierarchy, and focused on leaders who are currently active in their respective secular fields of endeavor.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to nm_newstips@newsmax.com).\u000a\u000a1. Mitt Romney \u2014 A fifth-generation Mormon, the former governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee served as a missionary in France.

Bill Marriott \u2014 The executive chairman and chairman of the board of Marriott International led the transformation of the family restaurant business into the world\u2019s largest lodging company. Marriott is easily one of the world\u2019s most recognizable and respected business leaders. He is also known for his tireless work within the Church and philanthropic communities.\u000a\u000a3. Orrin Hatch \u2013 Now in his seventh term as a U.S. senator for Utah, Hatch is currently chairman of the powerful Senate Committee on Finance.

The Searchlight, Nevada, native married his high school sweetheart, Landra, and together they have five children.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a7. Mike Lee \u2014 Having clearly stepped out of the long shadow cast by his famous late father, Rex Lee, Mike Lee became Utah\u2019s junior senator in 2011. Lee clerked for now Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito while Alito was a judge on the Third Circuit Court. Known as one of the most staunchly conservative senators, friends and associates say he is also known for his willingness to listen and learn from all sides.\u000a\u000a8. Jason Chaffetz \u2014 The U.S. Representative from Utah\u2019s 3rd District is currently chairman of the powerful House Oversight & Government Reform Committee.

Jon Huntsman (both and either Jr. or Sr.) \u2014 Utah\u2019s wealthiest citizen, Jon Huntsman, Sr., and eldest son, Jon, Jr., have both made their mark and each deserves to be on this list (but are hard to separate). After having built an impressive world-wide chemical company, Senior continues his influence through many channels, particularly through his philanthropy. His charitable giving now exceeds $1 billion, particularly in the fields of healthcare and education. Meanwhile, Jon, Jr., has served in several presidential administrations, including as ambassador to Singapore (1992-1993) and to China (2009-2011). In between, he took time to run for and win the governorship of Utah. In 2012, Republican Huntsman even made a run at the presidency.

He left that prestigious post to take up the mantle of president of Church-owned BYU-Idaho. Clark is now an LDS Church General Authority and is also the Church Commissioner of Education. Clark and his wife, Sue Lorraine, are the parents of seven children. [*As previously noted, the editors of this list decided not to include General Authorities on this list, even though they are obviously among the world\u2019s most influential Mormons. Clark is on this list both because of his role in education in the country and because of his somewhat secular role as Commissioner of Education, not because of his position as a General Authority.]\u000a\u000a13. Bryce Harper \u2013 One of Major League Baseball's undisputed superstars, Harper amps up the energy every time he takes the field for the Washington Nationals. Harper was selected as the National League Rookie of the Year in 2012 and as the NL's MVP for 2015.

In addition to West Virginia, Gee has led Ohio State, Vanderbilt, Brown, and University of Colorado.\u000a\u000a16. Gary Herbert \u2014 The Republican governor of Utah is also the chairman of the National Governors\u2019 Association. Herbert won his first (full-term) election in 2012 with a commanding 68 percent of the popular vote. He first took over the post when he was elevated from lieutenant governor to replace Gov. Jon Huntsman, Jr., who resigned when he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to China by President Barack Obama in 2009.\u000a\u000a17.

Beecroft \u2014 Currently the U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Beecroft is a career diplomat, having previously served as ambassador to both Iraq and Jordan (Church members Deborah Jones and Matthew Tueller are also influential U.S. ambassadors, currently serving in Libya and Yemen, respectively.)

To help others, Smith shared this tragedy in a heartfelt book entitled "Remembering Garrett, One Family\u2019s Battle with a Child\u2019s Depression." In 2004, President George W. Bush signed the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act, authorizing $82 million for suicide-prevention and awareness programs at colleges.\u000a\u000a20. Glenn Beck \u2014 Prominent conservative television and radio host, founder and host of Mercury Radio Arts, and founder of The Blaze, an independent news and entertainment television network and website.

aVBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Facing a possible 10-year jail term, former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra fled the country ahead of a court verdict her supporters say was politically motivated, a senior member of her party said.\u000a\u000aYingluck's whereabouts were not immediately known Saturday, but local media cited anonymous officials as saying she traveled by land to Cambodia then flew to Dubai to join her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra \u2014 another exiled former premier whose government, like hers, was toppled in a military coup.\u000a\u000aAn official of Yingluck's Pheu Thai party, who is close to the Shinawatra family, told The Associated Press she was no longer in Thailand. The official gave no other details, and declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.\u000a\u000aYingluck, who became Thailand's first female prime minister when her party swept elections in 2011, is accused of negligence in overseeing a money-losing rice subsidy program. She has denied charges as politically motivated.\u000a\u000aA verdict had been expected Friday, as thousands of Yingluck supporters gathered outside the court and thousands of police stood guard. But Yingluck never appeared, and a judge read out a statement saying her lawyers had informed the court she could not attend because of an earache.\u000a\u000aThe judge said the court did not believe the excuse, however, because no official medical verification was provided. He said a warrant would be issued for her arrest and postponed the trial until Sept. 27.\u000a\u000aNorrawit Larlaeng, Yingluck's lawyer, confirmed a warrant had been issued, but said he had no details on her whereabouts. "I was told this morning that she was ill, that she had vertigo, that she felt dizzy, so I requested the postponement ... that's all I have to say."\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the military chief who engineered the 2014 overthrow of Yingluck's government, also said he did not know where she was, and the government was "looking for her."\u000a\u000a"If she's not guilty she should stay and fight the case," Prayuth said. "If she's not here, what does that tell you? Will she still say that she didn't get justice?"\u000a\u000aDefense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said security forces had not allowed Yingluck to leave and are checking possible routes she may have used if she did. He said security officials monitoring Yingluck had not seen her leave her Bangkok home in the last two days.\u000a\u000aThe trial is the latest chapter in a decadelong struggle by the nation's elite minority to crush the powerful political machine founded by Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled in a 2006 coup. Thaksin, who has lived in Dubai since fleeing a corruption conviction he says was politically motivated, has studiously avoided commenting on his sister's case, apparently to avoid imperiling it.\u000a\u000aThaksin is a highly polarizing figure, and his overthrow triggered years of upheaval and division that has pitted a poor, rural majority in the north that supports the Shinawatras against royalists, the military and their urban backers.\u000a\u000aWhen Yingluck's government proposed an amnesty in 2013 that could have absolved her brother and allowed him to return without being arrested, street protests erupted that eventually led to her government's demise in the 2014 coup.\u000a\u000aThe junta that seized control of Thailand has since suppressed dissent and banned political gatherings of more than five people. The long-awaited decision on Yingluck's fate has rekindled tensions in the divided nation, but the military remains firmly in charge.\u000a\u000aFearing potential unrest, authorities tried to deter people from turning out Friday by threatening legal action against anyone planning to help transport Yingluck supporters. Yingluck posted a message on her Facebook page urging followers to stay away, saying she worried about their safety.\u000a\u000a"We're here to give her moral support because she truly cared and helped us out," said Prawit Pongkunnut, a rice farmer from the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima.\u000a\u000aThe rice subsidies, promised to farmers during the 2011 election, helped Yingluck's party ascend to power. Critics say they were effectively a means of vote-buying, while Yingluck supporters welcomed them.\u000a\u000aThe rice subsidy plan Yingluck oversaw paid farmers about 50 percent more that they would have made on the world market. The hope was to drive up prices by stockpiling the grain, but other Asian producers filled the void instead, knocking Thailand from its perch as the world's leading rice exporter.\u000a\u000aThe current government, which is still trying to sell off the rice stockpiles, says Yingluck's administration lost as much as $17 billion because it couldn't export at a price commensurate with what it had paid farmers. If convicted, Yingluck has the right to appeal.\u000a\u000aIn a separate administrative ruling that froze her bank accounts, Yingluck was held responsible for about $1 billion of those losses \u2014 an astounding personal penalty that prosecutors argued Yingluck deserved because she ignored warnings of corruption but continued the program anyway.\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the Supreme Court handed down several other verdicts. Boonsong Teriyapirom, a former commerce minister in Yingluck's administration, was sentenced to 42 years in prison for helping secure a fraudulent rice contract. His deputy, Poom Sarapol, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for his role in the case.\u000a\u000aIn Washington, the U.S. State Department declined to comment, saying the court process and verdicts were internal matters for Thailand.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press journalists Jerry Harmer, Grant Peck and Kankanit Wiriyasajja contributed to this report.

aVIconic comedian Jerry Lewis was remembered Sunday not only as a legendary performer, but also for raising billions of dollars for the Muscular Dystrophy Association during his decades as the host of the organization\u2019s annual Labor Day telethon.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Muscular Dystrophy Association is deeply saddened by the death of beloved comedian, performer, humanitarian and former MDA telethon star and national chairman Jerry Lewis,\u201d R. Rodney Howell, the organization\u2019s chairman of the board said Sunday, in a statement.\u000a\u000a"The MDA would not be the organization it is today if it were not for Jerry\u2019s tireless efforts on behalf of \u201chis kids,\u201d Howell added.\u000a\u000aOver his 45 years as host of the annual Labor Day telethon, Lewis raised over $2 billion in dollars for research aimed at finding new treatments or even a cure for muscular dystrophy, the MDA has said.\u000a\u000aIn 2009, he was awarded the prestigious "Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award," which is given periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for his work on behalf of the MDA.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor most of my life I thought that doing good for someone didn\u2019t mean you would receive commendation for that act of kindness,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAt least until now,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aLewis didn\u2019t just raise money for the MDA, he also raised awareness of the disease, Howell said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough we will miss him beyond measure, we suspect that somewhere in heaven, he\u2019s already urging the angels to give \u2018just one dollar more for my kids,' " said Howell, in the MDA\u2019s statement.\u000a\u000aThe MDA went on to note that, during Lewis' lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases, developed treatments, therapies, and standards of care that have allowed many living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger.\u000a\u000aOne notable turning point in understanding neuromuscular disease came in 1986 when Dr. Louis Kunkel, Ph.D., discovered the genetic defect that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Kunkel is a longtime MDA research grantee whose achievement, said Lewis, \u201cwas staggering.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo see this breakthrough tells me that indeed in my lifetime, I\u2019m going to see \u2018my kids\u2019 better than they are today,\u201d Lewis said at a press conference during the announcement of the discovery.\u000a\u000aIn September 2016, the Food and Drug Administraiton approved the first-ever drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. MDA has funded more than $1 billion in neuromuscular disease research since 1950, with three drugs approved in the last year, for Duchenne MD and spinal muscular dystrophy (SMA), spotlighting the organization's research program and the impact Lewis has had on MD research.

aVRam Rahim Singh's rape conviction set off a mob rampage in India Friday that left 28 people dead and more than 250 others injured after a court declared the quasi-religious sect leader guilty.\u000a\u000aMobs set fire to government buildings and attacked police and TV journalists in the town of Panchkula in Haryana state, smashing the windshields of news vans and breaking broadcast equipment.\u000a\u000aPolice initially used tear gas and water cannons and then fired bullets in the air in an attempt to control the surging mobs as they vandalized bus stations and government vehicles.\u000a\u000a"The situation is tense. There has been arson and burning," Rajiv Mehrishi, the federal home secretary, said late Friday.\u000a\u000aThe violence left at least 28 dead, including some with bullet wounds, and more than 250 injured, according to B.S. Sandhu, a top Haryana police official.\u000a\u000aHe said more than 1,000 of the guru's supporters had been detained in Panchkula on charges of arson and destruction of public property.\u000a\u000aThe special court announced the guilty verdict on Friday after hearing closing arguments in the 15-year-old case against the guru, who calls himself Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insaan.\u000a\u000aThe guru, who had denied the charges of raping two women at his ashram in 2002, was flown by helicopter to a jail in the nearby town of Rohtak because district officials feared they would be overrun by his supporters. His sentencing is to be held Aug. 28, prosecutor H.P.S. Verma said.\u000a\u000aTens of thousands of followers had camped overnight awaiting the verdict.\u000a\u000aViolence also broke out elsewhere in Haryana and the neighboring state of Punjab, as well as in the capital, New Delhi, police said. Railway stations in the towns of Malout and Balluana were ablaze, and two coaches of an empty train parked in New Delhi's Anand Vihar station were set on fire.\u000a\u000aA curfew was imposed in at least four districts of Punjab, said Amrinder Singh, the state's chief minister.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for the guru's sect, Dera Sacha Sauda, urged his supporters to remain calm.\u000a\u000a"I just want to request everyone to maintain peace at the moment," said Dilawar Insan. "We will explore what legal options are available to us."\u000a\u000aThe sect claims to have about 50 million followers and campaigns for vegetarianism and against drug addiction.

aVBill O'Reilly tells Newsmax TV that the raging debate over Confederate statues is a symptom of a much deeper problem \u2014 the U.S. is in the throes of a "social civil war" and the aggressors are "far-left extremists" who want to tear down much more than just monuments.\u000a\u000aThey want to destroy the entire legacy of the U.S., the former Fox News host told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

They're the far left, the extremists who believe that the United States from the jump was an evil country," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"They believe that the whole system . . . was designed to keep white men in power and prosperity at the expense of minorities.\u000a\u000a"So to them, destroying all of our legacy, all of it, and rebuilding it in this socialistic, far-left vision is what is necessary," O'Reilly said. "This is how bad this is. So this movement, it's not many Americans, but they're given a pass by the media."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly said there's one defense available to most Americans who want to push back \u2014 "know our history."\u000a\u000aThe timing of O'Reilly's latest "Killing" series book \u2014 "Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence" \u2014 couldn't be more poignant.\u000a\u000aThere's a debate to be had in this country about statues, and O'Reilly said removals of some should be a "case-by-case."\u000a\u000aBut this notion put forth by the far left of tearing them all down should be alarming to the "vast majority of Americans do not want their statues and monuments defaced."\u000a\u000a"The truth is always, when you're dealing with flawed human beings, good and bad. And that's what we're dealing with today in this country," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"But Americans don't know how brutal this eight-year war was. And the savagery that it took to get our freedoms that we are right now exercising and it wasn't pretty," O'Reilly said. "And if you're going to go back and start to demonize, as the far left wants to do, of people who were directly involved in getting us the freedom that we enjoy today, I'm going to come after you."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly said he's in favor of removing the statue of confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, founder of the KKK, in New Orleans, but said monuments of Robert E. Lee should remain.\u000a\u000aForrest "started the Ku Klux Klan after the war and the Klan did a lot of damage and does a lot of damage to this country. Should that statue be up there? And I say no," O'Reilly said. "That's a legitimate, absolutely a strong argument that that guy should not be honored with anything. You want that statue, you put it in a museum and then you tell a story about Nathan Bedford Forrest.\u000a\u000a"But Robert E. Lee is a whole different story," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"Yes, Lee fought for a system that wanted slavery. No question. Yes, Lee committed treason against his own country because he put his state, Virginia, over the union," O'Reilly said. "So Lee is not a hero, per-se, in my opinion.\u000a\u000a"However, he was involved after the war in healing the nation, bringing the nation together as [Abraham] Lincoln wanted. He was deeply involved with that and on the battlefield he was an honorable man. So are we going to wipe out Robert E. Lee's message? That's just stupid," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aPoint is, O'Reilly said, educated discussions are the only way to push back against extremism in our own country.\u000a\u000a"The pressure is going to get worse unless the majority of Americans start to push back. But the only way you can push back is if you really know our history," O'Reilly said. "The American people are struggling to put forth their side of the debate which is why I wrote 'Killing England.'\u000a\u000a"So you know exactly what Washington did right and wrong and then you can make a determination of the totality of the man. The same thing with [Thomas] Jefferson and [Benjmain] Franklin," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"So it becomes very important for individual Americans to stand up and say 'you know what in my town you're not going to do this fascist stuff. You're not going to knock down all this stuff.' This is what ISIS does. We're not going to do that here," O'Reilly said.

aVOne Confederate flag-maker's sales have surged amid heightened controversy in the wake of violent rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aAlabama Flag and Banner in Huntsville, which may be the only remaining U.S. manufacturer of the Confederate flag, attributed the rise in sales to the ongoing debates regarding the removal of the Confederate monuments across the country, CBS News reported.\u000a\u000a"What's really pushing sales is removal of the monuments," store owner Belinda Kennedy, told the network. "The general feeling I get from customers that call and email is that they are just pushing back at people who are trying to revise our history."\u000a\u000aShe added that, as long as the topic remained in the news, demand would continue.\u000a\u000aSales had increased so dramatically this past week that customers of Alabama Flag and Banner had a two- to three-week wait time for Confederate flags, read a notice on the store's website.\u000a\u000a"We are shipping them as fast as we can make them and in the order in which they are received. We greatly appreciate your devoted support and business!" the notice said.\u000a\u000aMajor U.S. flag-makers stopped producing Confederate flags in 2015, Kennedy said.\u000a\u000a"After the church shooting (in 2015), Amazon and Walmart stopped selling (the flag) and people were afraid they wouldn't be able to buy it," she told AL.com.\u000a\u000a"And then you started seeing streets renamed, schools being renamed, mountains being renamed. And then people started getting angry and then there's another surge (in sales)."\u000a\u000aSince then, Alabama Flag and Banner has sold between 600 and 800 Confederate flags a year, up from a handful of orders per year.\u000a\u000a"Everybody's got a different reason (for buying)," Kennedy said, according to AL.com. "By and large, I think people are afraid they may not be able to get it one day."

aVThe media is reporting that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving forward with the requirement that cigarette companies reduce the amount of nicotine in their products. This is based on the premise that nicotine is the addictive factor in cigarette smoking.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why nicotine patches and e-cigarettes are proposed as aids for people to stop smoking.\u000a\u000aI believe the source of the addiction is not nicotine, but the carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke. If you measure the carbon monoxide level of smokers, you will see that it is higher than normal. And when they quit it usually returns to normal.\u000a\u000aMost smokers say that they smoke to relax or when they are under stress. Nicotine is a stimulant. Therefore, it is not a likely the factor in cigarette addiction.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, elevated carbon monoxide can relieve stress and anxiety.\u000a\u000aMost smokers will tell you that when they stop, the third day is when they most want to smoke. This fits the idea of carbon monoxide addiction because at standard atmospheric pressure, it takes three days to clear the body of excess carbon monoxide.\u000a\u000aI have used hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to help patients quit smoking. It works because one treatment at 2.0 ATA for one hour will bring carbon monoxide level down to the normal range.\u000a\u000aThe people that I have treated with HBOT to assist in their stopping of cigarette smoking found that after coming out of the treatment they have no more yearnings for the cigarettes.\u000a\u000aIt should also be noted that carbon monoxide poisoning is a proven indication for HBOT, and therefore should be reimbursable under insurance coverage.\u000a\u000aI suggest that if you are going to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy as part of a smoking cessation program, take a blood sample and have it evaluated for carbon monoxide levels before and after the hyperbaric oxygen therapy so that you can have something that objectively documents the value of HBOT.

aVThe virus seems to be approaching its breakout phase. We could be looking at a full-scale epidemic here.\u000a\u000aZika? Ebola? Flu?\u000a\u000aNope. We don't have a great word for this sickness yet. "Iconoclasm" \u2014 i.e., the destruction of images and monuments that offend this mob or that \u2014 comes close, but the toppling of statues is just one acute symptom of the fever.\u000a\u000aIndeed, the fight over Confederate statues is just a discrete and more understandable eruption of the larger trend. This stuff has been happening for decades. One of the first outbreaks involved the word "crusader." The term hurt the feelings of people who didn't know what they didn't know. Left-wing historians (and the Islamists who love them) convinced themselves that the Crusades were a trial run of Western imperialism and colonialism. They were, in fact, largely defensive wars intended to beat back the aggression of Muslim colonizers. Even the organization Campus Crusade for Christ changed its name to "Cru" lest people get the wrong impression.\u000a\u000aSports teams \u2014 most famously the Washington, D.C., NFL Franchise That Dare Not Speak Its Name \u2014 have been under increasing pressure to drop any association with Native Americans. Columbus Day is outre. And statues of Christopher Columbus may be heading to the pyre, if recent developments in New York City are any indication.\u000a\u000aMy National Review colleague Kyle Smith reports that Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered a 90-day review of "all statues and monuments that in any way may suggest hate or division or racism, anti-Semitism \u2014 any kind of message that is against the values of New York City." Translation: de Blasio wants a carefully composed list of stuff to tear down.\u000a\u000aOrderliness is the one concession de Blasio's brand of progressivism demands of the mob.\u000a\u000aBut fear not, de Blasio has made it clear that the iconic statue of Christopher Columbus in New York's Columbus Circle is "obviously . . . one of the ones that will get very immediate attention because of the tremendous concerns about it." What's next, Smith wonders \u2014 Columbia University? The District of Columbia?\u000a\u000aIn New York, the drive to purge Columbus from the historical memory (save as a pioneer of imperialism, racism and genocide) is gaining newfound momentum.\u000a\u000a"There obviously has been ongoing dialogue and debate in the Caribbean \u2014 particularly in Puerto Rico, where I'm from \u2014 about this same conversation that there should be no monument or statue of Christopher Columbus based on what he signifies to the native population . . . [the] oppression and everything that he brought with him," Melissa Mark-Viverito, the speaker of the New York City Council, said this week.\u000a\u000aI wonder what Colombians think about all this.\u000a\u000aWhat fascinates me about this civilizational auto-immune disorder is how superficial it is. Mark-Viverito is from Puerto Rico. More than 95 percent of the people there speak Spanish. The dominant religion of Puerto Rico is Catholicism (85 percent). As far as I can tell, Mark-Viverito, who is of mixed European ancestry (her mother, Elizabeth Viverito, was of Italian descent and a prominent Puerto Rican feminist; her father, Anthony Mark, was a prominent doctor), does not speak Taino, the native language of the Arawak tribes who inhabited Puerto Rico when Columbus arrived. Rather, she speaks the languages of her alleged oppressors \u2014 Spanish and, of course, English. She even attended Columbia University. I could find no mention on the Internet that she has burned her diploma in protest.\u000a\u000aMy point is not that the world ushered in by Christopher Columbus has been very good to Mark-Viverito, though it obviously has. It is that toppling some statues or even incanting some nonsense about "cultural appropriation" cannot separate the iconoclasts from the culture they live in. The mobs of students \u2014 and their enabling professors and administrators \u2014 renaming buildings and bowdlerizing the language are still products of Western civilization. Even the poseurs who think Googling a few phrases from Karl Marx and wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt make them anti-colonialists are disciples of Western thinkers. Where does Mark-Viverito think her mother's feminism came from? The Arawaks?\u000a\u000aFor centuries, to the extent that educated Muslims talked about the Crusades at all, it was to boast about how they emerged victorious from them. But Osama bin Laden and his ilk read too much Noam Chomsky and caught the Western disease of victimization and resentment.\u000a\u000aThat is the plague sweeping the land now. And tearing down some statues and renaming some streets isn't a cure, it's a symptom.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJonah Goldberg is a syndicated columnist and author.

aVHurricane Harvey moved slowly but powerfully across Texas on Saturday, downgraded to a Category 1 storm, but only after hammering the coast with life-threatening winds and the prospect of catastrophic flooding.\u000a\u000aThe hurricane, initially a Category 4 and the most powerful storm in over a decade to hit the mainland United States, made a first landfall northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, late on Friday with maximum winds of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour).\u000a\u000aIn a sign of its lumbering movement, it then made a second landfall nearby three hours later.\u000a\u000aHarvey was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane by the National Hurricane Center early on Saturday as it moved slowly over parts of Texas at about 6 mph (10 km per hour).\u000a\u000aThe storm was expected to meander across the coast and up through Louisiana for days, with forecasts for storm surges of up to 13 feet (4 metres) and over 3 feet (90 cm) of rain.\u000a\u000aNearly 10 inches of rain had already fallen in a few areas in southeastern Texas, the center said.\u000a\u000aThe town of Rockport appeared to be one of the hardest hit by Harvey's punch, hours after the mayor told anyone staying to write their names on their arms for identification in case of death or injury.\u000a\u000aA high school, hotel, senior housing complex and other buildings suffered structural damage, according to emergency officials and local media. Some were being used as shelters.\u000a\u000a"Right now we're still hunkered down and can't go anywhere," said Steve Sims, the volunteer fire chief in Rockport. "We've heard rumors of 1,000 different things, we can't confirm anything because we haven't seen anything. We know we've got a lot of problems, but we don't know what yet."\u000a\u000aSims said power, internet and most cell phone service was out in the town of 10,000 where about two-thirds of people evacuated. Most of the senior citizens and nursing homes were among the first to be evacuated, he said.\u000a\u000aAs many as 6 million people were believed to be in Harvey's path, as is the heart of America's oil refining operations. The storm's impact on refineries has already pushed up gasoline prices while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifted some rules on gasoline to reduce shortages.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump, facing the first large-scale natural disaster of his presidency, said on Twitter he signed a disaster proclamation which "unleashes the full force of government help" shortly before Harvey made landfall.\u000a\u000aIn the early hours of the morning Saturday, Trump took to Twitter announcing to the people of Texas that "America is with you" as Harvey maked landfall:\u000a\u000aWe will remain fully engaged w/ open lines of communication as #HurricaneHarvey makes landfall. America is w/ you! @GovAbbott @FEMA @DHSgov pic.twitter.com/PryIqRxgLr \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017\u000a\u000aFueled by the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, Harvey became the first Category 4 hurricane to wallop the United States since Charley in 2004 and the first to hit Texas since Carla in 1961.\u000a\u000a"In the dark, internet out, ham radio not working. Is anybody out there? Alone trying not to be scared," Donna McClure in Corpus Christi said on Twitter as the storm made landfall.\u000a\u000aERCOT, which operates most of the power grid for Texas, said power outages from Hurricane Harvey topped 200,000 by 3 a.m. local time on Saturday. AEP said approximately 162,000 of its customers were without power, while CenterPoint Energy reported 22,874 without lights.\u000a\u000aAs winds from the storm began to gust in Victoria, a downed powerline sparked a house fire, said the county sheriff's office. The mayor estimated some 65 percent of the town\u2019s 65,000 residents defied the mandatory evacuation order.\u000a\u000aWhile thousands fled the expected devastating flooding and destruction, many residents stayed put in imperiled towns and stocked up on food, fuel and sandbags, drawing the ire of authorities.\u000a\u000aHOUSTON PREPARES FOR FLOODS\u000a\u000aAs a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Harvey was the first major hurricane of Category 3 or more to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.\u000a\u000aIts size and strength also dredged up memories of Katrina, the 2005 hurricane that made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. About 1,800 died in the disaster made worse by a slow government emergency response.\u000a\u000aCorpus Christi, a city of 320,000, was under voluntary evacuation for Harvey.\u000a\u000aAt least three cruise ships operated by Carnival Corp with thousands of passengers aboard were forced to change their plans to sail for the Port of Galveston.\u000a\u000aTwo of them headed New Orleans to pick up fresh supplies, while the third delayed its departure from Cozumel, Mexico.\u000a\u000aLouisiana and Texas declared states of disaster, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare.\u000a\u000aThe NHC's latest tracking model shows the storm sitting southwest of Houston for more than a day, giving the nation's fourth most populous city a double dose of rain and wind.\u000a\u000aThe city warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches (60 cm) of rain over several days.\u000a\u000aGASOLINE PRICES SPIKE\u000a\u000aGasoline stations on the south Texas coast were running out of fuel residents fled the region. U.S. gasoline prices spiked as the storm shut down 22 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production, according to the U.S. government.\u000a\u000aMore than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and others have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms.\u000a\u000aConcern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to their highest in four months, before profit taking pulled back prices. Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline margins hit their strongest levels in five years for this time of year.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government said it would make emergency stockpiles of crude available if needed to plug disruptions. It has regularly used them to dampen the impact of previous storms on energy supplies.

Instead, as with dozens of other addiction treatment centers in Florida, the owner was more interested in defrauding insurance companies by keeping his patients hooked, her family says.\u000a\u000a"It looked fine. They were saying all the right things to me. I could not help my child so I trusted them to help my child," Holley said.\u000a\u000aInstead, the center refused to give 19-year-old Jaime Holley her prescription medicine when she left, forcing her to use illegal drugs to avoid acute withdrawal symptoms, her mother said. She died of a heroin overdose last November. "Right to my face they lied to me, and I believed them."\u000a\u000aRather than working to get people well, a growing number of unscrupulous industry players are focusing on getting patients to relapse so that insurance dollars keep rolling in, according to law enforcement officials, treatment experts and people trying to beat their addictions.\u000a\u000a"It's terrible right now. I don't know of any business that wants to kill its customers, but this one does," said Timothy Schnellenberger, who has worked for years in running addiction recovery centers in Florida. "It really breaks my heart. Kids are dying left and right."\u000a\u000aReflections and Journey - both centers owned by Kenneth Chatman - are shuttered now, and Chatman is serving a 27-year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to health care fraud and money laundering, but that's little comfort to Holley, who described her daughter's ordeal in an interview.\u000a\u000a"I couldn't fix it. And as a parent, I wanted to fix it," she said, trying to contain her tears as she looked through her daughter's pictures and Mother's Day cards.\u000a\u000aAs drug addiction destroys families across America, "there's a need for a positive, vibrant recovery network to help people get off of opioids," said State Attorney Dave Aronberg, chief prosecutor in Palm Beach County. "You can't just arrest your way out of this problem."\u000a\u000aBut lately, sunny South Florida has become the focal point of rampant insurance fraud that relies on a lethal cycle of intentional failure, authorities say.\u000a\u000a"The incentive is to keep them in this relapse system, this gravy train that doesn't end until the person leaves in a body bag or an ambulance," said Aronberg, whose opioid task force has made more than 30 fraud arrests. "There's no money in sobriety."\u000a\u000aOvercoming substance abuse generally involves a treatment center, where urine tests are done, prescriptions dispensed and recovery group meetings held, and a "sober home," where people recovering from addictions live together to get group support.\u000a\u000aIt's a $1 billion business in Palm Beach County alone, federal officials say.\u000a\u000aFlorida has the most sober homes per capita of any state, said David Sheridan, President of the National Alliance for Recovery Residences. Opioid treatment fraud has surfaced in California and Arizona, but Florida stands out, in part because so many people come for treatment.\u000a\u000aTwo people overdose on opioids every day in Palm Beach County, mainly from heroin laced with the synthetic drug fentanyl, investigators say. Statewide, deaths from this combination rose 75 percent in 2015 as more than 2,500 people died in Florida from opioid-related overdoses, according to the state medical examiner.\u000a\u000aOne operation alone - the Real Life Recovery Delray treatment center and the Halfway There Florida home - collected almost $19 million by fraudulently billing insurance companies for $58 million over four years, according to the FBI. That case has not yet gone to trial.\u000a\u000aThe FBI affidavit said the fraud included unnecessary or faked urinalysis samples, double-billing, and paying kickbacks to patients in the form of gift cards, trips to casinos and strip clubs, and free airline tickets. Other tactics included paying "patient brokers" to illegally direct addicts to particular facilities.\u000a\u000aChatman's patients were given drugs to trigger a positive drug test so they could be considered in "relapse" when their insurance coverage was about to expire. Court documents say he induced some female patients into prostitution for free rent at his sober home, and confiscated car keys, cellphones and prescription medications.\u000a\u000a"They don't care if you die. They just want to keep swiping that insurance card so they can keep getting money out of you," said Blake Oppenheimer of Louisville, Kentucky, who was ordered into treatment, and landed in a center that was shut down for fraud. "I felt like I was something in a store that was just trying to be sold over and over again."\u000a\u000aFraudulent operators are exploiting a web of state and federal laws that make oversight difficult. People being treated for addictions are protected by the Americans With Disabilities Act and health privacy laws. With children up to age 26 now covered under their parents' insurance, there's more money to be made.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Legislature has imposed tougher penalties for patient brokering and new limits on deceptive marketing techniques. Delray Beach and Boynton Beach approved new rules for group homes, requiring them to be accredited by a regulatory organization such as the Florida Association of Recovery Residences.\u000a\u000aOppenheimer, 23, is now at Schnellenberger's Recovery Boot Camp, and hopes someday to return to college to study neuroscience.\u000a\u000a"This is like the last house on the block for me," he said. "This is my last opportunity, and I've got to use it."

aVThe lens is a transparent structure in the front of the eye that focuses an image on the retina, which is the light-sensitive region in the back of the eye.\u000a\u000aLight that passes through the lens to the retina is changed into nerve signals that are transmitted to the brain.\u000a\u000aA cataract is cloudiness on the lens, which blurs visual images. By age 80, more than 50 percent of adults either have cataracts or have had surgery to remove them. The most common symptoms include:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Blurred vision\u000a\u000a\u2022 Faded colors\u000a\u000a\u2022 Poor night vision, including glares\u000a\u000a\u2022 Double vision\u000a\u000a\u2022 Frequent prescription changes for glasses or contact lenses\u000a\u000aCataracts can develop in one or both eyes, and can form after surgery for other eye problems, or as a result of trauma or radiation damage to the eye.\u000a\u000aMost cataracts are caused by clumping of proteins that reduce the amount of light that reaches the retina.\u000a\u000aIf a cataract is small, only part of the lens is affected; the patient may not notice visual changes.\u000a\u000aBut cataracts tend to grow over time, gradually dulling and blurring vision. In advanced stages of the condition, the lens becomes discolored.\u000a\u000aIn addition to age, risk factors include diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, and prolonged sunlight exposure.\u000a\u000aPeople can lower their risk for developing cataracts by wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to protect the eyes from ultraviolet rays.\u000a\u000aQuitting smoking and consuming a diet rich in antioxidant fruits and vegetables may also reduce risk.\u000a\u000aYour doctor can detect cataracts with a dilated eye exam. If the condition is mild, new glasses, brighter lighting, and anti-glare sunglasses can help to reduce the symptoms.\u000a\u000aIf impaired vision interferes with everyday activities, surgery may be required to remove the clouded lens or lenses, which can be replaced with artificial lenses.\u000a\u000aApproximately 90 percent of patients who undergo cataract surgery enjoy better vision afterward.

"He lost that battle. Protectionism is his big thing.\u000a\u000a"Wall Street rallied on the news that Bannon was out. And this strengthens the hand of probably people like Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, who are both more free-traders and \u2014 of course \u2014 who want to get the tax cuts done.\u000a\u000a"So, on the whole, for the business community and the economy, probably Bannon's departure is a plus," Kudlow said.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"From that standpoint, this was railroaded all the way through.\u000a\u000a"When you talk about a justice system that was so negligent, the Obama administration set up Joe Arpaio on day one \u2014 and that's hardly an application of the rule of law.\u000a\u000a"When you politicize the law, forbid the individual from a jury trial, you have got a big problem in the efficacy in regards to the rule of law \u2014 the way it is applied."\u000a\u000aBiggs said in a statement that President Trump "brought justice to a situation where the Obama administration had attempted to destroy a political opponent.\u000a\u000a"Sheriff Joe Arpaio made many enemies in the judicial system, the media, and the left because he enforced laws that the federal government ignored," the first-term Biggs said.\u000a\u000a"He did right by the law \u2014 even as the political consequences continued to mount.\u000a\u000a"America owes Sheriff Arpaio a debt of gratitude and not the injustice of a political witch hunt.

aVOn August 16, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued aupholding Arkansas\u2019 decision to deny public Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The court reasoned that the federal Medicaid statute did not confer on the abortion provider a statutory right to access state funding.\u000a\u000aThe 8th Circuit decision was a break from a string of contrary holdings by other circuit courts that suggested the Medicaid law allowed an individual to choose a provider and sue the state if it would not work with that provider.\u000a\u000aThe backdrop for this series of cases are video disclosures that Planned Parenthood employees appeared to be engaging in the sale of body parts obtained through abortions. To these have been added additional videotaped conversations with executives of Planned Parenthood speaking in callous and shocking ways about a callous and shocking business they are engaged in, including, apparently, trafficking body parts obtained through abortions of unborn children.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of the initial disclosures, a number of states acted to end their contractual relationships with Planned Parenthood. Utah\u2019s governor, for instance, ordered state agencies to end the practice of funneling federal grants to Planned Parenthood\u2019s Utah affiliate by declining to renew four contracts with the group. The states involved in the lawsuits referenced above took similar actions.\u000a\u000aThis, of course, led to litigation, most of which has gone Planned Parenthood\u2019s way. In fact, Utah\u2019s Planned Parenthood claimed that the state had violated the federal constitution when it declined to continue its contracts with them. The trial court rejected this argument, but a panel of judges on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to take it seriously and the state gave up its fight.\u000a\u000aThe split between the circuits, caused by the Eighth Circuit ruling, about what federal law requires may lead to a U.S. Supreme Court case that would resolve the differing interpretations. That, in turn, should lead to a serious conversation about the underlying assumption Planned Parenthood has been acting on \u2014 that it has a right under federal law or the U.S. Constitution \u2014 to access taxpayer funding.\u000a\u000aSurely there cannot be a constitutional right of a vendor to get the government\u2019s business. If there is a statutory right, which is doubtful, should there be one? Such a right would require a state to implicitly approve of activities that it is likely the overwhelming majority of citizens of the state find shocking and reprehensible.\u000a\u000aWith these disclosures in the background, sending a check to Planned Parenthood would be understood as either approval of the behavior of the employees in the videos or at least a belief that it was not bad enough to justify distancing themselves from it. Conversely, an announcement that a person would no longer donate because of the videos would be understood as an expression of disapproval. Why should one kind of opinion, approval or nonchalance, be favored in the law over the expression of the other, disapproval or repugnance.\u000a\u000aIt is not, as Planned Parenthood would have it, that the answer should turn on whether the videos showed a legal violation. If, somehow, the kinds of things disclosed in the videos were legal, that would not make them any less horrifying to many citizens and the ability of these people to express their disapproval through their elected representatives is a right that needs protection.\u000a\u000aMany states have decided that they no longer want to do business with an organization tainted by these practices. A traffic in body parts of unborn children, or callous talk about taking an unborn life, are fundamentally at odds with basic standards of human decency. These states were right to try to keep themselves untainted by association with a group implicated in such practices.\u000a\u000aThat is a decision consistent with the constitution and with basic moral sanity. That this fact has not been more widely recognized is an ominous sign.\u000a\u000aBill Duncan is director of the Center for Family and Society at Sutherland Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah.

aVThe people arguing against removing statues to Confederate leaders insist "We\u2019re just defending history," adding, "We\u2019re just preserving the memory of the Civil War."\u000a\u000aHogwash. Do those defending the statues believe we\u2019re in any danger of forgetting about the Civil War? And does anyone think a statue of Robert E. Lee in the town square is all that keeps us from total amnesia about the bloodiest chapter in American history, one that divides us to the present day? The clear answer to both questions is "no."\u000a\u000aHiding behind defending history is a poor cover for wanting to continue to lionize Confederate icons. Those rallying in defense of the statues should stop lying to themselves and to everyone else.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s start with the obvious \u2014 America is in no danger of forgetting about the Civil War. Roughly 50,000 books have been written on the subject. More books have been written about the Civil War than any event in American history. Virtually every college in the nation has a course on the Civil War and it\u2019s part of almost every public high school\u2019s history curriculum.\u000a\u000a1.2 million people visit the Gettysburg battlefield alone each year, not to mention the roughly 130 other preserved battlefields. Americans even do Civil War reenactments. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of people watch them every year. These are not people who are going to forget the war.\u000a\u000aAnd what of the monuments serving as a reminder that many people still revere the Confederacy and its generals and leaders? As the events in Charlottesville proved, we\u2019re in no danger of forgetting that, either. The Confederate Battle Flag was on full display among the white nationalists and neo Nazis who brought so much discord. Indeed, the given reason for the "Unite the Right" protest was the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\u000a\u000aSo if these statues aren\u2019t all that\u2019s keeping us from forgetting our history, do they at least remind us of some aspect of the Civil War that we would otherwise not consider? Again, the answer is "no." Whether or not General Lee was a tactical genius or a flawed leader is already one of the most hotly debated topics in military history.\u000a\u000aThose interested in the military tactics and underlying forces determining the war\u2019s outcome are already deeply familiar with the strategies of Stonewall Jackson, P.G.T. Beauregard, and Jefferson Davis. Those who want to learn more can read one of the thousands of books about these men. No statue is required.\u000a\u000aThose defending the statues should admit what they are \u2014 attempts to make Confederate soldiers and leaders into heroes. Their plaques honor the "patriotism, valor, and devotion to duty" of the men who fought for the Confederacy. The statues show General Lee riding valiantly on his famous war horse "Traveler."\u000a\u000aThey show Jefferson Davis boldly standing and speaking. They don\u2019t show, for instance, General Lee looking over a map and deciding over the advice of his aides and simple common sense to demand the ill-fated and ultimately decisive Pickett\u2019s Charge, arguably the greatest blunder of the Civil War.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s no secret why those against removing the Confederate statues argue they\u2019re just "preserving history." The alternative explanation for what they are doing is morally indefensible. They want to make sure that Confederate leaders \u2014 men who fought to preserve slavery, men who picked a fight that lead to 600,000 deaths, men who were unapologetically racist \u2014 remain revered.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, I don\u2019t believe Confederate leaders deserve such respect. But those who do should stop hiding behind the lie that they\u2019re preserving history. They\u2019re not. Let\u2019s have the real debate about the Confederate statues, not the phony one they\u2019d rather have. To the statues\u2019 defenders, I say argue what you actually believe or else let those statues come down.\u000a\u000aNeal Urwitz is the Director of External Relations at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a defense and national security think tank in Washington, D.C.

Some of Bannon's ideas, such as a travel ban for people from countries with a terror presence and a push to withdraw the United States from NAFTA, have fallen short.\u000a\u000aThe Economist noted that Trump eventually began to rely on input from other aides, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, which seemed to diminish Bannon's role.\u000a\u000aBannon told the news outlet, however, that Breitbart will continue to support Trump.\u000a\u000a"I am an ideologue, that's why I am out," he said.

aVThere is surely no greater sign of the bankruptcy of American foreign policy than its Afghanistan policy. After 15 years of war and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops, a new president entered the Oval Office poised to fundamentally change that policy. Within months he presented, with great fanfare, a continuation of the same. The result: The United States is now firmly locked into its forever war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPresident Trump's policy differs from the one he inherited only in the addition of 4,000 more troops. Trump vows to eschew nation-building, emphasize counterterrorism, end corruption in Afghanistan, and hold Pakistan accountable. President Obama promised all the same things. "It is time to focus on nation-building here at home," Obama said in 2011, explaining his shift in approach from President George W. Bush's strategy.\u000a\u000aTrump's remarks on Pakistan were seen by many as a strong break from the previous administration, but people appear to have forgotten the unusually blunt testimony that Adm. Mike Mullen, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to Congress in 2011. He called the Haqqani network, one of the most dangerous terrorist groups in Afghanistan, "a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency." That same year, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-CIA Director David Petraeus both went to Pakistan to, in Clinton's words, "push the Pakistanis very hard" to end their support for the Haqqanis. The pressure was one in a series of actions that outraged the Pakistanis, causing them to shut down supply routes to American-led forces in Afghanistan for seven months.\u000a\u000aIn expressing support for Trump's open-ended commitment, House Speaker Paul Ryan used the tired old saying that the U.S. has the watches, but the Taliban has the time. "If they believe that we have some end date, some timetable, then they will wait us out," he said. But this fundamentally misunderstands the nature of this type of overseas struggle. The Taliban will wait us out for a very simple reason. They live there.\u000a\u000aHarry Summers, a wise army officer in the Vietnam War who went on to write a definitive book on that conflict's military lessons, opened the book by recounting an exchange he had with a North Vietnamese officer in 1975, just before Saigon fell. "You know you never defeated us on the battlefield," Summers said. The officer replied, "That may be so, but it is also irrelevant." Every local force knows one thing in its bones: Eventually, the foreigners have to go home.\u000a\u000aWhy are the Taliban gaining ground in Afghanistan? I asked The New Yorker's Dexter Filkins, one of the keenest observers of that war. "Ordinary Afghans don't like the Taliban. But they dislike the Afghan government even more. We say we don't want to do nation-building, but you can't build an army without first building a state. People don't die for an army; they die for a country. And who wants to die for the current Afghan government?"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe American military on the ground knows the problem well, which is why they refer to the Afghan government as a collection of corrupt networks that extend across the country. In true military fashion, they even have an acronym for it, VICE \u2014 vertically integrated criminal enterprise.\u000a\u000aA leading expert on Afghanistan policy, Barnett Rubin, who has advised the United Nations and the U.S. government, explains the problem differently. "The Afghan state cannot exist without outside help," he told me. "It cannot pay its bills without the U.S. government. It cannot have a stable society without Pakistan's help. It cannot grow economically without trade and transit with Iran." Referring to reports that Afghanistan is endowed with nearly $1 trillion in mineral resources, he wryly observed, "I'm sure the moon has even more mineral wealth, but you need a way to get it out to markets. And for that you need friendly neighbors." Rubin believes that Trump's approach is doomed because it seems willfully oblivious to the interests of the other powers in the region, especially Russia, China and Iran.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Trump administration has doubled down on more of the same. More money, bombs, troops, pressure on Pakistan and tough love for the Afghans. It is a tactical approach, designed by generals, to ensure that they do not lose. But it does not even pretend to contain a strategy to win. In other words, half a century later, at a lower human cost, the United States has replicated its strategy in Vietnam. Call it quagmire-lite.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFareed Zakaria hosts CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS," and makes regular appearances on shows such as ABC's "This Week" and NBC's "Meet The Press."

aVThe arrest Tuesday of one of Russia\u2019s most celebrated theatre directors has sparked fresh speculation that the regime of Vladimir Putin is planning a new round of crackdowns on his opponents.\u000a\u000aFor its part, the White House has so far avoided any public comment on the arrest of Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been likened to such legendary American theatre directors as Harold Prince and the late Mike Nichols.\u000a\u000aWhen Newsmax on Thursday asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders for a comment about the arrest, she would only say, \u201cI certainly can\u2019t make an official statement at this time, but I will circle back with you.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Russia, demonstrations against the arrest began last week and there are growing charges of a new Putin offensive against critics within the Russian arts community.\u000a\u000aMikhail Khodorkovsky, formerly a prisoner in Russia and now head of the Open Russia opposition group, told Newsmax, \u201cThe persecution of the famous theatre director Kirill Serebrennikov is another attempt to divert public attention away from real corruptionists among the Putin's circle, as well as to demonstrate to the cultural elite its vulnerability ahead of the elections.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf the mounting protests, Khodorkovsky said \u201cthe reaction of the society shows its unwillingness to accept the official position. However, the [opposition to Putin] still has no readiness for political mobilization."\u000a\u000aSerebrenikov is director of the Gogol Centre, a popular theatre known for dealing with controversial themes in politics and sex.

aVFree Retirement Calculator: When Can You Retire? \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here to Find Out\u000a\u000aAn Extremely Simple Way to Determine If You're Ready to Retire \u2014\u000a\u000aFind Out Now\u000a\u000aRetiring overseas has many advantages, especially for those who are adventurous, open-minded and looking to live cheaply \u2014 often in stunning vistas.Here are five advantages of retiring overseas.If you've worked all your life and been stuck in one place, moving to an overseas locale can create a renewed sense of adventure and exploration of life, noted International Living . Many seniors say such a change drastically improved their quality of life.Housing and often utilities can cost a fraction of what they might in the United States, International Living noted. Your retirement funds can go a long way, giving some the opportunity to live a much more posh life with house-keepers, drivers and gardeners to tend to the chores. Even property taxes are typically lower in most countries, the website added.The cost of health care is far cheaper. In some countries with socialized medicine, doctors visits can cost about $10, Kiplinger noted . "An office visit in Latin America or Asia will set you back, on average, anywhere from $10 to $40. Dental care is typically one-fifth the cost of the States, as are health plans," Kiplinger said. It added: "Some countries offer public health plans, with prices \u2026 ranging from $50 to $150 a month per person."You can still collect Social Security benefits wherever you live. According to Kiplinger, in 2011, the Social Security Administration mailed benefit checks to 346,000 people living abroad. One caveat, however: "Some countries require you to earn a specific amount of income every month to qualify for residency; in others, owning property is sufficient."Retirees can still take care of their investment accounts online, no matter where the live, using financial transaction technology that makes global living a snap. Kiplinger advised retirees to hold onto a bank account in the United States. "Expats who no longer have a U.S. address could run into bureaucratic difficulties. Some banks have closed expat accounts, citing Patriot Act provisions designed to thwart financing of international terrorists, according to American Citizens Abroad, Kiplinger noted, adding that details on such accounts were available at www.americansabroad.org. The State Department also offers guidelines for retirees living abroad.

That will bring the number of Sears and Kmarts stores closed this year to 358.\u000a\u000a"(L)ater this morning we will be notifying associates at 28 Kmart stores that we will be closing these stores later this year, as we continue to transform our business model so that our physical store footprint and our digital capabilities match the needs and preferences of our members," CEO Eddie Lampert said in a report to shareholders.\u000a\u000aThe company, which will still have about 1,000 stores after the closures, said in a public filing that it believes it has at least another 12 months of cash to continue operating, USA Today reported.\u000a\u000a"We will continue to right-size our store footprint to ensure we are positioned to meet the realities of the changing retail environment,'' Rob Riecker, Sears Holdings' chief financial officer, said in a call with investors.\u000a\u000aSears it is betting on a customer loyalty program, Shop Your Way, to help lead a turnaround.

aVPresident Donald Trump, facing his first major test in coping with a natural disaster, pushed federal emergency officials on Friday to be ready to help Gulf Coast residents as Hurricane Harvey bore down on the region.\u000a\u000aTrump said on Twitter he was following the storm's progress from the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, and the White House said he spoke with the governors of Texas and Louisiana and took briefings from emergency experts.\u000a\u000a"His questions aren't about the geopolitical issues or about large political consequences," Tom Bossert, the White House Homeland Security adviser, told a news conference. "His questions are: 'Are you doing what it takes to help the people that are going to be affected by this storm?'"\u000a\u000aThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which coordinates the response to major disasters, said it had sent more than 96,000 liters of water, 306,000 meals and 4,500 tarps to support bases in Texas and Louisiana with additional supplies being readied in case they are needed.\u000a\u000aMajor storms have posed severe challenges to previous presidents. The flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, which killed well over 1,000 people and wrecked parts of New Orleans in 2005, tainted the remainder of George W. Bush's presidency.\u000a\u000aRepublican Senator Chuck Grassley warned Trump on Friday to do better than that. "Keep on top of Hurricane Harvey dont make same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina," he said in a tweet to the president.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration earlier this year proposed cutting billions of dollars in funding for FEMA, and it has not yet filled key posts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, both of which closely track major weather events and coordinate with other government agencies.\u000a\u000aBut the U.S. Congress has mostly rejected the government's proposed cuts to FEMA's budget, and the agency is led by Brock Long, who has considerable experience in disaster management and was overwhelmingly confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June.\u000a\u000aSome critics said Hurricane Harvey might show the administration the importance of maintaining well-financed emergency response agencies.\u000a\u000a"Maybe this will be a moment where they sober up and realize the real-life human impact of those decisions," said Rachel Cleetus, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science-based advocacy group.

aVBeing libertarian is trendy right now, so much so that many actors, activists, politicians, media personalities, financial gurus, professors, scientists, and authors call themselves libertarians, even when they don\u2019t really qualify philosophically and fundamentally.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list, our editors defined a libertarian as a consistent advocate of free-market capitalism, minimal government, and social tolerance (thus distinguishing libertarians from conservatives). Their motto might be \u201cKeep government out of the boardroom and the bedroom.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur first effort to rank the 100 most influential libertarians came from a recent survey of libertarians carried out by FreedomFest, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest gathering of free minds.\u201d More than 10,000 people participated in the survey, identifying over 200 individuals whom they deemed most influential within the libertarian sphere. We also combed through many online sources and consulted with several well-connected and informed libertarians to compile this list.\u000a\u000aStill, a list like this is subjective at best, and should be viewed as interesting and informative, rather than definitive. We very likely missed people who should have been on the list, and we welcome your input and correction for future editions. Moreover, while selecting only 100 is difficult, coming up with a ranking is even more subjective. We tried to rank the entrants in what we believe is a somewhat logical order of influence, but we certainly recognize that many readers (and perhaps even some people whose names are on the list!) may take exception to the ranking.\u000a\u000aFinally, it is important to note that we chose to leave out a few individuals whose credentials as libertarians might be less convincing, such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Howard Stern. We may well change our minds on these omissions, but for now these individuals are left off the list.\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy the list and we welcome your corrections and suggestions for future lists (comments can be sent to bestlists@newsmax.com).

Some suspected an organized campaign to buy the book in bulk.\u000a\u000a"After investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for 'Handbook for Mortals' did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title," the Times said in an email to The Hollywood Reporter.\u000a\u000aSarem, an actress and former music manager, told The Hollywood Reporter she thinks the Times caved to social media pressure.\u000a\u000a"I'm super frustrated," she said.

aVEstate planning is not only important in directing the way a person\u2019s money and property is handled after death, but it also provides valuable information to loved ones to help seniors in their final years.\u000a\u000aSome people mistakenly believe an estate is something only the wealthy should worry about. An estate, however, applies to all people and the possessions they own. This may include bank accounts, cars, real estate, stocks and bonds, jewelry, or even pets.\u000a\u000aWithout proper estate planning, all decisions and arrangements for property distribution after death will be made according to state law, not according to someone\u2019s wishes. This could cause chaos and hostility among family members.\u000a\u000aHere are seven tips for seniors to get their estate plans in order:\u000a\u000a1. Keep personal and financial records in a safe place \u2014 Personal information includes everything from your name, date of birth, and Social Security number to employment records and contacts of relatives, close friends, or financial advisers, according to the National Institute on Aging. Financial records include banking and insurance information, liabilities, mortgages, deeds, wills, and trusts.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Your Tiny Thyroid Causing Hidden Problems: Heart, Obesity, Worse\u000a\u000a2. Let family members or trusted friends know you have records \u2014 In case of emergencies or death, people need to know the location of this information. You don\u2019t need to give details on the records, only the location of important papers. A lawyer can help if you don\u2019t have a trusted friend or relative.\u000a\u000a3. Prepare a will \u2014 A will makes it easier to distribute the property in the estate and avoids these affairs being handled by the courts. You can detail how you want possessions distributed to family members or close friends. A lawyer can help write up a will or you can draw up a simple will online at such sites as LegalZoom.com. Update information on the will when necessary.\u000a\u000a4. Consider life insurance \u2014 This helps your family meet necessary expenses, such as debts, education costs for children, mortgage and car loans, or annual income needs. A life insurance agent can explain what will work for your particular needs. Term life insurance with a fixed premium during the life of the term is often affordable.\u000a\u000aAlert: Do You Often Feel Tired and Sluggish? Take Simple Online Quiz\u000a\u000a5. Consider a living trust \u2014 The property listed in a trust goes to heirs after death and avoids probate, a court process that may take months or years. A trust is more difficult to challenge in court than a will to help disburse possessions properly. It takes considerable detail from a knowledgeable lawyer.\u000a\u000a6. Appoint a power of attorney \u2014 Seniors might become incapacitated and unable to make financial decisions. A power-of-attorney document allows a trusted person to handle these affairs, avoiding a court-appointed person to manage finances, according to Caring.com.\u000a\u000a7. Make end-of-life and final arrangements \u2014 Drawing up a healthcare directive provides your wishes about medical care and prolonged treatment if you\u2019re no longer able to make those decisions. A document for final arrangements details desires for a type of burial, body or organ donations, and whom seniors want to handle these matters.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000

aVHurricane Harvey moved slowly but powerfully across Texas on Saturday, downgraded to a Category 1 storm, but only after hammering the coast with life-threatening winds and the prospect of catastrophic flooding.\u000a\u000aThe hurricane, initially a Category 4 and the most powerful storm in over a decade to hit the mainland United States, made a first landfall northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, late on Friday with maximum winds of 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour).\u000a\u000aIn a sign of its lumbering movement, it then made a second landfall nearby three hours later.\u000a\u000aHarvey was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane by the National Hurricane Center early on Saturday as it moved slowly over parts of Texas at about 6 mph (10 km per hour).\u000a\u000aThe storm was expected to meander across the coast and up through Louisiana for days, with forecasts for storm surges of up to 13 feet (4 metres) and over 3 feet (90 cm) of rain.\u000a\u000aNearly 10 inches of rain had already fallen in a few areas in southeastern Texas, the center said.\u000a\u000aThe town of Rockport appeared to be one of the hardest hit by Harvey's punch, hours after the mayor told anyone staying to write their names on their arms for identification in case of death or injury.\u000a\u000aA high school, hotel, senior housing complex and other buildings suffered structural damage, according to emergency officials and local media. Some were being used as shelters.\u000a\u000a"Right now we're still hunkered down and can't go anywhere," said Steve Sims, the volunteer fire chief in Rockport.

We know we've got a lot of problems, but we don't know what yet."\u000a\u000aSims said power, internet and most cell phone service was out in the town of 10,000 where about two-thirds of people evacuated. Most of the senior citizens and nursing homes were among the first to be evacuated, he said.\u000a\u000aAs many as 6 million people were believed to be in Harvey's path, as is the heart of America's oil refining operations.

The mayor estimated some 65 percent of the town\u2019s 65,000 residents defied the mandatory evacuation order.\u000a\u000aWhile thousands fled the expected devastating flooding and destruction, many residents stayed put in imperiled towns and stocked up on food, fuel and sandbags, drawing the ire of authorities.\u000a\u000aHOUSTON PREPARES FOR FLOODS\u000a\u000aAs a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Harvey was the first major hurricane of Category 3 or more to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.\u000a\u000aIts size and strength also dredged up memories of Katrina, the 2005 hurricane that made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. About 1,800 died in the disaster made worse by a slow government emergency response.\u000a\u000aCorpus Christi, a city of 320,000, was under voluntary evacuation for Harvey.\u000a\u000aAt least three cruise ships operated by Carnival Corp with thousands of passengers aboard were forced to change their plans to sail for the Port of Galveston.\u000a\u000aTwo of them headed New Orleans to pick up fresh supplies, while the third delayed its departure from Cozumel, Mexico.\u000a\u000aLouisiana and Texas declared states of disaster, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare.\u000a\u000aThe NHC's latest tracking model shows the storm sitting southwest of Houston for more than a day, giving the nation's fourth most populous city a double dose of rain and wind.\u000a\u000aThe city warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches (60 cm) of rain over several days.\u000a\u000aGASOLINE PRICES SPIKE\u000a\u000aGasoline stations on the south Texas coast were running out of fuel residents fled the region. U.S. gasoline prices spiked as the storm shut down 22 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production, according to the U.S. government.\u000a\u000aMore than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and others have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms.\u000a\u000aConcern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to their highest in four months, before profit taking pulled back prices. Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline margins hit their strongest levels in five years for this time of year.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government said it would make emergency stockpiles of crude available if needed to plug disruptions. It has regularly used them to dampen the impact of previous storms on energy supplies.

aVJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Engulfed in a string of scandals, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds himself facing a growing grassroots protest movement demanding his indictment and removal from office.\u000a\u000aWeekly anti-corruption vigils in front of the home of Israel's attorney general have gone from a trickle to drawing thousands of people, and the recent arrest of the two main organizers seems to spell stress within Netanyahu's circle while further energizing his opponents.\u000a\u000aThe unlikely duo spearheading the protest effort could not be more different. One used to hobnob in the most exclusive circles of power, while the other is a former maintenance man at the prime minister's residence. Once dismissed as disgruntled fringe characters, Eldad Yaniv and Meni Naftali have together galvanized a movement that has rattled Netanyahu's grip on power.\u000a\u000a"Netanyahu sees our protest as a clear and present danger to his continued rule, and that is why he is trying to harm us," said Yaniv, who was arrested with Naftali last week on their way to a protest.\u000a\u000a"Our goal is more than just replacing Netanyahu," he said. "It's to create a new contract between politicians and the public so that the next prime minister is not investigated by police."\u000a\u000aAlthough the allegations have yet to threaten his lengthy rule, Netanyahu has seen his approval ratings drop amid repeated questions about his conduct and integrity.\u000a\u000aOne of his closest former aides has become a witness against him, and Netanyahu himself has been questioned under caution in a pair of cases relating to alleged financial misdeeds and illicit ties to executives in media, international business and Hollywood. Police say they suspect Netanyahu of being involved in bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The final decision is in the hands of his attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit.\u000a\u000aFor now, Netanyahu still has the backing of his ruling Likud Party and key conservative coalition partners, leaving critics pinning their hopes on the attorney general's discretion to indict.\u000a\u000aWhat began as a gathering of a handful of good governance activists outside Mandelblit's home has now, in its 40th week, swelled into a powerful display of flag-waving Israelis each Saturday night that has drawn heavy media coverage, sparked pro-Netanyahu protests and unnerved police.\u000a\u000aLast weekend, police pre-emptively arrested Yaniv and Naftali for allegedly soliciting an illegal demonstration, detaining them overnight before a court freed them amid scathing criticism of police. Israel's Supreme Court said Thursday the protests could continue but would be limited to 500 people, and it barred the use of loudspeakers in the residential area.\u000a\u000aYaniv, a lawyer, was a close aide to then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak but became disenchanted with the political system and turned into an anti-corruption crusader. He frequently speaks out against the influence of lobbyists, big business and the banks.\u000a\u000aYaniv says his arrest was an attempt to quash a "symbol" of resistance and was ordered from above \u2014 a charge police denied.\u000a\u000a"This protest began because of Netanyahu's corruption investigations, but they are just a trigger to a far larger problem \u2014 the unfathomable corruption of our leadership," he said, citing a former prime minister, president and several ministers and mayors who have served time for crimes in office.\u000a\u000aNaftali is a former custodian at the prime minister's residence, and an Israeli court has ruled he was abused and mistreated by Sara Netanyahu. He said it has become his mission to unmask the misdeeds of Israel's first family. Since his dismissal, he maintains that authorities have been hounding him by taking away his gun license, for instance, and thus hurting his livelihood as a security guard.\u000a\u000a"I am a victim of institutional corruption. People see what was done to me. This is about proper governance," said Naftali, who now works as a handyman. "The trust with the state has been broken."\u000a\u000aNetanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and called the accusations against him a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media. He has dismissed the suspicions as "background noise," vowed to stay in office for years to come and recently held a boisterous rally in Tel Aviv where he criticized the media to hundreds of cheering supporters.\u000a\u000aIsrael law says the prime minister can only be removed by parliament, though the Supreme Court has since ruled that government ministers and mayors had to resign if indicted.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, Israel's justice minister has said the prime minister is not compelled to do so. But should the attorney general issue an indictment, there will be a legal challenge and public pressure for him to step aside. The weekly protests are ostensibly aimed at encouraging an indictment.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu has escaped scandals before linked to his and his wife's expensive tastes and use of public funds, but the latest accusations appear to pose his stiffest challenge yet.\u000a\u000aOne investigation, dubbed "File 1000" by police, reportedly concerns allegations he improperly accepted lavish gifts from wealthy supporters, including Australian billionaire James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.\u000a\u000aA second investigation, "File 2000," reportedly concerns Netanyahu's alleged attempts to strike a deal with publisher Arnon Mozes of the Yediot Ahronot newspaper group to promote legislation to weaken Yediot's main competitor in exchange for more favorable coverage.\u000a\u000aAnd a probe called "File 3000" relates to a possible conflict of interest involving the purchase of German submarines, in which Netanyahu's cousin and personal attorney represented the German firm involved.\u000a\u000aRaviv Drucker, an investigative journalist who exposed the final affair, said the cases have damaged Netanyahu's image but not endangered his rule. Barring any unforeseen developments, Drucker predicted Netanyahu was safe politically for at least the next year, since none of his allies had any interest in seeing the government fall.\u000a\u000a"The legal picture has to change for that to happen," he said. "If it reaches a whole new threshold in which they will feel damaged by the association with him, then he could fall."\u000a\u000aFollow Aron Heller on Twitter at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap .

aVThe commander in chief hinted that he may pardon a former sheriff of a misdemeanor, and the left went into histrionics.\u000a\u000aAt a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rally in Phoenix, Arizona Tuesday, President Donald Trump indicated that a pardon for former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio was a strong possibility.\u000a\u000a"I won't do it tonight because I don't want to cause any controversy," Trump said, in reference to Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton\u2019s assessment that an Arpaio pardon would "inflame passions."\u000a\u000a"I'll make a prediction. I think he's going to be just fine," he said to raucous cheers from the crowd.\u000a\u000aAn administration official indicated Wednesday morning that the White House is preparing paperwork for what is looking like a probable pardon, including the preparation of talking points to smooth the process.\u000a\u000aThey include Arpaio\u2019s 50 years of service to his country and county \u2014 in the military and Drug Enforcement Administration and finally as sheriff.\u000a\u000aThey also reportedly include an assessment that to sentence him for "enforcing the law" and "working to keep people safe" would be unfair.\u000a\u000aArpaio, 85, was found guilty of criminal contempt of court following a bench trial last month, and is scheduled to begin the sentencing phase on October 5.\u000a\u000aHe faces up to a six-month sentence \u2014 that\u2019s it, six months.\u000a\u000aBut from the reaction of the left one would have thought he\u2019d committed a capital crime worthy of a firing squad.\u000a\u000aIgor Volsky, director of Guns Down, a group that calls for a dramatic reduction in firearms in America, published his disgust in an over-the-top tweet after the president\u2019s announcement.\u000a\u000a\u201cTO BE CLEAR: Trump's promise to pardon Arpaio right now is a full and complete embrace of white nationalism and racism. PERIOD,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aScott Dworkin, co-founder of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, was equally strident, and referred to Arpaio as \u201cthe most racist criminal\u201d Trump could muster.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump: How can I distract people today?

Network of Care also provides myriad listings for treatment services as well as support groups. WebMD said those with depression can create a personalized support group to "stay on top" of their illness and treatments. Family, it notes, offers a great place to talk along with friends and coworkers.The website also suggested connecting with faith-based organizations near you "whether from the pastor, rabbi, or other religious leader, small groups, or caring individuals within the organizations."WebMD cited the power of a depression support group in helping to support those with depression in a safe and loving environment. Together, it noted, people learn better strategies to cope and to understand that "someone else knows what I am going through," as camaraderie and trust are built.Some of those support groups are now on social media, including the Anxiety and Depression Support Group Facebook page Information about groups is available on the Anxiety and Depression Association of America website The ADAA noted of the importance of treatment: "Anxiety disorders are treatable, and the vast majority of people with an anxiety disorder can be helped with professional care. Success of treatment varies. Some may respond to treatment after a few weeks or months, while others may need more than a year. Treatment may be complicated if people have more than one anxiety disorder or if they suffer from depression, substance abuse, or other co-existing conditions. This is why treatment must be tailored specifically for each individual."

Take these steps to prepare for an earthquake and minimize damage to your property and ensure your family\u2019s safety.Prepare well in advance of an earthquake if you live in an area that is prone to them or along any major geologic fault zones. Unlike other natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes that can be predicted by meteorologists, earthquakes cannot be predicted. They occur without warning.Develop a family communication plan for during and after an earthquake. According to Earthquake Country Alliance , this plan should include agreeing on an out-of-state contact person that every member of the family can call to relay information in case the family is temporarily separated.Agree on a way to communicate to rescue workers if you find yourself trapped beneath debris. For example, equip your family members with emergency whistles they can use to alert first responders, suggests Earthquake Country Alliance.Practice the Drop, Cover, and Hold On drill until everyone in the family is comfortable with it, advises the Centers for Disease Control . This drill helps minimize injury during an earthquake. First, you drop to your knees so you won\u2019t get knocked down by the quake, then you cover your head and shoulders either with your hands or by finding shelter under low furniture that won\u2019t fall on you. Finally, you hang on to your surroundings until the shaking stops.Secure your home to prevent damage and minimize injury, recommends Earthquake Country Alliance. For example, move heavy items closer to the ground instead of high on bookshelves. Secure heavy bookcases and top-heavy furniture to wall studs. Hang mirrors and artwork using closed hooks and install latches on kitchen cabinets to keep contents from flying out. Ask your plumber to install flexible connectors where gas lines are connected to appliances.Create an emergency kit to prepare for the earthquake and have a kit available at home, in the car, and at your workplace. The CDC recommends stocking your kit with first aid supplies and enough food and water to last for three days.Remember there is no advance warning when an earthquake hits, so it's important to prepare ahead of time.

aVPresident Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military on Friday to reject openly transgender people as new recruits but authorized Defense Secretary James Mattis to decide how to handle transgender personnel already serving in the armed forces.\u000a\u000aTrump also ordered the military to stop paying for gender reassignment surgical procedures by March 23 except to protect the health of someone who has already begun the process of reassigning sex, according to a senior White House official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aThe Defense Department will have six month to consider how to handle openly transgender people currently serving in the military under a memorandum that Trump signed on Friday, official said. The memorandum directs the department to consider unit cohesion, applicable law and resources in making the determination, the official said.\u000a\u000aTrump announced July 26 he would ban transgender people from serving \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the U.S. military, reversing President Barack Obama\u2019s policy to let them serve openly in the ranks.\u000a\u000aThe announcement, in a series of early morning tweets, caught Pentagon officials and key members of Congress off-guard, and the Pentagon said it wouldn\u2019t change its policies until it received a formal order from the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere will be no modifications to the current policy until the President\u2019s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,\u201d the office of Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford said in a statement after Trump\u2019s July tweets. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat formal notification came in a presidential memorandum Trump signed Friday, the White House official said.\u000a\u000aTrump said in July his concern hinged on the additional medical costs and \u201cdisruption\u201d of such troops. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited \u201cmilitary readiness and unit cohesion.\u201d\u000a\u000aCare related to gender reassignment costs the Pentagon $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, the larger number a little more than 0.1 percent of the military\u2019s entire health-care bill, according to a 2016 Rand Corporation study. By contrast, the military spent $84 million on Viagra and other drugs for erectile dysfunction for active-duty troops, eligible family members and retirees in 2014 alone, the Military Times reported.\u000a\u000aTreatment of transgender people has become a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars as social conservatives lead fights in some states to require that students and sometimes adults use school and public restrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.\u000a\u000aTrump has attempted as a candidate to thread a needle between the two sides.

aVVA home loans are a valuable benefit offered to veterans, but the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says only 6 percent of eligible veterans use the program to finance a home. It is possible that many veterans who could benefit simply do not understand the program or have misconceptions. Here are some things you should know about this benefit.\u000a\u000a1. VA loans are flexible \u2013 According to Veterans United Network, less stringent credit requirements and underwriting standards for VA home loans allow many veterans to secure financing even when they would not be able to get a conventional loan. Veterans with troubled financial profiles are encouraged to apply.\u000a\u000aImportant: World-Famous Cardiologist Reveals Proof Of Life After Death\u000a\u000a2. Buy or refinance with a VA loan \u2013 Most people think you can only use the VA loan program to finance the purchase of a home, but you can also use these loans to refinance an existing mortgage, advises Quicken Loans.\u000a\u000a3. Not just for starter homes \u2013 VA loans are not necessarily small loans to purchase a first home. Quicken Loans says there is no limit to how many times an eligible veteran can use the program throughout their lifetime, and the loan amounts can be up to $1 million.\u000a\u000a4. Lower interest rates \u2013 Because the VA insures the loans and reduces the risk to the local lender, the lender is able to offer rates that are usually about .25 percent lower than a conventional loan, says the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack\u000a\u000a5. Surviving spouses can benefit \u2013 The VA acknowledges that there is no way to repay someone for the loss of their military fallen spouse, but eligibility for the VA home loan program may help them get back on their feet financially speaking. Surviving spouses must not have remarried in order to take advantage of the program.\u000a\u000a6. Quick close \u2013 Quicken Loans says it is a myth that VA home loans take a long time to process. They assert they can close a VA loan just as quickly as a conventional one.\u000a\u000a7. Bankruptcy is OK \u2013 Even in cases where a veteran has foreclosed on a previous home or declared bankruptcy, Veterans United Network says the VA loan may still come into play. There is usually a 2-year waiting period after a bankruptcy, but in some cases, it is only 1 year.\u000a\u000aTip: Heart Surgeon's Secret to Healthy Blood Pressure

aVPresident Donald Trump is likely to rescind an Obama-era policy that protects nearly 600,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally as children and are known as "Dreamers," according to media reports on Friday.\u000a\u000aTrump's decision on whether to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy could be announced as early as next week, reported ABC News, citing multiple sources.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior White House officials on Thursday, according to an administration official.\u000a\u000aDepartment of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan denied reports that the department had made any recommendations on DACA to the White House. "There have been continuing discussions about DACA but nothing has been determined," Lapan told Reuters.\u000a\u000aWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday that the program continues to be under review. A White House spokesperson told Reuters that only Congress can legislate a permanent solution for the plight of children who are currently protected from deportation by DACA.\u000a\u000aTrump had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of former President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration, including DACA.\u000a\u000aImmigrant advocates reacted to the news with a flurry of statements, promising to defend the program with protest and legal action.\u000a\u000a\u201cImmigrant youth fought to create the DACA program and we will fight like hell to defend it,\u201d said Greisa Martinez Rosas, Advocacy Director and DACA-beneficiary of United We Dream said in a statement.\u000a\u000aCivil rights groups said ending the program could increase racial divisions in the country in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aTen Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued.\u000a\u000aIf the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court.\u000a\u000aThe 10 who signed the letter represent Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.\u000a\u000aA larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect.

aVMany older adults may mishear important medical information from their healthcare providers, a study suggests.\u000a\u000aRoughly four of every 10 elders said they had misheard a doctor or nurse, researchers in Ireland found.\u000a\u000a"Patients may not have understood what you think they understood," senior author Simon Smith, of University College Cork, warns health care providers.\u000a\u000aSmith and colleagues write in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery that hearing loss is becoming more common among people over age 60.\u000a\u000aAlso, they note, medical errors are more common among older adults, who are some the healthcare system's most dependent users.\u000a\u000aFailure of communication is the leading cause of medical errors, earlier research has suggested.\u000a\u000aSmith told Reuters Health that even people who haven't been diagnosed with hearing issues - people who hear well in their day-to-day lives - may struggle in the noisy halls of a hospital.\u000a\u000aTo learn more about the proportion of older people having communication problems with healthcare providers, the researchers surveyed 100 outpatients at their hospital who were at least 60 years old.\u000a\u000aNearly 60 percent reported some hearing loss, and 26 percent used a hearing aid.\u000a\u000aOverall, 43 percent reported mishearing their doctor or nurse at a hospital or a doctor's office. The rate of miscommunication didn't differ between age groups.\u000a\u000aSome patients explained why they misheard their healthcare providers, and their reasons fell into one of five categories.\u000a\u000aDescriptions of illnesses or instructions tripped up 36 percent of people, and 29 percent said they missed words or full sentences for no particular reason. People talking too fast, too many people talking at once and similar issues were cited by 27 percent of people. Pronunciation or similar-sounding words were an issue to 10 percent of people. Others reported intentionally not listening to their providers and some blamed the setting.\u000a\u000aSmith pointed out that some of the issues can't be corrected by simply giving people hearing aids.\u000a\u000a"The key thing" for patients, he advises, "is to clarify with the doctor. Repeat it back would be the obvious first intervention."\u000a\u000aPeople need to recognize that hearing loss is a problem and look for it, writes Dr. Heather Weinreich, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in an editorial accompanying the new study.\u000a\u000aDoctors need to change their communication style and intervene to help patients hear well, she adds.\u000a\u000a"There are potential immediate short-term and long-term impacts of miscommunication with patient," Weinreich writes. "We need more research into the medical errors and costs caused by hearing loss and to examine methods to provide effective communication so as to deliver high-quality patient-centered care."

Watch This Video.\u000a\u000aThe foods people eat often affect the skin. Processed or junk foods, for example, can increase the production of oils to cause breakouts. But the best foods for skin health contain nutrients that protect people from skin problems and even enhance their appearance.Certain foods nourish skin cells and tissues to overcome blemishes, acne, eczema, psoriasis, and other skin disorders, according to BBC Good Food Here are the five best foods that promise to cure skin problems:with omega-3 fatty acids are vital to healthy skin. Known for heart health and protection against heart disease, omega-3s boost blood circulation for a healthy glow to the skin. Research has shown that fish oil protects the skin against sun damage, WebMD reported . The fatty acids build up cell membranes to shield the skin against harmful substances and clear the way for skin nutrients. Omega-3 fish include tuna, mackerel, salmon, herring, lake trout, and sardines.contains beta-carotene and like other dark, leafy green vegetables, this antioxidant works to repair skin cells as well as slow down the development of skin cancer cells, according to TotalBeauty . Age-defying spinach also provides the body and skin with folate, potassium, and fiber to restore skin cells damaged from sun exposure. This wards off the skin cancers. Spinach also provides vitamin A, also known as retinol, for skin health, as do other leafy greens, carrots, and butternut squash., such as oranges, tangerines and lemons, are among the highest sources of vitamin C, which contributes to improved skin health and faster healing, according to Chris Kresser, a promoter of nutrition and best-selling author . He noted that research has shown better skin appearance and fewer wrinkles for people with diets high in vitamin C. Other sources of vitamin C include strawberries, kiwi, bell peppers, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.have unsaturated fats and essential fatty acids that are called the \u201chealthy fats.\u201d Walnuts, Brazil nuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds have the healthy fats that reduce inflammation to significantly improve the skin, Jacqueline Banks, a certified holistic health counselor, wrote in an article for Fox News . Almonds are also known to strengthen cell membranes for skin health.is packed with protein and vitamins to enhance the immune system, necessary to maintain vibrant, clear and young-looking skin, TotalBeauty said. Yogurt and other dairy products contain vitamin A, which protects the skin from environmental damage and overexposure to the sun that can cause premature wrinkles.

aVEditor's Note:\u000a\u000aHormones May Be Causing Weight Gain, Heart Woes\u000a\u000aAlert:\u000a\u000aIs Your Tiny Thyroid Causing Your Weight Gain?\u000a\u000aGastric band and gastric bypass surgeries are among the most common types of weight-loss procedures for people who are obese. The difference between the two procedures involves how food intake is restricted. The operations are recommended for patients who suffer from other health conditions and for those who need the surgery to avoid the risks of obesity, which include heart disease and diabetes.With adjustable gastric band surgery, the surgeon inserts a small band around the top of the stomach, WebMD explained . The procedure limits how much food is allowed to go into the stomach, thereby limiting the food intake and managing weight.A small balloon inside the band controls the tightness around the stomach. A port placed under the skin of the abdomen connects to the band, according to the Mayo Clinic . Fluid can be injected or removed through the port to adjust the size. The band makes people feel fuller to avoid further eating. Gastric banding does not reduce absorption of calories and nutrients into the body as gastric bypass surgery does.In gastric bypass surgery, also referred to as Roux-en-Y bypass, a small pouch is created at the top of the stomach to limit the amount of food and liquid intake. A portion of the small intestine is cut to shorten the distance to the stomach as food flows to the pouch. The difference is that fewer nutrients and calories are absorbed from bypass surgery because food bypasses the portion of the small intestine.Gastric band or bypass surgery is effective when patients change their eating patterns and have regular medical check-ups. A difference between gastric band and bypass surgery involves nutrients. Patients who have had gastric bypass procedures may have vitamin and mineral deficiencies and need to take supplements, according to Medical News Today Both procedures are done through a laparoscope, which uses a camera for the surgeon to make small incisions.The surgeries help control a person\u2019s eating habits, but patients often need to follow strict diets to maintain a healthy weight. Snacking on or eating unhealthy foods that promote fat accumulation can cause patients to regain some of the weight they have lost following surgery, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

He told a judge on Thursday that he bought the animal on the streets of Tijuana.\u000a\u000aLuis Eudoro Valencia was charged after border officials said they found the furry cub early Wednesday lying on the floor of a car heading from Mexico to California, The Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000aValencia, a U.S. citizen who lives in Perris, told the court that he had purchased the tiger for $300 from someone he met in the Mexican border city who was walking a full-sized tiger on a leash.\u000a\u000aThe cub was found during an inspection at San Diego's Otay Mesa border crossing, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.\u000a\u000aU.S. Fish & Wildlife Service officials took custody of the cub and were working with the San Diego Zoo to care for it.\u000a\u000aIn January, Mexican authorities seized a Bengal tiger in Tijuana after a resident called police to report a man was walking a tiger on a dog leash through the neighborhood. Officials said the 4-month-old tiger had been living in a private home with children.\u000a\u000aIn April, Mexican officials seized a nine-month old Bengal tiger in Tijuana after the cub fell from a third-floor terrace onto a neighbor's patio, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

aVDecades ago, a debate over what kind of nation America is roiled the conservative movement.\u000a\u000aNeocons claimed America was an "ideological nation" a "creedal nation," dedicated to the proposition that "all men are created equal."\u000a\u000aExpropriating the biblical mandate, "Go forth and teach all nations!" they divinized democracy and made the conversion of mankind to the democratic faith their mission here on earth.\u000a\u000aWith his global crusade for democracy, George W. Bush bought into all this. Result: Ashes in our mouths and a series of foreign policy disasters, beginning with Afghanistan and Iraq.\u000a\u000aBehind the Trumpian slogan "America First" lay a conviction that, with the Cold War over and the real ideological nation, the USSR, shattered into pieces along ethnic lines, it was time for America to come home.\u000a\u000aContra the neocons, traditionalists argued that, while America was uniquely great, the nation was united by faith, culture, language, history, heroes, holidays, mores, manners, customs and traditions. A common feature of Americans, black and white, was pride in belonging to a people that had achieved so much.\u000a\u000aThe insight attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville \u2014 "America is great because she is good, and if America ceases to be good, she will cease to be great" \u2014 was a belief shared by almost all.\u000a\u000aWhat makes our future appear problematic is that what once united us now divides us. While Presidents Wilson and Truman declared us to be a "Christian nation," Christianity has been purged from our public life and sheds believers every decade. Atheism and agnosticism are growing rapidly, especially among the young.\u000a\u000aTraditional morality, grounded in Christianity, is being discarded. Half of all marriages end in divorce. Four-in-10 children are born out of wedlock. Unrestricted abortion and same-sex marriage \u2014 once regarded as marks of decadence and decline \u2014 are now seen as human rights and the hallmarks of social progress.\u000a\u000aTens of millions of us do not speak English. Where most of our music used to be classic, popular, country and western, and jazz, much of it now contains rutting lyrics that used to be unprintable.\u000a\u000aWhere we used to have three national networks, we have three 24-hour cable news channels and a thousand websites that reinforce our clashing beliefs on morality, culture, politics and race.\u000a\u000aConsider but a few events post-Charlottesville.\u000a\u000a"Murderer" was painted on the San Fernando statue of Fr. Junipero Serra, the Franciscan who founded the missions that became San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan Capistrano and Santa Clara.\u000a\u000aAmerica's oldest monument honoring Columbus, in Baltimore, was vandalized. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Robert E. Lee's statue to be removed from Capitol and replaced by \u2014 Pocahontas.\u000a\u000aAccording to legend, this daughter of Chief Powhatan saved Captain John Smith from being beheaded by throwing herself across his neck. The Chief was a "person of interest" in the disappearance of the "Lost Colony" of Roanoke Island, among whose missing was Virginia Dare, the first European baby born in British America.\u000a\u000aWhy did Kaine not call for John Smith himself, leader of the Jamestown Colony that fought off Indian attacks, to be so honored?\u000a\u000aIn New Orleans, "Tear It Down" was spray-painted on a statue of Joan of Arc, a gift from France in 1972. Besides being a canonized saint in the Catholic Church and a legendary heroine of France, what did the Maid of Orleans do to deserve this?\u000a\u000aTaken together, we are seeing the discoverers, explorers and missionaries of North America demonized as genocidal racists all. The Founding Fathers are either slave owners or sanctioners of slavery.\u000a\u000aOur nation-builders either collaborated in or condoned the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans. Almost to the present, ours was a land where segregationists were honored leaders.\u000a\u000aBottom line for the left: Americans should be sickened and ashamed of the history that made us the world's greatest nation. And we should acknowledge our ancestors' guilt by tearing down any and all monuments and statues that memorialize them.\u000a\u000aThis rising segment of America, full of self-righteous rage, is determined to blacken the memory of those who have gone before us.\u000a\u000aTo another slice of America, much of the celebrated social and moral "progress" of recent decades induces a sense of nausea, summarized in the lament, "This isn't the country we grew up in."\u000a\u000aHillary Clinton famously described this segment of America as a "basket of deplorables . . . racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic . . . bigots," and altogether "irredeemable."\u000a\u000aSo, what still unites us? What holds us together into the indefinite future? What makes us one nation and one people? What do we offer mankind, as nations seem to recoil from what we are becoming, and are instead eager to build their futures on the basis of ethnonationalism and fundamentalist faith?\u000a\u000aIf advanced democracy has produced the disintegration of a nation that we see around us, what is the compelling case for it?\u000a\u000aA sixth of the way through the 21st century, what is there to make us believe this will be the Second American Century?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPatrick Buchanan has been an adviser to three presidents, a two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the nominee for the Reform Party in 2000.

The FTC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aAfter getting the approval of the FTC and Whole Foods shareholders this week, Amazon said on Thursday that it planned to complete the acquisition on Monday and simultaneously introduce lower prices on some grocery staples.\u000a\u000aThe world\u2019s biggest online retailer also said it planned to start selling some Whole Foods-branded products on its website and offer incentives to its Prime members at Whole Foods stores.\u000a\u000aShares of major grocery stores fell sharply on Thursday on fears that Amazon\u2019s move would spark a new round of price wars in the industry, but they recovered somewhat on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe approval was one of the first major decisions by the Trump administration\u2019s FTC. The commission has five seats but just two members at present, and Trump has not yet nominated anyone to fill the remaining three positions.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump\u2019s leading choice to run the agency was Washington lawyer Joseph Simons, who was a top FTC official under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aA partner at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Simons would replace acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who has been running the FTC since January.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate still has not approved Makan Delrahim, Trump's choice to head the Justice Department's antitrust division.\u000a\u000aCongressional Democrats in July proposed taking a harder line on mergers and strengthening antitrust laws to give regulators more tools to block such deals or revisit those that were previously approved. "Growing corporate influence and consolidation has led to reductions in competition, choice for consumers, and bargaining power for workers," as well as higher prices, they said.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration is reviewing a number of mergers, including AT&T's Inc. proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc., the owner of HBO, Warner Bros and news network CNN. The Justice Department and AT&T have been discussing potential conditions in recent weeks.

"It's very disappointing that someone wished to spin this."\u000a\u000aHe also said in his text he told Trump's Chief of Staff John Kelly "today and emailed him today" about his resignation.\u000a\u000aHowever, a White House official said otherwise in a statement.\u000a\u000a"Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House," the statement read.\u000a\u000aNews of Gorka's departure was revealed Friday by The Federalist, which claimed to have details of his resignation letter where he reiterated his support for the president, but said, "It is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are \u2013 for now \u2013 ascendant within the White House."\u000a\u000aA source familiar with the situation said Gorka, who had been working on national security matters, began to be shut out of security-related meetings after White House chief strategist Steve Bannon left his position earlier this month and returned to head Breitbart News. Gorka at one time worked for Bannon at Breitbart.\u000a\u000aGorka said he's on vacation until Monday.

aVVeterans have a variety of resources to turn to when they have concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Symptoms of the disorder don\u2019t necessarily indicate PTSD and some reactions to stress and trauma are normal conditions.\u000a\u000aMental and physical distress, difficulty sleeping, and disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams are among the signs.\u000a\u000aThe best way to find out if you suffer from PTSD is through a medical professional, who can then advise treatment options. Doctors and online resources may identify the problem and help with the necessary treatment available.\u000a\u000aHere are six PTSD resources veterans should know about:\u000a\u000a1. VA medical centers and Vet Centers \u2014 Treatment programs are available to veterans through mental health services offered by VA medical centers. Vet Centers, located in the community along with outpatient clinics, provide readjustment counseling services that include PTSD. Services are open to vets and their families at no charge. The VA\u2019s National Center for PTSD has information about these and other programs.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat\u000a\u000a\u200b2. Counseling \u2014 Vets can find therapists, counselors, or mental health care providers that treat PTSD on their own. A family doctor may recommend someone. The VA offers information on finding a provider using the internet. Check with your health insurer to see if it includes mental health services for PTSD if you decide to take the private care route.\u000a\u000a\u200b3. Project Odyssey \u2014 The multi-day, adventure event is sponsored by the Wounded Warrior Project. Through activities such as hiking, rope courses, and rock climbing, veterans with PTSD or combat stress learn readjustment into civilian life by improving confidence, increasing skills, and overcoming fears.\u000a\u000a\u200b4. Psychological health \u2014 The Defense Centers of Excellence, under the military health system, offers programs and resources to treat psychological health and traumatic brain injuries for veterans and their families, Military OneSource explains. The DCoE has an outreach center that provides help for vets online or over the phone with information on its website.\u000a\u000aAlert: 3 Signs Clogged Arteries Are Ruining Your Heart\u000a\u000a\u200b5. Real Warriors Campaign \u2014 The program launched by the DCoE helps vets and their families with care and support for PTSD and other psychological issues. Along with valuable information on getting help through the VA, the campaign\u2019s site also offers tips on reducing stress, managing pain, and managing stress when returning home.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Make the Connection \u2014 The unique website allows vets to read and hear about the experiences of other vets dealing with PTSD and transitioning back into society. Through articles and videos, the site explains symptoms of PTSD and overcoming the challenges.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check

aVIf he were alive today, the Rev. Martin Luther King would call for peaceful, nonviolent protests in the wake of the deadly white power rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the civil-rights legend's niece, Dr. Alveda King, told Newsmax TV on Wednesday.\u000a\u000a"My uncle during his lifetime, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the brother of my dad, the Rev. A.D. King, often said we must learn from this together as brothers, and I add sisters," King said to Rita Cosby, guest host of Newsmax's "The Todd Schnitt Show."\u000a\u000a"One of my favorite quotes from my uncle is 'I have decided to stick with love because hate is too great a burden to bear.' Examine your own heart and mind as to where you are and negotiate peacefully and nonviolently.\u000a\u000a"If you haven't quite gotten to that solution, then demonstrate peacefully and nonviolently because we want a win-win situation and we want to reconcile. That's what my uncle would say if he were here today I'm almost sure of it because he said it for his whole lifetime."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

It's just uncovered."\u000a\u000a"They overplayed their hand. They thought it was okay to come out and show again what racism looks like. Racism will never be acceptable on the planet not just in America. And we're one blood," King told Cosby. "So we're going to have to use the nonviolent conflict resolution principles for reconciliation here."\u000a\u000aShe said she believes President Donald Trump gave the proper response in saying both sides were at fault, despite the belief of some that he was siding with white supremacists.\u000a\u000a"It was very important for the president of the United States to take time to let the American people know that he's interested, he's engaged and he cares. He also repudiated the Ku Klux Klan and said there was violence on every side," King said.\u000a\u000a"What he means by that you got an alt-right and you have an alt-left. Black Lives Matter is part of the alt-left and so we've got alt-left, alt-right and they get engaged to disturbed people and have people so upset that they cannot think.\u000a\u000a"And so I believe that the president's calling us to reason and saying let's get the facts and then act. Of course, he does not support segregation, the Ku Klux Klan and all of that. He's very clear and he said that over and over and he said it several times yesterday."\u000a\u000aKing said she is also in favor of leaving Confederate memorials in place instead of removing them from public spaces.\u000a\u000a"A good friend helped me to consolidate my thoughts on that. She tweeted me and she said no, leave the statues up. Let me tell you why. People will forget their history if they don't see it. And people are emotionally attached to them," she said.\u000a\u000a"So leave them up, but then put up another statue as well and name it \u2018liberty' or \u2018everybody's equal' or \u2018we love everybody' -- whatever you want to name [it]."\u000a\u000a"We don't want to forget our history, but we want to see how far we have come and how far we can go together. There's a scripture: 'be not overcome evil, overcome evil with good.' So if you erase your history, you'll forget it and you may have to repeat it. So we do not want to erase our history."

aVAre new medicines for people with out-of-control cholesterol wildly overpriced? It's a question that's sparking debate among consumers and providers of care.\u000a\u000aNow, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) report that the price of these drugs -- called PCSK9 inhibitors -- would have to be slashed by a whopping 71 percent to be deemed cost-effective.\u000a\u000aPCSK9 inhibitors are a relatively new class of medicines for treating patients whose LDL (bad) cholesterol isn't well-controlled on statins or who cannot tolerate statins. Lipitor (atorvastatin) and Crestor (rosuvastatin) are examples of first-line statins doctors typically prescribe to patients with high cholesterol.\u000a\u000aThe UCSF team didn't question whether these new medicines are effective in reducing heart attacks and strokes.\u000a\u000a"These are super awesome drugs, they really work," said study co-author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo.\u000a\u000aBut the price is "far in excess" of what would be considered a reasonable cost for the clinical benefit they provide, added Bibbins-Domingo, a UCSF professor of medicine, epidemiology and biostatistics.\u000a\u000aThe list price of these newer PCSK9 drugs is upwards of $14,000 a year per patient.\u000a\u000aDr. Kim Allan Williams, who was not involved in the study, is past president of the American College of Cardiology. He said some doctors have a difficult time with such studies because they compare patients' lives and "events" -- such as heart attack and stroke -- versus dollars spent on these medicines.\u000a\u000aThe new study doesn't change his view of the value of the PCSK9 inhibitor class.\u000a\u000a"No one's giving those drugs unless the patient is incapable of getting to the target [level of LDL cholesterol]," said Williams, who is chief of cardiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. "You're only going to use it for a situation where you have no choice."\u000a\u000aBecause the study is based on list prices, not what patients actually pay, it's also "difficult to analyze the cost-effectiveness when [you] don't know exactly what the cost is," Williams added.\u000a\u000aHe said he's had patients with copays of $380 a month and others who had zero copays because the cost was completely covered by insurance. He worries, though, that poor patients may not be offered the same access to these medicines.\u000a\u000aThe CSF researchers designed the study to find out how much bang for the buck these drugs actually provide.\u000a\u000aTheir study updates a prior cost-effectiveness analysis using current list prices as well as results of a recent clinical trial. That trial demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of Repatha (evolocumab), one of two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\u000a\u000aBased on a simulation involving 8.9 million adults who would meet trial criteria, adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins would prevent 2.9 million more heart attacks and strokes compared with adding Zetia (ezetimibe), another type of medication that blocks the production of cholesterol by the liver.\u000a\u000aBut the PCSK9 inhibitor class is not cost-effective based on a threshold of $100,000 for each life year gained, the study authors contend. They found that you would have to spend $450,000 per year to get one extra year of life per year.\u000a\u000a"The price would have to be between $4,000 and $5,000 [per year] for it to be cost-effective," said Bibbins-Domingo. "If you look in other countries, in Europe, for example, that is in fact where this drug is priced."\u000a\u000aDr. Josh Ofman, senior vice president of global value, access and policy at Amgen Inc., the maker of Repatha, took issue with the findings. "We think that their model is deeply flawed," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study was based a 3 percent per-year rate of heart attacks and strokes, while other studies use much higher rates -- more than three times higher -- based on "real-world" data, Ofman said. The study is modeling a population that's not having many heart attacks and strokes, he said.\u000a\u000aOfman also questioned the threshold for determining cost-effectiveness that the UCSF researchers used. He said other organizations use a minimum of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.\u000a\u000aAs for the price differential between the United States and Europe, Ofman cited many factors, from government price controls to how those countries price these drugs.\u000a\u000aAmgen isn't alone in its criticism of how these medicines are valued. Earlier this month, several national provider and payer groups raised concerns about how the PCSK9 inhibitors are valued in a letter to the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses the value of new medicines.\u000a\u000aMore than a dozen organizations, including the National Forum for Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention, the American Pharmacists Association Foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, signed the letter citing concerns ranging from the types of patients that could benefit from these drugs to the importance of preventing heart attacks and strokes -- not just deaths.\u000a\u000a"The big controversy about all these types of analyses is what we're willing to value a patient's year of life at," Ofman said.\u000a\u000aThe new study was published in the Aug. 22/29 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

aVA Louisiana boy saved his two twin cousins from drowning in a family pool Sunday, even though he did not know how to swim.\u000a\u000aBranson Lee, a first-grader in Calhoun, Louisiana, is being praised for pulling his relatives, Kaden and Isaac Kelley, 2, from the pool Sunday evening after a pool party where the door to the area was left unlocked, the Monroe News-Star reported.\u000a\u000aCourtney Lee, Branson's mother, told the newspaper it only took minutes in the middle of saying goodbye to her sister before the twins, who were watching television, wandered to the pool area and were face down when Brandon went into action.\u000a\u000aBranson, who does not know how to swim, jumped into the shallow end of the pool and managed to reach the twins and pull them out, ABC News reported.\u000a\u000a"My nephew happened to be walking outside because his little brother, who is the same age as my boys, was wandering outside too," Jeanie Kelley told the News-Star. "He saw his brother (walk toward the pool) and grabbed him, and that is when he saw my babies. And he ran outside and grabbed them and pulled them up out of the pool and started yelling for us."\u000a\u000aShe said the boys were blue and limp and called their survival a "total miracle."\u000a\u000aFamily members told ABC News that they had not realized that the boys had made their way to the pool area in such a short time.\u000a\u000a"We ran out there and they were laying on the side of the pool and were completely blue and completely lifeless," Kelley said, ABC News noted. "My husband immediately fell down to his knees and started doing compressions and CPR. He is a first responder."\u000a\u000aThe twin boys started showing signs of consciousness again just when emergency crews arrived, and they were taken via helicopter to University Health in Shreveport, Louisiana. The twin boys were playing with each other and appeared to be in good health Monday, the News-Star stated.\u000a\u000aCourtney Lee told the News-Star that she was proud of the way her son reacted and his determination to save his cousins.\u000a\u000a"He said he just dove in," Courtney Lee said to the newspaper. "All he knew is he had to try to save them ... It was a miraculous thing to know that at 6-years-old he didn't just scream and run away. He didn't just ignore it or stand there in shock. He just immediately acted and allowed God to do the rest."

aVDon Nichols, self-described "mountain man," was released on parole on Wednesday in Montana after serving 32 years for kidnapping a world-class athlete out on a training run in 1984 and killing her would-be rescuer.\u000a\u000aThe attack drew widespread media coverage and became the subject of a made-for-TV movie, The Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000aNichols, who must report to a parole office in Great Falls, was granted parole in April, The Missoulian.\u000a\u000aNichols, 86, was sentenced to 85 years in prison for kidnapping biathlete Kari Swenson in the mountains near Big Sky and killing Alan Goldstein, a friend helping to search for Swenson when she failed to return home from her run.\u000a\u000aSwenson, who was 22, said she was chained up during her ordeal and spotted her would-be rescuers before her abductors did. She yelled at them to leave because Nichols had threatened to shoot anyone who tried to help her.\u000a\u000aNichols shot Goldstein, and Nichols' son Dan apparently accidently shot Swenson. She said she was left for dead with a "sucking chest wound" for hours as Goldstein's body lay nearby.\u000a\u000aDon and Dan Nichols fled and were arrested five months later after a manhunt in the mountains of southwestern Montana.\u000a\u000aDuring the parole hearing in April, board members noted Nichols' clean record in his more than 30 years in prison and his completion of educational programs, including anger management and life skills.\u000a\u000aDon Nichols, who kidnapped Swenson to be a bride for his then 19-year-old son, told the board members they would not regret their decision and he felt bad about his crimes.\u000a\u000aBefore Don Nichols' 2012 parole hearing, Kari Swenson wrote a letter to The Bozeman Daily Chronicle calling the father and son "crazy misfits" who chose to live apart from society and defy its laws.\u000a\u000a"I endured being grabbed by both wrists, hit in the face, thrown to the ground, chained to Dan, threatened with knives and guns, marched through the woods, secured like an animal to trees and spent a terrifying night chained next to Dan," she wrote.\u000a\u000aShe said she spent years in counseling and still has shrapnel in her chest that hurts her and brings back haunting memories of the ordeal that ended her athletic career.\u000a\u000aDan Nichols was convicted of kidnapping and assault and was released from prison in 1991.\u000a\u000aThe case was the subject of a 1987 made-for-TV movie "The Abduction of Kari Swenson," starring Tracy Pollan. It was featured in an episode of Investigation Discovery's TV show "Your Worst Nightmare."

Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a type of depression that occurs during certain time periods of the year, typically starting in the fall and winter months when less sunlight is available in many areas of the country and world. According to WebMD , about 36 million people suffer from SAD in the winter months, with women reporting more instances of it than men. It typically begins in young adulthood. It rarely occurs in people living within 30 degrees of the equator where sunlight year-round is plentiful.The cause is neurobiological, WebMD noted, adding that "it is thought that brain areas which regulate mood and operate using the neurotransmitter serotonin may not function properly" during certain seasons. While winter SAD is most common, there is also a summer version of SAD as well.Noted WebMD of its causes: "Hormones manufactured in the brain that are affected by sunlight exposure may play a role in the development of SAD and its symptoms of depressed mood, fatigue, carbohydrate cravings, and weight gain. Because foods high in carbohydrates (like chips, pretzels, and cookies) boost serotonin, it is thought that they have a soothing effect on the body and mind." According to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s MedlinePlus website , symptoms may include sad or anxious feelings, feelings of hopelessness or guilt, irritability, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems, weight changes, and thoughts of suicide. Treatments for SAD, according to the Mayo Clinic , include light therapy, antidepressants, and sometimes psychotherapy. With light therapy, a patient would sit near a unit that emits bright light for a time period each day."Light therapy is one of the first-line treatments for fall-onset SAD. It generally starts working in a few days to two weeks and causes few side effects. Research on light therapy is limited, but it appears to be effective for most people in relieving SAD symptoms," the Mayo Clinic said.Some SAD patients also take medications for depression like Wellbutrin XL, or Aplenzin, among others. Talk therapy is also recommended to help SAD sufferers cope and manage their stress.

aVPresident Donald Trump is likely to rescind an Obama-era policy that protects nearly 600,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally as children and are known as "Dreamers," according to media reports on Friday.\u000a\u000aTrump's decision on whether to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy could be announced as early as next week, reported ABC News, citing multiple sources.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior White House officials on Thursday, according to an administration official.\u000a\u000aDepartment of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan denied reports that the department had made any recommendations on DACA to the White House. "There have been continuing discussions about DACA but nothing has been determined," Lapan told Reuters.\u000a\u000aWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday that the program continues to be under review. A White House spokesperson told Reuters that only Congress can legislate a permanent solution for the plight of children who are currently protected from deportation by DACA.\u000a\u000aTrump had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of former President Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration, including DACA.\u000a\u000aImmigrant advocates reacted to the news with a flurry of statements, promising to defend the program with protest and legal action.\u000a\u000a\u201cImmigrant youth fought to create the DACA program and we will fight like hell to defend it,\u201d said Greisa Martinez Rosas, Advocacy Director and DACA-beneficiary of United We Dream said in a statement.\u000a\u000aCivil rights groups said ending the program could increase racial divisions in the country in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aTen Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued.\u000a\u000aIf the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court.\u000a\u000aThe 10 who signed the letter represent Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.\u000a\u000aA larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect.

aVSo much for a quiet Friday in late August.\u000a\u000aAfter weeks of relative slumber, gold traders were rudely awoken to a surge in volume and volatility. In a span of one minute, 21,256 gold futures contracts, equal to more than 2 million ounces, traded just before Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen addressed a gathering of policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\u000a\u000aThe episode jolted the market after a measure of 60-day volatility on the metal touched the lowest since 2005. Gold had been in quiet mode even amid political discord in Washington, concerns about rising U.S. interest rates and tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Yellen\u2019s speech, which lacked clear rate cues, did little to calm the price swings and damped expectations of a rate hike this year.\u000a\u000aThe market is \u201cbipolar,\u201d Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures, said by phone. \u201cBetween now and the end of the year, the story is going to be the Fed. The Fed was pretty hawkish coming into the year. Now it feels like they are backing away from September.\u201d\u000a\u000aGold futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,297.20 an ounce at 12:38 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after falling as much as 0.8 percent and climbing 0.7 percent to briefly pierce the $1,300 threshold.\u000a\u000aFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan may have helped fuel the sharp move before Yellen\u2019s speech by saying the central bank can afford to be patient on raising interest rates even while noting it should shrink the balance sheet soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cKaplan was dovish and sent it higher,\u201d Robin Bhar, an analyst at Societe Generale AG, said by phone Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone then got wind of what Yellen was going to say, but it then dropped like a stone. And then, when she didn\u2019t mention monetary policy, things started to stabilize again.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are crazy markets, and very difficult to trade,\u201d Bhar said of Friday\u2019s gold moves. \u201cThe net result was extreme volatility.\u201d\u000a\u000aBase metals also fluctuated Friday. Copper on the Comex dropped 0.2 percent to $3.051 at 12:42 p.m, after it fell as much as 0.5 percent and rose 0.7 percent. The metal is still on track for a seventh weekly climb, which would be the longest stretch of such gains since 2009.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look at the chart, it just exploded to the upside,\u201d Peter Thomas, senior vice president at Zaner Group LLC, said of the copper futures trading.

aVBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 Belgian prosecutors have opened an "attempted terrorist murder" probe after a knife-wielding man assaulted three soldiers and was shot dead by troops in Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Prosecutor's Office said in a statement Saturday that the man was known to police for assault charges, but had no previous terror-related offenses.\u000a\u000aThe suspect allegedly attacked the soldiers from behind with a knife in central Brussels Friday evening while shouting "Allahu akbar," Arabic for "God is great."\u000a\u000aThe statement said he was shot twice, and that two soldiers received superficial wounds. The man was also carrying a fake firearm and two copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book.\u000a\u000aThe statement said he was around 30 years old and a Belgian national of Somali origin. Authorities searched his home overnight in the city of Bruges, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Brussels. Prosecutors declined to provide further details.\u000a\u000aBelgium has been on high alert since suicide bombers killed 32 people at the main Brussels airport and a subway station on March 22, 2016.\u000a\u000aSoldiers and extra police have been deployed at public buildings and around large gatherings ever since.\u000a\u000aFriday's incident happened in an area with many bars and restaurants and not far from the Grand Place historic square, a major tourist attraction.\u000a\u000aIn a separate statement Saturday, the Brussels city prosecutor's office said it had opened a use of force inquiry into the suspect's shooting, a standard procedure when security forces discharge their weapons.\u000a\u000aIt said the soldiers were probably justified in shooting the suspect.\u000a\u000a"Initial findings from the inquiry show that the soldiers twice opened fire on the suspect after he stabbed them with the knife. These shots came, therefore, in the context of legitimate defense in line with the (troops') rules of engagement," the city prosecutors said.\u000a\u000aThe prosecutors said they would make a final ruling once the results of an autopsy on the suspect and ballistic tests are known.

aVFormer Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said Friday that President Donald Trump's pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio was "a very political act used to kind of close this chapter out."\u000a\u000a"It was political prosecution to begin with, so it's not surprising to see a pardon, which is obviously a very political act used to kind of close this chapter out," Cuccinelli, a Republican who is now president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, told John Berman on CNN.\u000a\u000a"People will view the pardon based on where they start on Sheriff Arpaio," he said. "The prosecution in 2016 was commenced the day before early voting began in Arizona.\u000a\u000a"It was a political prosecution," Cuccinelli said, adding that Arpaio lost re-election to a seventh term in November.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department first sued Arpaio for racial profiling in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe case that ultimately led to the criminal contempt charges was initially filed in 2007 by a Mexican tourist who had been stopped in Maricopa County.\u000a\u000aCuccinelli said did not strongly endorse Trump's pardon, telling Berman that "I am an idealist.\u000a\u000a"I wouldn't say I'm jumping up and down for joy.\u000a\u000a"I think, on balance, it was a defensible and positive thing for the president to do.\u000a\u000a"I hope future presidents, including this president, when he's on his way out, whenever that may be, won't initiate prosecution of people running for office strictly for the purpose of defeating them.\u000a\u000a"This why the timing of Sheriff Joe's prosecution was commenced when it was commenced," Cuccinelli added. "It was so he would lose the election. And he did.\u000a\u000a"That is not how prosecutions should be commenced.\u000a\u000a"It is not how they should be carried forward \u2014 and now President Trump has undone it."

aVMost Republicans support killing the estate tax as part of a tax overhaul, but doing so could have dire consequences for something else conservatives cherish -- charitable giving.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump along with top GOP lawmakers have proposed ending what they call the death tax -- a 40 percent levy that\u2019s applied to estates worth more than $5.49 million for individuals and $10.98 million for married couples. The tax affected only 0.2 percent of estates in 2015.\u000a\u000aAlthough Republicans call the levy unAmerican and say it penalizes small businesses and farmers, data from 2013 show that just 3 percent of estates subject to the tax were businesses and farms, according to the Tax Policy Center.\u000a\u000aCharitable organizations have focused their lobbying efforts on how the GOP plan for doubling the standard deduction could affect charitable giving. They argue that a higher standard write-off may keep filers from itemizing deductions, which could lessen any tax incentive for charitable giving. Abolishing the estate tax -- a move that would be popular among many charities\u2019 largest donors -- so far hasn\u2019t engendered the same level of opposition, despite a similar effect on giving.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt clearly has a very, very significant negative impact on charitable giving,\u201d said Hadar Susskind, who runs government relations for the Council on Foundations, a philanthropic network that encourages charitable giving. \u201cIt\u2019s not all done for tax benefits, but it\u2019s also really clear that\u2019s an important driver.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Policy Nuances\u2019\u000a\u000aIn 2010, when the estate tax was temporarily repealed, gross charitable bequests in IRS tax filings totaled $7.49 billion -- a 37 percent drop from $11.9 billion the previous year. The tax returned in 2011, and charitable bequests soared to $14.36 billion.\u000a\u000aWilliam Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said there\u2019s \u201cno argument\u201d that the estate tax leads to higher charitable giving. \u201cCharitable contributions are highly concentrated among very wealthy households,\u201d he said. \u201cIt encourages people to give during life as well.\u201d\u000a\u000aSusskind said the foundations council is speaking with lawmakers including chief House tax writer Kevin Brady to explain how cutting the top tax rate, increasing the standard deduction and removing the estate tax could reduce charitable giving. Susskind said Brady has been willing to hear suggestions about ways to keep charitable giving intact.\u000a\u000a\u201cKilling the death tax is the perfect example of why tax reform is hard,\u201d said Sage Eastman, a Republican strategist and former counselor to the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cIt sounds great and has a good coalition behind it, but then you run into policy nuances like how it impacts the insurance industry and charitable giving.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe insurance industry sells products to help wealthy people arrange their assets to stay under the estate tax threshold.\u000a\u000aConservative Support\u000a\u000aWhile most GOP members support repealing the estate tax, there may be a couple of outliers. Senator Susan Collins of Maine voted against a nonbinding budget measure to scrap the estate tax in 2015. And Senator Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who\u2019s been critical of the president, said he questioned whether ending the estate tax would be that stimulative for economic growth.\u000a\u000aStill, for some lawmakers, like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the decision isn\u2019t complicated. \u201cI want to preserve charitable contributions, but I definitely want to get rid of the estate tax,\u201d said Jordan, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \u201cIt\u2019s peoples\u2019 money. It\u2019s their families\u2019 money. It\u2019s not the government\u2019s money.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the principle behind repeal of the estate tax overrides whatever second order consequences there might be with respect to current estate planning strategies,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, a former deputy chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000aCost of Giving\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Chairman Brady told reporters last week that Republicans are exploring \u201cfresh ideas\u201d to boost charitable giving, but didn\u2019t specify any.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want Americans to give more to their church, to the scouts, to the causes they believe in,\u201d Brady said during a tax event at the Reagan Ranch in California.\u000a\u000aAnd he said that if Americans have more money as a result of a tax overhaul, they\u2019ll give more to charity.\u000a\u000aUna Osili, an economics professor at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University, disputes that notion. Osili said the amount of money donors give is dependent on their income and the cost of giving -- so incentives to reduce that cost will increase donations.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a conflict, no question,\u201d for Republicans, Gale said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll let the charitable sector get in their way.\u201d

aVNews that Iran's and Turkey's governments reached an accord on Idlib, a Syrian town now the focus of American interests, brings relations between two of the largest and most influential states in the Mideast momentarily out of the shadows.\u000a\u000aTheir rivalry goes back a half-millennium, included eleven wars, and now remains, in the words of the Washington Institute's Soner Cagaptay, the region's "oldest power game." What does the recent accord signify and how will their competition influence the region's future?\u000a\u000aIranian and Turkish parallels are noteworthy. Both countries have populations of 80 million. (Egypt, the region's third large country, has 96 million.) Both boast ancient civilizations, long imperial histories, tensions with Russia, and a successful avoidance of European colonialism. In modern times, each came under the rule of a ruthless modernizer after World War I, followed more recently by an even more repressive Islamist.\u000a\u000aThe current leaders, Iran's Ali Khamene'i and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, enjoy near-absolute power and both feverishly try to hide this reality under a large and noisy apparatus of elections, parliaments, cabinets, laws, and NGOs. Both aspire to lead the entire Muslim community, perhaps someday claiming to be caliph. In an era of muted anti-Zionism from Arab states, Tehran and Ankara now lead the charge, with the Islamic Republic of Iran loudly denying the Holocaust and the Republic of Turkey comparing Israelis to Nazis.\u000a\u000aIn several ways, Iranians lead Turks, but the latter are catching up. Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979 and Erdo\u011fan in 2002. Iran has long enjoyed massive oil and gas reserves but Turkey recently built an impressive economic base. Tehran deploys forces abroad, dominating four Arab capitals, while Ankara still fights domestic opponents, especially Glenists and Kurds. Both governments despise the West but Iran's is openly hostile, while Turkey's formally remains in NATO and ostensibly seeks European Union (EU) membership.\u000a\u000aKhamene'i's thugs capture American sailors on the high seas while Erdo\u011fan's take residents hostage. Conspiracy theories, long an Iranian art form, have made huge strides over the past two decades in Turkey, which may now boast the region's most fantastical speculations. Both became enthusiastic allies of Venezuela's dictator, Nicols Maduro. As head of a longer-established dictatorship, Khamene'i can allow relative freedom of expression compared with Erdo\u011fan's obsessive desire to control, including what basketball players in the United States say or what travelers transiting through Istanbul airport think.\u000a\u000aTheir most major difference concerns the attitudes of their subjects. Whereas Khamenei enjoys the support of only about 15 percent of the populace, Erdo\u011fan can count on some 45 percent, affording Erdo\u011fan a legitimacy and confidence that Khamene'i can only dream of. In part, this results from longevity under Islamist rule, in part from difference in per capita income, which is only $4,700 U.S. and stagnant in Iran, $10,700 and rising in Turkey.\u000a\u000aRegime collapse in Iran is within sight and will diminish Islamism, encouraging Muslims to move toward a more modern and moderate form of their religion. The Turkish government's greater popularity and more advanced version of Islamism gives it greater staying power that makes it the more worrisome long-term opponent. Thus, the Mideast is likely to witness a grand switch, with Iran on course to moderation and Turkey becoming the region's supreme danger.\u000a\u000aBilateral relations flourished during the first years of Erdo\u011fan's rule (2002-10), when they shared an Islamist worldview and a suspicion of U.S. intentions in Iraq. But relations then soured, primarily because both regimes seek foreign influence and, as neighbors, they inevitably clash. The civil war in Syria, where Tehran backs Shi'ite-oriented jihadis and Ankara backs Sunni jihadis, is their biggest but not only problem. Other matters also aggravate relations, such as their supporting opposing sides in Yemen, Turkish installation of a NATO radar tracking Iranian activities, and Iranian support for al-Qaida against Turkey.\u000a\u000aTensions have reached the point that Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group finds Tehran and Ankara "on a collision course." Left unchecked, he expects the present dynamics to point "toward greater bloodshed, growing instability and greater risks of direct . . . military confrontation." More poetically, Cagaptay observes that the Mideast has room for "one shah or sultan, but not a shah and a sultan."\u000a\u000aIn this context, the Idlib accord looks flimsy and transient. Tehran and Ankara will probably soon turn against each other and with renewed vigor continue their perpetual rivalry.\u000a\u000aDaniel Pipes, a historian, is president of the Middle East Forum.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new Venezuelan government debt and state oil company debt in an effort to pressure President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s \u201cdictatorship\u201d to halt its \u201ctyranny,\u201d the White House said on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe order marks a significant escalation in recent sanctions imposed by Washington against Maduro and senior officials in his government to punish them for what the Trump administration sees as their role in undermining democracy in the oil-producing country.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese measures are carefully calibrated to deny the Maduro dictatorship a critical source of financing to maintain its illegitimate rule, protect the United States financial system from complicity in Venezuela\u2019s corruption and in the impoverishment of the Venezuelan people,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,\u201d it said.\u000a\u000aThe executive order prohibits dealings in new debt and equity issued by the Venezuelan government and its state-run oil company PDVSA as well as in some existing bonds owned by the public sector. It also prohibits payment of dividends to the Venezuelan government, the White House said.\u000a\u000aWhile the executive order protects holders of many existing Venezuelan government and PDVSA bonds, it will make the refinancing of PDVSA\u2019s hefty debt burden difficult and could further push the country toward financing from Russia and China.\u000a\u000aYields on Venezuela\u2019s benchmark 2038 sovereign bond and those of state-run oil company PDVSA\u2019s benchmark 2037 bond rose modestly after the announcement of the latest round of U.S. sanctions.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithout a doubt restructuring and swaps are no longer possible now,\u201d said a broker in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aSome bondholders expressed relief that the measures were not a widespread ban on trading of existing bonds.\u000a\u000aTrump's order allows the U.S. Treasury to provide licenses for dealings in select existing Venezuelan debts and many commercial and humanitarian transactions, including those for commercial trade and petroleum trade as well as for transactions involving only PDVSA's U.S. unit, Citgo Petroleum.\u000a\u000aWashington on Aug. 9 imposed sanctions against eight individuals, including the brother of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.

aVNew American research has found that for patients who suffer from sleep deprivation before surgery, caffeine before the operation could be an alternative way to reduce post-operative pain associated with a lack of sleep.\u000a\u000aPrevious research has shown that a lack of sleep both pre- and post-op can worsen pain after surgery. This new study from the Department of Anesthesiology at Michigan Medicine set out to see if there were any interventions that could help minimize the effect of sleep loss and reduce the severity of pain experienced after surgery.\u000a\u000aThe team focused on caffeine as a potential treatment, which may seem surprising given that caffeine is a stimulant to increase alertness.\u000a\u000a"Most people would be confused by the idea of using caffeine while we insist on the dangers of not getting enough sleep," noted study author Giancarlo Vanini, M.D.\u000a\u000aHowever, as caffeine blocks the actions of the sleep-inducing neurotransmitter adenosine, causing us to feel more awake, the team proposed that caffeine might counteract the negative impact of sleep deprivation on surgical pain.\u000a\u000a"Insufficient sleep enhances pain perception, so we reasoned that caffeine might also be useful for reversing the increase in pain caused by sleep loss," Vanini said.\u000a\u000aThe team used a rat model of surgical pain to test whether sleep deprivation before surgery would increase postoperative pain, and whether being given caffeine pre-emptively, before the sleep deprivation, would block the increase in postoperative pain caused by this lack of sleep.\u000a\u000aThe results showed that sleep deprivation before surgery did indeed increase postoperative pain, and also extended recovery time after surgery.\u000a\u000aHowever, as the team hypothesized, caffeine helped mitigate the negative effects of insufficient sleep prior to surgery, blocking the increase in surgical pain.\u000a\u000aVanini explained that caffeine's positive effect may be due to its role in blocking neurochemical changes caused by sleep deprivation in the brain areas that control sleep and wakefulness, and are connected to major pain-related areas.\u000a\u000a"These results are relevant because sleep disorders and insufficient sleep are highly prevalent problems in our society," he added.

aVVeterans may deal with difficulties when returning home. The problems facing disabled vets can complicate their transitioning process, but these men and women have many resources to turn to that offer assistance and even financial help.\u000a\u000aThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a good place to find available services for vets who have a disability because of their military service. Vets can learn about the eligibility requirements and what types of benefits they can receive.\u000a\u000aVets can also contact the various organizations that offer vital services.\u000a\u000aHere are six resources for disabled veterans:\u000a\u000a1. Transportation \u2014 Vans operated by the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) take injured and ill veterans to VA medical facilities for free. The program is available around the country. DAV and the Ford Motor Company purchased more than 3,000 vehicles and donated them to the VA for free transportation to vets.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a2. Education on wheels \u2014 The DAV has a mobile service offices (MSO) program that travels to small towns and rural communities to counsel and educate vets and their families on available benefits and services. It helps with claims and bringing benefits to disabled veterans.\u000a\u000a3. Housing assistance \u2014 Many veterans experience homelessness because of their disabilities. The VA works with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the HUD-VASH program that provides rental assistance for vets eligible for VA healthcare services.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000\u000a\u000a4. Next Step Service Dogs \u2014 NSSD is a nonprofit organization that provides trained service dogs to vets with invisible disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. There is an application fee, but training programs for the dogs are at no charge for vets. The service dogs offer vets help, balance support, safety, and even things such as turning on lights.\u000a\u000a5. Wings for Warriors \u2014 The organization has resources for wounded vets to help them through the recovery process. Vets can find guidance and counseling to help secure healthcare and financial benefits. Family members may receive financial assistance to travel to medical facilities to visit their loved ones.\u000a\u000a6. Veterans Crisis Line \u2014 Disabled veterans going through emotional stress can talk on the phone or chat online with trained people, many of them vets themselves. They help vets and their families take on the challenges veterans face. There are even text-messaging services.\u000a\u000aImportant: Gingrich and Reagan Video Goes Viral. See It Now

aVTen civilians, including three children, were killed in a raid by foreign and Somali forces on a farm in southern Somalia, a deputy governor said Friday as officials displayed victims' bloodied bodies in the capital. The U.S. military confirmed it supported a Somali operation in the area.\u000a\u000aThe farmers were killed "one by one" after soldiers stormed the farm in Barire village early Friday, the deputy governor of Lower Shabelle region, Ali Nur Mohamed, told reporters in Mogadishu.\u000a\u000aThree children aged 8 to 10 and a woman were among the dead, the official said, calling the attack a "real genocide." Their blanket-wrapped bodies were laid out in a grassy courtyard for display. Bodies of civilians, especially those killed in misdirected attacks, often are taken from remote areas to Mogadishu to draw media attention.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Africa Command confirmed that U.S. forces were supporting the Somalia National Army while it conducted an operation in the area. It gave no details about the operation. The U.S. military has stepped up efforts this year against the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab, often in support of Somali forces.\u000a\u000a"These local farmers were attacked by foreign troops while looking after their crops," the deputy governor told reporters. "The troops could have arrested them because they were unarmed but instead shot them one by one mercilessly."\u000a\u000aA statement by Somalia's information ministry said the raid on the farm killed eight al-Shabab fighters and that extremists began shooting at Somali forces after they entered. "No civilians were harmed or killed in this operation," the statement said.\u000a\u000aAl-Shabab, which has become the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, continues to hold vast areas of rural Somalia after being chased out of major cities in recent years by a multinational African Union force and Somali forces. The group continues to threaten the fragile central government and carry out deadly attacks in neighboring countries, notably Kenya.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, President Donald Trump approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, including more aggressive airstrikes and considering parts of southern Somalia areas of active hostilities.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. and Somalia in recent weeks said strikes have killed al-Shabab leaders responsible for planning and executing deadly attacks in Mogadishu, where high-profile areas such as hotels and military checkpoints are often targeted with deadly bombings.

aVHurricane Harvey was hours away from lashing the Texas coast on Friday with winds of up to 156 miles per hour and 13-foot ocean surges as the most powerful storm in over a decade bore down on the mainland United States.\u000a\u000aHarvey strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane with cities from northern Mexico to Louisiana bracing for flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was expected to hit land near Corpus Christi, Texas, around 9 p.m. CDT (0200 GMT) then stall and dump over 3 feet (90 cm) of rain in areas of the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana as it lingers for days.\u000a\u000aWhile thousands fled the expected devastating flooding and destruction, many residents defied mandatory evacuation orders and stocked up on food, fuel and sandbags.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re suggesting if people are going to stay here, mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and Social Security number," Rockport Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios told reporters Friday, according to media reports. "We hate to talk about things like that. It's not something we like to do but it\u2019s the reality. People don\u2019t listen."\u000a\u000aAs many as 5.8 million people were believed to be in the storm's path.\u000a\u000aIn Corpus Christi, a city of 320,000 under voluntary evacuation, strengthening winds buffeted the few trucks and cars that continued to circulate on the streets. The storm toppled wooden roadwork signs and littered the streets with pieces of palm trees as white caps rocked sailboats in their docks.\u000a\u000aAbout 85 miles (137 km) north in Victoria, Mayor Paul Polasek told CNN he estimated that 60 percent to 65 percent of the town\u2019s 65,000 residents defied the mandatory evacuation order.\u000a\u000aJose Rengel, a 47-year-old who works in construction, said he was one of the few people in Jamaica Beach in Galveston that did not heed a voluntary evacuation order.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll the shops are empty,\u201d he said as the sky turned black and rain fell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tornado went in and swept everything up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbout 20,000 passengers were riding out the storm aboard three cruise ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\u000a\u000aAs a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Harvey could uproot trees, destroy homes and disrupt utilities for days. If it maintains its intensity, it would be the first major hurricane to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.\u000a\u000aThe storm was about 45 miles (70 km) off Corpus Christi and packing winds of 130 mph (215 kph), the NHC said. The NHC's latest tracking model shows the storm sitting southwest of Houston for more than a day, giving the nation's fourth most populous city a double dose of rain and wind.\u000a\u000a"Life-threatening and devastating flooding expected near the coast due to heavy rainfall and storm surge," the NHC said.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump, facing the first large-scale natural disaster of his presidency, on Friday tweeted: "I am closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey ... BE SAFE!" Earlier, a White House official said the president was considering a request to issue an emergency declaration, providing federal disaster relief.\u000a\u000aLouisiana and Texas declared states of disaster, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare.\u000a\u000aThe city of Houston warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches (60 cm) of rain over several days.\u000a\u000aHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner advised city residents not to leave en masse, saying "no evacuation orders have been issued for the city." Chaotic traffic from a rushed evacuation in 2005 with Hurricane Rita proved tragic. "Calm and care!" he said in a tweet.\u000a\u000aGASOLINE PRICES SPIKE\u000a\u000aGasoline stations on the south Texas coast were running out of fuel as thousands of residents fled the region. U.S. gasoline prices spiked as the storm shut down 22 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production, according to the U.S. government.\u000a\u000aAt a Willis, Texas, station, about 50 miles (77 km) north of Houston, Corey Martinez, 40, was heading to Dallas from his Corpus Christi home.\u000a\u000a"It has been pretty stressful. We're just trying to get ahead of the storm," he said. "We've never been through a hurricane before."\u000a\u000aMore than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and others have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms.\u000a\u000aConcern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to their highest in four months, before profit taking pulled back prices. Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline margins hit their strongest levels in five years for this time of year.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government said it would make emergency stockpiles of crude available if needed to plug disruptions. It has regularly used them to dampen the impact of previous storms on energy supplies.

aVA price war has raged in U.S. supermarket aisles for well over a year, bloodying retailers big and small. On Monday, Amazon.com Inc. plans to toss a smart bomb into the fray.\u000a\u000aThe online giant\u2019s move to slash prices on everything from organic baby kale to fair-trade bananas on the same day its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. closes showed the \u201chigh-velocity decision making\u201d Amazon founder Jeff Bezos claims as his hallmark, and sent shares of Kroger Co., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reeling Thursday. Amazon will also begin selling Whole Foods\u2019 store brands on its site, install Amazon pickup lockers in some locations and meld its Prime program into the upscale grocer\u2019s operations.\u000a\u000aWhile this won\u2019t exactly bring responsibly farmed salmon to the masses -- after all, Whole Foods stores will remain in high-rent neighborhoods -- the price reductions could draw in curious new shoppers and present brick-and-mortar retailers with a dilemma. Do they follow suit and see their margins squeezed, or hold fast and risk sacrificing sales in one of the few areas of the food industry that\u2019s actually growing?\u000a\u000a\u201cChanging prices across the board is not a simple process for most retailers,\u201d said Greg Portell, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney. \u201cIt takes time and labor. What Amazon has done is bring a level of dynamic pricing that will have to be matched by anybody selling food. It will disrupt the way the sector works.\u201d\u000a\u000aKroger shares slumped 8.1 percent Thursday, while Costco dropped 5 percent. Friday, shares of Royal Ahold Delhaize NV, the Dutch company that operates the Giant Food and Food Lion chains, dropped as much as 7.3 percent in Amsterdam.\u000a\u000aAmazon is less constrained by profit expectations thanks to a tech-industry ethos that values growth above everything. So it can tinker with the prices of organic eggs, almond butter and rotisserie chicken, experimenting with what gets customers to respond and then doubling down on those successful bets.\u000a\u000aUp until a couple of years ago, the grocery price war had largely been fought over mainstream products like soda, soup and cereal, leaving higher-end organics to compete on quality. Organic products still have fatter margins, giving Amazon more room to experiment on pricing.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you think about Amazon\u2019s dynamic pricing, it is taking a 21st-century technology and putting it in front of consumers in a new venue,\u201d said Ken Harris, managing partner at Cadent Consulting Group. \u201cConsumers have come to expect it in other places but not their neighborhood supermarket. So it\u2019s profound, and other retailers have to take notice.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor years, organic food was a niche category, but Whole Foods showed there was growing demand as it opened more than 400 stores across the country. Eventually, major chains like Wal-Mart and Kroger responded by stocking more organic items. U.S. consumers bought more organic fare than ever before in 2016, with sales increasing 8.4 percent to $47 billion and accounting for more than 5 percent of all food sales in the country, according to the Organic Trade Association.\u000a\u000aBut as organics became more widespread, the traditional supermarkets undercut Whole Foods on price, and the chain\u2019s same-store sales have fallen for eight straight quarters as it struggled to respond. It introduced a new store format called 365 that offered less expensive items to attract younger, budget-conscious shoppers. But the declines continued, and the company had only opened a handful of 365 locations before Amazon pounced in mid-June.\u000a\u000aThat makes having Amazon behind Whole Foods all the more important, according to Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Even before the deal, the grocer was offering more discounts to combat its \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d reputation and investing in a rewards program. Amazon will speed those efforts by layering on discounts for Prime members, who are typically shopping at Whole Foods already. Nearly two-thirds of Whole Foods\u2019 regular customers are Prime members, according to retail consultancy Magid.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhole Foods customers are very Amazon-savvy,\u201d said Matt Sargent, Magid\u2019s senior vice president of retail. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing but with this deal, Amazon bought the same customers it already had. So they have to expand beyond current Whole Foods customers by offering more value.\u201d Whether Amazon can convert those value-seekers into long-term customers will be the challenge, Barthashus said.\u000a\u000aAmazon\u2019s rapid price moves could also backfire, some analysts said. If the retail giant is unable to move quickly enough to adjust price tags in the store to reflect the discounts it\u2019s advertising, the company could get called out by watchdogs and even fined by federal trade regulators, according to Cadent Consulting\u2019s Harris.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are huge risks,\u201d he said. And even with all this attention, Whole Foods is still a small player in the U.S. grocery market compared with Wal-Mart and Kroger, who together garner more than 30 percent of sales.\u000a\u000aStill, the brick-and-mortar crowd no doubt noticed Amazon\u2019s ominous note that the price cuts were \u201cjust the beginning,\u201d with more changes in the works. Bezos is fond of saying that it\u2019s always \u201cDay 1\u201d at the online giant, a reminder to maintain the aggressive, risk-taking culture of the company\u2019s inception.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, the supermarket industry will learn just what Day 1 means.

Here are five stocks facing potential complications you might consequently want to avoid in retirement.Things won\u2019t go better with Coke in the coming years, suggested The Motley Fool . It listed the soda giant in August 2015 as one of \u201c2 Dividend Stocks Retirees Should Avoid.\u201d U.S. soda sales have declined over the past decade, while that trend threatens to go global, The Motley Fool said. The stock\u2019s price per share was $39.45 as of Aug. 28, 2015, according to MSN The Motley Fool in August 2015 listed this retail giant as one of \u201c2 Dividend Stocks Retirees Should Avoid.\u201d Wal-Mart recently saw its market capitalization surpassed by Amazon, The Motley Fool noted. It suggested that was a \u201cpowerful sign of what\u2019s to come.\u201d The Fool concluded: \u201cWal-Mart came to dominance through an unbeatable combination of low prices, a wide selection of goods, and a convenient shopping experience. Now, however, Amazon is positioned to overtake the once unassailable Wal-Mart on each of those fronts.\u201d Wal-Mart\u2019s stock price per share was $64.94 as of Aug. 28, 2015, according to MSN. Kiplinger in August 2015 listed GlaxoSmithKline as a \u201cstock to avoid.\u201d It added: \u201cThe British pharmaceuticals giant is beginning to face stiff generic competition for its blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair, which accounts for 16 percent of sales; other respiratory therapies and a promising vaccine business have been slow to develop.\u201d The stock\u2019s price per share was $41.25 as of Aug. 28, 2015, according to MSN.Investors at times become too enthusiastic about companies or sectors and bid prices \u201cinto the stratosphere,\u201d said Kiplinger. It added, \u201cSometimes, this passion fuels a bubble that bursts, as it did for tech stocks in early 2000 and homebuilder stocks in early 2007.\u201d Kiplinger said a good way to protect against such occurrences is to \u201cbuy stocks that trade at less than the overall stock market\u2019s average P/E.\u201d With that strategy in mind, it suggested avoiding Tesla. The stock\u2019s price per share was $248.40 as of Aug. 28, 2015, according to MSN.Kiplinger also suggested avoiding investment in Automatic Data Processing as part of its recommended strategy of protecting against the bursting of stock market bubbles by shunning stocks that trade at more than the overall market\u2019s average P/E.

Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Amazon are the biggest companies in the world by market cap and dominate many facets of everyday life. Some critics have even suggested that they should be broken up.\u000a\u000aDuring the presidential campaign, Trump claimed Amazon was a monopoly that he would go after for antitrust violations if he were elected. Amazon takes about 70 percent of all e-book sales and 30 percent of all U.S. e-commerce. \u201cBelieve me, if I become president, do they have problems. They\u2019re going to have such problems,\u201d Trump said in February 2016. In the U.S. it isn\u2019t illegal to have a large market share.\u000a\u000aA rash of chains have filed for bankruptcy this year, including Payless Inc., Gymboree and HHGregg Inc. and RadioShack. And the biggest department-store companies, such as Macy\u2019s Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co., are shuttering hundreds of locations. The total number of store closings is expected to hit a record in the U.S. this year, with Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Christian Buss estimating that the number could exceed 8,000.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, Amazon is hiring rapidly. The online behemoth has pledged to hire more than 100,000 workers by 2018 and has been holding job fairs all over the U.S. In some cases, fired department store workers are ending up at Amazon fulfillment centers.\u000a\u000aAmazon has been battling a number of politicians from both the U.S. and Europe about its stance on tax. In the U.S., Amazon previously fought to only collect sales taxes for purchases in states where it doesn\u2019t have a physical presence. Now it has a legion of distribution centers and collects sales tax in every state that has one.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. retailer is currently fighting the European Union over its tax bill, while in March it won a $1.5 billion tax dispute with the IRS.

aVWhen making the choices about health, it is critical to have accurate information. Otherwise, our diet and lifestyle sacrifices, for which we sometimes give up things we enjoy, may kill us instead of helping.\u000a\u000aI would like to look at six common, and simply wrong, medical myths about things we avoid for our health, and then let\u2019s look at what the science really shows.\u000a\u000aMyth: 1 Skinny People Live Longer. Being overweight won\u2019t kill you \u2014 it may even help you live longer. That\u2019s the latest from a study that analyzed data on 11,326 Canadian adults ages 25 and older who were followed over a 12-year period.\u000a\u000aThe report, published online last week in the journal Obesity, found that, overall, people who were overweight but not obese were actually less likely to die than people of normal weight.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, people who were underweight were more likely to die than those of average weight. Their risk of dying was 73 percent higher than that of normal weight people, while the risk of dying for those who were overweight was 17 percent lower than for people of normal weight.\u000a\u000aThe finding adds to a simmering scientific controversy over the optimal weight for adults.\u000a\u000aMedical Myth 2: Salt is Bad for You. That myth has been well busted. Repeated studies show that people with higher salt intakes live longer.\u000a\u000aMedical Myth 3: Oily Food is Bad for You. This depends on the kind of fat. Trans fats (added to many processed foods \u2014 especially margarine, which was touted as more "heart healthy" than butter) is a major killer. Butter is much healthier.\u000a\u000aFish oil is especially healthy. Omega-3 deficiency is the sixth biggest killer of Americans and more deadly than excess trans fat intake, according to a new study.\u000a\u000aHarvard University researchers looked at 12 dietary, lifestyle and metabolic risk factors such as tobacco smoking and high blood pressure and used a mathematical model to determine how many fatalities could have been prevented if better practices had been observed.\u000a\u000aThe study, jointly funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Association of Schools of Public Health, drew on 2005 data from the U.S. National Health Center for Health Statistics.\u000a\u000aThey determined that there were 72,000-96,000 preventable deaths each year due to omega-3 deficiency, compared to 63,000-97,000 for high trans fat intake.\u000a\u000aMedical Myth 4: Eggs Raise Cholesterol and are Bad for You. Studies show that eating six eggs a day for six weeks had no significant effect on cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, eggs are the best (most complete) protein source available.\u000a\u000aMedical Myth 5: Chocolate is Bad. Dark chocolate has been shown to be high in antioxidants and offers numerous health benefits. Simply enjoy it in moderation.\u000a\u000aMedical Myth 6 (the Most Deadly Myth): Avoid Sunshine. This especially dangerous piece of bad medical advice is causing an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency, and is estimated to be causing 85,000 excess cancer deaths a year in the U.S. Vitamin D deficiency also contributes to obesity, and numerous other medical problems.\u000a\u000aThe proper advice? Avoid sunburn, not sunshine.

aVChina's largest state-owned commercial banks have vowed to raise billions to fund investment under Beijing's "Belt and Road" drive, people close to the matter said, bolstering ambitions to revive Silk Road trade routes and internationalize the yuan.\u000a\u000aHowever, many experts reportedly fear that the project could create a problem for China's banking sector \u2014 which would be a problem for the world\u000a\u000aChina Construction Bank Corp. (CCB), the country's second-biggest bank by assets, has been conducting roadshows to raise at least 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) from onshore and offshore investors, the people recently told Reuters.\u000a\u000aBank of China (BOC) , the smallest of the country's "big four" lenders, aims to raise around 20 billion yuan, two of the people said.\u000a\u000aThe fundraising comes less than a week after the government said it would strengthen regulation to reduce risk for domestic firms investing abroad and curb "irrational" Belt and Road investment.\u000a\u000aThe government is increasingly scrutinizing international investment after some big-money deals in recent years. Private spending on overseas mergers and acquisitions has since slumped in countries other than those targeted by the Belt and Road initiative, where investment for 2017 hit $33 billion this month.\u000a\u000aThat compared with $31 billion for all of 2016, Thomson Reuters data showed.\u000a\u000aCCB and BOC are raising money via their private equity or other investment platforms, as part of a broader central bank push to invest yuan overseas, one of the people said. Funds from offshore investors would be in U.S. dollars, the people said.\u000a\u000aTop lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd and third-ranked Agricultural Bank of China Ltd are also considering raising Belt and Road funds, two of the people said.\u000a\u000aThe people were not authorized to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.\u000a\u000aThe four lenders and the People's Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aHowever, experts fear the risk that the state could amass hundreds of billions of dollars in nonperforming loans if the projects fail.\u000a\u000a"The impact could be damaging not just for China, but for the global financial system," Xu Chenggang, professor of economics at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, told CNBC.\u000a\u000a"These loans are being extended to governments in risky countries to fund risky infrastructure projects. If the projects were launched by private firms we wouldn't have to worry because they would know they had to bear the consequences. But here we are talking about government-to-government lending and, ultimately, intergovernmental relations."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, research bodies are assessing risks to the political, economic and business landscapes of the involved nations.\u000a\u000a"There is no doubt in my mind that there will be a large number of projects that will have unforeseen problems," Bjorn Conrad, vice president at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told CNBC. "There are considerable risks of nonperforming credit in many of these projects and high risks of default."\u000a\u000a"A risk to China's banking system is, by default, a risk to the global banking system," he continued.\u000a\u000a"There will be an enormous amount of loans to give out, on a different scale to ever before, but also an awareness that they (the Chinese government) have to keep these at a manageable scale," Conrad said. "There will still be risks, but an understanding that they have to be managed with more scrutiny."\u000a\u000aINTERNATIONAL YUAN\u000a\u000aThe fundraising follows government calls on financial institutions to develop overseas lending businesses, targeting a combined 300 billion yuan, to help connect China with old and new trading partners under an initiative modeled on the Silk Road, which stretched from Asia to Europe for almost two millennia.\u000a\u000aRaising yuan, also known as renminbi, for overseas investment would also increase the currency's use in global trade and further its internationalization, thereby reducing exchange-rate risk and preserving China's foreign reserves.\u000a\u000a"Because those Belt and Road countries have close economic and trade ties with China, after they receive our yuan funds, they can use renminbi to pay for Chinese goods, equipment and labor," said a banker at one of the lenders with knowledge of the fundraising.\u000a\u000a"That is the overseas renminbi recycling mechanism we've envisioned and an important way to push forward the internationalization of renminbi."\u000a\u000aSenior China economist at ANZ, Betty Rui Wang, said yuan funds for overseas use would ease Chinese corporate concerns about normal funding channels being restricted by capital controls. However, there would still be foreign exchange risk, she said.\u000a\u000a"Many of those Belt and Road countries are developing economies with underdeveloped financial markets," Wang said. "Companies may need to convert yuan into local currencies after all."\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVWhite House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn has spoken "many times" with President Donald Trump about his comments on the Charlottesville violence nearly two weeks ago, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday.\u000a\u000a"The president and Gary have spoken many times," Sanders told reporters at the daily briefing. "Gary has not held back.\u000a\u000a"He has not held back on how he feels about the situation," she added. "I don't think that anyone was surprised by the comments."\u000a\u000aThe New York Times reported Friday that Cohn, who is Jewish, drafted his resignation after Trump's volatile news conference last week with reporters at Trump Tower, where he doubled down on his initial remarks that "both sides" were responsible for the unrest that killed a local woman and injured 19 others.\u000a\u000aThe day before, Cohn told The Financial Times that he was "under enormous pressure" to both resign and stay on, though choosing to remain.\u000a\u000aHowever, he told the financial publication that President Trump and the "administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning" hate groups.\u000a\u000aCohn is so far one of the few in the Trump White House to publicly condemn the president's remarks about the rally organized by white nationalist groups over the removal of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's statue from a downtown Charlottesville park.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who rejected calls from Yale University classmates and alumni to resign after Trump's comments, said Friday that "Gary is committed to being here."\u000a\u000a"There's no question he was not equating the hate groups with people who were peaceful," Mnuchin, who also is Jewish, told reporters of the president's remarks. "Under no circumstances was I going to resign.\u000a\u000a"Gary and I have known each other for 20 years. I am speaking to him every day.\u000a\u000a"His number one focus is absolutely working on tax reform with me and getting tax reform done," he said.\u000a\u000a"Gary is committed to be here \u2014 and I couldn't be more excited about that."

aVFormer undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson said Thursday that President Donald Trump has "bought into this whole notion that there is this vast, deep state that is working against him."\u000a\u000a"It's true that there have been many, many resignations throughout the administration in the intelligence world as well," Plame told Wolf Blitzer on CNN. "They felt that they simply could not support whatever his chaotic policies are at the moment.\u000a\u000a"It's undermines our national security. This is not good.\u000a\u000a"Our friends and enemies alike know that we are in complete chaos, there is no strategy," Wilson added. "And this is not good.\u000a\u000a"If there is not a fundamental trust between the intelligence community and the White House, then that's bad news."\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly attacked the nation's intelligence community \u2014 likening their actions to those of Nazi Germany even before he took office in January.\u000a\u000aFormer DNI Director James Clapper and ex-CIA Director John Brennan openly challenged Trump's fitness for office, with Clapper telling CNN on Wednesday that "I really question his ability to be . . . in this office."\u000a\u000aWilson, 54, who has a GoFundMe page to raise funds to buy a controlling stake in Twitter to close Trump's account, left the CIA in 2005.\u000a\u000aTwo years earlier, she was the center of a storm after her identity as a covert operative was leaked by an official in the Bush 43 White House to try to discredit her husband, Joe Wilson, a former diplomat who criticized the president's decision to invade Iraq.\u000a\u000aWilson told Blitzer on Thursday that she agreed the assessments of Trump by Clapper and Brennan.\u000a\u000a"Clapper was pretty direct in his words," she said. "He talked about Trump really not having the temperament, the stability, the wherewithal to be commander-in-chief \u2014 especially one that has one finger on Twitter and one finger on the nuclear codes.\u000a\u000a"It's deadly serious."\u000a\u000aTurning to Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting last year with a Russian lawyer with the hope of obtaining damaging information on Democrat Hillary Clinton, Wilson said the Kremlin's move was a "classic" strategy by its spy agencies.\u000a\u000a"It was really strange that candidate Trump, even before he had the nomination, that so many within his organization . . . were reaching out to the Russians rather than really focusing on trying to make sure they had the nomination," she said.\u000a\u000a"It is more than a coincidence.\u000a\u000a"There was definitely a Russian campaign to try to find what we would call agents of influence," Wilson added. "I don't think the Russians could look into a crystal ball and see that Trump was going to win, but they figured, why not?\u000a\u000a"Everything that we've read of how they approached and how they cultivated different contacts, this is classic KGB-FSB playbook."

aVThe debt ceiling is attracting a lot more attention, especially after President Donald Trump labeled it a "mess" on Wednesday amid growing tensions within the Republican Party. We should expect the rhetoric to get even more heated in the days and weeks ahead.\u000a\u000aIt is unlikely, however, that this will lead to a technical default by the U.S. or a repeat of the 2013 government shutdown. Instead, the most likely outcome would involve a last-minute compromise that, while it would avoid immediate damage, is likely to add to the delays in implementing the economic measures that are critically needed to deliver higher and more inclusive economic growth.\u000a\u000aEven though it has occurred 74 times in the last 55 years, the lifting of the debt ceiling has sometimes turned into a high-stakes political drama. In addition to bringing to the surface longstanding differences of opinion about the size of government and the dangers of debt, the process is complicated this time by the link to the financing of the president\u2019s controversial border wall. Moreover, differences over the whether, how and when of congressional approval -- and Trump has already tweeted that a timely opportunity has been missed by the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill -- are now playing straight into the worsening state of political posturing, blame games, and even more complicated and unpredictable games of chicken.\u000a\u000aWhile a political accident is possible, the most likely outcome is that the administration and Congress will agree to an increase in the debt ceiling before the government runs out of financing flexibility at the end of September or the beginning of October. And for a simple reason.\u000a\u000aWhen push comes to shove, neither political party will wish to be associated with a highly embarrassing downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, an unprecedented technical default for the issuer of the global reserve currency, and a highly unpopular government shutdown. This is particularly true for the Republican Party, which has majorities in both houses of Congress, and has yet to bounce back from failure to deliver on an often-repeated promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aYet the political course is far from clear for the economy and markets. There is a meaningful risk that the escalating tensions over the debt ceiling could provide more than just another short-term distraction for politicians who are already behind in implementing pro-growth economic measures.\u000a\u000aInstead, the broken glass could end up hampering subsequent agreement on the elements of tax reform, where the list of winners and losers can be devilishly divisive if the process is mishandled.\u000a\u000aAs for infrastructure, where there is more agreement in principle, politicians of the two parties might not wish to be seen collaborating ahead of next year's midterm elections.

aVStress-free traveling is just one reason why cruises are the best type of vacation. Passengers can enjoy the sights, sounds, and offerings of different faraway places while leaving the travel logistics to the ship captain.\u000a\u000aThere are plenty of activities onboard as well as the adventures that await when the ship reaches port. On top of that, there\u2019s usually not just one port but several destinations to visit. It\u2019s as if cruise passengers get several vacations in one.\u000a\u000aHere are six reasons why cruises are the best type of vacation:\u000a\u000a1. Great value \u2014 For one price, cruise travelers not only enjoy the sea, but they also have food service with meals and buffets throughout the day and night, according to ABC News. Accommodations are provided in comfy quarters and there\u2019s day and evening entertainment. Plus the cost includes travel to different destinations.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Family friendly \u2014 Parents can enjoy dining together while their children enjoy plenty of onboard activities. Many cruise ships offer age-related entertainment for young children or teens. Sit by the pool while the kids play video games or enjoy play areas.\u000a\u000a3. Unique itineraries \u2014 Some destinations are difficult to get to by land. Not with a cruise. Passengers can travel to faraway destinations such as Grenada, Anguilla, Hawaii, Europe, or even the Amazon, which would be more expensive when traveling by plane and staying in hotels, Cruise Critic explains.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Fun while learning \u2014 Many cruise lines include hosts who provide expertise on oceanographic or environmental issues, usually centered around the cruise. There are educational programs for kids on marine life. If the cruise includes faraway journeys to places like the Galapagos or other adventures, expert guides and equipment are available for nature lovers and photographers.\u000a\u000a5. Relaxation \u2014 As soon as the trip begins, there\u2019s no need for vacation planning. Cruise lines let passengers choose the itinerary, cabin, and tours available, Fodors notes. No stress about researching what to do. You only have to unpack once and you\u2019re off.\u000a\u000a6. See the world without hassle \u2014 Flying to Europe, Africa, or India might include frequent dealings with customs, transportation, visas, or language barriers. A cruise package, however, does all the work for you. You get transportation to places wherever you land. English-speaking tour guides are immediately available in foreign countries.\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aShould the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVPatty Jenkins responded to James Cameron in a strongly-worded tweet Thursday, taking the award-winning "Avatar" director to task for slamming "Wonder Woman," which she directed.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with The Guardian this week, the Academy Award-winning director slammed "Wonder Woman," one of the top-grossing films of the year, calling it a "step backwards" for superhero movies, comparing the role with his Sarah Connor character in his "Terminator" movie franchise.\u000a\u000a"All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over 'Wonder Woman' has been so misguided," Cameron told The Guardian. "She's an objectified icon, and it's just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but, to me, it's a step backwards."\u000a\u000a"Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, (the benefit of characters like Sarah) is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female," Cameron continued.\u000a\u000aJenkins, whose "Wonder Woman" has raked in $404.4 million domestically and another $396.1 million overseas, according to Box Office Mojo.com, clapped back with a tweet Thursday night, saying that women have the right to choose their own icons.\u000a\u000apic.twitter.com/8zkJXHLCJW \u2014 Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aJenkins directed the 2003 movie "Monster" that won Charlize Theron the Oscar for best actress in her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.\u000a\u000aFans registered their complaints to Cameron's words on social media.\u000a\u000aJames Cameron, who turned the story of the Titanic into a chance to get Kate Winslet nude, complains about #WonderWoman being a step back? pic.twitter.com/47jyCPR0hI \u2014 Duane Maddy (@GraphicArtMaddy) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aJames Cameron: Wonder Woman is a step backwards.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a... dude, you're making 4 Avatar sequels no one wants. https://t.co/OsDDTAbw9b pic.twitter.com/oxJjr8oISg \u2014 Kenny Williams (@Ohheykenny) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aJames Cameron just called "Wonder Woman" sexist and positioned himself as the moral voice for feminism in Hollywood. #NotTheOnion \u2014 Charles Clymer\U0001f3f3\ufe0f\u200d\U0001f308 (@cmclymer) August 24, 2017

aVChildren who skip breakfast on a regular basis are likely to fall short for the day in getting all their recommended essential nutrients, a UK study suggests.\u000a\u000aKids who skipped breakfast every day were less likely to get enough iron, calcium, iodine and folate when compared to kids who ate breakfast every day, the research team found.\u000a\u000a\u201cA greater proportion of those children who ate breakfast met their recommended intakes of these micronutrients compared to breakfast skippers,\u201d coauthors Gerda Pot and Janine Coulthard of Kings College London told Reuters Health in an email interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese findings suggest that eating breakfast could play an important role in ensuring that a child consumes enough of these key micronutrients,\u201d Pot and Coulthard said.\u000a\u000aThough older children were more likely to skip breakfast, the day\u2019s nutrient shortfall was greater when younger children missed the morning meal.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur research indicated that although lower proportions of 4-to-10-year-olds skipped breakfast regularly compared to 11-to-18-year-olds, greater differences in micronutrient intakes were seen in the younger age group when comparing days on which they ate breakfast with days on which they skipped it. It may, therefore, be particularly important to ensure that this younger age group eats a healthy breakfast, either at home or at a school breakfast club.\u201d\u000a\u000aResearchers examined four-day food diaries for almost 1,700 children ages 4 to 18. The information was taken from a yearly national diet and nutrition survey between 2008 and 2012.\u000a\u000aBreakfast was defined as consuming more than 100 calories between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.\u000a\u000aOverall, about 31 percent of kids ate breakfast daily, 17 percent never ate breakfast, and the rest ate it some days and skipped it on others. In this group, the researchers also compared differences in nutrient intake by the same child on different days.\u000a\u000aThe team found that 6.5 percent of kids aged 4 to 10 missed breakfast every day, compared with nearly 27 percent of 11-to-18-year-olds.\u000a\u000aGirls were more likely to miss breakfast than boys, and household income tended to be higher for families of children who ate breakfast every day.\u000a\u000aMore than 30 percent of kids who skipped breakfast did not get enough iron during the day, compared to less than 5 percent of kids who ate breakfast, the researchers report in British Journal of Nutrition.\u000a\u000aAround 20 percent of breakfast skippers were low on calcium and iodine, compared to roughly 3 percent of kids who ate breakfast.\u000a\u000aAbout 7 percent of children who skipped breakfast were low in folate, compared to none in the groups that ate breakfast.\u000a\u000aFat intake went up when kids skipped breakfast, researchers found.\u000a\u000aKids who skipped breakfast didn\u2019t seem to compensate by eating more calories later in the day. In fact, kids who didn\u2019t eat breakfast ended up eating the same number or fewer total calories as kids who ate breakfast every day.\u000a\u000aMaking sure kids eat breakfast appears to be more difficult in the older age group, who are possibly less receptive to parental supervision, Pot and Coulthard said.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne tactic would be to get children involved in making breakfast, maybe even preparing something the night before if time is short in the morning.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe authors noted there are a wealth of healthy, simple and tasty recipe ideas available on social media that children can choose from, adding that kids might even like to post a picture of their creations online.

aVFederal Reserve data on July industrial production offered little more than more of the same. Despite post-election optimism for a rebound in activity on the nation\u2019s factory floors, the data reveal a continued throttling down in the growth rate to just over 2 percent compared with this time last year.\u000a\u000aThe main drag on activity -- the auto sector -- should come as no surprise to investors.\u000a\u000aRather than rising by 0.2 percent over June as projected, manufacturing production contracted by 0.1 percent, marking the third decline in five months. Motor vehicles and parts production fell by 3.6 percent on the month, taking the year-over-year slide to five percent.\u000a\u000aBlue Line: IP Manufacturing, Growth Y-o-Y%\u000a\u000aRed Line: IP Manufacturing Ex-Motor Vehicles and Parts, Growth Y-o-Y%\u000a\u000aEvidence continues to build that a sampling error may be to blame for the surprising strength in June and July car sales. Inventory continues to pile up, suggesting more production cuts are in the offing: As of June, the latest data on hand, auto inventories were up 7.4 percent over last year, leaving manufacturers choking for air. In July, General Motors Co. alone was sitting on 104 days of supply, well above its target of 70 days. Industry-wide, the July/August average of 69 days ties the August 2008 record and sits above the historic average of 56 days of supply.\u000a\u000aIn all, automakers have 3.9 million units of unsold light vehicles, up 324,600 from last August and the highest on record for the month. For context, July and August tie for the leanest stock levels of the year.\u000a\u000aThe decline in July sales was already the steepest this year. Fresh loan delinquency data suggest more pain ahead. \u201cDeep subprime\u201d borrowers have been a big boost at the margin, propelling back-to-back record years of sales in 2015 and 2016 as lending standards loosened sufficiently to allow millions with credit scores below 530 to access financing.\u000a\u000aEquifax, the consumer credit reporting firm, didn\u2019t hold back in its second-quarter update, saying the performance of recent vintages of deep subprime loans was \u201cawful.\u201d While industry insiders are quick to point out that the overall pace of defaults across all borrowers remains in check, up just marginally over last year, there is growing concern that deep subprime delinquencies are back at 2007 levels. \u201cThe bottom line is excess auto inventories are clearly evident and the auto sector is now in recession,\u201d said The Lindsey Group\u2019s Peter Boockvar.\u000a\u000aBoockvar\u2019s conclusion raises the question of what\u2019s next for the broader economy. Downside risks are on full display when viewed through the prism of manufacturing net of motor vehicle and parts production. The revival of the auto industry drove the factory sector out of recession; the flipside doesn\u2019t look to be promising. As one economist quipped at the sight of the following chart, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s time to get out the gray crayon.\u201d\u000a\u000aIP Manufacturing Net of IP Manufacturing Ex-Motor Vehicles & Parts \u2013 Y-o-Y % Change\u000a\u000aA deeper question yet is what the implication is for long-term economic growth if credit-compelled sales continue to push the economy in and out of recession, as was the case for home sales in the last cycle and looks to be increasingly the case for the auto sector in the current cycle.\u000a\u000aA recent analysis by The Liscio Report, an economic consultancy, dug deeper into the long demise of the private sector\u2019s investment in the economy. Their findings:\u000a\u000aAt 2.1 percent of GDP, net fixed investment by the private sector is just over half its 1950 -- 2000 average of 3.8 percent. At 1.0 percent of GDP, investment in equipment and software, which has long been identified with long-term productivity growth, is more than a third below its average over the same period of 1.6 percent.\u000a\u000aThe latest political turmoil suggests a further dampening in animal spirits in c-suites across America. That only underscores the need to switch the focus to infrastructure spending.\u000a\u000aInfrastructure investment is supported on both sides of the aisle. No politician likes to run for office with the economy in recession. With the midterm elections just over the horizon, it would seem the imperative to set aside differences at this juncture are that much greater. For the sake of an economic jumpstart, it might be as simple as making America\u2019s highways and byways passable again.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aDanielle DiMartino Booth, a former adviser to the president of the Dallas Fed, is the author of "Fed Up: An Insider's Take on Why the Federal Reserve Is Bad for America," and founder of Money Strong LLC.

They included members of Congress, former members of Congress, congressional staffers, reporters, lobbyists, lawyers, and others. Importantly, we checked with constituents across the nation, asking their views on individual members of Congress.Our survey was not scientific, but was based on solid criteria, including a House member\u2019s commitment to their job, their interest in constituent services and follow-up, their championing of issues and causes important to the national interest, their honesty, and their ability to get things done.Our survey did not include ideological litmus tests, and it comprises a bipartisan roll call of the House\u2019s greatest. We looked at each member\u2019s concern and passion for the public good.Here is our 2016 list of the 25 Hardest Working Members of Congress:\u2014 At 66 and after 16 years in the House, Cole maintains the same pace as the young campaigner who served as secretary of state of Oklahoma and chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. He now serves as deputy majority whip, as well as a member of the Appropriations, Budget, and Rules Committees. Capitol Hill reporters still marvel at how Cole replies unfailing to their requests, whether it is at midnight or on weekends.\u2014 Despite careers as a lawyer, state representative and senator, and U.S. Representative, Lynch\u2019s drive and seemingly unstoppable energy, friends agree, comes from his days as an ironworker. Working on high-altitude structures by day and attending the Wentworth Institute of Technology by nights and weekends, Lynch rose to become the youngest (30) president of the Iron Workers Local 7 union in Boston. In politics, he has been nothing short of a force of nature: unseating an incumbent in the Democratic primary to win his first term as state representative in 1994. At 61 and now a senior member of the Financial Services and Oversight and Government Reform Committees, Lynch shows no signs of slowing down as a passionate advocate for the little guy.\u2014 No argument here: Ryan\u2019s early-morning workout was highly dramatized when he was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012 (one BBC reporter actually did the \u201cRyan routine\u201d while broadcasting from Ryan\u2019s hometown) and his morning to midnight schedule on weekdays is well-known by colleagues of both parties. Genuinely drafted to be speaker after John Boehner\u2019s resignation last year, Ryan, has an unparalleled passion for public policy, but he still faithfully returns to his wife and three children in Wisconsin every weekend.\u2014 Former San Diego city councilman and California state legislator Vargas works overtime, Hill staffers say, to maintain close ties to the Obama White House (he and the president were Harvard Law classmates) and to work with Republican colleagues. Vargas recently co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) to benefit wounded warriors and is co-chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast with Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.).\u2014 On Capitol Hill, the joke is that "it's not what cause will Peter King take up next, but what cause hasn't he taken up yet?" At 72 and after 24 years in Congress, the Nassau County lawmaker embraces controversial causes that many lawmakers would rather ignore or don\u2019t see much bang for the political buck. King, past chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and has become the key Capitol Hill player in keeping America vigilant in its the war on terror. King serves as an active watchdog of the banking industry as a Member of the House Financial Services Committee.\u2014 The three-term lawmaker\u2019s capacity for hard work was hailed at the recent National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. A U.S. Air Force veteran of Iraq, he worked overtime in 2014 to secure congressional approval for an airstrike against Syrian strongman Assad \u2014 only to have the White House back off. His is a rising leadership star in the GOP.\u2014 The \u201cother half\u201d of the Democrats\u2019 celebrated \u201cCastro brothers,\u201d Joaquin is the identical twin brother of Housing Secretary and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. Moving with ease from state House to U.S. House, Joaquin is considered a prodigious worker on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committee.\u2014 Professional auditor and former Maricopa County Treasurer, Schweikert is considered one of GOP\u2019s best budget authorities. His mastery of detail and understanding of the budget process have made him \u201cthe indispensable man\u201d for small government conservatives in House.\u2014 One of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, Gabbard is admired on both sides of the aisle for her personal drive \u2014 elected to the Hawaii legislature at 21, deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army at 25, elected to the Honolulu City Council at 30, and Congress at 31. Sandwiching her congressional duties with those as a military police officer in the Army National Guard, Gabbard was a vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee until resigning this year to back Bernie Sanders for president.\u2014 At 36, former Miami public relations man Curbelo is fast becoming known as a hard-charging lawmaker in his first term. On the same day that the White House announced plans to lift Cuba\u2019s designation as a terrorist nation, Curbelo became a highly visible opponent to the plan. A favorite of the \u201cTea Party\u201d in his campaign, Curbelo nonetheless drew swatches of publicity for vowing never to vote against lifting the debt ceiling and declaring \u201cAmerica must never, ever default.\u201d\u2014 Even before he got to Congress, onetime Yale baseball team captain and U.S. Navy veteran DeSantis demonstrated what associates call near-superhuman capacity for work. As a first-time candidate in 2012, he raised more than $1.1 million \u2014 almost all by his telephoning and asking people \u2014 and beat five other Republicans in the primary. A Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he has been a House point man on issues ranging from taking a harder line with Putin\u2019s Russia to trying to thwart the Iran agreement.\u2014 Onetime saleswoman and Republican activist Blackburn caught conservative eyes as a state legislator in 2000. That\u2019s when she broke with fellow Republican and then-Gov. Don Sundquist over his effort to bring a state income tax to Tennessee. Having forged a hard-charging band of conservative followers, Blackburn made history in \u201902 by becoming the first woman elected to Congress from Tennessee who did not follow her husband. These days, one only has to name a conservative cause to find the lady from the Volunteer State at the forefront of it \u2014 opposing climate change, investigating Planned Parenthood, and leading the charge against net neutrality.\u2014 The tenacity of Patrick Murphy became evident to those who covered him in 2012, when the first-time candidate unseated Republican firebrand Rep. Allen West in a major upset. Murphy spent $3 million to West\u2019s $12 million and pulled off a win. Now 33, self-styled \u201cBill Clinton Democrat\u201d Murphy occasionally surprises the liberal-leaning House leadership of his party with stands such as those in favor of the Keystone Pipeline and against tighter regulations on for-profit-universities. As a candidate for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Murphy is now leading fellow Rep. Alan Grayson for the Democratic nomination and has the rare pre-primary endorsement of Barack Obama.\u2014 Puerto Rican born immigration lawyer and three-term Rep. Labrador is considered the House GOP's best point man on legislation on the issue of illegal immigration. He also helped organize the monthly "Conversations With Conservatives" meetings in which he and other right-of-center colleagues talk freely with reporters. With all this activity, Labrador still maintains the Monday to Thursday commute from Washington to his Boise district.\u2014 Indiana's former secretary of state and father of its voter identification law, Rokita wrapped up key support for Congress in 2010 within 48 hours of the nine-term incumbent's retirement announcement. These days, Rep. Rokita stays busy as vice chairman of the House Budget Committee and as the GOP's premier spokesman in Congress on voter identification measures.\u2014 He is one of his party\u2019s most high-profile voices on illegal immigration and, from Pat Buchanan in 1996 to Ted Cruz this year, he is almost always a player in someone\u2019s presidential campaign in his state\u2019s quadrennial GOP caucuses. But since he came to Congress in 2002, King has had relatively comfortable re-elections. This is due, congressional staffers say, to his vigorous tours of his district nearly every weekend and his service on the House Agriculture Committee.\u2014 The former teacher and state Capitol staffer got elected to both the New York City Council and later the U.S. House by taking out seemingly unbeatable incumbents. Now 70, and after 24 years in Washington, Maloney, according to the New York Daily News in 2014, \u201cproposed more legislation than any other House Member.\u201d Her list of legislation ranges from a measure to provide compensation to Ground Zero workers who have fallen ill and to creating a database for monitoring of all federal contracts (which passed following exposes of corruption among military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maloney also found time to be a leader outside Congress on diseases that threaten the elderly, serving on foundation boards that seek cures for both Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases.\u2014 Bald, blunt-spoken Brady suddenly became a subject of the national media last fall, when colleague Paul Ryan moved up to the speakership of the House. Almost overnight, 10-termer Brady became his successor as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Had Brady faced a challenge, few congressional correspondents doubted the Texan would emerge with the gavel. He had been key point man for President George W. Bush on passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement and wrote a \u201csunset\u201d proposal to require every federal program not written in the Constitution to justify its existence in 12 years or face elimination. Most recently, Brady, 60, gave his blessings to a measure favored by anti-tax activists to sunset the U.S. Tax Code.\u2014 The best proof of Scalise\u2019s tireless knowledge and cultivation of his Republican colleagues as House GOP Whip came last year when several press outlets quoted remarks he allegedly made years before saying he was akin to Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke \u201cwithout the baggage.\u201d There were widespread press calls for his resignation from the No. 2 position in the House GOP hierarchy but, to remember, Republican colleagues (and fellow Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Democrat and black) rallied to Scalise\u2019s side. In part, it was a tribute to his reputation as someone who knows the needs of his colleagues and serves them.\u2014 In 2002, state legislator Van Hollen caught the eye of Democrats and the national press by winning the all-important Democratic primary in Maryland's 8th District (suburban Washington) over Tim Shriver, son of Sargent and nephew of John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy. Since then, his career has been nothing short of meteoric \u2014 rising to become chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee and then Budget Committee chairman in six years. Van Hollen is now considered the favorite to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski this year.\u2014 In contrast to her husband and predecessor John Dingell (who served a record 60 years in the seat until retiring in \u201914), freshman Rep. Debbie is back in the Dearborn-based district almost every Thursday to Monday. But she also wears the hats of Washington insider as a member of the Democratic National Committee and a top fundraiser for charities and fellow Democrats.\u2014 As far back as 1978, Chris Smith\u2019s capacity for taking on Herculean labor was sensed. Having just reached the constitutionally required age for the U.S. House (25), sporting goods salesman Smith took on powerful House Administration Committee Chairman Frank Thompson (D-N.J.) in a hopeless race. But a memo from the National Congressional Campaign Committee hailed him as one of the hardest-working candidates anywhere. Two years later, however, Smith unseated Thompson and today he is still in Congress \u2014 one of two of the GOP\u2019s 55 \u201cReagan babies\u201d elected to the House with the 40th president and still serving. As passionate as always about the pro-life cause, senior House Foreign Affairs Committee Member Smith also devotes his considerable energy to battling persecution of Christians in the Middle East and slave trafficking worldwide.\u2014 "I saw Fred Upton's high energy level first-hand in 1981," recalled TV commentator Larry Kudlow, referring to the days when he was deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald Reagan and the young Upton was an aide to then-Director David Stockman. During the fight over Reagan's historic tax and budget cuts of 1981, said Kudlow, "when email wasn't invented, Fred would go night and day running confidential messages to key Members of Congress. And we won." Five years later, Upton became one of the handful of House Members who got to Congress by defeating a member of his own party. Now finishing the sixth and last year of his "termed out" stint as House Energy Committee chairman, Upton, at 63, shows no signs of slowing down and has signaled he will remain in Congress after relinquishing his chairman's gavel.\u2014 When then-state legislator Mulvaney upset 28-year Rep. John Spratt (D-S.C.) in 2010, the national press was astonished. Not so were reporters in South Carolina who had seen his drive and his flair for attention-getting issues at the State Capitol. Now 47, Mulvaney has freely voted against John Boehner for speaker, opposed lifting the debt ceiling to fund the government, and rallied fellow Tea Party lawmakers \u2014 all the while coming home to the Palmetto State\u2019s 5th District every weekend and winning re-election with ease.\u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re probably asking yourself how a black dude wins in a district that is 71 percent Hispanic, right?\u201d freshman Rep. Will Hurd told Newsmax last year. One of the big upset winners of 2012, former CIA agent Hurd explained that he went \u201cout to go to all 29 counties in the district and engaged with people." It worked, and he won. Maintaining the same discipline as a Homeland Security Committee member, Hurd is widely sought out on intelligence-related issues because, in his words, \u201cI chased al-Qaida for much of my life.\u201d

aVGlobal interest in Kiwi-designed anti-aging antioxidant MitoQ has been encouraging, says MitoQ\u2019s chemist chief executive Greg Macpherson.\u000a\u000aGlobal interest in a Kiwi company's anti-ageing drug is ramping up, with three major clinical trials now under way to test it against a range of ailments.\u000a\u000aMitoquinol mesylate, marketed as MitoQ, is a New Zealand owned and developed super-antioxidant that works by penetrating and optimizing the cellular mitochondria, the so-called batteries within our cells.\u000a\u000aIts backers believe the drug holds the potential to increase lifespan by 10 to 15 per cent, while also improving health. Discovered by the University of Otago's Professor Rob Smith and global mitochondria expert Dr. Mike Murphy, of Cambridge University, the drug was launched as a skincare and supplement range in late 2013, and now sells into more than 100 countries.\u000a\u000aAgeing and its associated health issues and lower energy levels is linked to a decline in mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial dysfunction is now known to be associated with more than 200 diseases or conditions.\u000a\u000aVideo \u2013 The Secret behind Mitochondrial Science Revealed In NZ\u000a\u000a"This includes some of the biggest issues affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world like diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease and more," said Greg Macpherson, MitoQ's chief executive and the pharmacist who formulated the antioxidant to penetrate mitochondria.\u000a\u000aAs we age, Macpherson said, the levels of antioxidants in our mitochondria deplete reducing their ability to fend off damage caused by free radicals - highly reactive chemicals that have the potential to harm cells in our bodies.\u000a\u000a"Due to this damage our mitochondria decline in function at a rate of around 10 per cent a decade from our early thirties."\u000a\u000aThe MitoQ formulation worked by flooding the mitochondria with antioxidants, improving the level of energy available to a cell and reducing free radical-associated cell damage.\u000a\u000aGot a Health Challenge You Would Like To Beat? Take this quiz and find the solution\u000a\u000a"By improving their function while reducing cell damage, we can slow down the ageing process keeping all of our organs and body healthier and younger for longer."\u000a\u000aMitoQ is currently the subject of a collaborative study with Callaghan Innovation and the University of Auckland, which assesses its effects on blood sugar and cardiovascular health in 20 New Zealand patients.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in the US, University of Colorado researchers are investigating whether it improves physiological function in middle-aged and older adults, and a University of Delaware team is examining its effects on patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.\u000a\u000aInterest in the technology had been boosted by its recent selection for the US Government's National Institute of Aging's\u000a\u000aInterventions Testing Program.\u000a\u000aEach year, a global selection process by two expert panels invites a small number of compounds for testing, with applicants required to demonstrate "significant potential to delay or decelerate the ageing process and improve general health".\u000a\u000aMacpherson said the commercial benefits that came with being picked for the program were enormous.\u000a\u000aBillions of dollars were being poured into mitochondria-targeted anti-ageing therapeutic agents.\u000a\u000aAdvanced CoQ technology revolutionizes U.S. supplements industry\u000a\u000a"We were just lucky enough to be ahead of the curve - and the other big thing we've got is that what we do is quite broad.\u000a\u000a"Should we get proof of life-extension efficacy, then Mitoq.com has a multibillion-dollar market in the states ... so we will have a huge opportunity."\u000a\u000a- NZ Herald

aVThe State Department has expanded a Mexico travel warning in the wake of increased violent crimes against U.S. citizens.\u000a\u000aThe country has seen a spike in crimes including homicides at popular tourist destinations such as Baja California Sur, where Cabo San Lucas is located, as well as and Quintana Roo, where Cancun and Riviera Maya are, Fox News reported.\u000a\u000aAccording to NPR, additional warnings have been added to the states of Chiapas and Veracruz, with the U.S. government's advisory now covering 23 of the 31 Mexican states.\u000a\u000a"Gun battles between rival criminal organizations or with Mexican authorities have taken place on streets and in public places during broad daylight," the advisory says.\u000a\u000aAlthough there is less drug-related violence and crime reported at tourist destinations in comparison to the border region, the State Department has warned that many U.S. citizens have been killed in carjackings and highway robberies.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, travelers were cautioned to be wary of kidnapping.\u000a\u000aThese could take on various forms such as physical abduction, resulting in the victim being held captive; short-term abduction, during which the victim is forced to withdraw money from an ATM; or through virtual extortion-by-deception, through which the victim is threatened to provide phone numbers of family and friends, then isolated until a ransom is paid.\u000a\u000aRafael Fernandez de Castro, director for the Center for U.S.-Mexican studies at UC San Diego, said the travel warnings were bad news for Mexico's economy, the Los Angeles Times reported. Tourism makes up 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product.\u000a\u000aBut increased development at tourist destinations could be part of the problem, Fernandez de Castro said.\u000a\u000a"The growth of Los Cabos has been way too accelerated in the last two years," he said. "It's creating a little bit of social chaos."

aVDemocracies have a blind faith that treaties can disarm totalitarian regimes. The notion that "peace in our time" is possible through a scrap of paper is an irrational addiction in Washington, D.C., the opioid of the U.S. State Department.\u000a\u000aThe free world is free because it has laws and contracts, and an ideological imperative to believe in the efficacy of negotiation and compromise. The totalitarian world is not free because its laws and contracts are lies, merely a propagandistic means to the end of tyranny, where the ideological imperative is to enslave.\u000a\u000aNever the twain shall meet. But the free world never learns war cannot be outlawed by the Kellogg-Briand Pact of Aug. 27, 1928 or, just as absurdly, a world without nuclear weapons achieved by negotiating with North Korea an Agreed Framework (1994) or with Iran a Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA, 2015).\u000a\u000aPerhaps the best warning against JCPOA is the long, failed history of arms control.\u000a\u000aTrue believers in JCPOA should read two books, Barton Whaley\u2019s "Covert German Rearmament 1919-1939: Deception and Misperception" and John Jordan\u2019s "Warships After Washington." Both books describe cheating by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan on the Versailles Treaty of June 28, 1919, the Washington Naval Treaty of Feb. 6, 1922, the London Naval Treaty of April 22, 1930, and the Second London Naval Treaty of March 25, 1936.\u000a\u000aAlso read "The President\u2019s Unclassified Report to the Congress on Soviet Noncompliance with Arms Control Agreements" (Released Feb. 1, 1985) wherein is described the USSR\u2019s cheating on the major arms control agreements of the Cold War. The State Department is still sitting on the even more shocking classified version.\u000a\u000aNow, Clare Lopez, a former CIA clandestine services officer who is vice president for research and analysis at the Center for Security Policy (CSP), one of the best Washington, D.C. think tanks, has written the definitive study titled "Why Trump Must Not Re-Certify Iranian JCPOA Compliance." (Center for Security Policy, Aug. 23, 2017).\u000a\u000aLopez has deep expertise in the ideology of radical Islam that drives the Islamic Republic of Iran and their Islamic Revolutionary Guard to be the world\u2019s leading sponsors of international terrorism \u2014 and why development of an Islamic Bomb is an ideological religious imperative for Iran.\u000a\u000aThe mullahs who run Iran, and the fanatical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who run Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, will never betray Allah by surrendering their Islamic bomb \u2014 the most powerful weapon for material and spiritual victory in their global jihad.\u000a\u000aFailure by the U.S. State Department to understand the ideological motives behind Iran\u2019s nuclear missile program is repeating State\u2019s catastrophic misunderstanding that the ideological imperatives of totalitarianism made inevitable North Korea\u2019s cheating on former-President Bill Clinton\u2019s Agreed Framework.\u000a\u000aTotalitarian Iran and North Korea, despite profound ideological differences, are strategic partners in a nuclear missile "axis of evil" because the free world is even more abhorrent to Tehran and Pyongyang than each other.\u000a\u000aKey Findings from Clare Lopez\u2019s "Why Trump Must Not Re-Certify Iranian JCPOA Compliance":\u000a\u000a\u2014"It is imperative that President Trump not recertify the Iranian regime as compliant with the provisions of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) when the next deadline comes due in October 2017;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "Tehran is explicitly and demonstrably out of compliance with the JCPOA on numerous specific counts'"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "The nature of the Iranian regime is self-avowedly jihadist per its own constitution, which declares the objective of the regime is global conquest by an Islamic State under rule of Islamic Law (shariah) \u2013 thus, its nuclear weapons program is a means to achieve that objective;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "The Iranian regime is signatory to a host of international conventions and treaties but has a documented record of violations that lends little credence to its JCPOA pledges;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "The Iranian regime most notably violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for at least 14 years before getting caught and publicly revealed with a clandestine nuclear weapons program in 2002."\u000a\u000a\u2014 "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documented a long list of so-called Possible Military Dimensions (PMDs) related to the Iranian nuclear program in November 2011 that strongly suggest its assessment that Iran had an advanced nuclear weapons program and possibly nuclear warheads at that time;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "More recent revelations demonstrate that the Iranian regime continues to work on nuclear warheads and explosive charges to initiate the implosion sequence of a nuclear bomb at clandestine sites off-limits to IAEA inspections;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "Even after the July 2015 JCPOA, the Iranian regime has been confronted with credible information that it is operating more advanced centrifuges than permitted, exceeding limits on production of heavy water, and covertly procuring nuclear and missile technology outside of JCPOA-approved channels: these are all material breaches of the JCPOA;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "The Iranian regime\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile \u2018Joint Venture\u2019 with North Korea dates back at least to the 1990s and continues currently with especial concern about the sharing of expertise on warhead miniaturization and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) technology;"\u000a\u000a\u2014 "Denial of recertification of Iranian compliance with the JCPOA must be the first step in a complete review of the nuclear and ballistic missile threats from both Iran and North Korea."\u000a\u000aMr. President, don\u2019t let Iran become another North Korea.

aVRegarded as one of the greatest players in pro golf, Arnold Palmer earned the nickname "The King" not just because of his ability to win major tournaments, but because of his personality and his unique appeal to his fans as well.\u000a\u000aPalmer died at age 87 in 2016, still involved in the world of golf. He was among the first pro golfers to take advantage of sports marketing with equipment and product endorsements. His many charitable contributions included the founding of the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies in Orlando, Florida.\u000a\u000aHere are six reasons Arnold Palmer is still considered "The King" of golf:\u000a\u000a1. Charisma \u2014 Although he may not have been the single greatest on the pro golf circuit, he was the most beloved, earning the nickname \u201cThe King,\u201d according to Golf Channel's Randall Mell. It helped get him on the Wheaties box and on the cover of Sports Illustrated 11 times.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a2. His style \u2014 \u201cThe manner in which Arnold won, the way he attacked and made birdies, it was very spectacular,\u201d said former pro and friend Dow Finsterwald. The way he attacked in his game made him a star as golf on TV came of age. \u201cArnie would knock it in the trees and make a 3,\u201d said former PGA tour golfer Bob Toski.\u000a\u000a3. Youngest winner \u2014 Palmer established himself on the pro circuit by capturing the Masters Tournament title in 1958. At age 28, he was the youngest winner of the tournament at that time.\u000a\u000aPOLL:\u000a\u000aTiger or Jack? Who Is The Greatest Of All Time? Vote Now\u000a\u000a4. Major victories \u2014 He became the first golfer to win the Masters four times \u2014 in 1958, 1960, 1962, and 1964. He was the champion at two British Opens and won a total of 93 titles during his career. He was the first pro golfer to make $1 million in winnings in 1968.\u000a\u000a5. Aging grace \u2014 Even in his later years, Palmer took to the links on the Senior Tour. His victories included the 1980 PGA Seniors Championship and the 1981 U.S. Senior Open. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2012 when Golf Digest reported he was the third highest paid golfer at age 82, behind Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\u000a\u000a6. King of golf clubs \u2014 His expertise in the game was matched by his collection of more than 10,000 golf clubs, according to Golf.com. Many of them he made himself. His golf bags often included 40 to 60 clubs. Experimenting with the grip on his equipment helped develop his game.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVLast month Israel's prime minister issued a rare dissent from President Donald Trump's foreign policy. After Secretary of State Rex Tillerson helped broker a test ceasefire in southern Syria, a territory that borders the Jewish state, Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel opposed the plan.\u000a\u000aTrump's Syria policy has focused on eliminating the Islamic State. But for Israel, the greatest threat was from Iran, whose allies and forces showed no signs of leaving. Tillerson's ceasefire made no mention of the need for Iran and its proxies to get out of Syria. Israel understandably wondered: Was that arrangement a sign of Trump's broader Middle East policy?\u000a\u000aEvidently not. Last Thursday, a senior delegation of Israelis started consultations with their U.S. counterparts to begin planning a wider strategy to pressure Iran, Hezbollah and other Shiite militias to leave the Levant as, they hope, the war in Syria peters out.\u000a\u000aOne senior National Security Council official told me the plan was to make it "less pleasant for Iran to stay than to leave." A senior Israeli official confirmed that the two sides agreed to work together on a regional strategy to address Iran's efforts to expand its presence in Syria and Lebanon.\u000a\u000aThe consultations included very senior officials from both countries. The Israeli side included the Mossad director Yossi Cohen, the acting national security adviser Eytan Ben-David, the chief of the Israel Defense Forces' military intelligence directorate Herzi Halevi and the Israeli ambassador to Washington Ron Dermer. The U.S. delegation included National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, CIA director Mike Pompeo, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates and Trump's special representative for international negotiations, Jason Greenblatt.\u000a\u000aThere are a few reasons why all of this is important. To start, it shows a continuing commitment to an initial project of McMaster's predecessor, Mike Flynn: to drive a wedge between Iran and Russia.\u000a\u000aNetanyahu, Cohen and other senior officials will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday, and Syria will be on the agenda. Israel does not love Russia's military involvement in Syria, but can tolerate it. Iran is a different story. Russia, unlike Iran, has not anchored its state ideology in the destruction of the world's only Jewish state.\u000a\u000aTrump's team has also pursued cooperation with Russia in Syria, but has not sought such cooperation with Iran. Indeed, a U.S. spokesman for the coalition to defeat the Islamic State this week told Reuters the mission was to "defeat ISIS in designated areas of Iraq and Syria and to set conditions for follow-on operations to increase regional stability."\u000a\u000aAs the Israeli official told me this week, it was important to Netanyahu's government to make sure that the Russian-U.S. cooperation in Syria did not entail acceptance of a permanent Iranian presence in Syria. Tillerson's ceasefire could have opened the door to just that.\u000a\u000aThe consultations also indicate that McMaster has rebounded from his shaky start in the job. With the removal of his West Wing rival, Steve Bannon, McMaster now has a freer hand to coordinate U.S. foreign policy from his perch at the National Security Council. The meeting last week with the Israelis helped smooth an important ally's ruffled feathers.\u000a\u000aThe meeting also counters a narrative put out by McMaster's adversaries in Washington that he is hostile to Israel. The Israeli official told me that he was particularly generous with his time, inviting the delegation to his home for dinner and impressing on the Israelis the importance the president places on countering Iranian influence in the Middle East.\u000a\u000aBoth Israeli and U.S. officials tell me they expect more working-level follow-ups on the consultations. One factor that is likely to be part of the U.S. strategy in Syria will be empowering both Egypt and Jordan to play a greater role in building on the ceasefires negotiated by Russia, Iran, Turkey and the U.S. As Ha'aretz Middle East analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote Monday, Egypt is already conducting its diplomacy between rebel militias and the Syrian regime. That's reassuring to Israel because Egypt too considers Iran to be a major threat to regional stability.\u000a\u000aIncluding Israel in the U.S. planning on countering Iran is also a change from the Obama administration. During the Iran nuclear talks, the Israelis were briefed on the status of the negotiations, but were not at the table to influence the eventual agreement, which both Netanyahu as well as his political rivals opposed. The tensions during this period soured the U.S.-Israel relationship, especially after the Obama White House accused Israel of trying to spy on the talks and then brief Congress on them.\u000a\u000aThe world has been watching for signs of how Trump would navigate the Middle East. Last week's talks in Washington show that Trump is taking a different approach with Netanyahu than Obama did, and is getting a different response.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEli Lake is a Bloomberg View columnist.

aVThe billionaire head of South Korea\u2019s Samsung Group, Jay Y. Lee, was sentenced to five years in jail for bribery on Friday in a watershed for the country\u2019s decades-long economic order dominated by powerful, family-run conglomerates.\u000a\u000aAfter a six-month trial over a scandal that brought down the then president, Park Geun-hye, a court ruled that Lee had paid bribes in anticipation of favors from Park.\u000a\u000aThe court also found Lee guilty of hiding assets abroad, embezzlement and perjury.\u000a\u000aLee, the 49-year-old heir to one of the world\u2019s biggest corporate empires, has been held since February on charges that he bribed Park to help secure control of a conglomerate that owns Samsung Electronics, the world\u2019s leading smartphone and chip maker, and has interests ranging from drugs and home appliances to insurance and hotels.\u000a\u000aLee, who emerged stony-faced from the Seoul courtroom in a dark suit, but without a tie, and holding a document envelope, was escorted by justice ministry officials back to his detention center.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis case is a matter of Lee Jae-yong and Samsung Group executives, who had been steadily preparing for Lee\u2019s succession ... bribing the president,\u201d Seoul Central District Court Judge Kim Jin-dong said, using Lee\u2019s Korean name.\u000a\u000aKim said that as the group\u2019s heir apparent, Lee \u201cstood to benefit the most\u201d from any political favors for Samsung.\u000a\u000aLee denied wrongdoing, and one of his lawyers, Song Wu-cheol, said he would appeal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe entire guilty verdict is unacceptable,\u201d Song said, adding he was confident his client\u2019s innocence would be affirmed by a higher court. The case is expected to be appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court, likely next year.\u000a\u000aThe five year-sentence - one of the longest given to a South Korean business leader - is a landmark for South Korea, where the family-run conglomerates - or chaebols - have long been revered for helping transform the once war-ravaged country into a global economic powerhouse.\u000a\u000aBut they have more recently been criticized for holding back the economy and stifling small businesses and start-ups.\u000a\u000aSamsung, a symbol of the country\u2019s rise from poverty following the 1950-53 Korean War, has come to epitomize the cozy and sometimes corrupt ties between politicians and the chaebols.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ruling is a turning point for chaebols,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a business professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. \u201cIn the past, chaebols weren\u2019t afraid of laws because they were lenient. Now, Lee\u2019s ruling sets a precedent for strict enforcement of laws, and chaebols should be wary.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnder South Korean law, sentences of more than three years cannot be suspended.\u000a\u000aLEADERSHIP VACUUM\u000a\u000aThe third-generation de facto head of the powerful Samsung Group, Lee has effectively directed operations since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014. Some investors worry a prolonged leadership vacuum could slow decision-making at the group, which has more than five dozen affiliate companies and assets of 363.2 trillion won ($322.13 billion).\u000a\u000aIts listed companies make up about 30 percent of the market value of South Korea\u2019s KOSPI stock index.\u000a\u000aMany tycoons, including Lee\u2019s father, were convicted of crimes in the past, ranging from bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion, only to get presidential pardons, as both the government and the public feared going too hard on them would hurt the economy.\u000a\u000aBut South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Moon Jae-in, who won a May election, has pledged to rein in the chaebols, empower minority shareholders and end the practice of pardoning tycoons convicted of white-collar crime.\u000a\u000aThe presidential Blue House said in a statement that it hopes the ruling will serve as an opportunity to \u201cend the nexus of business and politics that has held back the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a June interview with Reuters, Moon said he did not believe Samsung\u2019s operations depended just on Lee.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen Lee was taken into custody, the share prices of Samsung went up,\u201d Moon said. \u201cIf we were to succeed in reforming the running of the chaebols and also increasing transparency, I believe this will not only help the economic power of Korea but also help to make the chaebols themselves more competitive.\u201d\u000a\u000aInvestors say shares in chaebol companies trade at lower prices than they would otherwise because of their opaque corporate governance - the so-called Korea Discount.\u000a\u000aShares of Samsung Electronics dropped more than 1 percent, and other group companies, including Samsung C&T and Samsung SDS, also turned lower after the verdict.\u000a\u000aThe court said Samsung\u2019s financial support of entities backed by a friend of Park\u2019s, Choi Soon-sil, constituted bribery, including 7.2 billion won ($6.4 million) in sponsoring the equestrian career of Choi\u2019s daughter.\u000a\u000aIn return, prosecutors say, Samsung sought government support for the 2015 merger of two of its affiliates, which helped Lee tighten control of the conglomerate. His lawyers had argued that the merger was done for business reasons.\u000a\u000aSome criminal lawyers had expected Lee to be found innocent of the major charges, as much of the evidence at the trial has been circumstantial. The appeals court and the Supreme Court might put a greater emphasis on prosecutors to provide direct proof of quid pro quo, the lawyers said.\u000a\u000aPARK SUPPORTERS OUTRAGED\u000a\u000aPark, who was forced from office in March, faces her own corruption trial, with a ruling expected later this year.\u000a\u000aProsecutors have argued that Park and Lee took part in the same act of bribery - so Lee\u2019s conviction would appear ominous for the former president.\u000a\u000aHundreds of Park's diehard supporters who rallied outside the court on Friday reacted with outrage to the ruling.\u000a\u000a"Our ultimate goal is Park's acquittal and release," Kim Won-joon, a 62-year-old former construction worker said. "We worry how today's guilty verdict for Lee would affect Park's ruling."\u000a\u000aSuch supporters are a minority compared with the huge crowds that turned out in Seoul every week to call for Park's ouster after the bribery scandal surfaced late last year.\u000a\u000aPublic approval of Lee's prosecution may underscore growing frustration in Asia's fourth-largest economy that the wealth amassed by conglomerates has not trickled down.\u000a\u000a"I think it was difficult for a court to ignore public opinion, given that the scandal rocked the country," said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com.\u000a\u000a"The five-year sentence was low given that he was found guilty of all the charges. I think the court gave him a lighter sentence, taking into account Samsung's importance to the economy."

aVPeople all over America want to give back to the veterans responsible for their freedoms. Perhaps no one knows better about how to help than fellow vets. Veterans also enjoy the connection to other vets when giving back.\u000a\u000aThere are many ways to help vets through such programs as the Disabled American Veterans and the Wounded Warrior Project. Vets are unique in that they know what other veterans may need at home.\u000a\u000aThey can help veterans just by being there or giving back in a variety of ways. Simply getting involved in certain programs or organizations for their own benefit can help other vets.\u000a\u000aTIP: The Secret Water Cure for Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000aHere are six ways veterans can give back to their fellow vets:\u000a\u000a1. Online education programs \u2014 Many vets return home to advance their education. There are many online education programs that encourage connecting with other veterans and sharing experiences, according to U.S. News. Find other vets by reading their introductions available to classmates or through class discussion boards where they might mention their military service.\u200b\u000a\u000a2. Vets Prevail \u2014 Soldiers returning home can connect with their peers to ease their transition to life after leaving the service. Vets Prevail is an online mental health tool to deal with readjustment challenges by chatting with other vets or getting information about their thoughts and feelings.\u000a\u000a\u200b3. Support veterans\u2019 groups \u2014 Vets can join or support organizations that help returning veterans who may have suffered from traumatic injuries. The Warriors & Quiet Waters Foundation, for example, provides retreats to injured veterans in Montana with recreational activities.\u000a\u000aIMPORTANT: Top Doctor Shares Tricks That Actually Make Your Brain Younger\u000a\u000a\u200b4. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America \u2014 The nonprofit IAVA connects veterans for support. There are some 420,000 members who enjoy family-friendly events, education and employment programs, and get-togethers at communities across the country.\u000a\u000a5. Vets4Vets \u2014 Through groups around the country, Vets4Vets provides free weekend workshops so vets can discuss their experiences or trauma of war with other vets.\u000a\u000a\u200b6. Start a vet program \u2014 U.S. Marine veterans Bob Adams and Dirk Enger opened the Midwest Shelter for Homeless Veterans in Wheaton, Illinois in 2007, CNN reported. The nonprofit grew into an organization that provides housing and counseling to some 400 vets a year. Adams, a clinical social worker, had noticed that many homeless people in Chicago were veterans and began envisioning such a program.\u000a\u000aALERT: Suzanne Somers Reveals 'Forbidden' Cancer Cures That Saved Her Life

aVWhen you book your dream cruise vacation, you are bound to be so excited that you may not consider things that could go wrong. You will likely be asked if you want to buy cruise insurance, and before you decline, read these reasons why you might need it.\u000a\u000a1. Trip cancellations \u2013 Cancelling your cruise at the last minute will cost you money, says Cruise Critic. If your elderly mother has been in declining health, cruise insurance will protect you in case you need to cancel your trip unexpectedly to care for her.\u000a\u000aLatest:\u000a\u000aWhat's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Medical emergencies \u2013 What happens if you fall seriously ill during the cruise? If you need medical treatment on the ship, your regular health insurance will not cover you and the costs can be astronomical, says Allianze Travel Insurance. For instance, being airlifted from the ship to a nearby hospital can cost upwards of $100,000. Cruise insurance can provide coverage, just in case.\u000a\u000a3. Missing the boat \u2013 There is always a risk of flight delays and cancellations that can cause you to miss the ship\u2019s departure. Ships do not wait for late passengers. Cruise insurance will reimburse you for hotel stays and even transportation to your ship\u2019s first port of call so you can board at that time, says Allianze.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Lost or stolen luggage \u2013 Between flying to your departure location and stopping at ports of call, Insure My Trip says there are many opportunities for bags to be lost, delayed or stolen. The right insurance policy will reimburse you for some of the replacement costs for your belongings.\u000a\u000a5. Trip interruption \u2013 Sometimes, mechanical failures onboard or dangerous weather can cause a cruise to be cut short with almost no notice. Cruise lines can assist passengers, says Cruise Critic, but an insurance policy will provide reimbursement should you need to find lodging and make changes to flight plans.\u000a\u000a6. Peace of mind \u2013 One likely reason you are booking a cruise in the first place is to escape the daily stresses of life even for just a short time. Worrying about losing money due to things that are out of your control is contrary to your vacation goals, so cruise insurance is a necessity for peace of mind before and during your exciting trip.\u000a\u000aVote Now:\u000a\u000aShould the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVFormer Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said Friday that President Donald Trump's pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio was "a very political act used to kind of close this chapter out."\u000a\u000a"It was political prosecution to begin with, so it's not surprising to see a pardon, which is obviously a very political act used to kind of close this chapter out," Cuccinelli, a Republican who is now president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, told John Berman on CNN.\u000a\u000a"People will view the pardon based on where they start on Sheriff Arpaio," he said. "The prosecution in 2016 was commenced the day before early voting began in Arizona.\u000a\u000a"It was a political prosecution," Cuccinelli said, adding that Arpaio lost re-election to a seventh term in November.\u000a\u000aThe Justice Department first sued Arpaio for racial profiling in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe case that ultimately led to the criminal contempt charges was initially filed in 2007 by a Mexican tourist who had been stopped in Maricopa County.\u000a\u000aCuccinelli said did not strongly endorse Trump's pardon, telling Berman that "I am an idealist.\u000a\u000a"I wouldn't say I'm jumping up and down for joy.\u000a\u000a"I think, on balance, it was a defensible and positive thing for the president to do.\u000a\u000a"I hope future presidents, including this president, when he's on his way out, whenever that may be, won't initiate prosecution of people running for office strictly for the purpose of defeating them.\u000a\u000a"This why the timing of Sheriff Joe's prosecution was commenced when it was commenced," Cuccinelli added. "It was so he would lose the election. And he did.\u000a\u000a"That is not how prosecutions should be commenced.\u000a\u000a"It is not how they should be carried forward \u2014 and now President Trump has undone it."

aVPeople taking insulin for Type 2 diabetes may manage symptoms better with a device that constantly checks their blood sugar, a small study suggests.\u000a\u000aResearchers focused on 158 adults with Type 2 diabetes, which is tied to aging and obesity and happens when the body can't properly use insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. All of the patients had poorly controlled blood sugar even though they were injecting insulin several times a day.\u000a\u000aFor the experiment, all of the patients continued using insulin and testing their blood sugar on their own. Researchers randomly assigned half of the participants to also use a continuous glucose monitoring device made by DexCom Inc., which paid for the study and has financial ties to several of its authors.\u000a\u000aAfter 24 weeks, patients on continuous glucose monitoring did a little better, on average, at managing their blood sugar than the people only using self-testing. But people in both groups typically still had poorly controlled blood sugar at the end of the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe value of continuous glucose monitoring is in the ability to see glucose readings continuously - every five minutes - plus having alarms that indicate that the blood sugar is going up or down,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Roy Beck, executive director of the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Fla.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe blood sugar if it gets too low can lead to seizure or loss of consciousness, so having the ability to know ahead of time that the glucose levels are trending in that direction is extremely valuable so that the patient can eat or drink carbohydrates to raise the blood sugar,\u201d Beck said by email.\u000a\u000aOver time, seeing what types of food raise blood sugar and which exercises can help lower sugar are other advantages of the continuous glucose monitors, Beck said.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor instance, it is common that a carbohydrate-heavy breakfast will raise the blood sugar considerably, but many patients with Type 2 diabetes don\u2019t realize this,\u201d Beck added.\u000a\u000aTo see how well self-testing stacked up against continuous monitoring, Beck and colleagues used what\u2019s known as a hemoglobin A1c test, which measures the percentage of hemoglobin (a molecule on red blood cells) that is coated with sugar. That provides a picture of average blood sugar levels over about three months. Normal A1C is below 6 percent, and readings of 6.5 percent or above signal diabetes.\u000a\u000aAt the start of the study, participants were typically testing their glucose about three times a day and they had average A1c readings of 8.5 percent, indicating poorly controlled blood sugar with an increased risk of serious complications.\u000a\u000aAfter 24 weeks, people had average A1c readings of 7.7 with continuous glucose monitoring and 8.0 without the device, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\u000a\u000aThere wasn\u2019t a statistically meaningful difference in how many patients in each group achieved A1c levels below 7.5 percent or below 7.0 percent by the end of 24 weeks, however.\u000a\u000aPatients with Type 2 diabetes typically don\u2019t use continuous glucose monitors because the devices can be expensive, may not be covered by their insurance plan and might not be recommended by their doctors. DexCom\u2019s continuous glucose monitoring systems can cost more than $1,000.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the devices are more typically used for patients with Type 1 diabetes, which happens when the body doesn\u2019t make insulin and is usually diagnosed in childhood or young adulthood.\u000a\u000aThe study results suggest that continuous glucose monitoring might make sense for certain patients with Type 2 diabetes, said Dr. Vanessa Arguello, an endocrinologist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California-Los Angeles, who coauthored an accompanying editorial.\u000a\u000a\u201cContinuous glucose monitoring may be unnecessary if people with Type 2 diabetes have impeccable glucose control and no (low blood sugar) risk,\u201d Arguello said by email.\u000a\u000aBut this option might make a big difference for people at high risk of low blood sugar and for patients who really struggle to manage their blood sugars and have dangerously high A1c levels above 9 percent, Arguello added.

aVIconic comedian Jerry Lewis was remembered Sunday not only as a legendary performer, but also for raising billions of dollars for the Muscular Dystrophy Association during his decades as the host of the organization\u2019s annual Labor Day telethon.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Muscular Dystrophy Association is deeply saddened by the death of beloved comedian, performer, humanitarian and former MDA telethon star and national chairman Jerry Lewis,\u201d R. Rodney Howell, the organization\u2019s chairman of the board said Sunday, in a statement.\u000a\u000a"The MDA would not be the organization it is today if it were not for Jerry\u2019s tireless efforts on behalf of \u201chis kids,\u201d Howell added.\u000a\u000aOver his 45 years as host of the annual Labor Day telethon, Lewis raised over $2 billion in dollars for research aimed at finding new treatments or even a cure for muscular dystrophy, the MDA has said.\u000a\u000aIn 2009, he was awarded the prestigious "Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award," which is given periodically by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for his work on behalf of the MDA.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor most of my life I thought that doing good for someone didn\u2019t mean you would receive commendation for that act of kindness,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAt least until now,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aLewis didn\u2019t just raise money for the MDA, he also raised awareness of the disease, Howell said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThough we will miss him beyond measure, we suspect that somewhere in heaven, he\u2019s already urging the angels to give \u2018just one dollar more for my kids,' " said Howell, in the MDA\u2019s statement.\u000a\u000aThe MDA went on to note that, during Lewis' lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases, developed treatments, therapies, and standards of care that have allowed many living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger.\u000a\u000aOne notable turning point in understanding neuromuscular disease came in 1986 when Dr. Louis Kunkel, Ph.D., discovered the genetic defect that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Kunkel is a longtime MDA research grantee whose achievement, said Lewis, \u201cwas staggering.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cTo see this breakthrough tells me that indeed in my lifetime, I\u2019m going to see \u2018my kids\u2019 better than they are today,\u201d Lewis said at a press conference during the announcement of the discovery.\u000a\u000aIn September 2016, the Food and Drug Administraiton approved the first-ever drug for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. MDA has funded more than $1 billion in neuromuscular disease research since 1950, with three drugs approved in the last year, for Duchenne MD and spinal muscular dystrophy (SMA), spotlighting the organization's research program and the impact Lewis has had on MD research.

aVPresident Donald Trump was privately furious about National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn's public flogging of his reaction to the violent Charlottesville, Virginia protests earlier this month, according to a White House source, and there may now be a rift between the president and Cohn, who he has been considering to chair the Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aCohn, who is Jewish, earlier this month lambasted Trump's comments blaming the violence on "both sides" in an interview with The Financial Times, drawing Trump's ire, reports The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aTrump is considering replacing current Fed chief Janet Yellen, when her term expires early next year. Yellen, a Democrat has also criticized Trump, without naming him, on Friday in Jackson, Wyoming, saying his call to roll back financial regulations was not a good idea, considering the reforms strengthened the financial system.\u000a\u000aAlan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, said he does not think Cohn is the front-runner to head the Fed anymore, even though Cohn does support Trump's call to roll back banking regulations.\u000a\u000aThere are several other potential replacements for Yellen, should it come to that, notes The Post, including former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; John Taylor, a Stanford University economics professor; and Glenn Hubbard, a former Bush economic adviser and dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.\u000a\u000aIn the Financial Times' interview, Cohn said that "citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK." He also called on the administration to "do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups."\u000a\u000aThe comments marked the first time a member of Trump's inner circle condemned his actions, but it may not have been the first time Cohn has spoken out against the president publicly.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, while having dinner with friends at a Long Island restaurants, Cohn complained, in a voice loud enough to be heard by other diners, that he had to be careful about giving Trump advance notice about his ideas, a source familiar with the dinner told The Post\u000a\u000aThe former Goldman-Sachs banker said if he gives Trump too much lead time, the president could hinder planning by disclosing information too soon.\u000a\u000aWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, while commenting about the Financial Times article, said that Cohn has not held back how he feels about the Charlottesville situation.\u000a\u000a"He\u2019s been very open and honest, so I don\u2019t think anyone was surprised by the comments,\u201d Sanders said.\u000a\u000aCohn has also often blocked proposals being made by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon and others who have aligned with Trump's nationalist leanings, instead choosing to ally with Trump's daughter, Ivanka and her husband, senior advisor Jared Kushner.\u000a\u000aTrump allies hoping to undermine Cohn were happy about his interview, hoping that it would widen a rift between the president and his key economic adviser.\u000a\u000aHowever, Trump is planning to begin his push in earnest next week for tax code reform, and Cohn and his team are central in designing the administration's strategy and a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, notes The Post.\u000a\u000aCohn, who was with Trump on stage during his Charlottesville remarks, told friends in New York and the White House that he was not going to remain quiet about the comments. He also drafted a resignation letter, but neither signed it or discussed it with the president, a source said\u000a\u000aHowever, Cohn told The Financial Times that he is "reluctant" to resign as he wants to fulfill his duties to the United States.\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also Jewish, has resisted calls to resign over Charlottesville, and commented at Friday's White House press briefing that he would not resign, and that Cohn is also "committed to be here."

aVWhen I was young, I don\u2019t recall anyone having a peanut allergy. In fact, we used to eat peanut butter sandwiches nearly every day at my elementary and middle schools.\u000a\u000aBut now peanut allergies are common in our schools. Kids are even told not to bring peanuts or peanut butter sandwiches to the lunchroom because it could cause anaphylaxis \u2014 a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction \u2014 in some children.\u000a\u000aAnaphylactic reactions can cause a drop in blood pressure and inability to breathe. A serious reaction to peanuts can even lead to death.\u000a\u000aThe prevalence of peanut allergies tripled in the United States between 1997 and 2007. Since then, they have increased to affect nearly 4 million people.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s now estimated that 1 percent of American adults and 3 percent of children have a peanut allergy.\u000a\u000aIn fact, it\u2019s occurring among children all over the world, including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, as well as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, and parts of Africa.\u000a\u000aThe fact that it is so widespread rules out a genetic cause. Clearly, there is an environmental cause.\u000a\u000aTheories include parasitic infections, mothers eating peanuts when pregnant, and too-sterile environments for children. But none of these can explain why children everywhere are suddenly deathly allergic to peanuts.\u000a\u000aSomething must be simultaneously happening to children around the world to be causing this epidemic.\u000a\u000aA wonderful book by a mother of a child with a peanut allergy has brought the problem to light. I highly recommend The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by Heather Fraser.\u000a\u000aFraser begins by describing the history of anaphylaxis, a condition characterized by hives, inflammation, vomiting, shock, and drop in blood pressure.\u000a\u000aIn the 19th century, animals sensitized to egg whites went into shock and died after an injection.\u000a\u000aWhen penicillin was first manufactured, peanut oil was used to prolong its action after injection. Hives were reported as a side effect.\u000a\u000aIn 1953, there were multiple reports of anaphylaxis and other problems from injectable antibiotics that contained peanut oil.\u000a\u000aThe peanut allergy epidemic began taking root in the early 1990s. That was the time period when vaccination rates for children increased, and the vaccination schedule started to expand.\u000a\u000aThe Hib (haemophilus influenza type b) vaccine was licensed in 1985. It contains a protein that has a similar molecular weight to the peanut protein Ara h1.\u000a\u000aAccording to Fraser, \u201cThe countries in which the peanut allergy first emerged were those that paired the Hib with the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine. This combination of two childhood vaccines has been shown to produce anaphylaxis in children and enhance the risk of allergic sensitization to foods in the diet or food proteins in a vaccine.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Tasmania, Australia, a 2001 study found that none of 456 children tested reacted to a peanut allergy test.\u000a\u000aBefore 2001, only 27 percent of Tasmanian children were vaccinated. But in 2001, the Australian government instituted a campaign vaccinating more than 94 percent of Tasmanian children.\u000a\u000aIn 2009, the rate of peanut allergies in Tasmanian children was 1.11 percent. Similar results were seen in other countries that increased vaccination rates.\u000a\u000aVitamin K injections in newborns also contribute to peanut allergies. And nearly all newborns in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and other Western countries receive vitamin K injections to prevent hemorrhagic diseases.\u000a\u000aInjectable vitamin K1 contains castor oil. Fraser writes that antibodies to castor seed bind to similar proteins of other oil-seed plants, including peanuts and soy.\u000a\u000aTherefore, injecting newborns with protein from castor oil would increase the risk for sensitization to other oil-seed plants \u2014 like peanuts.\u000a\u000aWhy aren\u2019t all children allergic to peanuts? Each child is a unique biochemical individual, with his or her own ability to get rid of toxins.\u000a\u000aFraser explains that allergies are the body\u2019s way to defend against toxins that cannot be excreted. Therefore, a child with a more compromised immune system, or those given too many vaccines, can be expected to have higher rates of allergies.\u000a\u000aFraser\u2019s book is a warning that vaccines come with adverse effects, such as severe food allergies.

It was during the last seasons of the show that he met his future wife, Chelsea Noble, who played the part of his girlfriend.\u000a\u000aCameron stands apart from many celebrities in Hollywood because he is a conservative and active evangelical Christian. His strong religious beliefs have led him to take part in Christian-themed films, including the \u201cLeft Behind\u201d series, which deals with the world after the rapture upon the Second Coming of Christ.\u000a\u000aHere are five things you might not know about Kirk Cameron.\u000a\u000a1. He has four adopted children \u2014 Along with his two biological children, Olivia Rose and James Thomas, Kirk and Chelsea also adopted four children: Jack, Isabella, Anna, and Luke, according to Movieguide.\u000a\u000a2. He didn\u2019t grow up in a Christian home and was once an atheist \u2014 It wasn\u2019t until age 17 that Kirk developed a close relationship with God. But then a friend invited him to church and that led to his conversion. He later co-founded The Way of the Master, an evangelical ministry, with evangelist Ray Comfort.\u000a\u000a3. His sister has her own ministry \u2014 Candace Cameron Bure also lacked a religious background and became a Christian at age 12. She played D. J. Tanner on TV\u2019s \u201cFull House\u201d and is also a producer along with her ministry, The Christian Post reported.\u000a\u000a4. He has a retreat for terminally ill children \u2014 The camp began while he was still starring in \u201cGrowing Pains.\u201d He and his family were meeting many children through the Make-A-Wish Foundation who wanted an autograph. \u201cMy wife and I wanted to do something more for them than just sign a piece of paper and take a picture,\u201d Cameron said, according to the Christian Post. So Camp Firefly was born.\u000a\u000a5. He doesn\u2019t care if his conservative and Christian beliefs have cost him roles in Hollywood \u2014 \u201cYou have to be true to your higher values,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAs an actor, you\u2019re playing someone other than who you are, but as a human being, you need to be who you are.\u201d He is content with the fact that some people share his views and others don\u2019t.

McCain with an oil tanker near Singapore earlier this week.\u000a\u000a"The military in general is, the Navy is, as they only have two battalions ready today," the Illinois Republican, himself a veteran of the Air Force, told Fox News' "America's Newsroom."\u000a\u000aPart of the issue is in military spending, said Kinzinger, as there is a cap on what Congress can spend.\u000a\u000a"They deserve every penny and more," said Kinzinger, but it's not only money issues.\u000a\u000a"I think it is something else, the amount of what I call ancillary training that we put on, whether it is sailors, airmen, once a quarter, you have to sit down and just do a bunch of computer-based training that has nothing to do with your ability to do your job," said Kinzinger.\u000a\u000aSome of the issue also involve information awareness, he continued, and training requirements for computer simulations.\u000a\u000a"A lot of it is either a congressional leadership or military leadership, covering themselves by saying 'well, if there is a problem, at least we put the computer-based training up,'" said Kinzinger. "But it takes away from the ability to go in and train with the limited time that they have."\u000a\u000aThe USS McCain incident remains under investigation, and there are several factors surrounding the crash, said Kinzinger.\u000a\u000a"There are always training accidents," he said. "It is particularly dangerous, even in peacetime operations, but to see Navy ships collide, it is not like going down and getting into a car wreck. This takes a lot of time."\u000a\u000aThe United States has the "best military" and the "best people in the military, but there is something that is missing," said Kinzinger. "I think no one should have any doubts that our Navy is unmatched, even with these unfortunate incidents."

aV"Handbook for Mortals" has been pulled from The New York Times bestseller list, and author Lani Sarem is firing back at those questioning sales of the young adult novel.\u000a\u000aThe book emerged at No. 1 on the Times' most recent young adult hardcover list, with some questioning how that was possible for a book many publishers and authors had never heard of. Some suspected an organized campaign to buy the book in bulk.\u000a\u000a"After investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for 'Handbook for Mortals' did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title," the Times said in an email to The Hollywood Reporter.\u000a\u000aSarem, an actress and former music manager, told The Hollywood Reporter she thinks the Times caved to social media pressure.\u000a\u000a"I'm super frustrated," she said. "There has been no official explanation to what happened other than they reported inconsistencies. Nobody talked to us."\u000a\u000a"Handbook for Mortals," the debut novel for publisher GeekNation, had knocked Angie Thomas' "The Hate U Give" out of the top spot on the Times list, Entertainment Weekly noted, adding that it takes about 5,000 sales to make the list.\u000a\u000aYoung adult author and publisher Phil Stamper was the first to raise questions about the book on Twitter, Pajiba reported.\u000a\u000aI find it... strange that a mediocre website can decide it wants to be a publisher, and one month later hit #1 on the NYT Bestsellers list. pic.twitter.com/RS1UoWl6H4 \u2014 Phil Stamper (@stampepk) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aThis is what I'm referencing.

"It's disheartening that someone I don\u2019t know decided to attack me today basically because he had never heard of my book. I\u2019ve never heard of his book either. It's probably great, but I\u2019ve never heard of it. Does it mean I would question it, if he had some level of success?"

aVLivestock farms are for people who want to raise animals for business or pleasure. Not everyone is cut out to be a livestock farmer, so knowing about livestock farming helps before starting out.\u000a\u000aLivestock farming may include everything from beef and dairy cattle to pigs, goats, sheep, horses, and even birds. For farmers, it\u2019s a great way to get back into nature, but it also provides the community, the nation, and the world with the products of agriculture.\u000a\u000aHere are six things for farmers to know about livestock farms:\u000a\u000a1. Business plan \u2014 Like any other endeavor, starting a livestock farm means setting goals and developing a plan. This is necessary for hobby or commercial farming. Planning is a way to know how much it will cost for the farm and how much you can charge at a fair price to make it profitable, according to PennState Extension.\u000a\u000aUrgent: Are You Eating These Cancer-Causing Foods?\u000a\u000a2. Love the work \u2014 Raising livestock may be something you want to do, but you\u2019ll have to love it to succeed. Ask farmers about their experiences to learn more. You may have worked on a farm, but knowing all factors involved in livestock farming is essential before making an initial investment.\u000a\u000a3. Know the resources \u2014 The land purchased for a livestock farm can differ, depending on whether you\u2019re raising pigs or cattle. Certain breeds are raised better on certain pastures or land. Stock selection and where a farmer buys livestock also play a part in starting a farm.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Full-time responsibilities \u2014 No matter the size of the farm, a livestock farmer needs to be on hand 24 hours a day. The reasons include everything from feeding a baby animal to retrieving escaped cattle or repairing damage to fencing, Hobby Farms points out. Injured animals are also sometimes in need of round-the-clock care.\u000a\u000a5. Ups and downs \u2014 The agriculture business faces market downturns as with any other business. Aside from their own needs, farmers must be able to take care of their livestock even in bad economic times. Financial resources are needed for the unexpected.\u000a\u000a6. Family and community support \u2014 Some farmers succeed by doing most of the work themselves to curtail costs. Most beginning farmers benefit from family support for labor and advice, explains the University of Wisconsin. Building up credit and community relations also provide much-needed support.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Don\u2019t Make These Mistakes With Allergy Drugs

aVOn the heels of his worst week in office, during which his crude comments about race were widely perceived as defending racism and hatred \u2014 comments that sent some of his natural domestic allies fleeing \u2014 President Donald Trump could not bring himself to articulate a mea culpa.\u000a\u000aInstead, he purported to defend as "some very fine people" the monsters who shouted "Jews will not replace us" and "blood and soil" (a virulent Nazi slogan calling for lands where only Aryans may live) as they clashed with those who rejected their messages in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aPolice failure and general government indifference about the freedom of speech permitted one of the racists to kill one of those who had come to reject the hate.\u000a\u000aAfter the deceased was identified, one of the neo-Nazis there said she deserved to die because she was "fat." It is difficult for me to accept that I am writing about neo-Nazis calling for racial purity and rejoicing in the death of an innocent \u2014 in America in 2017. But here we are. They are among us, and these subjects must be addressed.\u000a\u000aAt first, the president made a rambling statement about bad people on "both sides"; then he read a nicely worded attack on racists; and then he held a disastrous impromptu news conference in which he was so morally ambivalent that he seemed to reject his duty as president.\u000a\u000aRejecting, as well, the pleas of those around him to renounce his own failure to renounce his moral ambivalence \u2014 which won him a public accolade from the most notorious Ku Klux Klan fanatic in the country \u2014 Trump decided to change the subject.\u000a\u000aLike former President Bill Clinton after his disastrous public appearance before a federal grand jury that was investigating him, Trump decided to fight a war. But the war he announced we will "fight to win" earlier this week is the longest, most misguided, costliest and least understood war in our history, and we are fighting for people who hate us.\u000a\u000aIf these phrases and ideas sound familiar, they should. They are not my words \u2014 though I agree with them \u2014 but those of candidate Trump. He articulated them forcefully to the American electorate during last year's presidential election campaign. He actually began attacking the war in Afghanistan long before he announced his presidential candidacy.\u000a\u000aIf he has been consistent on any public issue, it has been his opposition to this useless, lawless, costly war \u2014 until he needed to change the subject.\u000a\u000aWhy war? Because nothing strengthens the presidency and its occupant or commands the attention of the public or weakens domestic political opposition as effectively as war.\u000a\u000aNo rational person will argue publicly that our troops should die or lose or lack the resources to fight even an unjust war, and often even political opponents will jump on a wartime president's patriotic bandwagon. We will witness that scene again soon.\u000a\u000aWith the last anti-war holdout in his inner circle \u2014 Steve Bannon \u2014 gone, Trump embraced the present and former generals with whom he has surrounded himself and surrendered to their arguments.\u000a\u000aI wish he had been faithful to his promise to the electorate to bring the troops home. Instead, he will send an unannounced number of service members and accompanying equipment to Afghanistan \u2014 not to rebuild the bridges and roads the U.S. destroyed there but to fight, to kill and to "win."\u000a\u000aWhat are we doing there?\u000a\u000aThe British tried to tame this unruly barren wasteland, which has never had a modern-day central government, back in the 19th century, and the Russians tried to do the same in the 20th century. They both lost a generation of soldiers and a fortune.\u000a\u000aWhat are we doing there?\u000a\u000aOn Sept. 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by 19 religious fanatics, most of whom were from Saudi Arabia. These monsters were funded by Saudi wealth.\u000a\u000aBut President George W. Bush needed some country to attack in the aftermath, so he convinced Congress that since we couldn't attack the dead people who attacked us or our "friends" \u2014 the Saudis \u2014 who financed them, we should attack their ideological comrades residing in a safe haven called Afghanistan. Instead of attacking the 9/11 attackers' sources, we attacked their friends.\u000a\u000aWhat are we doing there?\u000a\u000aDuring the Republican presidential primary debates, Trump himself savaged former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush so aggressively over his efforts to defend his brother's decision to invade Afghanistan that the younger Bush quit the race; and Republicans voted for Trump in droves.\u000a\u000aWhat are we doing there?\u000a\u000aWe have already spent more than 1 trillion borrowed dollars there, sent more than 100,000 troops there, killed countless innocents there, destroyed towns, cities and ancient artifacts there, lost billions in cash and equipment there; and whomever we have been fighting there for 16 years still controls more than 40 percent of the country.\u000a\u000aWhat are we doing there? How will we know if we have won there? When will we come home for good from there?\u000a\u000aThe answers to these questions are deadly but easy \u2014 when the subject has been changed here.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJudge Andrew P. Napolitano was the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of New Jersey. He is Fox News\u2019 senior judicial analyst. Napolitano has been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and numerous other publications. He is the author of the best-seller, "Lies the Government Told You: Myth, Power, and Deception in American History." For more of Judge Napolitano's reports, Go Here Now.

aVComedy giant and philanthropist Jerry Lewis died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d in Las Vegas with his family by his side Sunday morning, according to a statement issued by his publicist Candi Cazau.\u000a\u000aBut Lewis faced many health problems, including prostate cancer (undergoing surgery in 1992), three heart attacks, Type 1 diabetes, and the chronic lung disease pulmonary fibrosis, which left him dependent on steroids, according to media reports and documentaries about the comedian\u2019s personal and professional life.\u000a\u000aLewis was also hospitalized in 2012 for blood sugar problems and in 2011 for exhaustion, CBS News reported.\u000a\u000aLewis\u2019 death also followed a lengthy hospital stay in June when he was admitted and treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract injection. While he was in the hospital, he developed several other complications, which extended his stay, according to CBS.\u000a\u000aBut the family said the complications from his recent treatment didn\u2019t lead to his death, which was ultimately from undisclosed natural causes.\u000a\u000aThe hospital stay in June was one of many health concerns that plagued him over the years.\u000a\u000aIn the documentary \u201cMethod to the Madness of Jerry Lewis,\u201d the comedian revealed that he suffered a heart attack in 1960 and a second one in 1982, after which he underwent open-heart surgery. When he was hospitalized, it was revealed that he had pneumonia and a \u201cseverely damaged heart.\u201d He underwent a procedure and had stents placed into one of his arteries, which was almost 100 percent blocked.\u000a\u000aThen, on a cross-country flight from San Diego to New York City in 2006, Lewis suffered another heart attack, described as minor, USA Today reported.\u000a\u000aHe publicly disclosed he also developed several addiction problems, one of which was reportedly tied to a back injury he suffered when he fell from a piano while performing in Las Vegas in 1965. The accident nearly left him paralyzed, and he became addicted to painkillers in the 13 years that followed. In 2002, Lewis had a piece of equipment surgically implanted into his back to reduce the discomfort.

aVThe boom in exchange-traded funds is leaving so-called sustainable investing behind.\u000a\u000aThere are just 48 exchange-traded funds that invest based on environmental, social and governance factors, which are collectively known as ESG, according to data from research firm Morningstar.\u000a\u000aThose funds hold a total of $5.7 billion in assets - roughly a third of the $15.4 billion invested in the Parnassus Core Equity fund, the largest actively-managed, ESG-focused mutual fund.\u000a\u000aThe relatively small total of assets invested in sustainable ETFs comes at a time when ETFs overall are rapidly expanding. Investors pulled $264.5 billion out of U.S. actively-managed equity mutual funds in 2016, while pumping a record $282 billion into exchange-traded funds, according to data from Morningstar and FactSet.\u000a\u000a"I do think that ESG will be a growth industry for fund providers eventually, but it will take time for assets to move into these products," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research at New York-based CFRA.\u000a\u000a"Investors in ESG products tend to be more patient and care less about performance than investors in traditionally-managed products, so there might not be the same push to pull assets when a product has underperformed."\u000a\u000aESG-focused funds have been one of the few bright spots for the actively-managed fund industry at a time when lower-cost ETFs and passive index funds are drawing assets, in large part since sustainable strategies often require more research and stock selection that is not easily replicated in an index.\u000a\u000aBlackRock Inc, the largest ETF issuer through its iShares brand, has been expanding its number of ESG funds. The firm launched two ESG-focused bond ETFs last month, increasing its lineup of ESG funds to 10 overall.\u000a\u000a"ESG is very much about risk management," said Martin Small, U.S. Head of iShares at BlackRock, in an interview with Reuters. "ESG is not going to avoid all extreme risks ... It does reduce the range of those risks materially."\u000a\u000aFinancial advisors who focus on ESG investing say that they expect that index providers will create more tailored products, such as the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity ETF and the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF, that will draw more investors out of actively-managed funds.\u000a\u000a"The whole investment industry has been sliced into micro-indexes, and you will see the same thing happen in the ESG field over time," said Marlo Stil, an advisor at Las-Vegas based The Wealth Consulting Group.

aVSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., blasted President Donald Trump's decision to pardon a former Arizona sheriff who was accused of racially profiling Latinos.\u000a\u000aMcCain's office released a statement early Saturday morning that explained the lawmaker's views on Trump's full pardon of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\u000a\u000a"No one is above the law and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold," McCain said.\u000a\u000a"Mr. Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for continuing to illegally profile Latinos living in Arizona based on their perceived immigration status in violation of a judge's orders."\u000a\u000aMcCain said Trump had the power to grant the pardon, "but doing so at this time undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions."\u000a\u000aThe White House announced Trump's pardon of Arpaio late Friday, which prompted lawmakers to criticize the move.\u000a\u000a"Regarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course," said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.

aVRep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said Friday that "Mexico will pay at least part of the tab" for the border wall proposed by President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aOn CNN's "New Day" Friday, host Alisyn Camerota quoted Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto telling Trump in a phone call, "Mexico cannot pay for that wall."\u000a\u000a"It sounds like he's unequivocal, the Mexican president, that he's not going to pay for it."\u000a\u000aGriffith said that Pea Nieto is unequivocal "publicly," although Camerota had quoted him during a private conversation that was later released, that Mexico will "want to continue to have trade with these United States, and to bring their products north. And that's part of the negotiations between nation-states, and we're going to work that out."\u000a\u000aHe added, "I don't have any question that Mexico will pay at least part of the tab. It has to be a partnership, I have no doubt about that."\u000a\u000aGriffith also said, "We promised the American people, not just in the last campaign, we've promised the American people going back to the Reagan administration that we would secure our southern border."\u000a\u000a"We haven't done it; it's time for Congress to act," he said, voicing his support for a government shutdown if money for the wall isn't added to the next funding bill.

aVSoil management is an essential part of farming. The soil type helps farmers decide what crops will grow best because some crops do better with particular types of soil.\u000a\u000aTesting the soil helps determine what nutrients are available or unavailable for growing certain crops. Farmers usually have local agricultural experts test the soil on their land for information on how to proceed in growing crops.\u000a\u000aThe best soil has a balance of nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and others. Certain crops may need more of one nutrient, so farmers put back those ingredients into the soil for better crops.\u000a\u000aHere are six types of soil and what to grow in each:\u000a\u000a1. Loam \u2014 This type of soil helps grow the best possible crops because it provides the necessary elements. Loamy sand contains mostly sand plus clay and silt. It is good for root vegetables, such as carrots and beets, leafy vegetables, and tomatoes, according to SFGate.com.\u000a\u000aAlert: 4 Things You'll Feel Before a Heart Attack\u000a\u000a2. Clay \u2014 Cabbage and broccoli grow well in clay soil, but it may not be good for root vegetables because of its dense texture, writes D. Laverne O\u2019Neal in Hunker. Cherry, pear, maple, and black walnut trees also thrive in clay soil. Edible herbs, including yarrow and red valerian, also benefit from it.\u000a\u000a3. Sand \u2014 Root vegetables, including turnips, parsnips, and carrots, grow well in sandy soil as do pomegranate and fig trees. Bush clover, bayberry, creeping juniper, and thyme are among the herbs that do well in sandy soil.\u000a\u000a4. Silt \u2014 Silty soil is fertile and offers nutrients for development. Lettuce, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and many other vegetables flourish in silt. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, citrus trees, and pomegranate trees also develop well in silt.\u000a\u000aSpecial: World-Famous Cardiologist Reveals Proof: There Is Life After Death\u000a\u000a5. Peat \u2014 Peaty soil provides growth when mixed with rich organic matter, lime, and compost that reduces its acidity, according to Eartheasy. Legumes, root crops, cabbage, and spinach are easily grown in soil that\u2019s well-drained.\u000a\u000a6. Chalk \u2014 Sweet corn, beets, spinach, and cabbage are among the vegetables that benefit from more chalky soil. It is recommended that farmers use fertilizers and balance the pH levels to deal with the alkaline that can sometimes stunt growth.\u000a\u000aTip: Here's How to Never Run Out of Money During Retirement

aVBill O'Reilly told Newsmax TV Friday that removing controversial historical statues is a "case-by-case" issue.\u000a\u000a"I believe the vast majority of Americans do not want their statues and monuments defaced, destroyed or anything like that," the former Fox News host told John Bachman in an interview. "But it's a case-by-case."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Nathan Bedford Forrest, a confederate," he explained. "The Confederate general started the Ku Klux Klan after the war \u2014 and the Klan did a lot of damage and does a lot of damage to this country.\u000a\u000a"Should that statue be up there? I say no.\u000a\u000a"If you're African American and you're walking by that statue, you're going to say, 'Why is there a statue that founded the KKK?'\u000a\u000a"That's a legitimate, absolutely a strong argument that that guy should not be honored with anything," O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000a"You want that statue, you put it in a museum \u2014 and then you tell a story about Nathan Bedford Forrest.\u000a\u000a"But Robert E. Lee is a whole different story," he told Bachman.\u000a\u000a"Yes, Lee fought for a system that wanted slavery. No question.\u000a\u000a"Yes, Lee committed treason against his own country because he put his state, Virginia, over the union.\u000a\u000a"Lee was a West Pointer. He went to West Point.\u000a\u000a"So, Lee is not a hero per-se in my opinion," O'Reilly concluded.\u000a\u000a"However, he was involved after the war in healing the nation, bringing the nation together as Lincoln wanted.\u000a\u000a"He was deeply involved with that and on the battlefield he was an honorable man.\u000a\u000a"So are we going to wipe out Robert E.

aVIt might get lost in today's media climate, but the United States Senate is teeming with hardworking men and women on both sides of the aisle who put in brutally long hours to try and get the job done.\u000a\u000aSome may be plotting their own White House bids in 2020 or beyond. Some may be trying to move up the Senate leadership ladder. And some, believe it or not, may just be trying to deliver on campaign promises for their constituents and the country.\u000a\u000aHere, Newsmax has compiled a list of 15 U.S. senators who are widely considered to be the hardest-working among their colleagues as evidenced by the high regard and esteem shown to them by their peers and voters.\u000a\u000a1. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) \u2014 Grassley won a seventh Senate term in 2016 in a landslide over a Democrat who didn\u2019t even try to attack his advanced age. That\u2019s largely because, at 83, he still visits every county in Iowa annually (he calls it \u201cthe full Grassley\u201d) and runs circles around aides barely half his age. He\u2019ll need to pace himself in the Trump era, during which the Judiciary Committee chair burned the midnight oil to get Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch approved.\u000a\u000aTrump vs. Obama: Who is Better? Vote Here Now\u000a\u000a2. Charles Schumer (D-New York) \u2014 He has his share of critics on Capitol Hill, but few can deny the intense work ethic of Schumer, who learned everything he knows about politics growing up on the streets of Brooklyn. Schumer managed to outhustle Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin last year, securing the support he needed to succeed Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as Democratic minority leader. Indeed, the Energizer bunny of the Senate just keeps going and going and going . . .\u000a\u000a3. John McCain (R-Arizona) \u2014 \u201cIf it\u2019s Sunday,\u201d the inside-the-Beltway joke goes, \u201cit\u2019s John McCain on 'Meet the Press.'\u201d McCain, 80, has been a front-liner in Washington since the Reagan era and, having won a sixth Senate term last year, he shows no signs of slowing down. If anything, he seems to have found new energy this year by reviving his \u201cMaverick\u201d persona, this time to challenge President Donald Trump on foreign affairs and national security issues. His tough stances might hit Trump where it counts most: McCain is the most popular member of Congress on Twitter with more than 2.2 million followers.\u000a\u000a4. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) \u2014 Cotton is a U.S. Army veteran, Bronze Star medal winner, and Harvard Law graduate. Since moving into the Senate in 2015 from the U.S. House of Representatives, he has sponsored 76 pieces of legislation, in addition to 308 bills he co-sponsored. "His vigor in mastering the nuances of foreign policy and speaking schedule in articulating an internationalist view is well-known and often leaves younger staffers breathless," says Newsmax White House correspondent John Gizzi.\u000a\u000a5. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) \u2014 During his career, Portman has developed a reputation of getting results, and his time in the Senate has only bolstered that image as he has used much of it to promote bipartisan legislation, with a third of those bills being signed into law by President Obama. Portman\u2019s longtime legislative priorities have come to the fore in this session, such as removing barriers to job growth and the opioid crisis \u2014 two concerns that have also been championed by President Trump. The senator has already introduced several pieces of legislation in this session to address those two issues.\u000a\u000a6. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) \u2014 Love him or hate him \u2014 and there are certainly plenty of folks in Washington who do \u2014 McConnell is widely considered the senator who sleeps the least, works the most, fights the hardest, and has the scars to prove it. The Senate majority leader has been fighting and working his whole life, dating back to his race for student council president at duPont Manual High School in Louisville \u2014 the first of many races he has won. \u201cAlthough I did feel a bit sorry for him,\u201d McConnell wrote of his opponent in his memoir \u201cThe Long Game.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d simply outworked him.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) \u2014 Reed is a graduate of both Harvard Law and West Point and one of a few cadets in U.S. history to be elected to the Senate. Despite being one of the less visible senators, he is admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Republican Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby once said of Reed: \u201cHe is to be commended for his tenacity, for his never-give-up.\u201d And Sen. Schumer noted that \u201cJack does it in his quiet, steadfast way, and it is extremely effective,\u201d referring to Reed\u2019s deal-making and legislative style.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 12 Ways Trump Could Make You Rich in the Next 24 Months\u000a\u000a8. John Thune (R-South Dakota) \u2014 In addition to serving on three Senate committees \u2014 Finance; Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the latter of which he serves as chairman \u2014 Thune claims membership in 32 separate caucuses that tackle a variety of issues and interests.\u000a\u000a9. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) \u2014 As chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Johnson has a full grasp of the impacts of terrorism and immigration, which is why he\u2019s sponsoring a new initiative to hand over the distribution of work visas to states to issue as they see fit. Along with House Republican Ken Buck of Colorado, Johnson sees this potential legislation as a game-changer in immigration reform while allowing states to meet their specific labor shortage needs. This massive policy work also dovetails with his chairmanship of Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European and Regional Security Cooperation\u000a\u000a10. John Cornyn (R-Texas) \u2014 Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate and the party whip, has had his hands full corralling the party\u2019s voting power as discord between establishment and Tea Party Republicans has threatened to fracture the building majority. This tension is most evident, perhaps, in the sometimes perceived divide between both Texas senators: Cornyn, the establishment bellwether, and Ted Cruz, the Tea Party firebrand. But, the senior Texas senator has shown he can lead the Republican Party to major victories in Senate, such as the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u000a\u000a11. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) \u2014 All you need to know about Graham's work ethic is illustrated by his jam-packed pre-Senate rsum: At 21, his parents died, leaving him to raise his younger sister on his own. He then earned his JD from the University of South Carolina School of Law, joined the United States Air Force, and went on to work as a private practice lawyer before serving one term in the South Carolina House of Representatives and four in the U.S. House. Though sometimes criticized as being one of the more liberal Republicans in the Senate, Graham has remained uncompromising in his willingness to reach across the aisle to get the business of government done.\u000a\u000a12. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) \u2014 McCaskill learned a long time ago that being a woman in politics required her to work harder. \u201cI found that if you are informed and work hard, you can earn credibility,\u201d she wrote in \u201cPlenty Ladylike: A Memoir,\u201d while describing her service in the Missouri Legislature. \u201cI went from being the young blonde with all the hair to being someone whom the senior members approached.\u201d In the Senate, McCaskill has earned a reputation as someone who pulls no punches, speaks her mind and, most importantly, gets things done.\u000a\u000a13. Susan Collins (R-Maine) \u2014 Despite initially being shut out of the Senate Republican working group on healthcare reform, Collins continues to work on the Patient Freedom Act with Louisiana Republican Sen. Dr. Bill Cassidy and other Republican co-sponsors, which they introduced in the beginning of 2017. She hopes that she can attract moderate Democrats to the table to hammer out a comprehensive replacement for the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a14. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) \u2014 One of the more prolific senators, Blumenthal sponsors an average of 70 pieces of legislation a year since his move to the Senate in 2011. Additionally, he has co-signed more than 1,700 bills written by his colleagues. Blumenthal has been quite vocal about pursuing an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal as well as an independent investigation into Russia\u2019s possible role in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000a15. Mike Lee (R-Utah) \u2014 Lee is a member of the Joint Economic Committee; Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; and the Judiciary Committee. He chairs the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights in the Judiciary and the Water and Power Subcommittee in the Energy and Natural Resources.\u000a\u000aExclusive: Trump's 'Secret' Plan Revealed, 100 Days of Shock

aVAfter taking over as head coach of the Chicago Bulls in 1989, Phil Jackson (who had won two NBA championships in 1970 and 1973 playing with the New York Knicks) introduced mindful meditation to the team.\u000a\u000aAfter that, they won six NBA Championships.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Jackson again introduced mindful meditation to his team.

"By introducing an 'X' gender designation in our government-issued documents, we are taking an important step towards advancing equality for all Canadians regardless of gender identity or expression."\u000a\u000aThe option of listing an unspecified gender will begin with an interim measure Aug. 31 until the IRCC is able to print documents including the "X" designation, the statement said.\u000a\u000aThe move is the latest in Canada to embrace nontraditional gender identification, which have included the appointment in November of a special adviser to coordinate government efforts to promote equality for LGBT individuals and a law passed in June to include nondiscrimination protections for gender expression.\u000a\u000aFilling in the gender category is mandatory for travel documents, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\u000a\u000a"I'm thrilled, it's a step forward for our society.

There's no reason to have gender or sexual identity on identification, none whatsoever."\u000a\u000aEight other countries \u2014 Australia, Bangladesh, Germany, India, Malta, Nepal, New Zealand, and Pakistan \u2014 include third options for gender identification on government documents.\u000a\u000aLambda Legal, a nonprofit that promotes LGBT rights, is suing the United States on a behalf of an intersex client seeking a gender identification option on passports that is neither male nor female.

aVFEMA Director Brock Long said Friday he is concerned that people are not heeding evacuation warnings that are being posted as Hurricane Harvey picks up strength on its way into Texas.\u000a\u000a"Texas is about to have a very significant disaster," Long told CNN's "New Day" program. "If they have not [evacuated] their window to evacuate is rapidly coming to a close."\u000a\u000aIf people refuse to heed the warnings, Long stressed, "that's on them. The bottom line is they need to elevate and get into a structure that can withstand potentially category 3 winds from a hurricane."\u000a\u000aLong said he is specifically "very worried" about Harvey's storm surge and the potential for coastal flooding.\u000a\u000aThere will be two aspects to the flooding expected from Hurricane Harvey, Long told CNN.\u000a\u000a"The storm surge has the highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most of damage," said Long. "On top of that, we are looking at a significant inland flood event over many counties, which is going to be a sizable event."\u000a\u000a"The first is the coastal flood inundation which refer to as storm surge," he said. "This is wind-driven water that's going to encroach on the coastal barrier islands and go up the back bay inland areas, which is the most dangerous."\u000a\u000aThen, over the next five days, there will be "copious amounts of rainfall, up to 25 inches possibly in some areas, with isolated higher amounts," said Long. "This is going to be a slow-developing major disaster event for the state of Texas."\u000a\u000aThe federal government cannot issue a mandatory evacuation order, said Long, as that must come on the local level.\u000a\u000a"In Texas, local county officials are responsible for issuing evacuations," said Long. "I do not have the authority to issue any evacuation whatsoever."\u000a\u000aLong, the former head of Alabama's Emergency Management Agency, said what causes him the most concern is the way Harvey is strengthening.\u000a\u000a"The storm is getting stronger, the pressure is dropping, all indications from the National Hurricane Center that this is going to be the first major hurricane the nation has dealt with since 2005," said Long. "Right now FEMA is already in the state of Texas. We have pre-positioned incident management teams, life-saving, life-sustaining commodities. We have search and rescue teams in the state and we're ready to go to support our state partners."\u000a\u000aLong said most likely in upcoming hours, President Donald Trump will start getting requests for presidential disaster declarations coming from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\u000a\u000a"As soon as those come up, we're able to, the president has the ability, the authority to sign off on those to mobilize our support to the state government," Long said.\u000a\u000aHe said he's been in continuous contact with Trump and federal officials, and that the president is "giving me full authority in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the federal assets down to the state and local level as soon as we're called upon."\u000a\u000aAlso appearing on MSNBC, Long stressed that Harvey will be a "disaster."\u000a\u000a"What that means is your normal daily routine is about to be disrupted for multiple days, infrastructure and power will go off," Long said. "People need to be making final preparations to you know, to expect those kinds of things to happen. It's going to take time for the infrastructure to come back online, but we're prepared to support that effort."\u000a\u000aThe United States has not been hit by a major hurricane since 2005, said Long, and in many cases, people have never experienced the threat of a storm surge.\u000a\u000a"It's the hazard associated with hurricanes that have the highest potential to cause the most amount of damage and kill the most amount of people," said Long. "Nobody lives to talk about their experience with storm surge."

aVWhite House chief adviser Steve Bannon was fired for going "off the rails," for trashing the Trump administration and stealing the spotlight from the commander-in-chief himself, veteran political commentator Michael Reagan told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000a"There's not room for two narcissists in one building basically. And when Steve Bannon decided to go off the rails and do the interview he did with the American Prospect, the fact is the matter he wrote his own death sentence, if you will," Reagan, the son of Ronald Reagan said to Bill Tucker on "Newsmax Now."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615. If your cable operator doesn't have Newsmax TV just call and ask them to put us on \u2014 Call toll-free 1-844-500-6397 and we'll connect you right away to your cable operator!\u000a\u000aFor more places to Find Newsmax TV \u2014 Click Here Now\u000a\u000a"It reminded me of [deputy White House chief of staff] Mike Deaver in my father's administration [who] had a photo taken of him next to his jaguar in front of the White House and the caption was: 'Who speaks to the president of the United States of America?'\u000a\u000a"And about 72 hours later no more Mike Deaver involved in the White House. You can't do that. You got to work as a team and one thing this White House has not done to this date is work as a team. They work as individuals, but you need a team to move agendas not individuals."\u000a\u000aSources told Newsmax the boom was lowered after Bannon told American Prospect there is "no military solution" to dealing with North Korea's nuclear threats. He also publically trashed Susan Thornton, acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the State Department, and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and said senior White House officials were "wetting themselves" over changing U.S. trade strategy.\u000a\u000aReagan said White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who replaced Reince Priebus in a bid to bring order to the ongoing chaos in the administration, and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, likely had a hand in Bannon being shown the door, although ultimately Trump approved the heave-ho.\u000a\u000a"I don't think Trump likes anybody doing interviews other than him. I think that article was probably really what led Trump to finally come onboard and say 'we need to get rid of this guy. I can't have him going out there making news when I'm the president and I'm the one who's supposed to be making all the news,"' Reagan told Tucker.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, made waves when he told reporters on Thursday that Trump "has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful."\u000a\u000aIt's a sentiment that Reagan agrees with.\u000a\u000a"A lot of Republicans have been saying that and in many ways it's very, very true with what he is saying. The president of the United States needs to wake up and the people of his own party are trying to tell him what he needs to in fact be doing that he's not doing," Reagan said.\u000a\u000a"The whole thing with Charlottesville was a train wreck for him. Absolute train wreck."\u000a\u000aReagan was referring to the president's extraordinary flip-flopping on placing blame for those responsible for the deadly violence at last Saturday's white supremacy rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aThe commander-in-chief sparked outrage when he first said "many sides" were to blame for the violence in which counter-protester Heather Heyer, 32, was killed. He later flip-flopped and called out the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and white supremacist groups. Then, he flip-flopped again, by going back to his "many sides" view on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aTrump also said some of the alt-right protesters are "very nice people" and both sides of the protests had some "very fine" people.\u000a\u000a"This is the guy who thinks of politics like he's playing tennis and he's got to win every single point. If he went to Wimbledon, he wouldn't be happy with winning 6, 4. And that's why he keeps on going back and redoing what he's already done and that's where he hurts himself," Reagan said.\u000a\u000a"[His flip-flops] caused Corker and many Republicans just to shake their heads because they're looking at re-election too in another year. And they've got to get everybody on the team and they can't have a Republican Party that's in absolute disarray, that's thought of as a racist party walking into an election in 2018."\u000a\u000aReagan said one of Trump's chief problems is that he running the nation like he ran his business \u2014 as a dictator and somebody who ultimately ignores the advice of his staff.\u000a\u000a"He ran his business like a dictatorship and that's what he's doing within the White House. He doesn't see those people as equals. He sees those people as just underwings that he's in charge of. And people are afraid to say something. They leak things because they're afraid to talk to him, afraid he's going to go off on them on a Twitter rampage," Reagan said.\u000a\u000a"And so people are very cautious about being around the president of the United States. The only people he defends are family members. There's nobody else this president defends. And he's got to start defending Republicans instead of blaming them \u2026"\u000a\u000aAs well, Reagan added, Trump's policies are completely muddled.\u000a\u000a"If you took his staff and you put them in a room and \u2026 and you said 'what's the policy on North Korea?' You get five different answers. There's no policy," he said.\u000a\u000aReagan is the author of "Lessons My Father Taught Me: The Strength, Integrity, and Faith of Ronald Reagan," written with Jim Cenney and published by Humanix.

aVPresident Donald Trump will pardon former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio on federal contempt charges because "it was his duty to protect his people" from crime brought on by illegal immigration, Bill O'Reilly told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000a"Arpaio defied the government," the former Fox News host told John Bachman in an interview. "He was rightly convicted because he overstepped his local mandate \u2014 but if I were Trump, I'd pardon him."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

That's his deposition," O'Reilly said. "If he did it the wrong way, he did it the wrong way.\u000a\u000a"But Trump can go in and say: 'Look, the guy was trying to protect his folks in Phoenix and in Maricopa.

aVHousehold debt is rising at an alarming rate, along with credit delinquency in several sectors, and the Fed just issued a sobering warning in response.\u000a\u000aWhen this debt bubble pops, it could shake markets and touch every American\u2019s pocket book.\u000a\u000aIn the case of our last crisis, mortgage debt was the primary culprit. But with the debt bubble that\u2019s growing today, credit cards, student debt, auto loans, and other forms of debt are all playing a part\u2026 and that could make the damage even worse.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the threat this new debt bubble poses to your savings, and how to stay safe from it.\u000a\u000aNothing Like This Since 2008...\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s only one other time in U.S. economic history that we\u2019ve seen consumer debt activity like today\u2019s, and that was back in 2008\u2026 right before a debt-fueled bubble collapsed the entire economy.\u000a\u000aToday, the situation looks eerily similar.\u000a\u000aAmerican credit card debt rose to exceed $1 trillion in June, shattering the previous record high set in the summer of 2008. Student and auto loans are breaking record highs as well. Student loans now sit at a whopping $1.45 trillion. And auto debt trails shortly behind at $1.131 trillion.\u000a\u000aAnd mortgages? Well, mortgage balances have steadily increased throughout 2017, and they now stand at over $8.69 trillion.\u000a\u000aAcross every sector, consumer debt is at an all-time high. Now resting at over $12.73 trillion, we\u2019re well past our previous peak from the third quarter of 2008.\u000a\u000aThat fact alone is extremely troubling, but what\u2019s happening with credit delinquencies is even worse.\u000a\u000aFed Warning Shows Something Is Very Wrong\u000a\u000aDelinquency rates are like a canary in the debt coal mine. When they start to rise, we know something bad is waiting around the corner. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening now.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s starting with credit card debt. Delinquency rates on credit cards have \u201cticked up notably,\u201d according to a prominent Fed official. It could be an early indicator of a looming crisis.\u000a\u000aA recent statement from the New York Fed reads (emphasis ours):\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile relatively low, credit card delinquency flows climbed notably over the past year,\u201d said Andrew Haughwout, senior vice president at the New York Fed. \u201cThis is occurring within the context of loosening lending standards, as borrowers with lower credit scores recover their ability to access credit cards. The current state of credit card delinquency flows can be an early indicator of future trends and we will closely monitor the degree to which this uptick is predictive of further consumer distress.\u201d\u000a\u000aPay close attention to those statements in bold. What the Fed is essentially saying is that consumers are failing to meet their debt obligations at an unusually high rate, despite the fact that our lending environment is at its \u201ceasiest\u201d in decades!\u000a\u000aAnd this isn\u2019t just happening with credit card debt. Similar trends can be seen in the auto and student loan markets as well.\u000a\u000aUltimately, this means we\u2019re approaching a tipping point with consumer debt. And once that point is reached, the consequences could be even more severe than our last debt bubble.\u000a\u000aProtection from the Next Debt Bubble Collapse\u000a\u000aSo what kind of effects can we expect when this huge new debt bubble finally pops?\u000a\u000aStocks, bonds, and other traditional investment instruments will almost certainly behave just like they did in 2008\u2026 and anyone heavily invested in those instruments is dangerously prone to take a painful beating.\u000a\u000aHoarding your savings in cash isn\u2019t a very attractive alternative either. When the Fed rushes to keep the economy intact with rate cuts and quantitative easing (and possibly even negative interest rates), thus flooding the market with more dollars, the spending power of the dollars you already own in your savings will be decimated.\u000a\u000aBut there is one asset that can offer both protection and opportunity for growth when this bubble eventually pops: physical precious metals .\u000a\u000aAfter 2008, metals prices went through the roof -- just as they have in response to every major crisis of the last century. And when this consumer debt bubble reaches its destructive end, they'll likely do the same yet again.\u000a\u000aPeter Reagan is a financial market strategist at Birch Gold Group. As the Precious Metal IRA Specialists, Birch Gold helps Americans protect their retirement savings with physical gold and silver.

aVLivestock farms are for people who want to raise animals for business or pleasure. Not everyone is cut out to be a livestock farmer, so knowing about livestock farming helps before starting out.\u000a\u000aLivestock farming may include everything from beef and dairy cattle to pigs, goats, sheep, horses, and even birds. For farmers, it\u2019s a great way to get back into nature, but it also provides the community, the nation, and the world with the products of agriculture.\u000a\u000aHere are six things for farmers to know about livestock farms:\u000a\u000a1. Business plan \u2014 Like any other endeavor, starting a livestock farm means setting goals and developing a plan. This is necessary for hobby or commercial farming. Planning is a way to know how much it will cost for the farm and how much you can charge at a fair price to make it profitable, according to PennState Extension.\u000a\u000aUrgent: Are You Eating These Cancer-Causing Foods?\u000a\u000a2. Love the work \u2014 Raising livestock may be something you want to do, but you\u2019ll have to love it to succeed. Ask farmers about their experiences to learn more. You may have worked on a farm, but knowing all factors involved in livestock farming is essential before making an initial investment.\u000a\u000a3. Know the resources \u2014 The land purchased for a livestock farm can differ, depending on whether you\u2019re raising pigs or cattle. Certain breeds are raised better on certain pastures or land. Stock selection and where a farmer buys livestock also play a part in starting a farm.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Full-time responsibilities \u2014 No matter the size of the farm, a livestock farmer needs to be on hand 24 hours a day. The reasons include everything from feeding a baby animal to retrieving escaped cattle or repairing damage to fencing, Hobby Farms points out. Injured animals are also sometimes in need of round-the-clock care.\u000a\u000a5. Ups and downs \u2014 The agriculture business faces market downturns as with any other business. Aside from their own needs, farmers must be able to take care of their livestock even in bad economic times. Financial resources are needed for the unexpected.\u000a\u000a6. Family and community support \u2014 Some farmers succeed by doing most of the work themselves to curtail costs. Most beginning farmers benefit from family support for labor and advice, explains the University of Wisconsin. Building up credit and community relations also provide much-needed support.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Don\u2019t Make These Mistakes With Allergy Drugs

aVSpecial:\u000a\u000aTop Doc Shares Simple Daily Habits for Healthy Prostate\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aThe One Thing Your Prostate Needs Every Morning\u000a\u000aAdvanced technology has improved prostate cancer surgery to reduce the risks of erectile dysfunction following the procedure. However, possible nerve damage during surgery can still cause impotence in some men. Urinary incontinence is another possible side effect.A man\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain an erection after prostate cancer surgery may depend on age, sexual function before the operation, and whether certain nerves are cut during the procedure, according to the American Cancer Society . The organization stated that all men may experience some decrease in the ability to have an erection. But the younger the man, the better chances there are of maintaining the ability to have an erection.Surgeons attempt to avoid injuring the nerves in the prostate gland that enable men to have sexual function. If the cancer has grown near the nerves, the nerves on one side or both sides of the prostate might have to be removed, causing possible erectile problems.Impotence might be prevented through new procedures such as robotic surgery, although there are no guarantees. Robotic surgery includes a high-definition visual technique, called the da Vinci system, that allows surgeons to operate with better precision, dexterity and control than with other methods, according to da Vinci Surgery The advanced surgical technique results in more precise removal of cancerous tissue with less risk of damaging surrounding tissue and nerves. This has shown a faster return to erectile function for patients who have not had problems with impotence before the surgery.Fewer complications occur with robotic surgery than with traditional methods of prostate cancer surgery. Research shows more patients returning to the erectile function they had before the surgery than with other surgeries during checkups a year later, da Vinci Surgery noted. However, sexual dysfunction due to nerve damage remains a potential risk from the surgery.Laparoscopic surgery uses a tiny video camera inserted into the abdomen, making it possible to make smaller incisions than in traditional prostate surgery methods. Robotic surgery is a type of laparoscopic surgery. Instead of operating directly themselves, the surgeons operate from a panel that controls robotic arms.There is less of a risk of scarring with robotic surgery than with other surgeries, according to Dr. David B. Samadi, chief of robotic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The build-up of scar tissue following surgery may cause complications in the proper function of the prostate gland. These complications are less likely with the minimal incisions used in robotic surgery.

In fact, she proved so popular in 2016 that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign tapped her to help boost the candidate\u2019s social media profile. But it was her Final Thoughts segment aimed at Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest that really launched her into the stratosphere. On Lahren\u2019s official Facebook page, which has nearly 4 million page likes, the Kaepernick post alone collected 135,000 comments, 718,000 likes, 1.5 million shares, and 66 million views.\u000a\u000a2. Elliott Echols \u2014 As the director of the Republican Leadership Initiative in Washington, D.C., Echols mobilized the organization to train political field staffers and organizers for the 2016 election. The 26-year-old activist spent most of the election traveling to various battleground states to focus the Initiative\u2019s efforts in what would become an upset victory in the presidential race. Prior to his current role with the Republican National Convention, Echols was the national youth director for the RNC, a position that was geared toward engaging both young voters and College Republican groups.\u000a\u000a3. Hadley Heath Manning \u2014 A senior policy analyst and director of health policy at the Independent Women's Forum, Manning, 28, is frequently invited to comment on issues like healthcare, entitlements, and economic policy for print, digital, radio, and television media.

Bumgardner served on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding, Education, and Transportation committees while in office.\u000a\u000a8. Erin Stewart \u2014 The mayor of New Britain, Connecticut, Erin Stewart was re-elected to a second term in 2015 by a convincing margin, championing a leadership that is bipartisan in a largely Democratic state. The 29-year-old\u2019s executive career began in landmark fashion when she became the youngest mayor in the city\u2019s history, the second woman to hold the office, and now the first to be re-elected in New Britain. Her name is already being whispered around the state in connection to upcoming elections for higher offices currently occupied by Democrats.\u000a\u000a9. Saira Blair \u2014 She was the youngest person elected to either state or federal office in 2014, winning in the first election in which she was eligible to vote.

aVWhich are the busiest U.S. housing markets?\u000a\u000aAccording to a new report, the most active metropolitan areas include Chicago, where an inventory logjam appears to be loosening. Also, Colorado Springs, Washington, D.C., and Reno, Nevada, near Tesla\u2019s massive battery factory, which is attracting workers and driving housing demand. Lexington, Kentucky, rounds out the top five.\u000a\u000aThe least active metros are San Francisco, where the median home value has topped $1 million, and Rochester, New York where a typical home is worth $177,000.\u000a\u000aMarkets where homes are changing hands are noteworthy at a time when inventory shortages have constrained sales while pushing prices higher and provoking bidding wars for listings that do hit the market.\u000a\u000aLimited supply and high prices have damped activity in markets, like San Francisco, that are typically associated with high demand.\u000a\u000aThe chart comes from Attom Data Solutions\u2019 pre-mover index, which derives from mortgage applications submitted during the second quarter of 2017, offering a glimpse of home sales just ahead.\u000a\u000aThe index is compiled by comparing the number of homes flagged in mortgage applications to the total number of homes in a given market.\u000a\u000aBecause the data come from applications submitted from April through June, they include some transactions that have already closed and some that are still pending.\u000a\u000aThe index offers faster feedback than data pulled from recorded sales, according to Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom.\u000a\u000aThe report offers clues to where buyers are finding a greater supply of affordable homes, with the suburbs surrounding Washington, Chicago, and Atlanta topping the list of the busiest counties.\u000a\u000a\u201cWithin regional markets, we\u2019re seeing some similar patterns to the last housing boom, where it became drive until you qualify,\u201d Blomquist said, referring to the real estate adage urging home hunters to go where they can afford to buy.\u000a\u000aHome loans are harder to get this time around, he added, but housing market activity appears most robust in \u201cthe outlying counties further from jobs, but also less expensive.\u201d

aVOrders for long-lasting manufactured goods sank 6.8 percent in July, the biggest fall in nearly three years, led by a drop in the volatile category of civilian aircraft. But a gauge of business investment rose last month.\u000a\u000aThe Commerce Department said Friday that orders for durable goods \u2014 items meant to last at least three years \u2014 reversed a sharp gain in such orders in June.\u000a\u000aThe numbers were warped by a 19 percent drop in orders for transportation equipment, a category that bounces wildly from month to month. Specifically, orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 70.7 percent in July \u2014 payback for a 129.3 percent surge in June.\u000a\u000aExcluding transportation, orders rose a solid 0.5 percent last month.\u000a\u000aEconomists had expected orders to drop after the big gain in June. Overall, American industry continues to look mostly solid. Manufacturers have rebounded from a slump in late 2015 and early 2016 caused by cutbacks in the energy industry and a strong dollar that makes U.S. goods costlier overseas.\u000a\u000aSpending on durable goods accounts for a small part of American economic output. But changes in durable goods orders often signal where the economy is headed, so forecasters and investors watch the report closely.\u000a\u000aThe category that's seen as a harbinger of future business investment\u2014 orders for capital goods excluding defense equipment and aircraft \u2014 expanded 0.4 percent in July.

aVStatues of famous people \u2014 and one animal \u2014 could replace removed likenesses of Confederate military leaders if several online petitions are successful.\u000a\u000aThe Hill put together a list of three celebrities whose fans want them to be honored with statues in various locations across the country.\u000a\u000aMusician Missy Elliott. More than 31,000 people have signed a petition that calls for the removal of the Confederate Monument in Olde Towne Portsmouth, Virginia. The petition wants to see a statue of Elliott put in its place.\u000a\u000a"Getting this statue put up will be a lot of work and you may ask yourself is it worth it? I say yes and ask you to join me in letting us work it. Together we can put white supremacy down, flip it and reverse it," the petition reads.\u000a\u000aMusician Britney Spears. More than 6,500 people have put their names on a petition that asks the city of New Orleans to take down its Confederate statues and replace them with one of Spears, who hails from Kentwood, Louisiana.\u000a\u000a"Do the right thing: Replace the Confederate statues with an actual Louisiana hero and influential human being, Britney Spears," reads the petition.\u000a\u000aSnooty the Manatee. The world's oldest captive manatee died at age 69 in July. An online petition would like to see a Confederate statue in Bradenton, Florida taken down and replaced with one of Snooty.\u000a\u000a"To honor Snooty's legacy as a positive icon in Bradenton, I propose that the negative symbol of racism and oppression that is the Confederate monument be relocated and replaced with a statue of Snooty the Manatee," reads the petition.\u000a\u000aSeveral Confederate monuments have been taken down, or are slated to be taken down, in recent years because critics say they are reminders of slavery and racism.\u000a\u000aThe planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia led to violent riots there two weeks ago.

aVIf those on the Left sincerely wish to address America\u2019s historical injustices, rather than simply pursue partisan advantage, they should advocate the removal and purification of the hundreds of tributes to Democrats who oppressed blacks and other minorities.\u000a\u000aThey should start by being honest when they resist statues of Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, and other luminaries of the slave-owning South. These were not Republicans, as the Trump-hating Left hopes to convince people who don\u2019t know much about history. Rather, these Confederates were all Democrats.\u000a\u000aA statue of the late Senator Robert Byrd (D - West Virginia) stands in the U.S. Capitol. Some 55 bridges, highways, dams, and other facilities in Byrd\u2019s state carry his name. These honor Byrd\u2019s 51 years in the Senate, including 12 as Democrat leader, as recently as 1989. Byrd told the late Fox News anchor Tony Snow this about race relations in March 2001: \u201cThere are white n*****s. I\u2019ve seen a lot of white n*****s in my time; I\u2019m going to use that word.\u201d Byrd led the 83-day Democrat filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and spoke non-stop for its defeat for 14 hours on the Senate floor. Byrd also was an Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan, for which he recruited some 150 fresh Klansmen in the 1940s. Why have Democrats not cleansed the Capitol of this former Klansman\u2019s image, and urged West Virginians to do likewise?\u000a\u000ain Byrd\u2019s state carry his name.

Why have Democrats not cleansed the Capitol of this former Klansman\u2019s image, and urged West Virginians to do likewise? Democrat President Woodrow Wilson headed Princeton University, signed the Federal Reserve Act, commanded U.S. forces in World War I, and pioneered multilateralism through the League of Nations. These were momentous achievements, like them or not. Wilson also was a raving bigot who re-segregated the bathrooms in the federal building beside the White House. He hosted a February 15 screening of D.W. Griffith\u2019s pro-KKK epic, "Birth of a Nation," at the Executive Mansion. Wilson also said: \u201cSegregation is not a humiliation but a benefit .\u201d Why have Democrats not already pried this man\u2019s name from Washington, D.C.\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Bridge?\u000a\u000a.\u201d Why have Democrats not already pried this man\u2019s name from Washington, D.C.\u2019s Woodrow Wilson Bridge? Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt piloted the New Deal, pioneered Social Security, and orchestrated the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan \u2014 enormous accomplishments, no doubt. But, during World War II, FDR locked up roughly 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry in 10 internment centers, including California\u2019s Manzanar camp, solely due to their heritage. Also, as Woodrow Wilson\u2019s assistant secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt signed the August 8, 1916, order to re-segregate the bathrooms in the State, War, and Navy Departments Building \u201cfor the use of women, white men and Colored.\u201d Thus, Democrats should be thrilled to dismantle Washington\u2019s FDR Monument and sandblast his face from the dime.\u000a\u000aThe Right can pursue these facts along one of two paths:\u000a\u000aRepublicans and conservatives could hammer Democrats and liberals pitilessly as grotesque hypocrites who fail to repudiate and erase those on their side of the aisle who spent time, energy, and even government resources to abuse and terrorize blacks and other minorities.\u000a\u000aAlternatively, Republicans and conservatives could remind Democrats and the Left that their heroes, like nearly all human beings, blend good and bad, triumphs and tribulations, talents and shortcomings. Some display these contrasts more starkly than others. Thus, Americans could dislodge virtually every statue ever sculpted. JFK, LBJ, and MLK were unfaithful husbands. Winston Churchill drank his way through World War II and screamed at his staff. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.\u000a\u000aBefore the tributes to Jefferson, Lee, or even Roosevelt crash down into chunks of stone and hunks of steel, the time is now to halt the War on Statues. Instead, Americans should leave these works of art in peace, erect new statues of admirable people, and install bronze plaques to outline the good, the bad, and the ugly about those preserved in metal and marble. Every American would learn from that approach \u2014 most important, an urgent reminder about the angels and demons wrestling within each of us.\u000a\u000aDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a contributing editor with National Review Online.

Genworth Financial noted that for 2015 , the average adult day health care was about $17,900 annually, while the average annual cost for assisted living in the U.S. was $43,200 and a semi-private room in a nursing home cost on average $80,300.Here are five cities \u2014 and states \u2014 that offer value across the spectrum of care needs.The metropolitan area of Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, Georgia, was No. 1 on U.S. News and World Report's list of affordable long-term care , the magazine reported, adding that having a health care aide in your home costs about $17 an hour and adult day care costs about $55 daily.No. 2 on the U.S. News list was the Midwest\u2019s Chicago-Naperville-Joliet, Illinois, region, the magazine noted, adding that some home health care providers charged as low as $16 an hour.A 2014 study by the insurance provider Genworth called Louisiana the cheapest state for long-term care needs, with an average annual cost of $35,743. Louisiana was followed on Genworth's list by Alabama and Oklahoma.The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas, area made the No. 3 ranking on the U.S News list. The magazine noted: "A semi-private room in a Dallas nursing home costs a median of $46,173 a year, the lowest of any major metro area in the country."While Detroit may make the list of tough crime cities as it continues to rebuild its urban core after years of neglect, it remains an affordable place for long-term care. The Motor City, along with nearby suburbs of Warren and Livonia are below the national average, U.S. News noted. However, the costs there are rising quickly, the magazine noted.

aVChristian pastors and Jewish rabbis and leaders have initiated nearly every significant sociopolitical event in America. Their churches and synagogues were catalysts and hubs that made possible the American War of Independence, the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s suffrage, and civil rights. They founded schools and hospitals, created architectural wonders, and emphasized the preservation of nature.\u000a\u000aReligious landmarks in most of the original 13 states could easily fill their own top 50 lists, especially the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. However, these sites exemplify the diversity of America\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and commitment to religious freedom \u2014 the hallmark of American exceptionalism.\u000a\u000aWithout further adieu, here are Newsmax\u2019s Top 50 Religious Landmarks in America:\u000a\u000a1. \u201cGod\u2019s Square Mile;\u201d Ocean Grove, New Jersey; 1869 \u2014 This popular seaside retreat, concert, and vacation destination for millions is a lasting testament to the Victorian-era revivalist movement that followed the Second Great Awakening. Methodist ministers founded Ocean Grove believing \u201creligion and recreation should go hand in hand.\u201d Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this quaint town is crammed with picturesque Victorian homes, antiques, a historic Auditorium, chapel, and tent community, and offers numerous tours and activities on land, sea, and air. Methodists still gather here regularly as well as other Christian groups.\u000a\u000a2. Plymouth Rock and Plymouth Plantation; Plymouth, Massachusetts; 1620 \u2014 Especially at Thanksgiving, but all year round, millions come to learn what life was like in the first European settlement in New England. Three must-see sites include Plymouth Rock in Pilgrim Memorial State Park, which marks the arrival of the pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620. Nearby, visitors can board and tour a replica of the Mayflower, the ship the pilgrims sailed on to reach the New World. Spend at least a day to explore the living history museum of Plimouth Plantation (original spelling), taste 17th-century foods, and meet knowledgeable staff wearing period dress.\u000a\u000a3. San Antonio de Valero; San Antonio, Texas; 1720 \u2014 Better known as \u201cthe Alamo,\u201d this unassuming and uncompleted Spanish mission remains the quintessential symbol of freedom in the West. It is less known for its architectural style (akin to nearby Mission Concepcin) or that it was the first European hospital in Texas. Instead, the Alamo is synonymous with the Mexican Army\u2019s brutal slaughter of everyone inside its walls and the vow of freedom fighters to keep fighting. \u201cRemember the Alamo\u201d became more than a rallying cry used to win the War of Texas Independence. Without Texas, the U.S. government\u2019s access to land west of the Mississippi was nearly impossible. But after statehood, Texas opened up access to the West, after which 10 states joined the Union.\u000a\u000a4. French Huguenot Church; Charleston, South Carolina; 1687 \u2014 After the Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, French Huguenot Protestants fled to mostly British colonies, including the mostly eastern, coastal, pre-Colonial American towns. Called the \u201cChurch of the Tides,\u201d it was first built in 1687 in downtown Charleston by floods of French immigrants arriving in ships. By 1700, roughly 450 Huguenots had settled in this area of South Carolina. The church was rebuilt in 1844 after a fire and was nearly destroyed during the Civil War and later by an earthquake in 1866. Today, its services are no longer held in French, except once a year, but the church serves as a \u201cliving remnant and reminder of the Huguenot experience\u201d in South Carolina.\u000a\u000a5. St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral; New York City; 1879 \u2014 In 1785 there were only 200 Roman Catholics in New York City. But after a flood of Irish Catholics immigrated after surviving Ireland\u2019s potato famine, the Diocese of New York was created in 1808. By the early 1840s, the bishop of New York, John Hughes, proposed building \u201cthe most beautiful gothic cathedral in the New World,\u201d believing it would become \u201cthe heart of the city.\u201d Named after the Patron Saint of Ireland, the Cathedral idea was ridiculed as \u201cHughes\u2019 Folly.\u201d Today, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral is the most visited church in America, including a visit from a Roman Catholic Pope. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI was the first Pope to celebrate Mass at the cathedral.\u000a\u000a6. Touro Synagogue; Newport, Rhode Island; 1658 \u2014 Touro Synagogue is the oldest synagogue building still standing and only surviving Colonial synagogue building in America, and the oldest surviving synagogue building in North America. Founded by Spanish-Portuguese Jewish immigrants, its congregation dates to 1658 although construction of the synagogue did not begin until 1759 (completed 1763). Its most notable leaders include Isaac Touro, Aaron Lopez, Abraham Pereira Mendes, and Henry Samuel Morais. A 1790 letter President George Washington wrote to its congregation extolled the virtues of religious freedom and his commitment to protecting Jewish worship in America.\u000a\u000a7. Congregation Mikveh Israel; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1740 \u2014 Founded in the 1740 by Spanish-Portuguese Sephardic Jewish immigrants, it is the oldest continuous congregation in the United States. Called the \u201cSynagogue of the American Revolution,\u201d without its first members, the American Revolution might not have been possible. Instrumental to the cause were Haym Solomon, who helped finance the revolution, and the Gratz brothers who supplied the Continental Army with the bulk of its ammunition and supplies. Open to the public, tours (available in person and online in the virtual) and exhibits detail 270 years of American Jewish history.\u000a\u000a8. Plymouth Church; Brooklyn, New York; 1846 \u2014 A hidden gem in Brooklyn Heights, New York, is a National Historic Landmark whose first pastor was a powerful abolitionist. Henry Ward Beecher\u2019s fiery sermons and mock auctions of slaves created media frenzy and overflowing pews. Plymouth Church, Brooklyn\u2019s \u201cGrand Central Depot,\u201d was a primary hub along the Underground Railroad and influential even in Kansas (See No. 38.). Beecher also published the first hymnal in the world to have both music and words printed on the same page. His sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, authored one of the most significant works of literature in American history, \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d\u000a\u000a9. U.S. Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel; Colorado Springs, Colorado; 1962 \u2014 One of the most iconic landmarks in America is the place of worship for 4,000 U.S. Air Force cadets. The chapel\u2019s magnificent 17 spires constructed of steel, aluminum, and glass are shaped like fighter jets bursting towards the heavens. Inside are three chapels and two all-faith rooms, exemplifying its mission \u201cto facilitate the free exercise of religion.\u201d Visitors should plan a trip before summer of 2018 when major renovations are scheduled to begin. Open daily; groups can request guided tours.\u000a\u000a10. Harriet Tubman Thompson AME Zion Church; Auburn, New York; 1859; and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historic Park; Eastern Shore, Maryland; 2014 \u2014 The African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church was the stalwart defender of human rights for black Americans and strong opponent of slavery. Known as \u201cthe Freedom Church,\u201d it was home to the leader of the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, and famous black American civil rights activists, Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. Before the Civil War roughly 500 former slaves traveled through Auburn in their escape north, finding respite at Harriet Tubman\u2019s home and the AME Zion Church. Tubman was a devout Christian, hunter, and a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army. Referred to as \u201cMoses,\u201d Tubman risked her life to save hundreds of slaves traversing land and water spanning more than 300 miles from Maryland to New York. The national park and the Harriet Tubman Byway provide information and a self-guided 125-mile driving tour of her route, which includes 36 historical sites.\u000a\u000a11. Third Haven Meeting House; Talbot, Maryland; 1684 \u2014 Although the Society of Friends (Quakers) had been in the area since 1640, the third meeting house they built in 1684 is believed to be the oldest Friends Meeting House still standing in the United States still in use. Third Haven Quakers were viewed by their neighbors as \u201cGood Samaritans\u201d because they were the first to take in sick or ill-treated indentured servants, and they began their efforts to free slaves as early as 1674. In 1766, one famous Quaker, John Woolman, traveled barefoot (wearing undyed clothes) throughout the Eastern Shore of Maryland pleading with every slave owner to free their slaves and no longer profit from slavery. They, like their Tuckahoe Neck neighbors, would become instrumental in the Underground Railroad.\u000a\u000a12. \u201cThe Nation\u2019s Church,\u201d Christ Church; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1695 \u2014 Christ Church is the birthplace of the American Episcopalian denomination. Prominent Revolutionary War leaders worshipped here and its cemetery holds the remains of some of the most important political and religious leaders of the Colonial and Revolutionary-era, including those of Benjamin Franklin and four signers of the Declaration of Independence. Tours of the church and cemetery are held daily.\u000a\u000a13. Mission Dolores Parish; San Francisco, California; 1776 \u2014 Comprised of the original Misin San Francisco de Ass and the Dolores Basilica, this parish was essentially the birthplace of \u201cThe City by the Bay\u201d and has served the community since the days of the original, native Californians. It\u2019s the oldest, intact mission in the state, even surviving the great 1906 earthquake that leveled and burned more than three-quarters of the city. During his 1987 visit at the height of the AIDS epidemic, Pope John Paul II blessed 62 AIDS patients, including a 4-year-old child, at Mission Dolores.\u000a\u000a14. Holy Trinity \u201cOld Swedes\u201d Church; Wilmington, Delaware; 1699 \u2014 Swedish immigrants initially settled in the Delaware Valley in the mid- to late 17th century and built Lutheran churches. Most significant are the three that share similar architecture called "Old Swedes": Holy Trinity, Gloria Dei Church in Philadelphia (founded 1677 and the oldest church in Pennsylvania), and Trinity Church in Swedesboro, New Jersey (founded 1703). All were significant catalysts during the Revolutionary and Civil Wars whose members were prominent political, medical, and military leaders. Holy Trinity Delaware is reportedly "the nation's oldest church building still used for worship as originally built." Its cemetery holds more than 15,000 burials, including many noteworthy influencers.\u000a\u000a15. Roger Williams National Park; Providence, Rhode Island; 1636 \u2014 One of the most influential leaders in England, America, and Europe, was Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island. His 1644 treatise on religious freedom, \u201cThe Bloody Tenent of Persecution,\u201d influenced political philosophy for centuries. In 1636, Williams purchased land from the Narragansett Indians, naming this new colony, Providence, establishing it as a haven for freedom of conscience. The national park offers tours and a range of information about Williams, 17th-century life, and portrays how Thomas Jefferson and James Madison incorporated William\u2019s beliefs as the bedrock of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\u000a\u000a16. Temple Square; Salt Lake City, Utah; 1853 \u2014 One of Utah\u2019s top tourist attractions is Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. Its 35 acres encompasses the world headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, free, guided tours of historic sites, special exhibits, art displays, and films about Mormon culture and heritage. It also features parks and gardens, and it boasts the largest genealogy library of its kind in the world.\u000a\u000a17. The St. Louis Cathedral; New Orleans, Louisiana; 1720 \u2014 Not far from the delights of Caf du Monde sits the oldest cathedral in North America. Originally founded as a Roman Catholic parish in 1720, this cathedral\u2019s iconic and majestic triple steeples make it one of New Orleans\u2019 most remarkable landmarks. Its beauty is enhanced by the constant stream of jazz music flowing through its stained glass windows, enjoyed by visitors and parishioners alike.\u000a\u000a18. Old North Church; Boston, Massachusetts; 1729 \u2014 Although the church is Boston\u2019s oldest, it\u2019s most known because of Paul Revere\u2019s midnight ride on April 18, 1775. As he rode his horse through neighborhoods warning, \u201cThe British are coming! The British are coming!\u201d his destination was the Old North Church. It was the meeting place of the Revolution from which the famous signal, "One if by land, and two if by sea" was reportedly sent. The people who met here prepared for the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which began the American Revolution. Of Boston\u2019s numerous historic religious sites, this is part of the Freedom Trail.\u000a\u000a19. Old South Meeting House; Boston, Massachusetts; 1729\u2014 Built by congregants who broke from a church founded by John Winthrop in 1630, this church became central to public debate. Renowned for its protest meetings, it was called, the \u201cmouth-house\u201d before the American Revolution. It has always been a symbol and platform for the free expression of ideas. In 1773, 5,000 people gathered to debate British taxation, after which some dumped crates of tea off of three British ships into the Boston Harbor. It was from this church that Founding Father, Samuel Adams, gave the signal to the \u201cwar whoops,\u201d beginning the Boston Tea Party. Its first pastor published the state\u2019s first medical tract; notable congregants included Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin\u000a\u000aFranklin, Samuel Sewall, and African-American poet Phillis Wheatley.\u000a\u000a20. Christ Church; Savannah, Georgia; 1733 \u2014 Founded the same year as the colony of Georgia, its first church services were held in English, French, and Italian. Its most notable rector was the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, from 1736-1737. Wesley started the first Sunday school and published one of the first English hymnals in the colonies. Its bell was made by Revere and Son of Boston, which is still used today. One of its members, Juliette Gordon Low, founded the Girl Scouts of America. Wesley\u2019s successor was his friend and fellow evangelist and leader of the Great Awakening, George Whitefield, who served as the church\u2019s rector until 1740. He also founded the Bethesda Orphan House and Academy (Bethesda Academy), the oldest home and school for boys in America. His home for girls, Mercy House, is one of the oldest period homes in Savannah dating to 1740. Whitefield\u2019s message, fervor and oratory capabilities brought about the First Great Awakening in America between 1738 and 1770.\u000a\u000a21. Amish Heritage Sites of Pennsylvania; 1760 \u2014 One of the only unchanged communities in America can be found in the picturesque slopes and fields of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and its neighboring counties. Founded in 1760, America\u2019s oldest Amish community, and neighboring expansive Mennonite community, presents a popular year-round vacation and educational destination where traffic and time slow to the pace of horse-drawn buggies, and windmills, not cell phones, are prevalent. Old World attractions and events, handmade crafts, quaint bed-and-breakfasts, and homemade food abound from the Pennsylvania Dutch, who maintain a lifestyle made possible because of the religious freedom they enjoy.\u000a\u000a22. \u201cThe Little Chapel that Stood\u201d St. Paul\u2019s Chapel; New York City; 1766 \u2014 This chapel, which celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2016, is the oldest surviving church building, the only colonial-era building, and the oldest public building in continuous use in Manhattan. George Washington was inaugurated as the first U.S. president here, with the first members of Congress in attendance, on April 30, 1789. The chapel not only survived the Great Fire of 1776 (after the British won the Battle of Long Island and burned one fourth of the city), but also miraculously survived 9/11. Located opposite of the World Trade Center, not one of its windows was broken. The church became and remains a respite for survivors and symbol of hope. Open to the public, visitors can view old and new monuments and memorials.\u000a\u000a23. Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcal; San Diego, California; 1769 \u2014 Called the "Mother of the Missions" this National Historic Landmark was the first of 21 Spanish missions established by Franciscan priest Father Junpero Serra in modern-day California when it was the Spanish territory New Spain (Mexico). It fell under Mexican government control in 1821 and then under American control in 1848. Most notable of the mission\u2019s many achievements was the large-scale vineyard and farming operation it implemented, which by 1825 included more than 28,000 head of livestock and an olive harvest that helped source California\u2019s 1878 olive boom. It built a dam and a several-miles-long aqueduct, which was remarkable considering that the land was arid and no such farming existed prior to the Franciscans\u2019 arrival.\u000a\u000a24. The Billy Graham Library and Museum; Charlotte, North Carolina; 2007 \u2014 Perhaps one of the greatest American evangelists of all time, the Reverend Billy Graham reached several hundred million people in more than 185 countries in his lifetime, preaching the gospel and the freedom and liberty that comes with it. The impact of his ministry and information about his life and organizations\u2019 efforts are displayed through multimedia presentations, photos, memorabilia, and a tour of his childhood home. His ministries continue to provide disaster relief and humanitarian aid to people in need worldwide.\u000a\u000a25. Trinity Church; New York City; 1790 \u2014 Although it was first built facing Wall Street in 1697, the church was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1776 and rebuilt by 1790. Its 281-foot steeple was for nearly 200 years the highest point in the city and a landmark for ships entering Hudson Bay. President George Washington and members of his government, including John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, attended services here for two years when New York City was America\u2019s first capitol. Its cemetery holds the remains of many notables, including Alexander Hamilton and his family members.\u000a\u000a26. Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church; Montgomery, Alabama; 1954 \u2014 From the pulpit of this church, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ignited the Civil Rights Movement. Serving as its pastor from 1954 to 1960, he and others led countless civil rights meetings and activism, supporting the 1955-56 Montgomery bus boycott.\u000a\u000a27. First Church of Christ Congregational; Farmington, Connecticut; 1771 \u2014 Built in 1771, one of the church\u2019s first pastors was the father of the founder of Yale University. But the church became famous in 1839 for sheltering the African slaves who revolted on the Spanish ship, La Amistad. It was already a significant hub on the Underground Railroad, and its leaders were active abolitionists. Their cause for righteousness gained even more momentum after the Amistad trial, which became a turning point for the abolitionist movement.\u000a\u000a28. St. Michael the Archangel Cathedral; Sitka, Alaska; 1808 \u2014 For those who make the trek to Alaska or whose cruise ship stops in Sitka, one interesting stop is a visit to the National Historic Landmark, St. Michael\u2019s, a reconstruction of the historic Russian Orthodox cathedral. (The original burned in 1966.) Sitka was the former seat of the Russian Orthodox Diocese that governed all of North America, and was under control of Russia until 1867. This cathedral was the \u201clargest and most imposing edifice in Alaska until the 20th century.\u201d Although Alaska did not become a state until 1959, the cathedral fell under the authority of the Orthodox Church of America Diocese of Alaska in 1872, which has maintained its unique Russian characteristics.\u000a\u000a29. St. John\u2019s Church; Washington, D.C.; 1816 \u2014 Located directly across the street from the White House, this historic Episcopalian Church is known as the \u201cChurch of the Presidents.\u201d Since 1815, every U.S. president has attended at least one service here. Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who rebuilt the White House and the U.S. Capitol after the War of 1812, built it.\u000a\u000a30. Old Ursuline Convent; New Orleans, Louisiana; 1752 \u2014 Built in 1752, the convent is the only remaining French colonial building in America, and one of the only buildings in the French Quarter that survived a devastating fire in the 18th century. But its legacy is more than its architecture. The Sisters of Ursula founded schools, orphanages, and the first asylum to treat the sick and poor in New Orleans, and in numerous cities throughout America. St. Mary\u2019s Church adjoins the old convent, which is open for guided tours.\u000a\u000a31. Baltimore Basilica; Baltimore, Maryland (Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary); 1806-1821 \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Cathedral\u201d is the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in America after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. The archbishop of Baltimore\u2019s cousin, Charles Carroll, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Its architect, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, also designed the U.S. Capitol.\u000a\u000a32. St. Mary\u2019s Basilica; Natchez, Mississippi; 1843 \u2014 Like the Roman Catholics in the Southwest and West, the Catholic community in Natchez fell under the authority of several countries. Discovered in 1682 by Robert de la Salle, its first parish was established in 1722 by a French Catholic priest. After France lost the French and Indian War in 1762 it ceded the Louisiana territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain, which built a church in Natchez in 1788. In 1763 France ceded the land east of the Mississippi to England. After America gained its independence, Natchez was caught in-between Spain and America. Spain sold New Orleans to France in 1800 then France sold the Louisiana Territory to America in 1803. Needless to say the cathedral, which was established in 1843 and consecrated in 1886, reflects its multinational and ethnic heritage and is visited by people all over the globe because of its \u201cbreathtaking\u201d beauty.\u000a\u000a33. Mormon Trail Center; Omaha, Nebraska; 1846 \u2014 Unfortunately, after Joseph Smith\u2019s revelation in Palmyra, New York, he and his Mormon followers did not experience religious freedom in America. Run out of the East Coast as a heretic, he and his followers continued migrating west. The Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters depicts the experience of 90,000 Mormon pioneers who traveled west to the Rocky Mountains between 1846 and 1860. The museum displays a log cabin, covered wagon, and other aspects of their journey. Open daily; the center hosts guided tours and a yearly quilt show.\u000a\u000a34. Washington National Cathedral; Washington, D.C.; 1990 \u2014 Officially called the "Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington," the cathedral was completed in 1990 after 200 years of planning and construction. President George Washington had in 1792 sought to build "a church intended for national purposes." The gothic-style cathedral sits 400 feet above sea level on top of Mount Saint Albans in northwest Washington, D.C. Part of the National Park Service; it is the sixth largest in the world and second largest in America. The cathedral has held many significant funeral services including those of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Dwight Eisenhower. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from this pulpit before his assassination. Its cemetery holds the remains of many notable Americans including Woodrow Wilson and Helen Keller.\u000a\u000a35. Temple-Tifereth Israel; Cleveland, Ohio; 1850 \u2014 This 165-year-old Reform Jewish congregation\u2019s several sites include its gold-domed Byzantine-style temple, which is now part of the Maltz Performing Arts Center at Case Western Reserve University. Its Temple Museum of Jewish Art, Religion and Culture, is one of the oldest museums of Judaica in North America. Its gallery space at the Beachwood synagogue and Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage exhibit the history of Judaism and Jewish immigrant experiences in America.\u000a\u000a36. Race Street Meeting House; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1856 \u2014 The historic and still active Quaker meetinghouse was at the forefront of the women\u2019s rights movement. Its famous leaders include women\u2019s rights activist and abolitionist Lucretia Mott, peace activist Hannah Clothier Hull, and suffragette leader and author of the Equal Rights Amendment Alice Paul. A National Historic Landmark, this meetinghouse represents the achievements of women who tirelessly fought to end slavery and advance civil rights for women.\u000a\u000a37. Mission San Juan Capistrano; San Juan Capistrano, California; 1776 \u2014 Perhaps most famous as a destination for migratory swallows, the mission, dubbed the \u201cJewel of the California Missions,\u201d is a treasure trove of art, artifacts, architecture, and gardens to explore. Hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 and birds \u2014 visit the mission annually.\u000a\u000a38. Beecher Bible And Rifle Church; Wabaunsee, Kansas; 1856 \u2014 Following the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill in 1854, Kansans had to vote to become a free state or a slave state and choose which side of the Civil War it would support. East Coasters flooded into Kansas to influence the vote, including a group from Henry Ward Beecher\u2019s Plymouth Church, No. 26 on the list. To convince Kansans of the evil of slavery \u2014 they smuggled in Sharps rifles, widely known as \u201cBeecher Bibles,\u201d which Beecher maintained was a \u201cmoral agency\u201d necessary to fight the evils of slavery.\u000a\u000a39. Metropolitan AME Church; Washington, D.C.; 1872 \u2014 The oldest continuously operating black church in the District of Columbia was active in the abolitionist movement, sheltering slaves along the Underground Railroad. The first black U.S. senator to serve a full term, Sen. Blanche Kelso Bruce, of Missouri, was a church member. In 1894, he introduced fellow congregant and leading abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who delivered his last speech before he died, \u201cThe Lessons of the Hour,\u201d in which he admonished the U.S. to end racial prejudice so that the nation could \u201cflourish forever.\u201d Other leading figures who\u2019ve spoken at Metropolitan include Mary McLeod Bethune, the early 20th-century civil rights leader, Joel Elias Spingarn, a founder of the NAACP, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.\u000a\u000a40. Congregation Beth Jacob Cemetery; Galveston, Texas; 1888 \u2014 Galveston, Texas, is one of the oldest havens for Jews in North America. Home to Congregation Beth Jacob and its historic cemetery and Congregation B\u2019nai Israel, the oldest Reform synagogue in Texas, they represent the history of Jewish immigrants who came to America seeking freedom from religious persecution. The first Jewish European settlement in Galveston was founded in 1816. In 1907, New York financier Jacob Schiff and Reform Rabbi Henry Cohen of Galveston launched the Galveston Movement Plan, which helped bring more than 10,000 Jews to Galveston who escaped Russian and Eastern European pogroms.\u000a\u000a41. St. John the Divine; New York City; 1892 \u2014 The largest cathedral in the world is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Building began in 1892 but its construction remains only two-thirds completed. Continuing its Romanesque-Byzantine and French gothic style, its completion relies on European master stonecutters. Visitors can gaze at its colossal structure whose nave alone is the size of two football fields, and at its Great Rose Window, the largest glass window in America, made from more than 10,000 pieces of colored glass. Inside its 162-foot dome the Statue of Liberty could easily fit. Twice a year its three-ton bronze doors are opened \u2014 on Easter and during the Feast of St. Francis.\u000a\u000a42. Congregation Sherith Israel; San Francisco, California; 1851 \u2014 This Reform temple boasts a monumental Spanish revival era stained-glass window that depicts the story of Moses on Mount Sinai \u2014 with a twist. Established by Jewish pioneers during California\u2019s Gold Rush, the window shows the iconic El Capitan towering from the Yosemite Valley (replacing Mount Sinai), symbolizing the Jewish yearning for a promised land and their new life in America.\u000a\u000a43. Temple Emanu-El; New York City; 1847 \u2014 Temple Emanu-El is the world\u2019s largest temple and the first Reform congregation established in New York City. In addition to the building\u2019s magnificent art deco, Byzantine, and Moorish-influenced mosaics, its museum holds a collection of Hanukah lamps dating to the 14th century.\u000a\u000a44. Unity Temple; Oak Park, Illinois; 1905 \u2014 The Frank Lloyd Wright Trust describes Unity Temple as \u201cthe greatest public building of the architect\u2019s Chicago years.\u201d Included as one of the stops on the Frank Lloyd Wright tour, visitors continue to be intrigued by the building\u2019s invisible entrance while they learn about the Unitarian Universalists\u2019 roles in the abolition and civil rights movements.\u000a\u000a45. Twin Cathedral; Twin Cities, Minnesota; 1915 \u2014 Roman Catholicism was introduced into the territory that is now Minnesota in the 1830s. By the early 1900s, two cathedrals were designed by the same architect in the same classical revival style and were completed within a few years of each other. By 1915, the first liturgy was read at the Cathedral of St. Paul, which is the third-largest Roman Catholic church in America. Its \u201ctwin,\u201d the Basilica of St. Mary, claims the distinction of being the first church in America designated as a basilica. The Basilica School opened in 1913. Free tours are available during which visitors can learn of the churches\u2019 historic involvement with immigrant communities and its ongoing commitment to the arts.\u000a\u000a46. Riverside Church; New York City; 1930 \u2014 Inspired by a famous French cathedral, Riverside Church is the tallest church in America and the 24th tallest in the world. Its architectural feat is rivaled by its congregants\u2019 commitment to social activism and \u201cnondenominational inclusivism.\u201d In the west portal, its \u201cArch of Scientists\u201d includes sculptures of Archimedes, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Louis Pasteur, Isaac Newton \u2014 and Albert Einstein. When Einstein heard that as a Jew he was included in a Protestant church he said, \u201cThis could not happen in Europe. I am afraid it may never happen there.\u201d Fleeing Jewish persecution in Germany, he found respite in Princeton, New Jersey.\u000a\u000a47. Temple Beth Sholom; Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; 1959 \u2014 This futuristic, pyramidal synagogue is the only synagogue ever designed by the famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. A National Historic Landmark, its walls and ceilings are masterfully decorated with geometrical designs. It represents significant architectural history and the 20th-century suburbanization of Jews into middle- and upper-class America.\u000a\u000a48. Mason Temple Church of God in Christ; Memphis, Tennessee; 1968 \u2014 More than 3,000 people gathered at this temple to hear Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his prophetic "Mountaintop" speech on April 3, 1968 \u2014 the eve of his assassination. The temple was central to civil rights meetings and activism in Memphis during the 1950s and \u201960s, and today remains the headquarters of the Church of God in Christ, the second-largest black denomination after the AME.\u000a\u000a49. The Chapel in the Hills; Rapid City, South Dakota; 1969 \u2014 This wooden church transports visitors to a Scandinavian world of more than 800 years ago. On the western outskirts of Rapid City lies a full-scale replica of a 12th-century Norwegian Borgund stave church. Visitors can learn about Norwegian immigrant history at a small museum, which includes an original log cabin previously owned by Norwegian settlers, and attend daily summer worship services in the chapel.\u000a\u000a50. Saint Photios Greek Orthodox Chapel and National Shrine; St. Augustine, Florida; 1985 \u2014 The first Greek Orthodox community in North America was established in New Orleans by a small group of Greek merchants. They also settled in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1768. Although the first permanent Greek Orthodox community was established in New York City in 1892, this National Shrine serves as a monument and museum that tells the Greek immigrant story and pursuit of finding religious freedom in the New World.

aVThe United States is one of the most charitable countries in the world with Americans donating more than $358 billion in 2014 alone, according to GivingUSA.org. Charity runs deep through the fabric of who we are as a people, so it is little wonder that many U.S. charities celebrate the values that founded this nation. Those values include individual freedom, self-reliance, equality of opportunity, competition, and hard work, to name a few.\u000a\u000aTo compile this list of Newsmax\u2019s Top 50 Charities That Celebrate American Values, our editors combed through reputable online resources such as Charity Navigator, GreatNonprofits, and Philanthropedia. We also consulted with several well-connected nonprofit professionals.\u000a\u000aWe used the following criteria to establish inclusion in the list: The nonprofit needed to excel at promoting one of the core American values above.

aVFlorida is scheduled on Thursday to put to death an inmate by lethal injection that includes a drug never before used in a U.S. execution.\u000a\u000aMark James Asay, 53, would be the first Florida inmate executed since January 2016, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty process was unconstitutional because it gave powers to judges that should be reserved for juries.\u000a\u000aAsay would also be the first white man executed for killing a black man in Florida since the state revived its death penalty in 1979, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\u000a\u000aIn dissenting from a Florida Supreme Court ruling earlier this month denying a stay of execution, Justice Barbara Pariente wrote that Asay was being treated as "the proverbial guinea pig" for the untested death penalty drug, etomidate, which she said would violate the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\u000a\u000aThe court's majority cited a U.S. Supreme Court decision from two years ago that said that since the death penalty is constitutional, there must be a way to carry out executions and that eliminating all pain during them was not workable.\u000a\u000aFlorida, along with other states, had to find a replacement for drugs that became unavailable when drugmakers stopped distributing them because of their stands against the death penalty. In Florida, etomidate replaced midazolam, which Pfizer Inc stopped making last year to keep it from being used in executions.\u000a\u000aEtomidate, an anesthesia invented in Belgium in the 1960s by Janssen, now a division of privately held U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson, is off patent and more readily available than midazolam and produced by others as a generic drug. Janssen stopped making the drug last year, after never selling it in the United States.\u000a\u000a"We do not condone the use of our medicines in lethal injections for capital punishment," Janssen said in an emailed statement.\u000a\u000aMarty McClain, Asay's attorney, told Reuters on Wednesday that etomidate, which would be part of a three-drug lethal injection protocol, causes pain before it takes hold and could cause involuntary body movements that make it difficult for corrections personnel "to know when the guy is unconscious."\u000a\u000aAsay was sentenced to death in 1988 for the killing of two men in Jacksonville a year earlier.\u000a\u000aHe shot Robert Lee Booker in the belly after an argument in which he used a racial slur against him, according to court records. He killed Robert McDowell by shooting him multiple times in the chest. Asay said later he believed McDowell had cheated him out of $10.\u000a\u000aBooker was black and McDowell was white.\u000a\u000aSince it resumed capital punishment in 1979, Florida has executed 90 men and two women.\u000a\u000aFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed a death warrant for Asay in January 2016. Days later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it should be juries, not judges, who decide whether aggravating factors determine if a defendant is eligible for execution.\u000a\u000aFlorida lawmakers rewrote the state's capital punishment law this year to require that juries be unanimous when recommending the death penalty.

aVFor decades the \u201ctwo-state\u201d paradigm \u2014 which calls for the establishment for an independent Palestinian state to be established in Judea-Samaria (a.k.a the \u201cWest Bank\u201d) which fell to Israeli forces in the 1967 Six Day War \u2014 has dominated the discourse of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\u000a\u000aOpponents of this idea have often warned of the dire dangers that that such an outcome would herald for Israel, however many in the general public have little notion of how potentially perilous a Palestinian state would be for Israel.\u000a\u000a(Photo Credit: Mycolors/Dreamstime)\u000a\u000aThese dire dangers that are graphically illustrated in the following series of photographs taken from sites inside the territory designated for any future Palestinian state.\u000a\u000aThey demonstrate, dramatically, how vulnerable and exposed Israel would appear through the binoculars of a Palestinian \u201cintelligence officer\u201d (a.k.a. a terrorist).\u000a\u000aGreater Tel Aviv Skyline as Seen From a Potential Palestinian State\u000a\u000a(Photo Credit: Hagai Nativ)\u000a\u000aThe clearly visible Azrieli Towers complex is an iconic feature of the central Tel Aviv skyline.

aVSome Americans believe the best way to eat healthy meals is to prepare them at home. In fact, Health Fitness Revolution says the benefits of home-cooked meals include better nutrition, better control of portion sizes, and the confidence of knowing you are using quality ingredients.\u000a\u000aHowever, there may be times when preparing a fresh meal to savor at home is simply not an option. Whether you\u2019re picking up dinner after your child\u2019s soccer practice, ordering lunch with co-workers, or stranded at an airport, your options could be limited to fast food.\u000a\u000aAs Americans become increasingly concerned with their health, many chains have been stepping up their efforts to create more options for everyone. Nowadays, it is easier than ever to find acceptably healthy meals even in the most unlikely of places: a fast-food restaurant.\u000a\u000aAlert: 5 Signs Cancer Is Starting Inside Your Body\u000a\u000aTo compile Newsmax\u2019s list of 10 Healthiest Fast-Food Meals, the nutrition facts, ingredient lists, and sourcing information for many popular fast-food restaurants were thoroughly researched. Meals that have a good balance of protein and carbohydrates, quality ingredients, and limited artificial additives comprise the base criteria for formulating the list. Sodium content and calorie counts factored into the selection process as well.\u000a\u000aThis list is especially handy for New Year's resolution time when most people are looking to make healthier choices.\u000a\u000a1. Chipotle Salad with Sofritas \u2014 Daniel Levine, trends expert and director of The Avant-Guide Institute, tells Food Dive that consumers are focused on fewer processed ingredients, artificial additives, and preservatives. If you need evidence of this trend, check out the long lines you\u2019re sure to find at any Chipotle restaurant during peak business hours.\u000a\u000aSince its humble beginnings, Chipotle has been committed to sourcing quality ingredients. From pasture-raised meats to completely GMO-free ingredients, Chipotle leads the way for sourcing quality ingredients. Most of the menu items contain only easily recognizable, whole-food ingredients prepared on-site daily.\u000a\u000aChipotle has a handy nutrition calculator that shows how your favorite fixings will affect the overall nutrition of your burrito, bowl, or salad. The salad topped with flavorful organic tofu (sofritas), fajita vegetables and black beans for extra fiber, fresh tomato salsa, and guacamole comes in at 550 calories. It has a whopping 24 grams of fiber, 19 grams of protein, and 46 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re watching carbohydrates, skip the black beans and cut the total in half. While the salad does contain almost an entire day\u2019s worth of sodium, the other nutritional attributes combined with the best ingredient quality in the fast-food business make Chipotle a top choice for healthy meals.\u000a\u000a2. Panera Bread Ancient Grain and Arugula Salad with Chicken \u2014 This upscale bakery-caf chain, which includes St. Louis Bread Co., has recently marketed its commitment to eliminating many additives from its menu. This gradual shift to eliminate all artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, and preservatives was completed by the end of 2016. You can download a complete list of the ingredients that Panera Bread eliminated at its website.\u000a\u000aThe restaurants feature a number of relatively healthy options. This 410-calorie salad is featured because it is low in sodium, only 290 milligrams, and has a generous 25 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. Organic grains like farro, barley, and freekeh are combined with zesty arugula, sweet apple and cabbage slaw, and refreshing red grapes. Panera Bread tops the salad with antibiotic-free chicken to make it a complete and satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a3. Elevation Burger single burger with side salad \u2014 This small but growing burger chain began in 2005 with a mission to serve great burgers made of only 100 percent organic, grass-fed beef. According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, grass-fed beef is a return to the way beef was traditionally raised, before large-scale beef producers began feeding cattle with low-quality corn. Not only is grass-fed beef naturally lower in calories, but it has a more favorable fat profile and a higher level of healthy omega-3 fatty acids compared to grain-fed beef.\u000a\u000aElevation Burger\u2019s single burger has just 330 calories. It has 23 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates, and about one-quarter of the recommended daily allowance of sodium, just 520 milligrams. Instead of fries, opt for the side salad to get a small dose of greens.\u000a\u000a4. Starbucks Classic Whole-Grain Oatmeal \u2014 Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it is also the one most likely to get skipped if you are short on time. It is easy to find breakfast foods at most fast-food restaurants these days, but few of them are nutritious. Coffee giant Starbucks offers a hearty oatmeal that will keep you satisfied until lunch.\u000a\u000aUnlike other fast-food oatmeal, this one contains mostly just rolled and steel-cut oats without the long laundry list of additives and added sugar. When ordered plain, it contains 160 calories with 4 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, 28 grams of carbohydrates, and only 125 milligrams of sodium. For more flavor and some healthy fat, top it with Starbucks\u2019 nut medley and dried fruits toppings.\u000a\u000a5. McDonald's Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich \u2014 This fast-food giant is known for its classic burgers, but it has grown its menu substantially over the years to include many other foods based on changing consumer preferences.\u000a\u000aThe Artisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich is one of the healthiest options available at McDonald\u2019s in part because of its relatively simple ingredient list. The corporation says it has committed to sourcing only antibiotic-free chicken. The sandwich contains 380 calories, a hefty 37 grams of protein, 44 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber, and 960 milligrams of sodium. For a fiber boost and to make it a complete meal, skip the fries but order a side salad instead.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Fix Your Blood Pressure (Do This Every Day)\u000a\u000a6. Subway Rotisserie-Style Chicken Salad \u2014 The Subway chain boasts nearly 45,000 restaurants in 112 countries worldwide, so its \u201csandwich artists\u201d can be found in cities and rural areas alike. While Subway has not taken the same clean food approach to its ingredients as the other chains topping our list, its franchises have plenty of meal options that won\u2019t ruin your diet.\u000a\u000aThis salad features grilled chicken and a customizable array of fresh vegetables. It has just 170 calories, only 4.5 grams of total fat, and 340 milligrams of sodium. It will keep you satisfied with 24 grams of protein and 10 grams of carbohydrates. If you\u2019re adding a salad dressing, the Subway Vinaigrette is your best choice for healthiest salad dressing. Containing 35 calories, 3.5 grams of total fat, and 110 grams of sodium per serving, it is by far lightest option on the menu.\u000a\u000a7. Burger King Veggie Burger \u2014 This vegetarian burger is touted by WebMD as being \u201csurprisingly tasty,\u201d and the Morningstar patty doesn\u2019t taste like a beef substitute. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or not, this is a healthy option if you\u2019re dining at Burger King.\u000a\u000aThe veggie burger is 310 calories if ordered without mayonnaise and has a generous 22 grams of protein, 6 grams of fiber, 42 grams of carbohydrates but 990 milligrams of sodium. Skip the fries and order a side salad with just a drizzle of salad dressing to make a full meal.\u000a\u000a8. Wendy\u2019s Rich and Meaty Chili and Side Salad \u2014 Wendy\u2019s has made a commitment to providing options to fit the health concerns of all consumers. For example, Wendy\u2019s has an online Meal Builder resource that allows you to customize your meal and preview its nutrition information before you even order.\u000a\u000aOne of the best options for health-conscious eaters at Wendy\u2019s is its chili. A large cup of beef chili is high in protein and low in calories. With 250 calories, 23 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrates, and 5 grams of fiber, the chili is a meal in itself. As is hard to avoid with many fast-food restaurant items, the Rich and Meaty Chili is high in sodium at 1,170 milligrams, and that\u2019s without the crackers or toppings. Pair the chili with a side salad for extra fiber and to make a very satisfying meal.\u000a\u000a9. Taco Bell Fresco Bean Burrito \u2014 For some, this fast-Mexican chain conjures images of late-night taco binges, chalupas, and clever marketing. \u201cMaking a run for the border\u201d doesn\u2019t often come to mind when searching for a wholesome, healthy meal.\u000a\u000aAccording to Taco Bell, it has programs in place to improve the quality of its food ingredients. For example, it is trying to reduce artificial flavors and colors and high-fructose corn syrup in its foods but several items on its menu currently contain these items. If you are looking for a healthier alternative at Taco Bell, try an option from their Fresco menu, with all items containing fewer than 350 calories.\u000a\u000aThe Fresco Bean Burrito is a vegetarian option that has 350 calories, 56 grams of carbohydrates, 13 grams of protein, and 9 grams of fiber but 1,050 milligrams of sodium.\u000a\u000a10. Chick-fil-a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap \u2014 This popular fast-food chain is known for its Southern fried chicken sandwiches, which is not exactly the preferred fare for consumers who are concerned about healthy eating. However, Business Insider points out that the company has made an effort to add a few menu items, such as this light chicken wrap, to cater to this group.\u000a\u000aAccording to Chick-fil-a, the chicken that the company sources is conventionally raised, which means it is not free-range, pastured, or organic. The company\u2019s available information does not specifically mention any initiatives to reduce additives in its prepared foods. However, the Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap does have some favorable nutrition attributes if responsible food sourcing is not your top priority. It totals only 340 calories with a hefty 36 grams of protein, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 15 grams of fiber, and 900 milligrams of sodium. Because the Cool Wrap is relatively low in calories, you might want to add a side for a more substantial meal. Instead of the waffle fries, try the side salad or any of the restaurant\u2019s other healthier sides.\u000a\u000aSpecial: If You Collect Social Security, Please Read This Critical Information . . .\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy , to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

aVA U.S. Democratic senator on Friday questioned the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s quick approval of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods Market Inc. this week, less than three months after the $13.7 billion deal was announced.\u000a\u000aThe FTC said on Wednesday that it had ended its antitrust investigation without seeking a second request for additional information on a deal that has sent shock waves through the grocery industry.\u000a\u000aSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement on Friday that she was concerned about the FTC\u2019s decision to \u201cnot fully review\u201d the deal, which was announced on June 16.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmazon\u2019s increased access to data on consumers and their behavior, and its dominance in internet retail sales, raises questions about whether this merger harms consumers and suppresses competition,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aKlobuchar said she would ask the FTC to explain why it made such a quick decision.\u000a\u000aSeattle-based Amazon declined to comment. The FTC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aAfter getting the approval of the FTC and Whole Foods shareholders this week, Amazon said on Thursday that it planned to complete the acquisition on Monday and simultaneously introduce lower prices on some grocery staples.\u000a\u000aThe world\u2019s biggest online retailer also said it planned to start selling some Whole Foods-branded products on its website and offer incentives to its Prime members at Whole Foods stores.\u000a\u000aShares of major grocery stores fell sharply on Thursday on fears that Amazon\u2019s move would spark a new round of price wars in the industry, but they recovered somewhat on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe approval was one of the first major decisions by the Trump administration\u2019s FTC. The commission has five seats but just two members at present, and Trump has not yet nominated anyone to fill the remaining three positions.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump\u2019s leading choice to run the agency was Washington lawyer Joseph Simons, who was a top FTC official under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aA partner at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Simons would replace acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who has been running the FTC since January.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate still has not approved Makan Delrahim, Trump's choice to head the Justice Department's antitrust division.\u000a\u000aCongressional Democrats in July proposed taking a harder line on mergers and strengthening antitrust laws to give regulators more tools to block such deals or revisit those that were previously approved. "Growing corporate influence and consolidation has led to reductions in competition, choice for consumers, and bargaining power for workers," as well as higher prices, they said.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration is reviewing a number of mergers, including AT&T's Inc. proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc., the owner of HBO, Warner Bros and news network CNN. The Justice Department and AT&T have been discussing potential conditions in recent weeks.

aVThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday approved Celgene Corp and Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc's oral treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a rare genetic mutation.\u000a\u000aThe drug, Idhifa, will have a monthly list price of $24,872, Celgene said in an email, noting that the median time on therapy for patients was 4.3 months in the trial to secure the FDA's approval.\u000a\u000aThe list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Their 'out-of-pocket' cost is based on their individual healthcare insurance plans and duration of treatment.\u000a\u000aAML is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow and progresses rapidly, resulting in an abnormal increase in white blood cells. It is generally diagnosed in older people, and is uncommon before the age of 45.\u000a\u000aThe drug secured approval for relapsed or refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation. It is to be used along with a diagnostic test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, designed to detect the mutation.\u000a\u000a"While the product isn't expected to be a big needle mover for Celgene, it does represent the first approval for a partnered product," J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said, pointing out that the drug targeted "an area of clear high unmet need."\u000a\u000aNovartis AG's recently approved AML drug, Rydapt, has a list price of $7,495 for a 14-day treatment duration and $14,990 for a 28-day duration.\u000a\u000aHowever, Novartis' treatment is approved for newly diagnosed patients with AML carrying a specific genetic mutation called FLT3.\u000a\u000aIdhifa's approval comes with a boxed warning \u2014 the strongest mandated by the FDA \u2014 designed to call attention to the risk of differentiation syndrome, an adverse reaction that could be fatal if untreated.\u000a\u000aDifferentiation syndrome is characterized by fever, respiratory distress and multi-organ dysfunction.\u000a\u000aIdhifa is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with an IDH2 mutation, a group that accounts for 8 to 19 percent of all AML patients. In the United States, that translates to about 1,200 to 1,500 patients, Celgene said.\u000a\u000aOppenheimer's Leah Rush Cann said in a client note that the drug could generate sales of $1.4 billion in 2021.\u000a\u000aAbout 21,380 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in 2017 and some 10,590 patients will succumb to the disease this year, according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.

aVBy not solely condemning Nazis in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, President Donald Trump opened the door for haters to brand him a "sympathizer" to the white supremacist movement, Bill O'Reilly told Newsmax TV Friday.\u000a\u000a"When you're speaking about Nazis, you can't bring in anybody else. It can't be 'Nazis and,'" O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

So that was President Trump's first mistake is that he equated behavior by Nazis in Charlottesville with behavior by the Antifas," said O'Reilly, whose latest book, "Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence," comes out Sept. 19.\u000a\u000aO'Reilly wrote earlier in the week that it's Trump's \u2014 and the country's \u2014 ignorance about Nazi history that led to the gaffe.\u000a\u000a"The historical context of the Charlottesville reaction is that mass murder was carried out by ordinary Germans while the vast majority of that population looked away out of self-interest and fear. President Trump did not understand that and it has hurt him," O'Reilly wrote then.\u000a\u000aDenounce Nazis first, then go after far-left extremists, said the former prime-time stalwart and host of "The O'Reilly Factor" on Fox News.\u000a\u000a"Then the day after, say this Antifa movement, they're becoming very, very dangerous to the country and lay out that case but separately," O'Reilly told Newmax TV. "When he didn't do it separately and he brought them both in together, that gave the Trump haters the license to brand him a sympathizer. Disgusting, despicable, it's a lie, but that's what the Trump haters did."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly was then asked about how Trump should handle Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, who came out critically of Trump's reticence to denounce the alt-right in an interview Thursday.\u000a\u000a"I would say, 'I've spoken to Gary, he's a close friend, he's doing a great job and I respect his point of view. And I've learned some lessons in this case and going forward, we're going to do it differently,'" O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aWhether Trump takes that tack isn't as important as recognizing the what the long view is of Democrats and the media.\u000a\u000a"There's only one bottom line on Donald Trump: get him out of office; that's what's happening here," O'Reilly said. "And the media has invested in that, the far left has invested in that, the Democratic Party has invested in that.\u000a\u000a"That's a lot of people trying to get him out of office. So you're not going to get any honesty on this level. So President Trump has got to understand that. He knows his base is still with him but he's got to be very careful going forward and be as magnanimous as possible," O'Reilly said.

aVSponsored Content\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(Washington, D.C.) -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is unveiling a new \u201cLet\u2019s Get America Working\u201d campaign in advance of the 2016 election that will encourage both Democratic and Republican lawmakers to endorse a pro-worker platform.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the center of the platform is the need for this country to invest in infrastructure, which in turn will create good jobs for everyday Americans. Working on transportation, energy and water projects will put thousands to work in construction jobs across the country. It will also improve roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure, which in turn will help business and improve the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Labor Department\u2019s own statistics support the Teamsters\u2019 initiative. The median union worker earns more than $200 a week more than the median non-union worker. That\u2019s an extra $10,000 a year that goes into the pockets of union workers. These jobs also offer health benefits and retirement security.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile unemployment is down, the vast majority of jobs being created pay low wages,\u201d Teamster General President Jim Hoffa said. \u201cWe can stop this trend and create good-paying union jobs if government invests in our nation\u2019s workforce.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInfrastructure presents an opportunity to break the political gridlock. Congress in late July approved a three-month extension for spending on transportation projects that provides a temporary patch until the end of October for the continuing issue of road and rail funding. But it is not a real solution.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 2008, Congress has transferred more than $62 billion from the general fund to keep the Highway Trust Fund afloat, and it has been more than a decade since Congress has passed a highway bill more than two years in duration. Meanwhile, the transportation system continues to crumble and the safety of those who work and travel along the vast network of U.S. roads and rails is being jeopardized. Our nation\u2019s failure to maintain and improve our infrastructure is costing Americans more and more.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere also is a significant need to move forward with a broader agenda that puts U.S. workers first. That means standing up against lousy trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that send American jobs overseas; protecting workers\u2019 rights to form unions and collectively bargain; increasing affordability of college and vocational schools; and ensuring retirement and pension security for working families.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLawmakers need to remember that dollars invested in education, job training and supporting retirement for those who worked hard all their lives helps not only individuals, but our society as a whole. These are promises each generation in this country has made to the next and we can\u2019t forget it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBut if this nation is going to improve the lives of its citizens, Congress needs to advance bipartisan policies that will encourage good job growth. And it must put the current and future generations of workers in a position to succeed in the workforce by giving them the skills they need.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere was a time when all these issues weren\u2019t partisan issues \u2013 they were American values, something everyone could support. But government is broken. Partisan bickering has replaced finding solutions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential for the Teamsters and like-minded allies all over the country to join together and push this message with lawmakers, colleagues, friends and family.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf elected officials from both parties want to rebuild and repair the trust between government and workers, they need to reinvest in people that have and can continue to make this country great. Better pay will lead to more spending and improve workers\u2019 quality of life. That way everyone wins.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s Get America Working! Now is the time to Build, Repair and Maintain America!

aVPresident Donald Trump was privately furious about National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn's public flogging of his reaction to the violent Charlottesville, Virginia protests earlier this month, according to a White House source, and there may now be a rift between the president and Cohn, who he has been considering to chair the Federal Reserve.\u000a\u000aCohn, who is Jewish, earlier this month lambasted Trump's comments blaming the violence on "both sides" in an interview with The Financial Times, drawing Trump's ire, reports The Washington Post.\u000a\u000aTrump is considering replacing current Fed chief Janet Yellen, when her term expires early next year. Yellen, a Democrat has also criticized Trump, without naming him, on Friday in Jackson, Wyoming, saying his call to roll back financial regulations was not a good idea, considering the reforms strengthened the financial system.\u000a\u000aAlan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, said he does not think Cohn is the front-runner to head the Fed anymore, even though Cohn does support Trump's call to roll back banking regulations.\u000a\u000aThere are several other potential replacements for Yellen, should it come to that, notes The Post, including former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; John Taylor, a Stanford University economics professor; and Glenn Hubbard, a former Bush economic adviser and dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.\u000a\u000aIn the Financial Times' interview, Cohn said that "citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK." He also called on the administration to "do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups."\u000a\u000aThe comments marked the first time a member of Trump's inner circle condemned his actions, but it may not have been the first time Cohn has spoken out against the president publicly.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, while having dinner with friends at a Long Island restaurants, Cohn complained, in a voice loud enough to be heard by other diners, that he had to be careful about giving Trump advance notice about his ideas, a source familiar with the dinner told The Post\u000a\u000aThe former Goldman-Sachs banker said if he gives Trump too much lead time, the president could hinder planning by disclosing information too soon.\u000a\u000aWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, while commenting about the Financial Times article, said that Cohn has not held back how he feels about the Charlottesville situation.\u000a\u000a"He\u2019s been very open and honest, so I don\u2019t think anyone was surprised by the comments,\u201d Sanders said.\u000a\u000aCohn has also often blocked proposals being made by former chief strategist Stephen Bannon and others who have aligned with Trump's nationalist leanings, instead choosing to ally with Trump's daughter, Ivanka and her husband, senior advisor Jared Kushner.\u000a\u000aTrump allies hoping to undermine Cohn were happy about his interview, hoping that it would widen a rift between the president and his key economic adviser.\u000a\u000aHowever, Trump is planning to begin his push in earnest next week for tax code reform, and Cohn and his team are central in designing the administration's strategy and a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, notes The Post.\u000a\u000aCohn, who was with Trump on stage during his Charlottesville remarks, told friends in New York and the White House that he was not going to remain quiet about the comments. He also drafted a resignation letter, but neither signed it or discussed it with the president, a source said\u000a\u000aHowever, Cohn told The Financial Times that he is "reluctant" to resign as he wants to fulfill his duties to the United States.\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also Jewish, has resisted calls to resign over Charlottesville, and commented at Friday's White House press briefing that he would not resign, and that Cohn is also "committed to be here."

It said officers saw the weapon in the man's car when he drove up to a police vehicle near Queen Elizabeth II's London residence, one of London's top tourist attractions.\u000a\u000aHe was held on suspicion of assaulting police and has since been arrested under the Terrorism Act.\u000a\u000aThe suspect was taken to the hospital for minor injuries. No one besides him and the police officers was injured.\u000a\u000aBritish media reported that no members of the royal family were in Buckingham Palace at the time.\u000a\u000aBuckingham Palace did not comment and directed all questions to London police. It said tours of the parts of the palace that are open to the public in summer were unaffected Saturday.\u000a\u000aWitness Kiana Williamson said she saw officers trying to wrestle a man out of a car that had stopped near the palace. In less than a minute, "the man had been restrained and looked almost unconscious by the side of the road," Williamson said.\u000a\u000aLast year, a man convicted of murder climbed a palace wall and was detained on the grounds while the queen was at home.

aVThe United States military has become embroiled in a showdown over funding for President Donald Trump's border wall, CNN reports.\u000a\u000aEarlier this week, Trump threatened Democrats with a government shutdown if they didn't agree to include funds for the wall he proposed along the U.S.-Mexico border in the spending bill that must be passed by the end of next month.\u000a\u000aFor the military, "the future is as murky as it has ever been," Fred Bartels, Heritage Foundation defense analyst, told CNN on Friday. "When [Congress] went into recess, basically no one knew where to go, and I don't think anything has changed during August."\u000a\u000aAlthough the Trump administration called for $603 billion for national security funding, and House Republicans would authorize $622 billion in their budget plan, a spending cap law passed in 2011 restricts national security funding to $549 billion. In previous years, bipartisan, short-term deals could be reached to raise the caps temporarily, but that approach may not work this time.\u000a\u000a"At this point the range of uncertainty is really high," Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International studies told the network. "The lowest it could possibly be is the budget caps. That's the default if all else fails. I've not heard anything on what a broader budget deal looks like. It remains a mystery."\u000a\u000aEven a continuing resolution, which usually acts as a stopgap to avoid a shutdown, would cause problems for the military. It wouldn't allow for new programs to fight cyberattacks, enemy drones or other forms of high-tech warfare.\u000a\u000a"It just creates unpredictability. It makes us rigid," Defense Secretary James Mattis told Congress earlier this month, according to CNN. "We cannot deal with new and revealing threats. We know our enemies are not standing still. ... So, it's about as unwise as can be."

He has been a longtime supporter of Trump.\u000a\u000a"It's important to know all the facts of all the cases," Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor emeritus, told Hayworth. "The fact that it was done in the run-up to reelection makes it sound very political. The fact that they concocted it as a nonjury trial makes it sound political.\u000a\u000a"But I'd need to know more about the facts and more about whether he really defied a court order in order to conclude whether this falls into the category that I've been writing about, namely the criminalization of political differences."

aVA power outage for a few hours may be a minor inconvenience, but the situation gets a little scary when the lights go out for days or even weeks on end. But natural disasters have kept people without power for such long periods, and they\u2019ve managed to prevail.\u000a\u000aSome people worry about foreign or terrorist acts that could keep entire areas of the country off the power grid. State and local governments have emergency preparedness plans to help communities, but sometimes people are left on their own.\u000a\u000aThe Emergency Radio Every Family Must Have \u2014 Special FREE Offer\u000a\u000aThese seven ways to live if the lights go out can help you deal with an uncomfortable situation that lasts longer than usual:\u000a\u000a1. Don\u2019t panic \u2014 If the lights go out for a long period of time, remember that people not too long ago lived just fine without electrical power. Many people continue to do so for fun when camping or hiking. Friends and family in the same situation can help each other get through it.\u000a\u000a2. Protect food sources \u2014 Staying fed is essential, especially if the darkness lingers on. Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible the day the power goes off, advises the American Red Cross. Use food from the refrigerator first, then from the freezer, which can keep foods for up to 48 hours. Afterwards, use non-perishable foods. Store food in a cooler with ice when it appears the power outage will last more than a day.\u000a\u000a3. Use candles carefully \u2014 Candles cause hundreds of fires a year when left unattended, according to Uxari. Keep lit candles away from flammable materials such as upholstered furniture and curtains.\u000a\u000a4. Stay safe inside \u2014 Avoid travel and wasting gas as much as possible, especially with the danger of no traffic lights and anxious drivers. Do not use outdoor grills, generators, or other devices that use gas, propane, and charcoal burning inside. They can release life-threatening carbon monoxide. Keep the devices outside, away from doors, windows, and vents that might bring carbon monoxide inside.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Terror Chatter High, Get Your FREE Emergency Radio Now\u000a\u000a5. Have alternative power sources \u2014 Battery-operated gadgets keep you in contact with the rest of the world. Prepare to use battery packs and plenty of AA and AAA batteries for radios, flashlights, and other necessities. A car battery can be a good source of power. A cigarette-lighter adapter can also charge up various gadgets, writes Eric Limer at Gizmodo.\u000a\u000a6. Keep hydrated \u2014 A gallon of drinking water is needed for each person each day. Fill up the tub or buckets when it appears the power may be off for a long time, affecting the water supply. Collect rain water if possible. Water is also needed for cleaning dishes and washing.\u000a\u000a7. Remain active \u2014 Exercise is important for body and mind. Turn to board games and cards to occupy the time with family and friends. Communicate with your neighbors. Cooking with outside grills connects neighbors with each other. Maintaining a strong relationship with neighbors at this time comes in handy to share thoughts and ideas on survival methods if the lights stay out for a very long time.\u000a\u000aClick Here: Free Emergency Radio Is Yours, Get It Before It's Too Late!

aVAre new medicines for people with out-of-control cholesterol wildly overpriced? It's a question that's sparking debate among consumers and providers of care.\u000a\u000aNow, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) report that the price of these drugs -- called PCSK9 inhibitors -- would have to be slashed by a whopping 71 percent to be deemed cost-effective.\u000a\u000aPCSK9 inhibitors are a relatively new class of medicines for treating patients whose LDL (bad) cholesterol isn't well-controlled on statins or who cannot tolerate statins. Lipitor (atorvastatin) and Crestor (rosuvastatin) are examples of first-line statins doctors typically prescribe to patients with high cholesterol.\u000a\u000aThe UCSF team didn't question whether these new medicines are effective in reducing heart attacks and strokes.\u000a\u000a"These are super awesome drugs, they really work," said study co-author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo.\u000a\u000aBut the price is "far in excess" of what would be considered a reasonable cost for the clinical benefit they provide, added Bibbins-Domingo, a UCSF professor of medicine, epidemiology and biostatistics.\u000a\u000aThe list price of these newer PCSK9 drugs is upwards of $14,000 a year per patient.\u000a\u000aDr. Kim Allan Williams, who was not involved in the study, is past president of the American College of Cardiology. He said some doctors have a difficult time with such studies because they compare patients' lives and "events" -- such as heart attack and stroke -- versus dollars spent on these medicines.\u000a\u000aThe new study doesn't change his view of the value of the PCSK9 inhibitor class.\u000a\u000a"No one's giving those drugs unless the patient is incapable of getting to the target [level of LDL cholesterol]," said Williams, who is chief of cardiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. "You're only going to use it for a situation where you have no choice."\u000a\u000aBecause the study is based on list prices, not what patients actually pay, it's also "difficult to analyze the cost-effectiveness when [you] don't know exactly what the cost is," Williams added.\u000a\u000aHe said he's had patients with copays of $380 a month and others who had zero copays because the cost was completely covered by insurance. He worries, though, that poor patients may not be offered the same access to these medicines.\u000a\u000aThe CSF researchers designed the study to find out how much bang for the buck these drugs actually provide.\u000a\u000aTheir study updates a prior cost-effectiveness analysis using current list prices as well as results of a recent clinical trial. That trial demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of Repatha (evolocumab), one of two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\u000a\u000aBased on a simulation involving 8.9 million adults who would meet trial criteria, adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins would prevent 2.9 million more heart attacks and strokes compared with adding Zetia (ezetimibe), another type of medication that blocks the production of cholesterol by the liver.\u000a\u000aBut the PCSK9 inhibitor class is not cost-effective based on a threshold of $100,000 for each life year gained, the study authors contend. They found that you would have to spend $450,000 per year to get one extra year of life per year.\u000a\u000a"The price would have to be between $4,000 and $5,000 [per year] for it to be cost-effective," said Bibbins-Domingo. "If you look in other countries, in Europe, for example, that is in fact where this drug is priced."\u000a\u000aDr. Josh Ofman, senior vice president of global value, access and policy at Amgen Inc., the maker of Repatha, took issue with the findings. "We think that their model is deeply flawed," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study was based a 3 percent per-year rate of heart attacks and strokes, while other studies use much higher rates -- more than three times higher -- based on "real-world" data, Ofman said. The study is modeling a population that's not having many heart attacks and strokes, he said.\u000a\u000aOfman also questioned the threshold for determining cost-effectiveness that the UCSF researchers used. He said other organizations use a minimum of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.\u000a\u000aAs for the price differential between the United States and Europe, Ofman cited many factors, from government price controls to how those countries price these drugs.\u000a\u000aAmgen isn't alone in its criticism of how these medicines are valued. Earlier this month, several national provider and payer groups raised concerns about how the PCSK9 inhibitors are valued in a letter to the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses the value of new medicines.\u000a\u000aMore than a dozen organizations, including the National Forum for Heart Disease & Stroke Prevention, the American Pharmacists Association Foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, signed the letter citing concerns ranging from the types of patients that could benefit from these drugs to the importance of preventing heart attacks and strokes -- not just deaths.\u000a\u000a"The big controversy about all these types of analyses is what we're willing to value a patient's year of life at," Ofman said.\u000a\u000aThe new study was published in the Aug. 22/29 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

aVOne thing is for sure, America and its citizens are vulnerable at all times to natural disasters. Whether it's hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, floods, fires, or volcano\u2019s, it's not a question of if, it's always a question of when and where disaster strikes.\u000a\u000aWith computer modeling we can even predict where such events are likely to occur. Thus, we know which areas of the country are more likely than not to be affected by natural disasters.\u000a\u000aSo, it makes perfect sense to focus on areas of the country that are vulnerable, while empowering local authorities to take the lead in preparation and management; with the help and assistance of state and federal governments.\u000a\u000aI suggest every American be issued an emergency response identification card. Such a card would identify the person by their address and it would additionally contain life saving information, like blood type, next of kin, and other germane details.\u000a\u000aWhile everyone would be required to provide basic information, a citizen could augment it with information they would want shared. The card would also contain information on where to report in the event of an evacuation, or to get supplies. Such identification would also contain phone numbers and websites to get public instructions and updates.\u000a\u000aIn areas government deems as "high risk" for natural disasters, local communities well in advance of any event, would have stock-piled supplies of bottled water, military style meals ready to eat, cots, blankets, and medical supplies prepositioned in public buildings. That is, structures like schools, armories, municipal buildings, churches, fire houses, theaters, etc.\u000a\u000aEvery citizen in affected areas would know in advance where they are to report locally to get supplies, or to seek shelter. The supplies amassed and housed would be a three day supply for every person in every designated shelter or supply center. It has been said that the first 3 days in the aftermath of a disaster are the most critical in both assessing and responding to natural disasters.\u000a\u000aIt will be the responsibility of local officials to let citizens know through official communications in advance of disasters what every home must contain in preparation. If people are not able to afford supplies then they can petition the local authorities for such supplies like flashlights, candles, radios, etc. \u2014 free of charge.\u000a\u000aBy stockpiling supplies locally, the government is assured that supplies are nearby. This way they know too where they are; so do the people affected. The ID cards will also make it easier for local governments to account for the people they are charged to protect.\u000a\u000aThe initial costs for localizing supplies and creating storage areas will be amortized over the shelf-life of the supplies themselves. Shelf-life today can be as much as 10 years for bottled water and meals ready to eat. In addition, towards the end of the shelf-life of supplies, they can be given away to the needy. This way nothing goes to waste.\u000a\u000aGovernments closest to the people know their populations the best. Thus, they are positioned the best to provide superior preparations and responses to natural disasters \u2014 to their constituents with the help of state and federal authorities. Time is the most precious commodity in disaster relief and the time it takes to amass and move supplies over great distances hampers responses to those in need.\u000a\u000aThe most important role of government is to prevent harm not merely respond to it afterwards.\u000a\u000aIt makes perfect sense for governments to rethink emergency management. This is this a great place to start, by empowering and supplying local governments.\u000a\u000aBradley Blakeman was a member of President George W. Bush's senior White House staff from 2001 to 2004.

aVScientists are conducting a study that would use human stem cells to repopulate insulin-producing cells destroyed by Type 1 diabetes. The cells would be grown in the lab and transplanted to diabetes patients. The process looks very promising, and the transplanted cells would begin producing insulin immediately \u2014 and could revolutionize diabetes treatment.\u000a\u000aMicroscopic groups of cells, called islets, are responsible for producing insulin in the pancreas. But Type 1 diabetes tricks the immune system into killing these cells, causing a lifelong dependency on insulin shots. Without insulin, cells could not obtain energy from sugars (glucose) and would starve \u2014 leading to loss of vision, heart conditions, and even death.\u000a\u000aA lifelong dependency on shots, that is, unless islets could be restored in the pancreas. Enter researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering who are investigating the use of stem cells to engineer pancreatic islets in the lab. Step 1: meeting the oxygen demands of the pancreatic cells. Since these islets have a very high oxygen demand, researchers began looking for new techniques to speed up the oxygen possibilities after tests began to show this would ultimately improve cell life and transplantation outcome.\u000a\u000aIpsita Banerjee, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and lead investigator of the study, said, "Through collaborative efforts, we have developed a method of implanting blood vessel fragments into the islets. By vascularizing the islets before they are transplanted to the body, they are more likely to survive and can begin regulating blood glucose more quickly."\u000a\u000aBlood vessels carry out the oxygenation process for the cells, and once researchers overcame this huge obstacle, they set their sights on converting stem cells into Type 1 diabetes-resistant supercells. The process in underway, and Banerjee and colleagues hope to have a working process in the near future.

Try a \u201cflighted shot\u201d \u2013 When a round isn\u2019t going well, Day describes to Golf Digest a technique that can rescue it. The shot involves using a grip that is down about a half-inch from the handle and shifting your weight slightly to the left. Next, pivot your body away from your target on the backswing, and don\u2019t let your arms continue to swing after you\u2019ve pivoted. Finally, make solid contact with the ball and swing at about 80 percent of your usual speed.\u000a\u000a3. Practice your weight shift \u2013 John Stahlschmidt analyzed Day\u2019s technique and told Golf Tips that power hitters often have their belt buckle literally pointing to their target at the moment of impact.

aVThe Trump administration is exploring new approaches for easing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that build on talks with a budding Sunni Arab coalition of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJared Kushner, the White House senior adviser and presidential son-in-law, visited the leaders of all four countries during his Middle East trip this week. He was accompanied by special envoy Jason Greenblatt and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell. The group came away hopeful that the new generation of Arab leaders is a potential "game-changer," said a senior administration official.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPrince Khaled bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, gave an upbeat account of the talks with Kushner. He said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his older brother, "is optimistic in light of the commitment of Donald Trump to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians." He said this week's visit "cemented Saudi and other Arab officials' respect" for Kushner and his team, who organized Trump's visit to the kingdom in May.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA first step in the new Palestinian strategy involves Gaza, which under Hamas has been Israel's most implacable adversary. The moderate Sunni coalition has tried to pull Hamas closer to Egypt and the UAE, and increase Hamas' distance from Qatar, which for years has been a major financial backer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe goal is to broker a reunification of Gaza with the Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas, so that a united PA could represent all Palestinians. This would be a key step toward resuming broader negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration seems to envision an "outside-in" strategy for breaking the Palestinian-Israeli stalemate. The U.S., it's hoped, could eventually bring together Israelis and leaders of the major Arab states for a peace conference. Trump's unusually close relations with both Israel and the Gulf Arabs are part of this strategy.\u000a\u000aThe Gaza opening by the moderate Arabs is an unlikely offshoot of their bitter feud with Qatar, Turkey and other nations that support the Muslim Brotherhood militants who have long dominated Hamas.\u000a\u000aMohammed Dahlan, a Gazan Palestinian now living in the UAE, has been the key intermediary. He has traveled to Gaza and organized UAE-financed humanitarian assistance there, working in collaboration with Yahya al-Sinwar, the head of Hamas inside Gaza. The plan is to provide economic and social support, through Egypt and with Israel's blessing, that can weaken the hard-liners' control.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"We both realized it's time to find a way out" in Gaza, Dahlan told The Associated Press last month after meeting with Sinwar, who was a childhood friend.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDahlan's aid to Gaza is said to include about $15 million a month in food and social assistance for families, plus an unspecified additional amount for electricity and water, an Arab official told me. Israel has allowed fuel and other shipments to pass from Egypt through the border crossing at Rafah, signaling tacit support.\u000a\u000aDahlan and his Emirati backers have bigger plans. He told the AP that the UAE has pledged to finance a $100 million electricity plant, to be built on the Egyptian side of the border, to help power Gaza. Although Dahlan is a long-time rival of Abbas, U.S. officials insist they don't want to undermine the PA leader.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBeyond the machinations in Gaza is a larger vision for restarting a Palestinian peace process drawing on the alliance of moderate Sunni leaders. Jordan's King Abdullah and Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi already have extensive, friendly relations with Israel. Mohammed bin Zayed, the military leader of the UAE, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed don't have formal ambassadorial contacts with Israel. But they share a common enemy in Iran.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMBS, as the Saudi crown prince is known, has made some brash moves that have caused him trouble, including the war in Yemen. But he's willing to take risks on the reform side, too, including challenging the kingdom's religious establishment. Prince Khaled, the Saudi ambassador, said that MBS believes resolution of the Palestinian problem and peace with Israel "is crucial for the future of the Middle East."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a"This young, dynamic leadership presents opportunities that may not have existed before," argues Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to Washington. The White House clearly shares that view.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, 50 years of peacemaking history sadly warns us that a new initiative probably won't work. And Trump's domestic problems weaken his ability to deliver on Kushner's advance work. But it must be said: The opportunities for trade, investment and security cooperation between Israel and the Arabs have never been greater.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDavid Ignatius writes a foreign affairs column.

aVDonald Trump started as the most unpopular new president in the history of modern polling. After seven months, things have only gotten worse.\u000a\u000aPlunging into undesirably uncharted territory, Trump is setting records with his dismally low approval ratings, including the lowest mark ever for a president in his first year. In fact, with four months left in the year, Trump has already spent more time under 40 percent than any other first-year president.\u000a\u000aAt 34 percent, his current approval rating is worse than former President Barack Obama's ever was.\u000a\u000aTrump's early descent in the polls defies some longstanding patterns about how Americans view their president. Such plunges are often tied to external forces that the president only partially controls, such as a sluggish economy or an all-consuming international crisis. In Trump's case, the economy is humming and the foreign crises have been kept to a minimum.\u000a\u000aAmericans also tend to be optimistic about their new leaders, typically cutting them some slack during their early days in office. Not with Trump.\u000a\u000a"Most presidents begin with a honeymoon period and then go down from that, and Trump had no honeymoon," said Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport.\u000a\u000aIt's a jarring juxtaposition for the reality TV star-turned-president who spent months on the campaign trail obsessing about his poll numbers and reading them to massive rally crowds while vowing that he'd win so much as president that Americans would get sick of it. Since he took office, the poll number recitations have stopped.\u000a\u000aTrump is now viewed positively by only 37 percent of Americans, according to Gallup's most recent weekly estimate. (Obama's lowest weekly average never fell below 40 percent.) It's even lower \u2014 just 34 percent \u2014 in Gallup's shorter, three-day average, which includes more recent interviews but can also involve more random variation.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, approval ratings can fluctuate \u2014 sometimes dramatically. Some presidents have seen their positive reviews dip below 40 percent, only to recover strongly. Bill Clinton, whose rating fell to 37 percent in early June 1993 after policy stumbles, quickly gained ground. Later that same month, he climbed to 46 percent, and ended his eight years enjoying approval from 66 percent of the nation.\u000a\u000aTrump has defied the trends before. But if history is a guide, his numbers don't bode well. Low approval ratings hamper a president's ability to push an agenda through Congress and make it more likely the president's party will lose seats in Congress in the midterm elections.\u000a\u000aScott de Marchi, who teaches political science at Duke University, says his research suggests approval ratings tend to affect whether a president can persuade Congress to do his or her bidding. That's primarily true with complex issues like tax reform, where Americans care about the outcome but may not have strongly formed opinions. In those cases, Americans are more likely to support whatever plan the president proposes if they broadly approve of the president himself.\u000a\u000a"The problem with Trump is that on any area like the budget or tax policy or even health care, people need to be led to a position to support," de Marchi said.\u000a\u000aSince Gallup began tracking presidential approval, four presidents \u2014 Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush \u2014 spent significant time below 40 percent during their first four years. Clinton's and Ronald Reagan's forays below the 40 percent mark also came during their first terms. But neither stayed there long.\u000a\u000aOf those who spent at least a few months below 40 percent approval in a first term, only one \u2014 Truman \u2014 recovered enough to win re-election.\u000a\u000aStill, several others reached lows at some point in their presidency that are worse than Trump's, including several who dropped below 30 percent.\u000a\u000aTruman hit 22 percent in February 1952, during a drawn-out Korean War stalemate and accusations of corruption in his administration. Richard Nixon hit 24 percent at the height of the Watergate scandal just before his resignation in 1974. Carter bottomed out at 28 percent in the summer of 1979, amid that year's oil crisis.\u000a\u000aTrump's average approval rating so far: Just 40 percent. That's even lower than the previous average low for a first-term president, 46 percent, set by Carter.\u000a\u000aNewport, the Gallup chief, said Trump's struggles are unusual in that such abysmal numbers can usually be tied to a single, specific issue bedeviling the country. With Trump, Newport said, "it's a more general kind of issue with the man himself and a more general dissatisfaction with the way things are going in the country."\u000a\u000aIn July, Gallup posed another question to Trump's disapprovers: Why? Nearly two-thirds cited his personality or character, while less than a third cited issues, policies or job performance.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, when Gallup asked the same question about Obama in 2009 and George W. Bush in 2001, less than 2 in 10 disapprovers cited similar concerns about personal characteristics.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of Republicans support Trump while the vast majority of Democrats oppose him. Such political polarization might be both a blessing and a curse for Trump, preventing him from achieving higher ratings but also keeping him from falling even further.\u000a\u000a"When Trump has done things that have generated an enormous amount of attention and people have anticipated his rating could go down, it has not," Newport said. "And that's because he's being propped up by Republicans."\u000a\u000aIt's unclear whether Trump's most recent bout with controversy \u2014 his response to racially tinged clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 further harmed his approval ratings. It could be he's close enough to bottoming out that the latest dust-up will have little effect.\u000a\u000aIn a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted Aug. 16-20, just 28 percent said they approve of Trump's response to Charlottesville. But 37 percent said they approved of the job Trump is doing overall \u2014 almost the exact same percentage that approved in the same poll a month earlier.\u000a\u000aYet if the famously image-conscious Trump aspires to undo some of the damage, there's reason to hope.\u000a\u000a"The history of presidential job approval ratings shows an enormous amount of fluctuation," Newport said. "There's no historical reason why his ratings couldn't go up."

aVYou\u2019d think investors would see it coming: debt tied to weather risk can be volatile in the Atlantic hurricane season.\u000a\u000aCatastrophe bonds, used by investors to bet against natural disasters, tend to drop substantially as storms approach populated areas.\u000a\u000aWhile they can recover just as quickly, as they did last year when Hurricane Matthew did less damage than feared, seasonal analysis of the past decade shows they have dropped almost every November and December -- the tail end of the season.\u000a\u000aAs Hurricane Harvey heads toward landfall in Texas, it\u2019s strengthening, and is forecast to become the worst storm to strike the region in more than a decade. Natural disasters that cause enough damage can cost cat bond investors some of their principal, as was the case after Hurricane Katrina in the U.S. in 2005 and an earthquake in Japan six years later.\u000a\u000aInvestors in the securities get above-market yields in exchange for shouldering the risk of natural disasters. Cat bonds are typically issued by insurers or government agencies that want to spread their risks to the capital markets.

aVSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster took steps Friday to defund abortion providers in his state by signing an order that cuts off funding to healthcare providers that have partnerships with clinics that provide abortions.\u000a\u000aThe Post and Courier reports that McMaster's executive order also opened the possibility of cutting off the flow of Medicaid funds to abortion clinics.\u000a\u000a"There are a variety of agencies, clinics, and medical entities in South Carolina that receive taxpayer funding to offer important women's health and family planning services without performing abortions," McMaster said. "Taxpayer dollars must not directly or indirectly subsidize abortion providers like Planned Parenthood."\u000a\u000aAccording to the Post and Courier, just three clinics in South Carolina offer elective abortions, a list that includes one Planned Parenthood location in the state capital of Columbia.\u000a\u000aRepublicans in Washington and across the nation have targeted Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers in recent years. There was a push for the federal government to cut off funding to the healthcare organization, but that never materialized as anything more than a threat.\u000a\u000aTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, signed two abortion-related bills last week: one that forces women who want abortion coverage in their health insurance plans to pay a separate premium and another that requires healthcare providers to report to the state about abortion complications.

aVPatty Jenkins responded to James Cameron in a strongly-worded tweet Thursday, taking the award-winning "Avatar" director to task for slamming "Wonder Woman," which she directed.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with The Guardian this week, the Academy Award-winning director slammed "Wonder Woman," one of the top-grossing films of the year, calling it a "step backwards" for superhero movies, comparing the role with his Sarah Connor character in his "Terminator" movie franchise.\u000a\u000a"All of the self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over 'Wonder Woman' has been so misguided," Cameron told The Guardian. "She's an objectified icon, and it's just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but, to me, it's a step backwards."\u000a\u000a"Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, (the benefit of characters like Sarah) is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female," Cameron continued.\u000a\u000aJenkins, whose "Wonder Woman" has raked in $404.4 million domestically and another $396.1 million overseas, according to Box Office Mojo.com, clapped back with a tweet Thursday night, saying that women have the right to choose their own icons.\u000a\u000apic.twitter.com/8zkJXHLCJW \u2014 Patty Jenkins (@PattyJenks) August 25, 2017\u000a\u000aJenkins directed the 2003 movie "Monster" that won Charlize Theron the Oscar for best actress in her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos.\u000a\u000aFans registered their complaints to Cameron's words on social media.\u000a\u000aJames Cameron, who turned the story of the Titanic into a chance to get Kate Winslet nude, complains about #WonderWoman being a step back? pic.twitter.com/47jyCPR0hI \u2014 Duane Maddy (@GraphicArtMaddy) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aJames Cameron: Wonder Woman is a step backwards.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a... dude, you're making 4 Avatar sequels no one wants. https://t.co/OsDDTAbw9b pic.twitter.com/oxJjr8oISg \u2014 Kenny Williams (@Ohheykenny) August 24, 2017\u000a\u000aJames Cameron just called "Wonder Woman" sexist and positioned himself as the moral voice for feminism in Hollywood. #NotTheOnion \u2014 Charles Clymer\U0001f3f3\ufe0f\u200d\U0001f308 (@cmclymer) August 24, 2017

The kit should include food, water, and other supplies that will last at least 72 hours in the aftermath of a tornado, according to Ready.gov , the official website for the Department of Homeland Security.Keep a radio or NOAA weather radio handy to listen to the latest weather information. If a tornado may be approaching, follow the instructions from emergency management personnel.Know the difference between a tornado watch, which means tornadoes are possible or nearby, and a tornado warning, which means a tornado has been sighted or found through weather radar.Knowing changing weather conditions helps to warn of a possible tornado. These signs include a dark or greenish sky or a large, dark, low-lying cloud. A load roar that sounds like a freight train often indicates a tornado. Large hail also may be a danger sign of a tornado.Become familiar with your community\u2019s warning system. Although tornadoes may occur more often in certain areas of the country, all 50 states are affected by the storms and may have different warning signals or sirens to alert citizens.Develop a family emergency plan. With a tornado, it\u2019s a good idea to choose a safe room where all family members and pets can stay until the tornado is over. Safe spaces to prepare for a tornado might include the basement or a room that has no windows and is on the lowest floor. The American Red Cross suggests having periodic drills in case of a tornado or other disaster.Maintain a secure safe room with better protection or reinforcement.Keep the yard clean of debris, lawn furniture, hanging plants, or tree limbs in preparation for a tornado since these things can easily be tossed around and cause damage.

aVInvestors have been piling into currency-hedged equity tracker funds, seeking protection against big moves in foreign exchange rates.\u000a\u000aTypically foreign investors buy un-hedged equities since share prices are usually negatively correlated to currencies. In fact, they offer a partial hedge against sharp moves in foreign exchange.\u000a\u000aBut with most equity markets near record highs and major currencies notching up double-digit gains or losses this year, investors are taking no chances.\u000a\u000aExchange-traded funds trade like stocks but track a wider range of securities more cheaply than buying the underlying assets. With a currency-hedged ETF, an investor pays an additional cost for hedging the foreign exchange risk, often using currency forwards or options.\u000a\u000a"ETFs are becoming a tool also to manage currency," said Simone Rosti, European head of passive and exchange-traded fund sales at UBS.\u000a\u000aInvestors poured some $17 billion into currency-hedged equity ETFs globally to the end of July, a sharp turnaround from the $9.1 billion of outflows seen in the same period last year.\u000a\u000aCurrency-hedged ETFs are relative newcomers and still just a drop in the ocean. They make up just $127 billion of the $3.3 trillion assets under management in equity ETFs as a whole, according to industry research group ETFGI.\u000a\u000aBut their growing importance underlines the impact currency moves can have on portfolio returns.\u000a\u000a"The performance of an equity market relative to the global benchmark can be dominated by movements in the country's currency," said Mark Richards of JPMorgan Asset Management.\u000a\u000aA U.S. investor holding an MSCI Europe tracker, for example, has enjoyed returns of 15.5 percent year-to-date in dollars, while the index has gained just 3.2 percent in euro terms.\u000a\u000aFX HEDGES\u000a\u000aETF providers say flows into hedged products often increase just after a big swing in a currency or when market positioning shows a preponderance of investors betting a currency will move in one direction.\u000a\u000aFor example, the euro has gained more than 12 percent so far this year and is the best performing G10 currency.\u000a\u000aFlows into currency-hedged ETFs tracking European equities in 2017 have far outpaced last year as brokers and investors have warned in recent weeks that the euro\u2019s rise could start to threaten the bright outlook for profits of European companies.\u000a\u000aIn the first seven months of this year investors poured $1.3 billion into these products, compared with $9.2 billion of outflows in the same period last year.\u000a\u000a"We've started to see many clients moving to euro-hedged products. We see this trend continuing in the next few months," said UBS\u2019s Rosti.\u000a\u000aETFs hedged to the single currency saw a dramatic increase in inflows in April as concerns around the French election faded. They drew in $638 million that month after managing just $6 million in March.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, since the pound's dramatic slide on the day after Britain's Brexit vote in June 2016, the benchmark UK stock index has hit record highs as the British-based companies with large global footprints benefited from favorable currency translation boosting earnings.\u000a\u000aSterling fell to its lowest against the euro in eight years this week, barring a brief flash crash in October 2016 and analysts say investors are reaching for hedged ETFs to protect against a possible rebound in the pound.\u000a\u000aDeutsche Asset Management ETF strategist Eric Wiegand said ETFs hedged against sterling are their best-selling product so far this year.\u000a\u000aTURNING FORTUNES\u000a\u000aWhile the cost of hedging foreign equity exposure can be substantial even for relatively low-cost ETFs, amounting to anything between 1 to 2 percent, investors say these products can offer valuable savings especially when markets lean towards consensus views.\u000a\u000aFor example, at the end of last year, expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal plans would fuel a strong dollar and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates multiple times were very popular.\u000a\u000aBut those expectations have been squashed in recent months and bets the greenback will weaken have multiplied.\u000a\u000aInflows into currency-hedged ETFs exposed to the United States also ballooned this year, drawing in $5.9 billion so far \u2013 already ahead of the $5.3 billion net inflows for the full year 2016.\u000a\u000a"Is this really the time, now that the dollar has moved, that you want to go unhedged? I'd really question that," Schwartz said.\u000a\u000aDOUBLE HEDGING\u000a\u000aBut some remain skeptical about the need for ETFs to hedge currency exposure when large multinational companies run sophisticated treasury operations that use a variety of instruments to protect themselves against currency swings.\u000a\u000a"Buying a hedged ETF hedges the currency exposure of companies that are already hedging," wrote Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at INTL FCStone, a brokerage, in a note to clients.\u000a\u000a"Double-hedging achieves nothing other than generate extra fees and commissions."\u000a\u000aThough a hedge can drive outperformance during a currency shock, in the medium to long-term the performance differential between hedged and unhedged ETFs tracking the same index diminishes.\u000a\u000aThen there are other asset classes such as fixed income where investors see more value of an FX-hedged ETF to cushion the blows from a volatile currency on tiny but steady returns from coupon payments on bonds.\u000a\u000a"Right now, if we look at our asset split, the proportion of flows into currency-hedged ETFs is larger in the fixed income space," said Deutsche's Wiegand.\u000a\u000aSome 37 percent of Deutsche Asset Management's year-to-date net inflows in fixed income ETFs went into hedged products, while just 21 percent of their equity inflows were hedged.

They can make up the rules for their workplace, but also must be responsible for benefits other workers are offered by their companies, including their retirement plans. TheSelfEmployed.com noted that Social Security pays about $1,153 per month on average so a healthy nest egg will be needed to cover extra expenses. That is where a strong retirement plan comes in.Here are the four top retirement plans for those who are self-employed, according to Forbes. They include a SEP-IRA, a simple IRA, a solo 401(k), and Keogh plans.Forbes recommended a SEP-IRA as its top choice for self-employed people. SEP stands for simplified employee pension. This IRA is a simple way to put money aside, pre-tax, as savings, the magazine noted. Under this IRA, investors can contribute as much as 25 percent of their income \u2014 up to $49,000 annually.A simple IRA is just that \u2014 a simple incentive-match plan for employees at small businesses as well as the self-employed, Forbes reported. A solo 401(k) allows small business owners or those who are independently employed to contribute up to $16,500 annually, Forbes reported.There are two types of Keogh plans \u2014 defined contribution and defined benefit. They are popular for those who are self-employed and earn large incomes, CNN noted . Under a defined benefit plan, you must fund it yourself. Under a defined contribution plan, you have two options \u2014 profit-sharing and money-purchase, CNN said.Someone need not be a full-time business owner to use a retirement plan for the self-employed, according to financial adviser Jonathan Pond "If you moonlight or just work part time, self-employed retirement plans offer great tax benefits," he wrote. "In fact, if you can spare the money, you may be able to put 100 percent of your net profit from self-employment into a plan and deduct it as well."

aVIt wasn\u2019t long ago that food trucks were commonly derided as \u201croach coaches\u201d and mostly offered an unimaginative choice of pre-made sandwiches, chips, and canned soft drinks.\u000a\u000aBut that all changed about a decade ago, sparked by chef Roy Choi taking a Korean/Mexican fusion called Kogi BBQ to the streets of Los Angeles. Now food trucks are all the rage with an astounding variety of cuisines. And seeing how they often source produce locally and cook meals to order, they can actually be healthy eating if you choose the right stuff.\u000a\u000aOf course, that\u2019s not always easy to do. Like restaurants, food trucks are most successful when they offer lip-smacking grub, which often translates into a lot of salt, sugar, unhealthy fats, and simple carbohydrates. And while a growing number of trucks offer super-healthy fare, like soba noodle salad and Portobello carpaccio, most of us still flock to familiar ethnic cuisines, where it\u2019s easy to run into trouble.\u000a\u000a\u201cOpt for grilled meats and any kind of vegetable that isn\u2019t fried or smothered in sauce,\u201d suggests Kelly Pritchett, National Media Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cMilk or water is generally the best choice for drinks. And when getting a smoothie, make sure they\u2019re made with real fruit and no added sugar.\u201d\u000a\u000aRegistered dietitian Joy Dubost adds: \u201cI have seen more food trucks at breweries, wineries and distilleries. When considering your choice of food, you should consider that the calories from alcoholic beverages can add up quickly.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere are some tips from Pritchett, Dubost, and other experts on what to order, and avoid, when you belly up to a food truck:\u000a\u000aGreek: Nutritionists may rave about the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet, but that doesn\u2019t include some of the most popular items you find at Greek food trucks. Gyros with their fatty meat, gobs of tzatziki sauce, and carb-heavy pita bread are belly busters. So too are spinach pies and fried falafel balls. Better choices are a Greek salad, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, hummus, grape leaves, and chicken souvlaki.\u000a\u000aMexican: Tacos are a good bet. Go with grilled or blackened fish, shrimp or chicken rather than beef, and choose the corn tortilla, which is typically smaller and less processed than the flour version. Stick to one sauce, preferably salsa or guacamole, and skip the cheese. In other dishes, choose black beans over refried, and go easy on the rice. Forget about \u2014 or at least limit \u2014 tortilla chips.\u000a\u000aCaribbean: Heavy on chicken, fish, beans, and tropical fruit, Caribbean food is typically healthy when it\u2019s not fried. So forgo the conch fritters and meat pies. Spicy jerk seasoning is filled with herbs that have been used in traditional medicine, such as garlic, cinnamon, thyme, and Scotch bonnet pepper. Order the chicken or fish as opposed to pork. Try some fresh mango and papaya to satisfy your sweet tooth.\u000a\u000aAsian: Unfortunately, the most popular Asian truck food is also the unhealthiest. Egg rolls, spare ribs, fried rice, and lo mein noodles are all tasty but high in calories and filled with salt, fats and/or empty carbs. Ditto for anything that\u2019s been battered and fried, such as sweet and sour dishes, and General Tso\u2019s chicken. Even stir-fried dishes can be sodium- and calorie-laden. Spring rolls in rice paper, wonton soup, steamed dumplings, satay, and chop suey are better choices.\u000a\u000aIndian: On the healthy side, curry dishes are cooked with turmeric, a super food spice. Tandoori chicken is baked rather than fried. Aloo goobi is cauliflower and potatoes cooked in turmeric, ginger, garlic and other beneficial spices. And chana masala is made with nutritious chickpeas. Avoid fried samosas and pakoras as well as cream-based korma dishes and that delicious but nutritionally bankrupt naan bread.\u000a\u000aItalian: The ever-popular pizza may seem like a bargain, but white flour dough topped with processed meats and cheese is no great deal for your body. If you must, go with a thin crust (whole wheat, if available) topped with veggies. Other good dishes to avoid are Paninis, calzones, lasagna, and anything Alfredo. Truth is, there\u2019s typically not much to choose that isn\u2019t loaded with fat, sodium and simple carbs. The healthiest choices include minestrone soup, bruschetta, and pasta primavera.

aVAn inexpensive over-the-counter antioxidant/zinc supplement that may help preserve vision in older people is also cost effective, a new study suggests.\u000a\u000aThe combo pill has been dubbed the "Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)" supplement, based on trial in which it was studied previously.\u000a\u000aDr. Aaron Lee, a researcher on the new trial, said his team found AREDS was "greatly cost-effective for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, specifically in people who have active wet, age-related macular degeneration in one eye and dry in the other." Lee is assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington in Seattle.\u000a\u000aMacular degeneration is a progressive disease that's a major cause of vision loss in older Americans.\u000a\u000aThe new study suggests the AREDS supplement may delay the need for more expensive treatment of the "wet" form of the illness, especially, Lee said.\u000a\u000aExactly how the supplements work to slow progression of the eye malady isn't known, he added, but "the current formulation of the supplements contain antioxidants that are thought to be protective of the retina from damage that results in wet age-related macular degeneration."\u000a\u000aStill, at least one U.S. eye expert challenged the idea that the AREDS supplement definitively showed a benefit in preventing the disease or its progression.\u000a\u000a"Despite this being routine practice among many retinal specialists in the U.S., the benefits remain uncertain," said Dr. Alfred Sommer, professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.\u000a\u000aAccording to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation (AMDF), age-related macular degeneration causes damage to the macula, a small spot near the center of the retina. It's the part of the eye needed for sharp, central vision. Over time, vision can become blurry, and eventually patients can lose their eyesight.\u000a\u000aThe two basic types of macular degeneration are called wet and dry. About 10 percent to 15 percent of the cases of macular degeneration are the wet type.\u000a\u000aIn wet macular degeneration, blood vessels grow under the retina and macula. These new vessels may bleed and leak fluid, causing the macula to bulge or lift up from its normally flat position, thus distorting or destroying central vision. Vision loss may be rapid and severe.\u000a\u000aApproximately 85 percent to 90 percent of the cases of macular degeneration are the dry type. Dry age-related macular degeneration does not involve any leakage of blood. Instead, the macula may deteriorate and waste products from cells in the eye can build up. Loss of vision can occur, according to the AMDF.\u000a\u000aThe prior AREDS trial showed that the supplements, which combine antioxidant vitamins with zinc and copper, are inexpensive and effective in slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration.\u000a\u000aAREDS supplements are sold under brand names such as PreserVision and Pro-Optic. Costs range from about $25 to $40 for 120 pills -- a two-month supply.\u000a\u000aThat's a much lower price tag than expensive prescription drugs called anti-VEGF therapies, which are currently used to treat wet macular degeneration. Plus, anti-VEGF drug therapy involves getting a needle in the eye, and the drugs can also have side effects. One possible side effect is an increased risk of inflammation of the inside of the eye, and another possibility is stroke, Lee noted.\u000a\u000aSo, to calculate the cost-effectiveness of AREDS supplements, Lee and colleagues looked at the use of the supplements in people over 55 years of age.\u000a\u000aThe AREDS trial had concluded that a daily supplement combining high-dose antioxidants and zinc lowered the risk of developing wet age-related macular degeneration and slowed its progression.\u000a\u000aLee's team looked at two formulas of available supplements.\u000a\u000aFormula 1 has high doses of vitamins C and E, beta carotene, zinc and copper. Formula 2 has lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta carotene.\u000a\u000aThe researchers used a statistical model with information from the AREDS trial, along with data from more than 90,000 people with macular degeneration in the United Kingdom.\u000a\u000aThe investigators found that both formulations were cost effective for treating patients with early stage disease, but they were even more cost effective for those with the condition in only one eye.\u000a\u000aOver the course of a lifetime, the researchers found that these patients would need nearly eight fewer injections of anti-VEGF therapies into their eye, Lee said.\u000a\u000aThat could lead to thousands of dollars in savings per patient over time, the British team concluded.\u000a\u000aBut Sommer, who reviewed the new findings, did have some caveats.\u000a\u000aSommer noted that "it is now, in fact, common practice for ophthalmologists in the U.S. to recommend that their patients who fit this profile take this supplement."\u000a\u000aHe added, "If one believes the supplement does work in the group in which it appeared to, then the whole issue is cost, since no evidence has ever been reported that shows harm."\u000a\u000aBut does ARDS actually work?\u000a\u000aAccording to Sommer, no large-scale study has been done to test that out. And the AREDS trial researchers used to tout these supplements was small, so that any positive results might still be a chance occurrence, he noted.\u000a\u000aSommer's conclusion: "Despite this being routine practice among many retinal specialists in the U.S., the benefits remain uncertain."\u000a\u000aTherefore, "any analysis of the cost for the benefits are somewhat meaningless when viewed from this perspective," he said.\u000a\u000aThe study was published Aug. 23 in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

This further eroded confidence in Trump's ability to enact his reforms.\u000a\u000aA late-September deadline is now looming for U.S. officials to raise the debt ceiling or risk default, leading investors to anticipate a volatile month.\u000a\u000a"Since late June, investors have withdrawn $30 billion from U.S. funds while adding $36 billion to the rest of the world," said BAML's analysts, citing inflows to emerging markets, Europe and Japan.\u000a\u000aWhile the European region\u2019s equity funds posted their first outflow in seven weeks, the $200 million that left is dwarfed by this year\u2019s inflows which now total $32 billion, according to the report.\u000a\u000aJapanese equities attracted $3.1 billion over the week, their biggest inflows in five months, whilst emerging markets pulled in $200 million.\u000a\u000aEmerging market equities continued to top BAML's table of cross-asset winners in 2017, returning 27.1 percent year-to-date in dollar terms. European equities were in third place, delivering 18.7 percent, but suffered their first outflows in seven weeks, losing $200 million.\u000a\u000aOverall, global equities attracted $3.1 billion, whilst bond funds pulled in $5.5 billion, with government bond and Treasury funds enjoying their largest inflows in 10 weeks at $900 million.\u000a\u000aInvestment grade corporate bonds continued to attract the lion's share of the fixed income flows, pulling in $5 billion, whilst emerging market debt funds attracted $1.9 billion. High yield bonds suffered their second straight week of chunky outflows, losing $2.2 billion.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report).

aVOne Confederate flag-maker's sales have surged amid heightened controversy in the wake of violent rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aAlabama Flag and Banner in Huntsville, which may be the only remaining U.S. manufacturer of the Confederate flag, attributed the rise in sales to the ongoing debates regarding the removal of the Confederate monuments across the country, CBS News reported.\u000a\u000a"What's really pushing sales is removal of the monuments," store owner Belinda Kennedy, told the network. "The general feeling I get from customers that call and email is that they are just pushing back at people who are trying to revise our history."\u000a\u000aShe added that, as long as the topic remained in the news, demand would continue.\u000a\u000aSales had increased so dramatically this past week that customers of Alabama Flag and Banner had a two- to three-week wait time for Confederate flags, read a notice on the store's website.\u000a\u000a"We are shipping them as fast as we can make them and in the order in which they are received. We greatly appreciate your devoted support and business!" the notice said.\u000a\u000aMajor U.S. flag-makers stopped producing Confederate flags in 2015, Kennedy said.\u000a\u000a"After the church shooting (in 2015), Amazon and Walmart stopped selling (the flag) and people were afraid they wouldn't be able to buy it," she told AL.com.\u000a\u000a"And then you started seeing streets renamed, schools being renamed, mountains being renamed. And then people started getting angry and then there's another surge (in sales)."\u000a\u000aSince then, Alabama Flag and Banner has sold between 600 and 800 Confederate flags a year, up from a handful of orders per year.\u000a\u000a"Everybody's got a different reason (for buying)," Kennedy said, according to AL.com. "By and large, I think people are afraid they may not be able to get it one day."

aVJanet Yellen delivered a message to President Donald Trump on Friday, making it clear that if he re-nominates her as Federal Reserve chair she will not turn her back on the raft of U.S. financial reforms that Republicans want to roll back.\u000a\u000aHer speech to the world's top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, comes at a time when the chaos at the White House may make it more likely that she would be appointed to serve another four years to head the U.S. central bank.\u000a\u000aYellen, whose term ends in February, warned that "for some" memories of the 2007-2009 financial crisis may be fading, and she said that only "modest" adjustments could be made to regulations meant to protect the economy from runs on banks and other financial panics.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump and congressional Republicans say many of the Obama-era rules go too far in choking off credit and burdening firms with unnecessary compliance.\u000a\u000a"Yellen's passionate defense of the post-crisis tightening of financial regulation isn't going to go down particularly well at the White House," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in Toronto.\u000a\u000aYet with Trump's regulatory, tax and infrastructure policy plans so far delayed, and the White House struggling to fill several key posts, Yellen, a Democrat, may represent the President's best shot at ensuring stability at an institution critical to running the economy smoothly.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump may disagree with Yellen's big-government stance on regulatory policy, he is more aligned with her track record of keeping rates low to get Americans back to work.\u000a\u000aIn addition, she said she was open to some of the key changes that the administration, and its nominee as Fed vice chair for regulation, Randal Quarles, want to pursue.\u000a\u000aLOBBYING FOR CONTINUITY\u000a\u000aOthers have been mentioned as possible choices for Trump, several of whom attended the Fed conference at a lodge in Grand Teton National Park.\u000a\u000aAlong with her standing among economists and market participants, Yellen has a public lobby as well. Demonstrators here held a rally outside the conference donning wigs fashioned after Yellen's hairstyle. The organizers, the Fed Up Coalition that has criticized the central bank's recent interest-rate hikes, want Trump to stick with Yellen.\u000a\u000aThe Fed chair has not said explicitly whether she would be open to another term, a question that has taken on added interest following intense criticism of Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Yellen, 71, is Jewish, and her image was included in a Trump campaign ad shortly before the election criticized as anti-Semitic.\u000a\u000aBut Yellen may come under increased pressure from liberals to accept if nominated, as the Fed is an independent agency and is not viewed as being part of the presidential administration.\u000a\u000a"Janet Yellen is a patriot," said Gene Sperling, who was director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama, who appointed her.\u000a\u000a"She would feel a patriotic duty to stay on if asked, even if from a personal level she was ready for a break ... she would feel an obligation to serve."\u000a\u000aAlong with academic economists, Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is now Trump's chief economic advisor, is considered a top contender for the job.\u000a\u000aYellen's familiarity among investors may be welcome to a White House facing an acrimonious political battle to avoid a debt ceiling deadline next month, and still reeling from criticism over its response to Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aReports emerged Friday that Cohn had drafted a letter of resignation over the latter incident, but decided to stay on the job.\u000a\u000aTrump, who praised Yellen after his election for keeping interest rates low, has said he probably won't make the decision about the Fed chair until late in the year.\u000a\u000aThat time frame has struck many Fed officials as worryingly late given the need for Senate confirmation and the possibility of a negative market reaction.\u000a\u000aDemocratic President Obama re-nominated Ben Bernanke, first selected as Fed chair by Republican President George W. Bush, at exactly this time in the process in 2009. At the 2013 Jackson Hole conference, the White House had already winnowed the choice down to Yellen or Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary.\u000a\u000a"It would be a smart move for him economically" for Trump to promptly choose Yellen, added Sperling.

aVThe leftist extremists are the true "threat," not the "marginal bozos" of universally condemned hate groups, and "idiot Republicans" are getting sucked into the "ludicrous and ridiculous... charade... to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump," best-selling author David Horowitz told Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000a"If there's a serious fascist movement in America, it's the left," Horowitz told guest host Jonathan Gilliam on Thursday's "The Schnitt Show." "They're the ones who go around to cities picking fights, violence \u2014 they want to shut up other people. Even these alt-right clowns were not about shutting up the opposition and suppressing it.\u000a\u000a"One fascism in America, it's coming from the left \u2013 with the support of the Democratic Party I should say.

"This is so ludicrous and ridiculous \u2014 and that's what conservatives and Republicans should be saying.\u000a\u000a"This is a charade but its one purpose is \u2014 from the time he was elected \u2014 the Democrats were going to out to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump, to undermine, to sabotage it, and that hurts all Americans."\u000a\u000aHorowitz, author of The New York Times best-seller "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," wrote the book which predicted the anti-Trump left would use race to divide America and undermine the presidency.\u000a\u000a"I call it the fascistic left \u2014 the violence and the aggression is coming from the left," Horowitz said of the Charlottesville, Virginia, counter-protest violence. " ...The left is really responsible for the violence there \u2013 not that anybody mentions it."\u000a\u000aThe left then seized on an opportunity to attempt to discredit the U.S. president.\u000a\u000a"What's going on is this is part of an ongoing war to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump," Horowitz added. "Nothing Donald Trump does or says \u2014 he's not going to get credit for anything.\u000a\u000a"You have a vicious, lying media which will seize on any fragment of his. If he gives out a statement, they'll look for the one point that they can twist and use to attack him."\u000a\u000aAnd "idiot Republicans" have fallen for it, hook, line, and sinker, feeding into the opportunistic, leftist media frenzy, according to Horowitz.\u000a\u000a"One of the reasons they have some credibility is because there are all these idiot Republicans and conservatives who join in," Horowitz lamented. "Everybody wants to feel good about themselves: 'Yeah, I'm anti-Nazi, neo-Nazi, I'm anti-white supremacy.'\u000a\u000a"Well who isn't, except for a bunch of marginal bozos?"\u000a\u000aThe fact President Trump has to specifically call out hate groups that everyone unilaterally condemns is appalling, Horowitz said.\u000a\u000a"This hysteria over white supremacy and Nazism: You know we defeated the Nazis 70 years ago?" Horowitz said. "And we ended slavery 150 years ago. There's no threat from white supremacists or Nazis, neo-Nazis. These are marginal groups."\u000a\u000aThe actual racist hate groups are so small, Horowitz said, they could never be as harmful to the U.S. as the left's army.\u000a\u000a"Any leftist group calls a national demonstration they're going to get 10,000 or 100,000 people \u2013 that's where the threat is," he concluded.\u000a\u000a" ...People coming out like it's been some kind of courage to condemn Nazism and slavery. Takes no courage at all. There's nobody out there \u2014 even these [Charlottesville white nationalist] guys are not promoting slavery."

aVConsidering how much time Grayson Perry has spent pondering masculinity, it\u2019s disappointing how little he seems to value or understand it.\u000a\u000aAn award-winning artist, author, television presenter, and BBC Reith lecturer, the London-based Perry is also a transvestite and, as he rather simply puts it. "a man." Not long ago he pursued a thoughtful if flawed exploration of masculinity in a three-part BBC TV series called "All Man," and now has written a short, self-illustrated book on the subject called "The Descent of Man." The book poses and attempts to answer the question that men of no other century have ever had to ask, "What does it mean to be a male in the 21st century?"\u000a\u000aMasculinity is the source of a great deal of handwringing and finger-wagging in our gender-confused time. It is viewed by many as resting somewhere on a scale between problematic and abominable, and there is an increasing urgency to do something about it. Grayson Perry, who considers himself very masculine, sees it as the very source of all our troubles, "I sometimes watch the evening news on television and think all of the world\u2019s problems can be boiled down to one thing: the behavior of people with a Y chromosome," his book begins, and adds, "The consequences of rogue masculinity are, I think, one of the biggest issues, if not the biggest issue, facing the world today."\u000a\u000aHe also views masculinity as outdated. Here is his condescending message to his fellow men, "Look, I know it\u2019s been tough, and you have done a great job of dominating, defending and providing with your big, strong male body, but things are changing." We no longer need men like Bear Grylls to teach us how to survive in the wild, he says.\u000a\u000aIn sum, \u201cwe don\u2019t need lumbering, warmongering animal chasers anymore." Instead, the "true survival skills" of our time are "trying to find an affordable flat to rent in London or sorting out a decent state school for their children."\u000a\u000aApart from the fact that this is a stunningly narrow, first-world perspective on survival, is he really suggesting that men have no purpose anymore as men beyond apartment-hunting or enrolling their kids in school (which could just as easily be done by women)? Yes, he is, and it\u2019s time, he declares, for traditional masculinity and what he sees as its troubling componentsviolence, the drive for success and status, the macho posturing \u2014 to be dismantled and discarded. "The world is changing, and masculinity needs to change too."\u000a\u000aHow do we accomplish this? "In order for equality to flourish, Default Man\u2019s ideology has to be unpicked from the fabric of society . . . so that we can more easily weave a just world." But plucking the "patriarchy" from society\u2019s fabric like so much lint is no mean feat. It requires perpetual activism. "Resistance needs to be woven into every moment, every thought, observation, and act." [Emphasis added.]\u000a\u000aPerry even claims, "I find myself now questioning everything: Is that trash can sexist? Are traffic regulations anti-woman?" This sounds like a silly, exhausting, unproductive, joyless way to go through life, not to mention pathologically obsessive. And it won\u2019t work.\u000a\u000aPerry and I do agree on a few points: boys need daily contact with and attention from positive male role models, preferably their fathers; boys today also would benefit from some kind of ritualized passage to manhood; soldiering and sports are effective ways of "dealing with unsocialized masculine energy"; and "being single for a man is not healthy, no matter what some mens\u2019 rights groups like MGTOW [Men Going Their Own Way] think."\u000a\u000aBut beyond that, we have different solutions. Perry\u2019s position is the politically correct, utopian fantasy that if we can just acculturate men to be more like women, peace and harmony and equality will reign. This is a denial of human nature and an ass-backward way to go about managing what Perry calls "rogue" masculinity.\u000a\u000aDiscussions about manhood today are dominated by a loud minority of voices such as Perry\u2019s, who label it "toxic" and call for its fundamental transformation, if not its extermination. Lost in all their noisy condemnation is any recognition for the good that men do, for the positive aspects of masculinity, for the flip sides of some of the very qualities Perry derides.\u000a\u000aViolence, for example, is necessary and righteous when employed in defense of self, family and country (presumably Perry would disagree, since in his book he dismisses the police and armed forces as "legitimized violent gangs"). The male drive to compete, as another example, is beneficial when it leads to self-actualization, innovation, and prosperity.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s long past time that we stopped allowing the voices of anti-masculinity to sway the discussion. There is plenty to celebrate and to value in traditional masculinity. Instead of eliminating it altogether, we should be channeling it in productive, virtuous directions. We need to shift the conversation from the "descent of man" to the "ascent of man" \u2014 building up the best in masculine nature, not demolishing the whole structure.\u000a\u000aThis article first appeared on Acculturated.com.\u000a\u000aMark Tapson is the editor-in-chief of TruthRevolt and a Shillman Fellow at the Horowitz Freedom Center.

aVSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller has issued grand jury subpoenas seeking testimony from public relations executives who worked on an international campaign organized by former Trump campaign adviser Paul Manafort, NBC News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\u000a\u000aThis is the first indication that Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russia, is beginning to compel witness testimony before the grand jury, NBC said.\u000a\u000aRussia's government has denied interfering in the election and the president has denied collusion took place.\u000a\u000aOne executive whose firm received a subpoena told NBC Mueller's team is looking at the lobbying campaign, which ran from 2012 to 2014.

aVPresident Donald Trump reportedly will begin a major push next week to convince the public of the need for tax reform, shifting his focus to fiscal policy in a bid to win a big legislative victory by the end of the year.\u000a\u000aGary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, told the Financial Times in an interview that Trump would begin the tax reform push next Wednesday with a speech in Missouri, the first in a series of addresses to generate public support for tax reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are completely engaged in tax reform. Starting next week the president\u2019s agenda and calendar is going to revolve around tax reform,\u201d he told the FT.\u000a\u000aCohn said Trump will spend the next several weeks leading a public campaign in support of a tax overhaul while the White House leaves Republican lawmakers to hash out details of the plan,\u000a\u000a\u201cHe will start being on the road making major addresses justifying the reasoning for tax reform and why we need it in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump will kick off the campaign next week with a visit to Missouri, according to an administration official familiar with the plans told Bloomberg. His trip Wednesday to the state\u2019s southwestern city of Springfield is expected to be the first of several stops around the country in the coming weeks, said the official, who asked not to be identified because the details were still under review.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the end of the day, tax legislation has to happen in Congress and the House. The \u201cbig six\u201d [a group of White House officials and leading congressional Republicans] have been meeting and have come up with an outline and skeleton and we have a good skeleton that we have agreed to," Cohn said.\u000a\u000a"Now it is chairman [Kevin] Brady\u2019s time to get the ways and means committee together to put flesh and bone on it and they will do it next week when the House comes back into session," Cohn said.\u000a\u000a"The ways and means committee will be drafting legislation and we will be on the road and holding meetings in Washington and elsewhere explaining why it is so important to have tax reform in America.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn said he believes the legislation can be written and pass both houses of Congress by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have been holding hearings for years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they are just starting the process now.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is not expected to set forth his own plan or many specifics, the official said. Instead, Trump will advocate broad themes of middle-class tax cuts, simplifying the tax code and making businesses more competitive in a way that encourages job creation, the official said.\u000a\u000aRepublican congressional leaders have already said they don\u2019t expect to release a joint tax plan with the White House. Instead, they\u2019ll rely on House and Senate tax-writing committees to solve the big questions that remain unanswered, according to two people familiar with the matter.\u000a\u000aThe so-called Big Six -- made up of White House officials and congressional leaders involved in tax negotiations -- jointly released a two-page statement in July that outlined a broad set of agreed-upon tax principles. Specifics, including such basic matters as where to set the corporate tax rate and how to set up individual tax brackets, have yet to emerge.\u000a\u000aWhile White House officials previously said Trump would spend much of August promoting the tax plan, the administration instead became engulfed with controversy after the president said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides of clashes in Charlottesville involving neo-Nazi groups and counter-protesters.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report).

Yahya Rasool, a military spokesman, spoke hours after Iraq's foreign minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, said that 70 percent of the town west of Mosul had been retaken. Al-Jaafari spoke during a news conference with his French counterpart.\u000a\u000aIraqi officials often declare areas liberated before the fighting has completely ended, and the militants have been known to carry out surprise counterattacks.\u000a\u000aIraq launched the operation to retake Tal Afar on Sunday, a month after it declared the northern city of Mosul, its second largest, to be fully liberated. Tal Afar is about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Syria's border and it's among the last IS-held towns in Iraq.\u000a\u000aIraqi and Syrian forces have advanced against the extremist group on a number of fronts in recent months with the help of a U.S.-led coalition. U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led forces are currently battling IS inside the group's self-declared capital, Raqqa, in northern Syria.\u000a\u000aIS still controls large areas in Syria and a handful of towns in Iraq. In the past, it has managed to inspire or carry out attacks in Europe and elsewhere even while suffering battlefield setbacks in the Middle East.

But the NRA has begun a campaign not against pending legislation but what it sees as liberal forces bent on undoing the progress it's made \u2014 and the political powerhouse is resorting to language that some believe could incite violence.\u000a\u000aUsing the hashtags #counterresistance and #clenchedfistoftruth, the NRA has put out a series of videos that announce a "shot across the bow," and say the gun-rights group is "coming for you" and that "elites ... threaten our very survival," terms that suggest opponents are enemy combatants.\u000a\u000a"The times are burning and the media elites have been caught holding the match," NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch says in one video aired on NRATV, the gun lobby's web video site, as it shows footage of people fighting police, breaking storefront glass and burning the American flag.\u000a\u000aLater, she specifically calls out The New York Times: "We've had it with your narratives, your propaganda, your fake news. We've had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life. And we've had it with your tone-deaf assertion that you are in any way truth or fact-based journalism," Loesch says. "Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow. ... In short? We're coming for you."\u000a\u000aKathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the tone and language is "overwrought rhetoric" that, viewed by the wrong person, could lead to violence. The kicker on one of the videos \u2014 "We're coming for you" \u2014 is straight out of the movies, she said, and "that phrase means that violence is imminent and we will perpetrate it."\u000a\u000aThe NRA is taking a page from the Trump playbook.\u000a\u000aThe friction between the gun lobby and the media isn't new. But critics of the NRA contend the organization is relying on the "fake news" mantra started by Trump to whip up its followers after a dip in gun sales that has taken place since Trump succeeded President Barack Obama, who favored stricter gun-control laws.\u000a\u000a"They're not inventing this hyperangry, nasty partisan tone but piggybacking on Trump's approach. Of course, NRA voters by and large are Trump voters, so they would be sympathetic to that kind of message," said Robert Spitzer, chairman of the political science department at State University of New York at Cortland, who has examined the firearms industry and Second Amendment issues extensively.\u000a\u000aSpitzer, a member of the NRA as well as the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said it's a pattern the NRA has exhibited as the group evolved from an almost exclusive focus on gun safety into a political beacon for conservatives who fear changes to the Second Amendment and the gun industry.\u000a\u000a"It was Bill Clinton in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, it was John McCain. It was Hillary Clinton. It was the United Nations. They've held up the U.N. as ready to swoop in and take everybody's guns," Spitzer said. "The focus of their ire has changed, but the basic message has been the same."\u000a\u000aThe NRA declined to comment on the videos to The Associated Press. But the NRA has produced videos saying the left and the media are out of control and feeding a false narrative that tea party conservatives are racists and Trump supporters are "toothless hillbillies."\u000a\u000aWayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, said this month: "There is no longer any difference between our politicians and the elite media who report on them. ... These elites threaten our very survival, and to them we say: We don't trust you, we don't fear you, and we don't need you. Take your hands off our future."\u000a\u000aErich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said it's been a longtime frustration with journalists who, he contends, "ignore the violence and harsh rhetoric on the left while magnifying and twisting the words of those on the right."\u000a\u000aThe NRA videos prompted Mike Nelson, a Democratic congressional candidate in Arkansas and self-described hunter and gun-rights supporter, to label them as "hate speech." Nelson, whose website lists the NRA among more than two dozen organization he's supported, said he can no longer back the NRA.\u000a\u000aIn a Facebook post, Nelson wrote: "If the NRA does not stop their hate campaign, I will call them out on sedition. Sedition is the willful undermining of the legal authority, the Incitement of Violence."\u000a\u000aSome gun owners have cheered the videos and said they give voice to conservatives weary of media attacks on Trump; others say the videos stray from the NRA's original mission and that the NRA is inviting violence.\u000a\u000aJoe Plenzler, a Marine veteran who served overseas and sometimes had reporters accompanying his unit, joined two other veterans in writing an opinion piece for The Daily Beast criticizing the videos.\u000a\u000a"The NRA props up the Second Amendment by undermining and vilifying the protections afforded in the First, and paints everyone who may disagree with the current administration, our country's justice system, or the NRA's partisan political position with a very dark and unjust broad brush," Plenzler wrote with Marine veterans Craig Tucker and Kyleanne Hunter.\u000a\u000aPlenzler, who has since dropped his NRA membership, said he was disturbed by the videos.\u000a\u000a"Lately, it seems like they've gone well out of the bounds of any sort of sane responsible behavior. If you want to advocate for the Second Amendment, which I unapologetically believe in, that's fine," he said. "But I think at the point where you are going to demonize half the American population in a recruitment effort to get more members, I've got a big problem with that."

aVGwyneth Paltrow's health claims on her Goop wellness brand are unsubstantiated and deceptive, two California attorneys are charging in a complaint to the state's Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force filed on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aLaura Smith and Bonnie Patten, of Truth In Advertising (TINA), said in a letter to the task force that they have documented more than 50 unsubstantiated claims made by the Oscar-winning actress and her company about Goop's products.\u000a\u000aThe attorneys said the company claims "either expressly or implicitly, that its products or third party products that it promotes can treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments, ranging from depression, anxiety, and insomnia, to infertility, uterine prolapse, and arthritis, just to name a few."\u000a\u000aSmith and Patten urged in their letter for the task force to start an investigation into Goop and take enforcement action against the company.\u000a\u000a"Women that are having infertility problems are desperate to find a cure or treatment, and Goop is taking advantage of people at their most vulnerable positions," Patten told NBC's "Today" show. "And it's really just not acceptable."\u000a\u000aGoop responded to the TINA's claims with a statement to E! News, calling their charges mislead and unfounded.\u000a\u000a"We are receptive to feedback and consistently seek to improve the quality of the products and information referenced on our site," the Goop statement said, per E! News. "We responded promptly and in good faith to the initial outreach from representatives of TINA and hoped to engage with them to address their concerns.\u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, they provided limited information and made threats under arbitrary deadlines which were not reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, while we believe that TINA's description of our interactions is misleading and their claims unsubstantiated and unfounded, we will continue to evaluate our products and our content and make those improvements that we believe are reasonable and necessary in the interests of our community of users," the statement continued.\u000a\u000aThe "Iron Man" actress founded in 2008 a weekly email newsletter, but it has now grown into a retail and lifestyle business that she runs as its chief executive officer, the "Today" show wrote.

aVAn ancient tablet may contain trigonometry secrets suggesting Babylonians may have understood the advanced mathematics 1,000 years before Greeks.\u000a\u000aThe meaning of an ancient tablet, Plimpton 322, discovered in Iraq in the early 1900s, was explored in a recent study published in Historia Matematica.\u000a\u000a"Our research reveals that Plimpton 322 describes the shapes of right-angle triangles using a novel kind of trigonometry based on ratios, not angles and circles. It is a fascinating mathematical work that demonstrates undoubted genius,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Mansfield, of the University of New South Wales' School of Mathematics and Statistics in Sydney, Australia, according to Newsweek.\u000a\u000aMansfield co-authored the study with UNSW associate professor Norman Wildberger.\u000a\u000aMansfield described the tablet in a video posted on the university's YouTube channel, featured above.\u000a\u000a"Our research shows that it's a trigonometric table so unfamiliar and advanced that, in some respects, it's superior even to modern trigonometry," he said in the video.\u000a\u000aHe speculated that the tablet could have been used to survey fields or to build architectural structures like palaces or pyramids. He called it the world's oldest and the only completely accurate trigonometric table on record.\u000a\u000aThe tablet's more accurate base 60 system could have applications in modern day surveying, computers, and education, Mansfield said.\u000a\u000a"It's rare that the ancient world teaches us something new. After 3,000 years, Babylonia mathematics might just be coming back into fashion," he said in the video.\u000a\u000aMathematics professor Duncan Melville of St. Lawrence University isn't convinced, according to National Geographic.\u000a\u000a"Apart from the column headings, the tablet just consists of columns of numbers, and this invites a great deal of purely mathematical speculation," Melville told National Geographic in an email. "Some of the different interpretations for construction of the tablet are mathematically equivalent and so just having the output on the tablet does not tell you much about the process used to generate that output."\u000a\u000aMathematics professor Donald Allen of Texas A&M University also raised doubts, saying key information from pieces broken from the tablet leave too much to conjecture.\u000a\u000a"Bottom line is this: If interpreted as a trig table, it would be the oldest known. Some of their computations were very accurate. Babylonian arithmetic was rather clumsy, but then so were Egyptian and Greek variations," Allen said, according to National Geographic.

aVPacking could end up being the most important factor when traveling internationally. Many times, travelers will realize too late the extra baggage they took along, causing strained muscles and extra charges.\u000a\u000aEveryone has different needs, but anyone can become a pro when it comes to packing for a trip abroad. Here are six tips for packing like a pro on your next international journey:\u000a\u000a1. List items for packing \u2014 Instead of grabbing something here and something there, list the things you will need for your trip. Items you need can depend on the length of the trip or the weather. Check off the items as you gather them, Frommer\u2019s advises.\u000a\u000aLatest: What's Your Favorite Type of Vacation? Relaxing or Exploring?\u000a\u000a2. Check with the airline on baggage information \u2014 On some international flights, travelers are allowed up to two 50-pound bags free of charge. A carry-on, however, is still a good idea because your baggage might not arrive on the same flight. Divide items evenly if checking more than one bag so you will have what you need incase the other bag doesn\u2019t arrive at the same time.\u000a\u000a3. Don\u2019t bring things you don\u2019t need \u2014 Research your destination to find out if you can buy personal items there. Also, voltage and plug types might be different abroad. Buying an adapter often solves the problem. Avoid packing jewelry and other valuables. Tourists make good targets for thieves, Caroline Costello points out in Smarter Travel. Unnecessary gadgets, such as DVD players, coffee makers, or other devices, only take up room, and travelers often find they never use them.\u000a\u000aTell Us: What Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?\u000a\u000a4. Bring the right amount of clothing \u2014 Before going on a trip, take note of the clothes you wear in a week. You can make a list, then reduce the number of outfits you\u2019ll need. Bring lots of neutral colors for mixing and matching. In most cases, you won\u2019t have to change your clothes that often when traveling abroad.\u000a\u000a5. Pack shoes that can be worn with different outfits \u2014 Limit it to three pairs for dress, casual, and comfort wear, CNN Travel recommends. Pack shoes with soles to the side of the case around the edge and keep the center for clothes. Stuff socks and undergarments into shoes to save space and help keep the shape of the shoes.\u000a\u000a6. Pack really light \u2014 An alternative method is traveling light while on an international trip, according to Rick Steves\u2019 Europe. Steves recommends one carry-on-size bag for transatlantic flights that is limited to 20 pounds. Travelers walk with their bags more than they think, and going casual and simple is the best way. You can buy many things you might need later at various locations.\u000a\u000aVote Now: Should the Government Be Doing More to Promote Tourism in America?

aVTesla next month plans to unveil an electric big-rig truck with a working range of 200 to 300 miles, Reuters has learned, a sign that the electric car maker is targeting regional hauling for its entry into the commercial freight market.\u000a\u000aChief Executive Elon Musk has promised to release a prototype of its Tesla Semi truck next month in a bid to expand the company's market beyond luxury cars.\u000a\u000aThe entrepreneur has tantalized the trucking industry with the prospect of a battery-powered heavy-duty vehicle that can compete with conventional diesels, which can travel up to 1,000 miles on a single tank of fuel.\u000a\u000aTesla\u2019s electric prototype will be capable of traveling the low end of what transportation veterans consider to be \u201clong-haul\u201d trucking, according to Scott Perry, an executive at Miami-based fleet operator Ryder System. Perry said he met with Tesla officials earlier this year to discuss the technology at the automaker\u2019s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California.\u000a\u000aPerry said Tesla\u2019s efforts are centered on an electric big-rig known as a \u201cday cab\u201d with no sleeper berth, capable of traveling about 200 to 300 miles with a typical payload before recharging.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not going to count them out for having a strategy for longer distances or ranges, but right out of the gate I think that\u2019s where they\u2019ll start,\u201d said Perry, who is the chief technology officer and chief procurement officer for Ryder.\u000a\u000aTesla's plan, which could change as the truck is developed, is consistent with what battery researchers say is possible with current technology. Tesla has not said publicly how far its electric truck could travel, what it would cost or how much cargo it could carry. But Musk has acknowledged that Tesla has met privately with potential buyers to discuss their needs.\u000a\u000aReuters reported earlier this month that Tesla is developing self-driving capability for the big rig.\u000a\u000aMusk has expressed hopes for large-scale production of the Tesla Semi within a couple of years. That audacious effort could open a potentially lucrative new market for the Palo Alto, California-based automaker.\u000a\u000aOr it could prove an expensive distraction. Musk in July warned that the company is bracing for \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d as it accelerates production of its new Model 3 sedan. Tesla aims to produce 5,000 of the cars per week by the end of this year, and 10,000 per week some time next year.\u000a\u000aTesla shares are up about 65 percent this year. But skeptics abound. Some doubt Musk's ability to take Tesla from a niche producer to a large-scale automaker. About 22 percent of shares available for trade have been sold "short" by investors who expect the stock to fall.\u000a\u000aMusk, a quirky billionaire whose transportation ambitions include colonizing the planet Mars, has long delighted in defying conventional wisdom. At Tesla\u2019s annual meeting in June, he repeated his promise of a battery-powered long-haul big rig.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people don't think you can do a heavy-duty, long-range truck that's electric, but we are confident that this can be done," he said.\u000a\u000aWhile the prototype described by Ryder\u2019s Perry would fall well short of the capabilities of conventional diesels, Musk may well have found a sweet spot if he can deliver. Roughly 30 percent of U.S. trucking jobs are regional trips of 100 to 200 miles, according to Sandeep Kar, chief strategy officer of Toronto-based Fleet Complete, which tracks and analyzes truck movement.\u000a\u000aA truck with that range would be able to move freight regionally, such as from ports to nearby cities or from warehouses to retail establishments.\u000a\u000a"As long as (Musk) can break 200 miles he can claim his truck is 'long haul' and he will be technically right," Kar said.\u000a\u000aInterest in electric trucks is high among transportation firms looking to reduce their emissions and operating costs. Electric motors require less maintenance than internal combustion engines. Juice from the grid is cheaper than diesel.\u000a\u000aBut current technology doesn\u2019t pencil when it comes to powering U.S. trucks across the country. Experts say the batteries required would be so large and heavy there would be little room for cargo.\u000a\u000aAn average diesel cab costs around $120,000. The cost of the battery alone for a big rig capable of going 200 to 400 miles carrying a typical payload could be more than that, according to battery researchers Shashank Sripad and Venkat Viswanathan of Carnegie Mellon University.\u000a\u000aBattery weight and ability would limit a semi to a range of about 300 miles with an average payload, according to a paper recently published by Viswanathan and Sripad. The paperthanked Tesla for "helpful comments and suggestions." Tesla did not endorse the work or comment on the conclusions to Reuters.\u000a\u000aA range of 200 to 300 miles would put Tesla at the edge of what the nascent electric truck industry believes is economically feasible, the researchers and industry insiders said.\u000a\u000aTransportation stalwarts such as manufacturer Daimler AG and shipping company United Parcel Service said they are focusing their electric efforts on short-haul trucks. That\u2019s because smaller distances and lighter payloads require less batterypower, and trucks can recharge at a central hub overnight.\u000a\u000aDaimler, the largest truck manufacturer in the world by sales, will begin production this year on an electric delivery truck. The vehicle will have a 100-mile range and be capable of carrying a payload of 9,400 pounds, about 1,000 pounds less than its diesel counterpart, according to Daimler officials.\u000a\u000aDaimler has been joined by a handful of startups such as Chanje, a Los Angeles-based manufacturer that has a partnership with Ryder to build 100-mile-range electric trucks for package delivery.\u000a\u000aRyder and its customers believe electric trucks could cost more to buy but may be cheaper to maintain and have more predictable fuel costs. As batteries become cheaper and environmental regulation increases, the case for electric trucks could strengthen.\u000a\u000a"This tech is being seen as a major potential differentiator. Everyone wants to understand how real it is," said Perry, the chief technology officer.

aVOutnumbered and outvoted in hubs of innovation like Silicon Valley and Seattle, conservatives in the overwhelmingly blue industry have faced a challenging political environment for years \u2014 especially during the Obama era when the White House had Google and Facebook chiefs on speed dial.\u000a\u000aBut several deep-pocketed Republicans have managed to carve out a niche for themselves in the tech world, including a few who even backed Donald Trump publicly last year over techie favorite Hillary Clinton. According to Wired, employees at tech firms overwhelmingly supported Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u000a\u000aAlert: Your Drugstore Doesn't Understand Your Thyroid\u000a\u000aNewsmax has selected these 25 high-tech heavyweights who run against the grain in Silicon Valley and beyond, wielding their influence, forward-thinking, and resources to promote Republican candidates and ideals.\u000a\u000a1. Peter Thiel \u2014 The billionaire co-founder of PayPal last year threw his support, and a big chunk of his money, behind Trump, earning him a speaking spot at the GOP convention. Thiel made headlines \u2014 not because of his Silicon Valley ZIP code, but because of his sexual orientation. \u201cI am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican,\u201d he has said. \u201cBut most of all, I am proud to be an American.\u201d Thiel isn\u2019t just a Trump Republican; he\u2019s donated almost $5 million to various GOP candidates and PACs over the past few years.\u000a\u000a2. Larry Ellison \u2014 Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Ellison has donated over the years to Democrats and Republicans, but hosted fundraisers for Sen. Rand Paul in 2014 and Marco Rubio in 2016. In addition to hosting the Rubio dinner, Ellison was reportedly the second-largest donor to the Florida senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid through Conservative Solutions PAC, giving the super PAC $4 million throughout the campaign. The billionaire has continued to support the GOP after the November election, hosting a Republican fundraiser in his Silicon Valley home in April 2017.\u000a\u000a3. Meg Whitman \u2014 The former Hewlett-Packard and eBay executive ran for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, losing badly after pouring $144 million of her own money into the race. She backed Chris Christie in 2016 but endorsed Clinton over Trump after Christie dropped out. Still, she said, she remains a staunch Republican.\u000a\u000a4. Marc Andreessen \u2014 While funding and supporting Democrats in the past, Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and a director of eBay, Facebook, and Hewlett-Packard made a political shift when he threw his considerable weight, and wallet, behind Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cYou do not get a high-end, professional CEO running for president very often,\u201d the co-founder and partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz told CNBC at the time.\u000a\u000a5. Michael Dell \u2014 The Dell Technologies founder and former CEO has a long history of backing Republicans, including many in his home state of Texas. While he regularly makes smaller donations to (mostly) GOP candidates, he made a whopping $250,000 contribution in 2002 to the Republican National Committee. Even though his company is headquartered near Austin, Texas, Dell has developed strong ties to Silicon Valley by establishing mentors and opening an R&D center there.\u000a\u000a6. Scott McNealy \u2014 The Sun Microsystems co-founder, who self-identifies as a \u201craging capitalist,\u201d is bullish on Trump. "I\u2019ve never seen anybody who actually is a developer and an entrepreneur in charge and understanding what really projects capability in our country,\u201d McNealy told Fox Business. In 2012, he also backed Mitt Romney, with whom he shares a secondary school alma mater in Michigan.\u000a\u000a7. Steve Ballmer \u2014 The former Microsoft CEO has given plenty of cash to Democrats, but he is a self-described Republican who worked on George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and has helped many other GOP candidates. He has offered tempered praise for Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying it\u2019s \u201cimportant to have reasonably secure borders.\u201d And he said Trump\u2019s message about business stimulating jobs inside the country \u201cis not a bad theme at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a8. Paul Otellini \u2014 The former Intel CEO and president tried to work closely with the Obama White House, despite once famously saying the Democrat did not understand \u201cwhat it takes to create jobs.\u201d But Otellini, an executive with Trident Capital Cybersecurity, has made no secret of his preference for Republicans. He publicly backed, and financially supported, both John McCain and Romney in their races against Obama.\u000a\u000a9. Sarah Pompei \u2014 Possessing a lengthy Republican rsum before making the jump to Silicon Valley: Pompei advised Meg Whitman\u2019s gubernatorial bid in 2010, ran Romney's regional press in 2012, and worked briefly in the House GOP leaderships. She then left politics for senior communications roles at Hewlett-Packard and, now, rideshare app Lyft.\u000a\u000a10. Garrett Johnson \u2014 Co-founder of tech startup SendHub, Johnson differs from most other influencers considered among \u201cNewsmax's 25 Most Influential Republicans in Tech\u201d as his impact is more felt at the grassroots level. As executive director and co-founder of the Lincoln Network, he\u2019s a leader in building up and organizing right-leaning thinkers in the tech community in an effort to affect public policy with technological solutions driven toward freedom.\u000a\u000a11. Scott Banister \u2014 A PayPal board member and tech mega-investor, Banister strongly backed Rand Paul last year and supported Paul\u2019s father Ron in 2012. When Rand Paul quit the race, Banister, a marijuana rights activist who describes himself as a Libertarian, threw his support to Ted Cruz. Banister\u2019s wife Cyan is also a Republican super-donor.\u000a\u000a12. Palmer Luckey \u2014 The 24-year-old founder of Oculus Rift took a bare-knuckled approach to the 2016 campaign, helping to finance a pro-Trump group that created harsh anti-Clinton memes. Specifically, the group, Nimble America, ran a billboard campaign featuring Clinton with the caption \u201cToo Big to Jail.\u201d Luckey self-describes as a Libertarian.\u000a\u000a13. Tim Armstrong \u2014 The current AOL Inc. chief executive\u2019s support for Republicans has caused headaches for one of AOL\u2019s big media properties, the left-leaning Huffington Post, which quoted a \u201csource\u201d in 2011 saying Armstrong \u201ccalls himself a libertarian,\u201d but is in fact \u201cone of the most conservative people around.\u201d\u000a\u000a14. Don Scifres \u2014 The president of the tech startup SmartFile, Scifres is a venture capitalist who co-founded the SDL Capital investment firm and Spectra Diode Laboratories. Scifres has been a go-to GOP donor for years; in 2016, he backed Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz.\u000a\u000a15. Aaron Ginn \u2013 An early founder of the growth hacking movement, Ginn specializes in data science and product development. He\u2019s also one of the co-founders of Lincoln Network, formerly Lincoln Labs, an incubator for conservative tech professionals who, according to its website, is \u201cdevoted to building alliance of liberty and technology.\u201d He also worked on Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012.\u000a\u000aTip: Loophole Can Qualify Seniors for $20,500 Check\u000a\u000a16. Chris Abrams \u2014 The co-founder and chief technology officer of Matters Media, which he describes as a \u201cdigital publishing holdings company with a tech twist.\u201d Abrams is a self-described technologist and entrepreneur who previously worked with large organizations such as NASA and the Department of Defense, but also worked with dozens of small startups. He also works with Ginn on Lincoln Network.\u000a\u000a17. Brian Krzanich \u2014 The CEO of Intel since 2013, Krzanich agreed to host a Trump fundraiser last year at his California home but canceled it. Amid uproar, he later said he was staying neutral in the 2016 election. But unlike many other tech leaders, he has decided to work very closely with Trump in the White House.\u000a\u000a18. Eric Jackson \u2014 Jackson, a former PayPal executive, is also the co-founder of CapLinked, a group focused on linking tech companies and investors. He has been active in conservative causes for decades and frequently appears as a conservative commentator on radio and TV.\u000a\u000a19. Keith Rabois \u2014 A technology entrepreneur, executive, and investor, Rabois is known for his early-stage startup investments and his executive roles at PayPal, LinkedIn, Slide, and Square. In response to Thiel\u2019s convention speech last year, he tweeted that the \u201ctech industry is primarily out of touch by being too far to the Left.\u201d\u000a\u000a20. Andrew Torba \u2014 According to TechCrunch, Torba \u201cdescribed himself as a lifelong \u2018conservative Republican Christian,\u2019\u201d but is also the co-founder and CEO of Automate Ads and more famously the founder and CEO of Gab, a free speech-minded alternative to Twitter.\u000a\u000a21. Scott Slinker \u2014 The CEO of analytics startup Paradata is a staunch supporter of Trump. Slinker told CNBC that the president is \u201cracist for the American employee . . . He wants to get America back to work, and I think that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d Upon reflection, he stuck by his controversial words. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t edit that out,\u201d he told the \u201cRaw Story\u201d host.\u000a\u000a22. Dr. Susan Amat \u2014 A self-described serial entrepreneur with a Ph.D. in strategic entrepreneurship, Amat is the CEO and founder of Venture Hive, which finances startups and other tech companies. She served as an adviser to Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\u000a\u000a23. John Rampton \u2014 The CEO of Due, a financial advice platform for small-business owners, backed Trump, he told USA Today, because \u201cI like when business people run for president.\u201d He's donated to the Trump campaign because Trump "speaks his mind and doesn't care what people think. That is how you effect change." It's not the most popular stance in the valley where, Rampton told the newspaper, "once a day, I'm asked to f*** myself for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap."\u000a\u000a24. Tim Draper \u2014 The Bitcoin CEO is not overtly partisan and once said he doesn\u2019t \u201cfit into either political party.\u201d Nonetheless, he has been a registered Republican who financed California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and other GOP candidates and has spoken out strongly against Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. In 2000, he spent $20 million of his own money on a failed effort to support school vouchers.\u000a\u000a25. Tom Siebel \u2014 From 2009 to 2014, the Siebel Systems founder gave almost $350,000 to political candidates. Most of this largesse went to independents, but a big chunk went to GOP candidates and none went to Democrats. He also planned to host a fundraiser for Sarah Palin at his Woodside home in 2008, but the event was canceled.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 2 Warning Signs of Sudden Cardiac Death

aVEaster, and the Holy Week leading up to it, is celebrated differently around the world. Some mark the holiday with egg hunts and chocolates and visits from a giant, mythical bunny, while others choose to also celebrate the Resurrection of the Christ.\u000a\u000aFor this list, Newsmax considered destinations far and wide \u2014 across the United States and around the globe \u2014 where the religious Easter holiday is celebrated with processions, parades, and pageantry that mark the foundation of the Christian faith.\u000a\u000aSince the holiday often coincides with spring break, Easter can also be the perfect time to plan a more extensive cultural family vacation abroad.\u000a\u000aFrom witnessing centuries-old religious processions across Europe to a sunrise Easter service at the Garden Tomb in Jerusalem, Newsmax has curated 25 destinations where you can experience the holy side of Easter.\u000a\u000aSpecial: 270 Ways to Slash Your 2016 Tax Bill\u000a\u000aThe list isn\u2019t focused on international destinations, either. There are plenty of equally engaging places right here in the U.S. to experience the holiday as well, including America\u2019s longest-running passion play in Oklahoma and a pilgrimage to a sacred church in New Mexico.\u000a\u000aHere are Newsmax's top 25 Easter destinations around the world:\u000a\u000a1. Jerusalem, Israel \u2014 It is pretty difficult to think of anywhere more special to celebrate Easter Week than Jerusalem, where the story that led to the first Easter unfolded. Jerusalem\u2019s Holy Week begins with a Palm Sunday parade to commemorate Christ entering the city. The route, which attracts up to 10,000 participants each year, follows the footsteps Jesus took along the Via Dolorosa in the Old City. A Palm Sunday Mass is also held at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is the place where Christians believe Christ was buried and then rose from the dead. On Easter itself, a sunrise service is held at the Garden Tomb.\u000a\u000a2. Rome, Italy \u2014 Attending Easter Mass held by the Pope at the Vatican is a sacred experience for Catholics. And Rome is truly a wonderful cultural family destination to celebrate the Holy Week. Events begin on Palm Sunday with a free mass in Saint Peter\u2019s Square. There are also Mass services on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday. Also don\u2019t miss the Stations of the Cross (Via Crucis) parade on Good Friday when a huge cross with burning torches lights the sky as a procession passes each station placed by Pope Benedict XIV at the Colosseum back in 1744.\u000a\u000a3. Chimayo, New Mexico \u2014 In the tiny northern New Mexico town of Chimayo, about a 45-minute drive from Santa Fe, this simple adobe church, known as El Santuario de Chimayo, has been called the \u201cLourdes of North America\u201d for its supposed healing powers. Each year thousands of people come to this rural village to gather the soil from a place in the floor that is associated with a miraculous crucifix discovery in 1810 and is believed to have amazing curative powers. Easter Week is one of the most popular, and special times, to visit Chimayo, with many visitors choosing to make a walking pilgrimage to the church from Santa Fe.\u000a\u000a4. Bloomington, Illinois \u2014 Bloomington puts on America\u2019s oldest Passion play each Easter with a production now in its 94th consecutive year. The \u201cAmerican Passion Play,\u201d held at the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts, differs from other Passion plays in that it follows Jesus\u2019 entire life, rather than just the events surrounding Easter. In this performance, guests are transported back to Palestine in the time of Christ, and follow him on his ministry and life from the Sermon on the Mount to the Resurrection and Ascension. The settings and costumes aim to be as historically accurate as possible, and the script follows passages from the King James Version of the Bible.\u000a\u000a5. Lawton, Oklahoma \u2014 Another one of America\u2019s longest-running Easter Passion plays is performed each year at a remote location inside southwest Oklahoma\u2019s Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge known as Holy City of the Wichitas. The narrated dramatization of the birth, life, death, and Resurrection of Christ has been held outside in what is now a replica of the Holy Land every year since 1926. The story is performed entirely in pantomime with musical backing, while readers also broadcast the script on the radio and to the Easter performance crowd. Over the years, the cast has grown to some 150 members.\u000a\u000a6. Marion, Indiana \u2014 Running since 1937, the Marion Easter Pageant uses no spoken commentary, but instead tells the story of the last week of Christ\u2019s life entirely with pantomime, pageantry, and hymns. The hour-long performance, held at the Memorial Coliseum YMCA, begins with the Palm Sunday entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem and concludes with the "Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah.\u201d\u000a\u000a7. Orlando, Florida \u2014 Orlando\u2019s Bible-themed park, known as The Holy Land Experience, is a great, educationally focused family experience. The park is a living, biblical museum that is designed to replicate the city of Jerusalem some 2,000 years ago. From the Garden Tomb to the Wilderness Tabernacle, biblical history comes alive in intricate detail. Although the theme park is open year-round, in the six weeks around Easter (March 14 to April 29, 2017) they put on special Crucifixion and Resurrection re-enactments outside by the tomb.\u000a\u000a8. Lourdes, France \u2014 One of the most-visited religious sites in the world, the village of Lourdes, at the base of the Pyrenees Mountains, is especially magical at Easter. During the Holy Week, France\u2019s second most-visited city sees thousands of pilgrims \u2014 it is the largest Catholic pilgrimage destination in Europe \u2014 carrying torches in a procession through the ancient streets, meditating the prayer of the Rosary. Many companies offer organized tours, which include Mass at the Grotto, a cave-like shrine at the base of Lourdes Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.\u000a\u000a9. Lalibela, Ethiopia \u2014 Ethiopia was one of the earliest countries to embrace Christianity, and very little has changed since the 1st century in the way its practitioners worship there. Easter, known as Fasika there, begins in earnest on its eve, as congregants gather until nearly dawn when Lent fasting gives way to enormous feasting and celebration. Lalibela, named after the 13th-century Ethiopian king who commissioned its building, is the site where about a dozen interconnected churches were carved out of volcanic earth. The purpose of this architectural wonder, according to Ethiopian lore, was King Lalibela founding a \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d after Saladin had conquered the Hebrew city during the Third Crusade. Fasika, which follows the Eastern Orthodox calendar, usually falls a week or two after the Western holiday, so American travelers would not miss celebrating Easter at their home church by experiencing it in the African nation.\u000a\u000a10. Junction, Texas \u2014 The town of Junction, in Texas hill country, also puts on a re-enactment of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ in its annual pageant. It\u2019s held at sunset on the Saturday evening before Easter Sunday in an outdoor theater off Farm Road 2169. The site, known as the Easter Pageant grounds, sits on a pretty hillside beneath a bluff known as Lover\u2019s Leap. The pageant is performed and sponsored by the Men\u2019s Bible Class of Junction, which began as a veterans' ministry.\u000a\u000a11. Denver, Colorado \u2014 Red Rocks Amphitheater, just west of Denver, Colorado, is one of the world\u2019s most famous outdoor concert venues, known for the stunning red rock scenery surrounding the stage, but also its natural acoustics. On Easter Sunday, a sunrise prayer service held here attracts thousands who come to worship in this place of natural beauty. Afterwards, many choose to go for a hike in the park surrounding the amphitheater or continue west into the mountains for a day of reflection in nature.\u000a\u000a12. Florence, Italy \u2014 Another top Easter destination in Europe is Florence, which puts on a parade known as the Explosion of the Cart. The fiery procession is held on Easter Sunday in honor of the Florentine knight Pazzino, who was the first person to plant the banner of the cross at the battle of Jerusalem during the First Crusade in 1096. The procession, which began in the 17th century, features a float pulled by two white oxen through the streets before fireworks are set off from it before a host of fireworks explode from it.\u000a\u000a13. Seville, Spain \u2014 Holy Week, or Semana Santa in Seville, is one of Spain\u2019s largest religious festivals. The week is filled with parades, led by different religious brotherhoods, who dress in penitential robes, with giant floats featuring lifelike wooden sculptures depicting scenes from the last week of Christ\u2019s life. Many of these floats dates back to the 17th century and are considered religious works of art. The most important parade begins on the evening of Holy Thursday and continues through Good Friday dawn.\u000a\u000aAlert:\u000a\u000aWhen Do You Think Christ Is Returning? Vote Now\u000a\u000a14. Eureka Springs, Arkansas \u2014 Back in the U.S., another Passion play option can be found in the Ozark Mountains at Eureka Springs. Here \u201cThe Great Passion Play\u201d is staged in an outdoor, multi-level amphitheater with special lighting and sound effects, live animals, and a cast of 150 actors dressed in New Testament-era costumes. On Easter morning, there is a sunrise service at the amphitheater. The grounds of The Great Passion Play are also home to a few different museums, including one dedicated to the Bible, as well as a life-sized replica of Jerusalem\u2019s Eastern Gate and hiking trails, which remain open year-round.\u000a\u000a15. Mesa, Arizona \u2014 Held on the west end of the lawn north of the Mesa Arizona Temple Visitors\u2019 Center, the \u201cMesa Arizona Easter Pageant, Jesus the Christ\u201d presents the life, ministry, and mission of Christ through music, dance, and drama. This Church of Latter-Day Saints\u2019 presentation is designed for \u201call religions, ages, and cultures\u201d and takes place over multiple dates in April leading up to Easter. Claiming to be \u201clargest annual, outdoor Easter pageant in the world,\u201d the Mesa Arizona Temple hosts audiences that can exceed 10,000 in attendance.\u000a\u000a16. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \u2014 In Brazil, Easter falls at the end of summer, which means warm weather and plenty of light. Rio de Janeiro hosts numerous colorful processions throughout Holy Week, and during this time many of the city\u2019s streets are decorated with carpets of flowers.\u000a\u000a17. Oberammergau, Germany \u2014 This village in the Bavarian Alps has been putting on its \u201cPassion Play\u201d for nearly 400 years. This play is produced and performed entirely by Oberammergau villagers, by law, every 10 years, and it is expected to draw nearly half a million visitors to its 100-plus performances in 2020. Born out of war and plague and a promise to God, the manuscript has changed little over the centuries, yet has remained unique in updated presentations. The production is also easily the most exhaustive Passion play, expecting to take the stage for around five hours, with a three-hour dinner intermission. There is a theater tour, led daily in German and English, and an Easter market to add to the experience, as well as the many local and regional sights and delights to add to the experience.\u000a\u000a18. Verges, Spain \u2014 Also in Spain, the medieval city of Verges puts on a traditional \u201cdansa de la mort\u201d on Holy Thursday. The \u201cdeath dance\u201d re-enacts scenes from the Passion, and participants parade through the streets in skeleton costumes. The procession ends with purposefully frightening skeleton dancers carrying boxes of ashes and is followed by a macabre dance that beings at midnight and lasts for three hours.\u000a\u000a19. Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 Charleston is a wonderful city to celebrate Easter on the water. The weather is usually nice, the air scented with jasmine and other spring flowers, and there are a number of different sunrise service celebration options. One favorite is held at White Point Garden on the Battery at 6:45 a.m., and it usually draws a crowd of around 500 people. The views of the harbor as the sun comes up are inspiring.\u000a\u000a20. Dubrovnik, Croatia \u2014 One of Europe\u2019s most religious Easter celebrations takes place in the beautiful Croatian coastal city of Dubrovnik. Here you\u2019ll experience a ceremonious procession of the cross during Good Friday. Other Easter traditions include giving gifts of colored eggs and partaking in a special Easter cake known as pinca.\u000a\u000a21. Indianapolis, Indiana \u2014Christians come from across the country to experience Upon This Rock Passion Play at Pike Performing Arts Center in Indianapolis. The musical theater version of the Passion play includes soulful singing, choreographed dance, spoken words from the Bible, and even a pyrotechnic display as Christ rises from the grave.\u000a\u000a22. New Orleans, Louisiana \u2014 New Orleans is a city that knows how to put on a good parade anytime of year, but on Easter Sunday, it offers a full Easter procession through the French Quarter. Known as the Historic French Quarter Parade, it has been running since 1956, and begins at Antoine\u2019s Restaurant, continues on to Jackson Square, and then comes back to the starting point, following a stop for a mass at the St. Louis Cathedral.\u000a\u000a23. Buenos Aires, Argentina \u2014 Easter Sunday in Buenos Aires sees a number of traditions including consuming and sharing eggs and a special Easter cake, known as rosca de Pascua, with family, friends, and even colleagues. The day also includes Mass followed by big family gatherings with food, usually of the barbecue variety and a government-organized treasure hunt.\u000a\u000a24. Beirut, Lebanon \u2014 In Lebanon, half the country is Christian, and many Lebanese consider themselves quite religious, so Easter is celebrated passionately. Easter Sunday begins in church, and includes a custom that is unique to Lebanon. Known as Shanineh, it includes a procession of children carrying hand-decorated candles with ribbons and flowers.\u000a\u000a25. Lakeport, California \u2014 If you miss the Easter Passion plays, head to Lakeport, about a two-hour drive from the East Bay, on May 20 and 21, for its annual presentation of the \u201cPassion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d The Lake County Passion Play Grounds is a pastoral, lakeside landscape that serves as a 1,000-foot stage where more than 150 costumed actors re-enact the final days of Christ\u2019s ministry on Earth.\u000a\u000aTell Us:\u000a\u000aWhat Part of the World Do You Like to Visit?

aVSpooked American investors pulled $2.6 billion from U.S. stocks during the last week as U.S. equity funds suffered their longest outflows streak since 2004, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data showed.\u000a\u000aInvestors have been losing faith that President Donald Trump can deliver on his ambitious tax cut and spending campaign pledges.\u000a\u000aThe data, which track fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, showed investors pulled $2.6 billion from U.S. stocks over the last week, with tech stock funds losing $600 million, their biggest outflows in almost a year.\u000a\u000aThe S&P 500 is down more than 1 percent so far this month, having rallied almost 9 percent year-to-date, whilst U.S. tech stocks have surged over 22 percent so far this year.\u000a\u000aBut investors have grown increasingly concerned about stretched U.S. equity valuations, with Trump's inability to usher legislation through Congress raising doubts about his campaign promises to cut taxes and boost spending.\u000a\u000aLast week Trump dismantled two of his business advisory groups after several chief executives quit following his response to racially charged protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. This further eroded confidence in Trump's ability to enact his reforms.\u000a\u000aA late-September deadline is now looming for U.S. officials to raise the debt ceiling or risk default, leading investors to anticipate a volatile month.\u000a\u000a"Since late June, investors have withdrawn $30 billion from U.S. funds while adding $36 billion to the rest of the world," said BAML's analysts, citing inflows to emerging markets, Europe and Japan.\u000a\u000aWhile the European region\u2019s equity funds posted their first outflow in seven weeks, the $200 million that left is dwarfed by this year\u2019s inflows which now total $32 billion, according to the report.\u000a\u000aJapanese equities attracted $3.1 billion over the week, their biggest inflows in five months, whilst emerging markets pulled in $200 million.\u000a\u000aEmerging market equities continued to top BAML's table of cross-asset winners in 2017, returning 27.1 percent year-to-date in dollar terms.

aVLong before "The Passion of the Christ" became a runaway box office hit, raking in more than $370 million domestically since its 2004 debut, Christian films have had a spot in Hollywood history.\u000a\u000aFaith-based movies have recently enjoyed a resurrection. Audiences looking to see their own beliefs reflected on the big screen turned out in droves for films like 2014's "Heaven Is for Real" ($91.4 million), 2015's "War Room" ($67.7 million), and this year's "Miracles From Heaven" ($61.7 million).\u000a\u000aChristianity is still the most common belief system in the United States, not just the world. For example, more than two-thirds of Americans \u2014 68 percent to 75.2 percent or up to 242.72 million people \u2014 believe in Christianity, Jesus, and miracles, while up to 86 percent (or about 277.57 million people) believe in God, according to Movieguide, the biggest faith-based, family review service. In contrast to this, only 8 percent to 18 percent of America\u2019s 322.76 million people refuse to believe in God or the Jesus of the Bible.\u000a\u000aThat said, movies about Jesus Christ and movies with strong Christian and biblical moral content dominate 90 percent of the top-grossing movies worldwide, not just in Christian countries, because people have hard lives and are looking for the good, the true, and the beautiful to triumph, which usually leads them to want a savior, whether allegorical or christological.\u000a\u000aAlert: Prayer Changes Your Brain in 4 Amazing Ways\u000a\u000aA procession of Christian films paved the way for these modern-day, box-office success stories. Here, the editors of Movieguide and its publisher, Ted Baehr, have compiled for Newsmax a list of what they feel are the Top 25 Christian Movies of All Time.\u000a\u000aThe list is meant as a conversation starter, and not necessarily meant as a definitive list. The list considers the Christological, biblical content of each movie, combined with the movie\u2019s aesthetic and entertainment value, its visual or cinematic quality, its dramatic power, the cohesion and energy behind its narrative structure, its moral and spiritual acceptability for family audiences, and the moral and spiritual depth of its message and themes.\u000a\u000a1. "The King of Kings" (1927- silent), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The famous H.B. Warner played Jesus in Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s "King of Kings," still the classic of all movies about Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a2. "Quo Vadis" (1951), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: This very Christian classic places Marcus Vinicius, played by Robert Taylor, between the tyrannical Nero, played by Peter Ustinov, and the beautiful redeemed Christian Lygia, played by Deborah Kerr. The movie includes a great explanation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ by St. Peter.\u000a\u000a3. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" (2005), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," based on C. S. Lewis\u2019 popular Christian fable, tells the story of four English children who enter the land of Narnia, where they meet Aslan, the son of the Emperor-Beyond-the-Sea, who rescues the land from the evil White Witch. Despite some minor changes from the book, "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe," retains most of its Christian focus and is tremendously exciting, thrilling, and redemptive.\u000a\u000a4. "The Robe" (1953), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Starring Richard Burton, Jean Simmons, and Victor Mature, this Hollywood Cinemascope spectacle is the story of an Ancient Roman soldier, who turns to Christianity when embracing the robe of Jesus Christ.\u000a\u000a5. "Les Misrables" (1934), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: Based on the redemptive novel by Victor Hugo, "Les Misrables" tells the redeeming story of Jean Valjean who goes to prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister\u2019s child and then comes to Jesus Christ through the sacrificial love of a poor bishop. Jean becomes a new man and dedicates his life to helping others though he is pursued by the unforgiving Javert.\u000a\u000aAlso highly recommended:\u000a\u000a"Les Misrables" (2012), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -1: The Hollywood film version of the beloved musical play of Victor Hugo\u2019s novel about an ex-convict whose life is redeemed, though is still hounded by a legalistic policeman. "Les Misrables" is a brilliant adaptation of this inspiring, spiritually uplifting Christian story that beautifully depicts God\u2019s transformational powers though the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but it contains some harsh scenes showing the brokenness of humanity without God. "Les Misrables" (1998), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +1: Liam Neeson plays Jean Valjean, a reformed convict pursued his whole life by a legalistic police inspector. Literally overflowing with redemption and grace in the face of horrible legalism, rigidity, and the perils of war, this journey is wonderfully told through a near flawless script, excellent acting, great photography, and wonderful set design with moderate violence and no sex or nudity. "Les Misrables" (1995), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: +4: The magnificent movie by Claude Lelouch, "Les Misrables" is not another adaptation of Victor Hugo's redemptive story; instead, the movie is a unique re-telling of Hugo's masterpiece using Hugo's work as a metaphor for life. Henri Fortin travels through life from boxer, to prisoner, to criminal, to a man redeemed through the cruel and miserable experiences in the midst of the German cruel occupation of France during World War II.\u000a\u000a6.

"True Grit" (2010), Quality: * * * * Acceptability: -2: "True Grit," adapted from the Charles Portis novel by Joel and Ethan Coen, hews a bit more closely to the book but also pays some homage to the 1969 version starring the great John Wayne. After her father is killed in cold blood, spunky 14-year-old Presbyterian farm girl Mattie Ross hires one-eyed U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to track down the killer. "True Grit" has a lot of humor, but it also has some heart-rending moments. There are, however, some strong obscenities and profanities, and one violent scene is extreme, but the movie\u2019s overt Christian, biblical themes and powerful spirit of chivalry and justice are thoroughly stirring.\u000a\u000aTed Baehr is publisher of MOVIEGUIDE(r), a family guide to entertainment, and the chairman of The Christian Film & Television Commission\u2122.

aVA former Republican lawmaker and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations blasted President Donald Trump in an opinion piece published this week.\u000a\u000aFormer Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., wrote in The Washington Post that Trump is not a true Republican because of one main reason: he stands against having a unified nation.\u000a\u000a"We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, and our founding principle is our commitment to holding the nation together. This brought us into being just before the Civil War," Danforth wrote before citing a line from the GOP's first national convention.\u000a\u000a"That founding principle of the party is also a founding principle of the United States. Even when we were a tiny fraction of our present size and breadth, the framers of our Constitution understood the need for holding ourselves together, whatever our differences."\u000a\u000aTrump critics have criticized him for using divisive language during his campaign and during his presidency. His response to the recent violent riots demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia during which he blamed both sides \u2014 including the white supremacists who had gathered in the college town \u2014 drew anger from both sides of the aisle and even his own administration.\u000a\u000aDanforth argued that Trump does not stand for the Republican party.\u000a\u000a"We are the party of the Union, and he is the most divisive president in our history. There hasn't been a more divisive person in national politics since George Wallace," he wrote.\u000a\u000a"To my fellow Republicans: We cannot allow Donald Trump to redefine the Republican Party.\u000a\u000a"Our country needs a responsibly conservative party. But our party has been corrupted by this hateful man, and it is now in peril."

aVLONDON (AP) \u2014 Britain is set to conduct road trials of self-driving trucks, involving a "platoon" of vehicles controlled by a driver in the front.\u000a\u000aThe Department for Transport said Friday that up to three trucks will travel in convoy, connected by Wi-Fi and with braking and acceleration controlled by the lead vehicle.\u000a\u000aOfficials say the formation saves fuel and reduces carbon emissions, because the lead truck pushes air out of the way, making the others more efficient.\u000a\u000aSimilar trials have been conducted in Europe and the United States. But critics say driverless trucks are unsuited to Britain's often narrow and winding roads.\u000a\u000aAutomobile Association President Edmund King says "platooning may work on the miles of deserted freeways in Arizona or Nevada, but this is not America."

aVBy not solely condemning Nazis in the wake of the tragedy in Charlottesville, President Donald Trump opened the door for haters to brand him a "sympathizer" to the white supremacist movement, Bill O'Reilly told Newsmax TV Friday.\u000a\u000a"When you're speaking about Nazis, you can't bring in anybody else. It can't be 'Nazis and,'" O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

So that was President Trump's first mistake is that he equated behavior by Nazis in Charlottesville with behavior by the Antifas," said O'Reilly, whose latest book, "Killing England: The Brutal Struggle for American Independence," comes out Sept. 19.\u000a\u000aO'Reilly wrote earlier in the week that it's Trump's \u2014 and the country's \u2014 ignorance about Nazi history that led to the gaffe.\u000a\u000a"The historical context of the Charlottesville reaction is that mass murder was carried out by ordinary Germans while the vast majority of that population looked away out of self-interest and fear. President Trump did not understand that and it has hurt him," O'Reilly wrote then.\u000a\u000aDenounce Nazis first, then go after far-left extremists, said the former prime-time stalwart and host of "The O'Reilly Factor" on Fox News.\u000a\u000a"Then the day after, say this Antifa movement, they're becoming very, very dangerous to the country and lay out that case but separately," O'Reilly told Newmax TV. "When he didn't do it separately and he brought them both in together, that gave the Trump haters the license to brand him a sympathizer. Disgusting, despicable, it's a lie, but that's what the Trump haters did."\u000a\u000aO'Reilly was then asked about how Trump should handle Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, who came out critically of Trump's reticence to denounce the alt-right in an interview Thursday.\u000a\u000a"I would say, 'I've spoken to Gary, he's a close friend, he's doing a great job and I respect his point of view. And I've learned some lessons in this case and going forward, we're going to do it differently,'" O'Reilly said.\u000a\u000aWhether Trump takes that tack isn't as important as recognizing the what the long view is of Democrats and the media.\u000a\u000a"There's only one bottom line on Donald Trump: get him out of office; that's what's happening here," O'Reilly said. "And the media has invested in that, the far left has invested in that, the Democratic Party has invested in that.\u000a\u000a"That's a lot of people trying to get him out of office. So you're not going to get any honesty on this level. So President Trump has got to understand that. He knows his base is still with him but he's got to be very careful going forward and be as magnanimous as possible," O'Reilly said.

aVRadical leftist organizations (for example, Antifa) are having a field day maligning movement conservatives like me. They are intentionally clumping us with white nationalist and racist groups because we reject identity politics and their socialist agenda.\u000a\u000aWorse yet, many leftists are in favor of physically assaulting political opponents. Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, made these observations about this development, "There is violence on the left. The anti-fascists engage with those they oppose through physical confrontation. And that is a problem. That is an extremist\u2019s tactic. There is also bigotry on the left."\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not all \u2014 there is also ignorance on the left. It should come as no surprise that these young radicals, whose knowledge of philosophy and history wouldn\u2019t fill a bumper sticker, do not know that Italian fascism and Nazism were actually socialist movements.\u000a\u000aFor those interested in learning about fascism and Nazism and how leftists use the fascist card to intimidate conservatives, I recommend Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s new book, "The Big Lie."\u000a\u000aD\u2019Souza contends the terms "Nazi" and "fascist" have become "virtually meaningless in popular culture." To make his case, he cites various scholars, including the leading expert on fascism, Dr. A. James Gregor, Professor of Political Science Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. "Fascism."\u000a\u000aGregor has written, "is routinely attributed to people who are avowedly Christians who seek lower levels of taxation, who oppose further government regulation, who are skeptical on global warming, and who seem indifferent to the fate of endangered species." The term, "has been diluted to the point where its cognitive use has become more than suspect."\u000a\u000aFascism is Italian for "collectivism." Its adherents adopted it from "fasci"of ancient Rome which were bundles of rods carried by the lectors to symbolize the unified strength of Romans.\u000a\u000a"The first fascists," Dr. Gregor observes, "were almost all Marxists." The movement "was not conservative. It was revolutionary. Its clear intention was to destroy the social economic and political artifacts of classical liberalism."\u000a\u000aAnother distinguished historian, Stanley Payne, agrees, "The nucleus that eventually founded fascism in Italy did not stem from the right-wing nationalists but from the transformation of part of the revolutionary left."\u000a\u000aThe father of fascism, philosopher Giovanni Gentile (1875-1944), a disenchanted Marxist, believed . . . "the state and the individual is one" and the "authority of the state is not subject to negotiation." Fascism, he declared, is a "total conception of life . . . One cannot be a fascist in politics and not a fascist in school, not a fascist in one\u2019s family, not a fascist in one\u2019s work place."\u000a\u000aGentile\u2019s top pupil was Italy\u2019s most prominent post World War I socialist, Benito Mussolini, who declared "All is the state and nothing human exists outside the state." For Mussolini, Fascism was a practical form of socialism for the new century.\u000a\u000aAs for Hitler, he was a National Socialist who publicly stated "We are socialists, we are the enemies of today\u2019s capitalist system of exploitation . . . and we are determined to destroy this system under all conditions."\u000a\u000aWhile collectivism was the basic tenet of fascist and National Socialist ideologies, there was a difference: The Nazis were anti-Semitic, deemed Slovaks and Gypsies sub-human, and believed in a "mystical bond" between German blood and German soil.\u000a\u000aBefore establishing an Aryan socialist state, Hitler was determined to exterminate the Jews and to subjugate indigenous Eastern Europeans.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, the Nationalist Socialists were influenced by American Progressives who embraced the so-called science of eugenics which espoused birth control, abortion and sterilization to limit unworthy lives and "to conserve national resources for the future offspring of those worth saving, and to keep the superior creatures close to nature in order to keep them pure."\u000a\u000aIn "The Big Lie," D\u2019Souza reveals that the charges made against conservatives and members of the Republican Party apply to radical leftists. These self-styled leftist "opponents of hate are the actual practitioners of the politics of hate. Though a process of transference leftists blame their victims for being and doing what they themselves are and do. In a sick inversion, the real fascists in American politics masquerade as anti-fascists and accuse the real anti-fascists of being fascists."\u000a\u000aGeorge J. Marlin, a former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is the author of "The American Catholic Voter: Two Hundred Years of Political Impact," and "Christian Persecutions in the Middle East: A 21st Century Tragedy."

aVFEMA Director Brock Long said Friday he is concerned that people are not heeding evacuation warnings that are being posted as Hurricane Harvey picks up strength on its way into Texas.\u000a\u000a"Texas is about to have a very significant disaster," Long told CNN's "New Day" program. "If they have not [evacuated] their window to evacuate is rapidly coming to a close."\u000a\u000aIf people refuse to heed the warnings, Long stressed, "that's on them. The bottom line is they need to elevate and get into a structure that can withstand potentially category 3 winds from a hurricane."\u000a\u000aLong said he is specifically "very worried" about Harvey's storm surge and the potential for coastal flooding.\u000a\u000aThere will be two aspects to the flooding expected from Hurricane Harvey, Long told CNN.\u000a\u000a"The storm surge has the highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most of damage," said Long. "On top of that, we are looking at a significant inland flood event over many counties, which is going to be a sizable event."\u000a\u000a"The first is the coastal flood inundation which refer to as storm surge," he said. "This is wind-driven water that's going to encroach on the coastal barrier islands and go up the back bay inland areas, which is the most dangerous."\u000a\u000aThen, over the next five days, there will be "copious amounts of rainfall, up to 25 inches possibly in some areas, with isolated higher amounts," said Long. "This is going to be a slow-developing major disaster event for the state of Texas."\u000a\u000aThe federal government cannot issue a mandatory evacuation order, said Long, as that must come on the local level.\u000a\u000a"In Texas, local county officials are responsible for issuing evacuations," said Long. "I do not have the authority to issue any evacuation whatsoever."\u000a\u000aLong, the former head of Alabama's Emergency Management Agency, said what causes him the most concern is the way Harvey is strengthening.\u000a\u000a"The storm is getting stronger, the pressure is dropping, all indications from the National Hurricane Center that this is going to be the first major hurricane the nation has dealt with since 2005," said Long. "Right now FEMA is already in the state of Texas. We have pre-positioned incident management teams, life-saving, life-sustaining commodities. We have search and rescue teams in the state and we're ready to go to support our state partners."\u000a\u000aLong said most likely in upcoming hours, President Donald Trump will start getting requests for presidential disaster declarations coming from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\u000a\u000a"As soon as those come up, we're able to, the president has the ability, the authority to sign off on those to mobilize our support to the state government," Long said.\u000a\u000aHe said he's been in continuous contact with Trump and federal officials, and that the president is "giving me full authority in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the federal assets down to the state and local level as soon as we're called upon."\u000a\u000aAlso appearing on MSNBC, Long stressed that Harvey will be a "disaster."\u000a\u000a"What that means is your normal daily routine is about to be disrupted for multiple days, infrastructure and power will go off," Long said. "People need to be making final preparations to you know, to expect those kinds of things to happen. It's going to take time for the infrastructure to come back online, but we're prepared to support that effort."\u000a\u000aThe United States has not been hit by a major hurricane since 2005, said Long, and in many cases, people have never experienced the threat of a storm surge.\u000a\u000a"It's the hazard associated with hurricanes that have the highest potential to cause the most amount of damage and kill the most amount of people," said Long. "Nobody lives to talk about their experience with storm surge."

Not anymore.Groups like Friends of Abe, a conclave of Hollywood and entertainment professionals, are thriving. Actors like the late Charlton Heston, an outspoken Republican and advocate of gun freedom, helped pave the way.One caveat here: The conservative-leaning celebrities listed here may not be going to a Ted Cruz rally anytime soon. They are better described as Hollywood contrarians; they don\u2019t typically advocate any hardcore political agenda.Instead, they are for a new openness in Hollywood, and don\u2019t accept the old industry standard that one has to be a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party to find career advancement.Oftentimes these conservatives are more libertarian than traditional, button-down Republicans.Whatever their stripes, they are a unique and exciting breed changing Hollywood and, we hope, America for the better.Here, Newsmax has compiled a list of 50 influential leaders of this cultural minority who have bucked Hollywood\u2019s liberal establishment and thrived.\u2014 The actor and director famously trashed President Barack Obama in 2012 at the Republican National Convention and stirred up a firestorm of liberal griping with his patriotic film, "American Sniper."\u2014 The star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" series of hit movies is not shy about voicing his Christian conservative beliefs. He backed Sen. John McCain's presidential bid in 2008 and recently told evangelist Pat Robertson, "I have surrendered my life to Jesus Christ."\u2014 The "Home Improvement" actor once told Sean Hannity he is a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d who \u201clike[s] problem solving."

aVThe women who made this year's list of 100 Most Influential Republican Women often have the word \u201cfirst\u201d next to their names: First female senator from their respective states, first Hispanic female governor, first woman combat pilot, first lady.\u000a\u000aIndeed, they are leading GOP voices at a time when the party is trying to reach women voters through a variety of channels \u2014 politics, media, business, and academics.\u000a\u000aThese women are self-styled pioneers who, despite their varied public roles, share a core set of conservative principles and beliefs.\u000a\u000a1. Betsy DeVos \u2014 A businesswoman and generous GOP donor, DeVos won confirmation as education secretary after a bruising and partisan Senate fight, which President Donald Trump called a "very tough trial and a very unfair trial."

Dina Powell \u2014 A former Goldman Sachs executive and State Department aide under Bush, Powell serves as deputy national security adviser to Trump.

Kellyanne Conway \u2014 A ubiquitous GOP pollster, Conway led Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to a surprise win and now serves in the White House as a counselor to the president.

aVThe Republican National Committee officially denounced white supremacists in a formal resolution on Friday, The Hill reported.\u000a\u000aThe resolution came as many party members remained uncomfortable with President Donald Trump's remarks following the violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the Hill.\u000a\u000aThe resolution says "the racist beliefs of Nazis, the KKK, white supremacists and other like-minded groups are completely inconsistent with the Republican Party's platform" and "have no fruitful place in the United States."\u000a\u000aBill Palatucci, an RNC committeeman from New Jersey, sponsored the resolution. He maintained it was important for the RNC to make it clear that it condemns white supremacists.\u000a\u000a"It's always important to quickly and clearly denounce racism and bigotry whenever we see it," he said. "As a member of the RNC, I wanted no ambiguity that the organization condemned these white supremacists," Palatucci told the Hill.

aVHurricane Harvey was hours away from lashing the Texas coast on Friday with winds of up to 156 miles per hour and 13-foot ocean surges as the most powerful storm in over a decade bore down on the mainland United States.\u000a\u000aHarvey strengthened to a powerful Category 4 hurricane with cities from northern Mexico to Louisiana bracing for flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was expected to hit land near Corpus Christi, Texas, around 9 p.m. CDT (0200 GMT) then stall and dump over 3 feet (90 cm) of rain in areas of the Texas coast and parts of Louisiana as it lingers for days.\u000a\u000aWhile thousands fled the expected devastating flooding and destruction, many residents defied mandatory evacuation orders and stocked up on food, fuel and sandbags.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re suggesting if people are going to stay here, mark their arm with a Sharpie pen with their name and Social Security number," Rockport Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios told reporters Friday, according to media reports. "We hate to talk about things like that. It's not something we like to do but it\u2019s the reality. People don\u2019t listen."\u000a\u000aAs many as 5.8 million people were believed to be in the storm's path.\u000a\u000aIn Corpus Christi, a city of 320,000 under voluntary evacuation, strengthening winds buffeted the few trucks and cars that continued to circulate on the streets. The storm toppled wooden roadwork signs and littered the streets with pieces of palm trees as white caps rocked sailboats in their docks.\u000a\u000aAbout 85 miles (137 km) north in Victoria, Mayor Paul Polasek told CNN he estimated that 60 percent to 65 percent of the town\u2019s 65,000 residents defied the mandatory evacuation order.\u000a\u000aJose Rengel, a 47-year-old who works in construction, said he was one of the few people in Jamaica Beach in Galveston that did not heed a voluntary evacuation order.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll the shops are empty,\u201d he said as the sky turned black and rain fell. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tornado went in and swept everything up.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbout 20,000 passengers were riding out the storm aboard three cruise ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\u000a\u000aAs a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, Harvey could uproot trees, destroy homes and disrupt utilities for days. If it maintains its intensity, it would be the first major hurricane to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.\u000a\u000aThe storm was about 45 miles (70 km) off Corpus Christi and packing winds of 130 mph (215 kph), the NHC said. The NHC's latest tracking model shows the storm sitting southwest of Houston for more than a day, giving the nation's fourth most populous city a double dose of rain and wind.\u000a\u000a"Life-threatening and devastating flooding expected near the coast due to heavy rainfall and storm surge," the NHC said.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump, facing the first large-scale natural disaster of his presidency, on Friday tweeted: "I am closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey ... BE SAFE!" Earlier, a White House official said the president was considering a request to issue an emergency declaration, providing federal disaster relief.\u000a\u000aLouisiana and Texas declared states of disaster, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare.\u000a\u000aThe city of Houston warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches (60 cm) of rain over several days.\u000a\u000aHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner advised city residents not to leave en masse, saying "no evacuation orders have been issued for the city." Chaotic traffic from a rushed evacuation in 2005 with Hurricane Rita proved tragic. "Calm and care!" he said in a tweet.\u000a\u000aGASOLINE PRICES SPIKE\u000a\u000aGasoline stations on the south Texas coast were running out of fuel as thousands of residents fled the region. U.S. gasoline prices spiked as the storm shut down 22 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production, according to the U.S. government.\u000a\u000aAt a Willis, Texas, station, about 50 miles (77 km) north of Houston, Corey Martinez, 40, was heading to Dallas from his Corpus Christi home.\u000a\u000a"It has been pretty stressful. We're just trying to get ahead of the storm," he said. "We've never been through a hurricane before."\u000a\u000aMore than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and others have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms.\u000a\u000aConcern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to their highest in four months, before profit taking pulled back prices. Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline margins hit their strongest levels in five years for this time of year.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. government said it would make emergency stockpiles of crude available if needed to plug disruptions. It has regularly used them to dampen the impact of previous storms on energy supplies.

aVKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 The number of people killed in an attack on a Shiite mosque in the Afghan capital during Friday prayers rose to at least 28 \u2014 up from 20 \u2014 including women and children, the chief of Kabul's hospitals said Saturday. Meanwhile, hundreds took part in the burial of two dozen victims in the mosque compound.\u000a\u000aTwo assailants blew themselves up and another two were shot dead by Afghan security forces, according to police. Kabul hospital chief Mohammad Salim Rasouli said more than 50 people were wounded in the attack that went on for hours.\u000a\u000aThe Interior Ministry said four of the dead were police.\u000a\u000aHundreds of family members, relatives and local people participated in the burial of about two dozen victims inside the mosque compound Saturday.\u000a\u000aSayed Jan Agha, 34, lost his mother and an aunt in the attack. He said that he tried several times to get into the mosque and rescue his mother and other relatives, but security forces prevented him.\u000a\u000a"My mother was martyred while she was trying to come down from the second floor, she was shot right at the stairs," said Agha.\u000a\u000aAgha said his aunt called him and asked for help while she was bleeding, but no one could help her while the battle was going on between the attackers and security forces and she died from her wounds, he said.\u000a\u000aThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest to target Afghanistan's minority Shiites. The Taliban condemned the violence, with a spokesman for the militants, Zabihullah Mujahid, telling The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the group had nothing to do with it.\u000a\u000aPresident Ashraf Ghani condemned the violence and said the militants were turning to attacking places of worship because they were losing on the battlefield. He urged Islamic clerics everywhere to condemn the bloodshed.\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in a statement condemned the attack. It said at least two attackers wearing police uniforms stormed the mosque while several hundred worshippers, including many women and children, attended Friday prayers. One assailant detonated his suicide vest outside the mosque, while another continued inside, indiscriminately killing and wounding people, the statement said.\u000a\u000a"This latest in a series of attacks targeting members of the Shi'a community at worship has no possible justification," said Toby Lanzer, the U.N. Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and acting head of UNAMA. "Such attacks directed against congregations and places of worship are serious violations of international law that may amount to war crimes."\u000a\u000aTerrified worshippers endured about four harrowing hours of gunfire and explosions before the four attackers were killed.\u000a\u000aThe Islamic State said in a statement that it had deployed two attackers to the mosque. There was no immediate explanation for the contradictory number of attackers.\u000a\u000aSecurity forces surrounded the mosque in the northern Kabul neighborhood but did not initially enter to prevent further casualties to the many worshippers inside, police said. Later, as police tried to advance, one of the attackers set off an explosion that forced them to withdraw.\u000a\u000aThe cleric who was performing the prayers was among the dead, said Mir Hussain Nasiri, a member of Afghanistan's Shiite clerical council. The gunmen had taken over both the cavernous prayer hall for the men and the separate, second-floor prayer area for the women, he said.\u000a\u000aThe mosque could accommodate up to 1,000 people, Nasiri added.\u000a\u000aWhen police initially tried to get inside, they discovered the militants had blocked the door leading to the second floor, turning the women upstairs into hostages, Nasiri said.\u000a\u000aLast month, the Sunni-dominated Islamic State group attacked the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul and then warned Shiites in Afghanistan that their mosques would be targeted. Sunni extremists consider Shiites to be heretics.\u000a\u000aWithin days of that, IS also took responsibility for a suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in western Herat province that left 32 people dead.

aVFor many Republicans, what matters most about Donald Trump is that he's demonstrated resolve against the enemy \u2014 not the Islamic State or the Taliban, but the media.\u000a\u000aThe media has become for the right what the Soviet Union was during the Cold War \u2014 a common, unifying adversary of overwhelming importance. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, religious conservatives and libertarians could agree that, whatever their other differences, godless communism had to be resisted. This commitment was the glue of the GOP coalition, and the basic price of admission to conservatism.\u000a\u000aNow, a policy of containment, preferably rollback, of the mainstream media occupies that central role. Trump may not be delivering on his agenda, but he's a righteous, unyielding warrior against the media. And this is the one nonnegotiable. To put it in terms of the famous Isaiah Berlin essay, the fox knows many things; the hedgehog knows one thing \u2014 CNN sucks.\u000a\u000aThe right's hostility toward the media is long-standing. In fact, no one has improved on what Spiro Agnew said in a famous speech in Des Moines, Iowa, in November 1969, or even really said anything new.\u000a\u000aAgnew complained that after President Richard Nixon gave a televised speech, his words were instantly subjected to "querulous criticism." He pointed out that the media is in a bubble, living "in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington, D.C., or New York City." And he wanted to limit the power of this "small and unelected elite."\u000a\u000aNewt Gingrich demonstrated the transformative potential of theatrical attacks on the media in his show-stopping performances at two South Carolina primary debates in 2012. He wouldn't have won the state without them.\u000a\u000aTrump's insight was basically, "What if every day were like that?" After witnessing the fate of two candidates who got savage coverage in the general election, despite being a media darling in the case of John McCain and being an earnest, well-meaning man in the case of Mitt Romney, Republican voters were ready for harsher stuff.\u000a\u000aTrump had long had his own problems with the media, namely that it wasn't nearly favorable enough to Donald Trump. With his talents as a showman, his taste for combat and his instinct for what energizes an audience, he was ideally suited to transfer his long-developed personal sensitivity to slights from reporters to the ideological realm of Republican presidential politics. In large part, he rode his mutual enmity with the media to the White House.\u000a\u000aIt remains a lifeline. Most commentators saw Trump angrily saying indefensible things about Charlottesville at the news conference last week; most Republicans saw him gamely standing his ground in front a group of braying reporters. At his rally in Phoenix, Trump upped the rhetorical ante and used the media's lack of credibility to try to undermine the critique of his Charlottesville remarks.\u000a\u000aIt helps him that the press is, indeed, worse than ever before. As the media environment has fractured, organizations feel less obligation to try to cultivate a broader audience. And as politics becomes more culturally charged, the divide between the heartland and the coasts where the media lives and works becomes important.\u000a\u000aThen there's the reaction to Trump himself. Since he is genuinely outrageous, especially to coastal sensibilities, the media feels justified in its unremittingly harsh coverage.\u000a\u000aThe war with Trump also serves the twin goals of self-referentiality and ratings. CNN at times appears to be a network devoted to covering things that the president says about the network. Prior to Trump's rally in Phoenix, CNN relentlessly promoted the event. Then it broadcast the whole thing and devoted the rest of the night to commentators pronouncing themselves outraged and dismayed. At the end of the day, what had really happened? Nothing much, but at least something entertaining had filled the air.\u000a\u000aTrump might well have been hate-watching much of it, pleased somewhere beneath his anger and disgust that he had, once again, proved to have the right enemy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRich Lowry is editor of the National Review and author of the best-seller "Lincoln Unbound: How an Ambitious Young Railsplitter Saved the American Dream \u2014 and How We Can Do It Again.

aVSome Americans are misguidedly tearing down the United States, focusing too much on its imperfect history and forgetting its greatness, Michael Reagan, the son of President Ronald Reagan, told Newsmax TV on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aReagan was asked about his reaction to the decision by Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh to remove all Confederate moments from public spaces following the deadly white power rally in Charlottesville, by Miranda Khan on Newsmax's "America Talks Now."\u000a\u000a"It was her decision to make but I believe it was made because of the fear of riots in Baltimore and statues being torn down as they were last night in other cities back in the east coast. So it's really out of fear at this point and time.\u000a\u000a"It's really unfortunate to the point that I think most of these people who are acting and reacting like this have never studied the history of the United States, really study it, study who these people are.\u000a\u000a"I doubt if any of them know how to spell the names of the people on the statue and it just shows what's happened with our education system in America. We're raising people to hate parts of America instead of raising people to find ways to love parts of America."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Lee and Stonewall Jackson Monument and the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000a"The fact is we've changed over the years. That is part of our history. And if we keep on tearing down our history what will our history be?" Reagan told Khan.\u000a\u000a"The problem with the media today is they believe history began this morning when they woke up. And that's sad that we've done that.\u000a\u000a"I remember playing golf with a young man a couple of years ago when I was headed to Normandy to raise the American flag at the American cemetery at Normandy. A 28-year-old young man looked at me and didn't know why there was an American cemetery at Normandy."\u000a\u000aAnd during a trip to Germany, Reagan added, "a kid I ran into in Berlin... thought the Americans put up the Berlin Wall to keep the communists out of their sector."\u000a\u000a"We sit there and we don't educate people on what's great about America," he said. "We try to find those areas of America that maybe we don't agree with and then you see what's happening in the country and the world today where we grow up angry, mad and what have you.

aVA U.S. Democratic senator on Friday questioned the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s quick approval of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods Market Inc. this week, less than three months after the $13.7 billion deal was announced.\u000a\u000aThe FTC said on Wednesday that it had ended its antitrust investigation without seeking a second request for additional information on a deal that has sent shock waves through the grocery industry.\u000a\u000aSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement on Friday that she was concerned about the FTC\u2019s decision to \u201cnot fully review\u201d the deal, which was announced on June 16.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmazon\u2019s increased access to data on consumers and their behavior, and its dominance in internet retail sales, raises questions about whether this merger harms consumers and suppresses competition,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aKlobuchar said she would ask the FTC to explain why it made such a quick decision.\u000a\u000aSeattle-based Amazon declined to comment. The FTC did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aAfter getting the approval of the FTC and Whole Foods shareholders this week, Amazon said on Thursday that it planned to complete the acquisition on Monday and simultaneously introduce lower prices on some grocery staples.\u000a\u000aThe world\u2019s biggest online retailer also said it planned to start selling some Whole Foods-branded products on its website and offer incentives to its Prime members at Whole Foods stores.\u000a\u000aShares of major grocery stores fell sharply on Thursday on fears that Amazon\u2019s move would spark a new round of price wars in the industry, but they recovered somewhat on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe approval was one of the first major decisions by the Trump administration\u2019s FTC. The commission has five seats but just two members at present, and Trump has not yet nominated anyone to fill the remaining three positions.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, Reuters reported that President Donald Trump\u2019s leading choice to run the agency was Washington lawyer Joseph Simons, who was a top FTC official under President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aA partner at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, Simons would replace acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who has been running the FTC since January.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate still has not approved Makan Delrahim, Trump's choice to head the Justice Department's antitrust division.\u000a\u000aCongressional Democrats in July proposed taking a harder line on mergers and strengthening antitrust laws to give regulators more tools to block such deals or revisit those that were previously approved. "Growing corporate influence and consolidation has led to reductions in competition, choice for consumers, and bargaining power for workers," as well as higher prices, they said.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration is reviewing a number of mergers, including AT&T's Inc. proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc., the owner of HBO, Warner Bros and news network CNN. The Justice Department and AT&T have been discussing potential conditions in recent weeks.

aVRussia special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had been part of an effort to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\u000a\u000aThe report was based on "people familiar with the matter."\u000a\u000aThe effort to obtain Clinton's hacked emails was disclosed by the Journal in June \u2014 and it was led by Peter Smith, a longtime Republican activist who died in May. He was 81.\u000a\u000aSmith, in correspondence and conversations with his colleagues, "portrayed Mr. Flynn as an ally in those efforts and implied that other senior Trump campaign officials were coordinating with him, which they have denied," the Journal reported.\u000a\u000aSmith also named Flynn's consulting firm \u2014 Flynn Intel Group, which has since been disbanded \u2014 and his son, Michael G. Flynn, in the correspondence and conversations.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Journal in May, Smith said he believed that as many as 33,000 emails that Clinton said were personal and had been deleted from her private server had been obtained by hackers.\u000a\u000aHe made contact with what he said were five groups of hackers in the last months of last year's presidential campaign. Two of the groups, Smith believed, consisted of Russians who claimed to have Clinton's emails.\u000a\u000a"We knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government," Smith told the Journal in the interview.\u000a\u000aThere was no evidence that Clinton's server was ever hacked.\u000a\u000aAccording to the report, Mueller's investigators were seeking to determine whether the elder Flynn was involved in Smith's effort to obtain the hacked Clinton documents. At the time, Flynn was a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump fired Flynn in February amid concerns about his disclosures to Vice President Mike Pence about his Russia connections. A lawyer for Mr. Flynn and a lawyer for his son declined to comment, the Journal reported.\u000a\u000aPeter Carr, a Mueller spokesperson, declined to comment.\u000a\u000aIn addition, U.S. officials "with knowledge of the intelligence" told the Journal that investigators also have examined reports that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from the Clinton server and providing them to Flynn via an intermediary.\u000a\u000aHowever, the Journal noted that "it is isn't known if those hackers are ones" Smith approached in his effort.\u000a\u000aOn May 14, about 10 days after his Journal interview, Smith asphyxiated himself in a hotel room in Rochester, Minn., according to local authorities.\u000a\u000aHis body was found in a hotel located across the street the Mayo Clinic, according to a medical examiner's report.\u000a\u000aA Smith associate told the Journal that he had recently visited the clinic.\u000a\u000aIn a note found near Smith's body, he apologized and said that "no foul play whatsoever" had occurred with his death, authorities told the Journal.

aVAll decent Americans have an obligation to condemn the violent bigotry of the Nazi and KKK demonstrators in Charlottesville or wherever else they spew their poisonous and threatening rhetoric. But President Donald Trump has a special obligation to single out for condemnation, and distance himself from, individuals and groups that claim \u2014 even if falsely \u2014 to speak in his name, as the racist provocateurs in Charlottesville did.\u000a\u000aDavid Duke, the notorious bigot, told reporters that white nationalists were working to \u201cfulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\u201d Richard Spencer, the founder of the Daily Stormer (a not so coded homage to the Nazi publication Der Sturmer) attributed the growth of the ultra-nationalist alt-right to the Trump presidency:\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously the alt-right has come very far in the past two years in terms of public exposure\u2026is Donald Trump one of the major causes of that? Of course.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump initially responded as follows: \u201cWe must ALL be united and condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America.\u201d But then, following the car ramming that killed a peaceful protestor, President Trump made the following statement: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump\u2019s inclusion of the words \u201cviolence on many sides\u201d \u2014 which seemed improvised \u2014 suggested to some a moral equivalence between the Nazis and the KKK, on the one hand, and those protesting and resisting them, on the other hand.\u000a\u000aTrump denied that he was suggesting any such equivalence and made the following statement: \u201cRacism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut then a day later he seemed to double down on his attempt to be even handed in his comments about the \u201cmany sides\u201d of this conflict. He pointed to \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d implying that Nazis and Klansmen could be \u201cfine,\u201d because their protests were \u201cvery legal.\u201d Then he denounced \u201calt-left\u201d groups that were \u201cvery, very violent.\u201d Once again he blamed \u201cboth sides,\u201d and asked rhetorically, \u201cwhat about the \u2018alt-left,\u2019 that as you say, came charging at the alt-right? Don\u2019t they have any semblance of guilt?\u201d\u000a\u000aDavid Duke immediately praised President Trump\u2019s condemnation of the \u201calt-left,\u201d thanking him \u201cfor your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.\u201d\u000a\u000aFinally (though nothing this president ever tweets is final) President Trump praised the anti-racist \u201cprotesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is against this background that the president\u2019s back-and-forth statements must be evaluated.\u000a\u000aEven if it were true \u2014 and the evidence is to the contrary \u2014 that Black Lives Matter and Antifa were as blameworthy for Charlottesville as the Nazis and KKK, it would still be incumbent on President Trump to focus his condemnation especially on the violent racist right that claims to speak on his behalf. The hard left \u2014 which does, in part, include some violent and bigoted elements \u2014 does not purport to speak on the president\u2019s behalf and does not claim to be trying to \u201cfulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\u201d To the contrary, they oppose everything he stands for. This situation poses a delicate dilemma for President Trump. He has denounced the ideology of the violent racists on the alt-right who claim to be acting in his name \u2014 not quickly or forcefully enough. And he has declared his opposition to \u201cracism\u201d and specifically to \u201cthose who cause violence in its name,\u201d who he has called \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cthugs.\u201d He specifically included within these categories the \u201cKKK, Neo-Nazis [and] White Supremacists,\u201d the very groups that purport to speak in his name.\u000a\u000aWhy is that not enough? Why should he not at the same time condemn the alt-left for its violence? These are reasonable questions that require nuanced answers. Let me try to provide some.\u000a\u000aI have long believed that it is the special responsibility of decent conservatives to expose, condemn, and marginalize hard-right extremists and bigots. William Buckley showed the way when he refused to defend Patrick Buchanan against charges that what he had said amounted to anti-Semitism. Other decent conservatives followed Buckley\u2019s lead, and marginalized anti-Semites and racists who expressed bigotry in the false name of conservatism.\u000a\u000aI also believe that it is the special responsibility of decent liberals to do the same with regard to hard-left bigoted extremists. I must acknowledge, as a liberal, that we have not done as good a job as decent conservatives have done. Perhaps this is because hard-left extremists often march under banners of benevolence, whereas hard-right extremists tend not to hide their malevolence.\u000a\u000aConsider, for example, Antifa, the radical hard-left group, some of whose members violently confronted the Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville. As reported by The New York Times, the organization is comprised of a \u201cdiverse collection of anarchists, communists and socialists\u201d with its \u201cantecedents in Germany and Italy.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to The Times, \u201cIts adherents express disdain for mainstream liberal politics\u201d and support \u201cdirect action\u201d by which they mean \u201cusing force and violence,\u201d rather than free speech and civil disobedience. Their leaders claim that violence is necessary because \u201cit\u2019s full-on war.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor is this merely rhetoric. On university campuses, particularly at Berkeley, \u201cblack-clad protesters, some of whom identified themselves as Antifa, smashed windows, threw gasoline bombs and broke into campus buildings, causing $100,000 in damage.\u201d They model themselves on the \u201cWeathermen\u201d of the 1970s, who were responsible for numerous acts of violence.\u000a\u000aThey claim to be using counter-violence in defense against the violence of Neo-Nazi and Klansmen, but that is not true. They also use violence to shut down speakers with whose worldviews they disagree; they include not only right-wing extremists, but also mainstream conservatives, moderate Zionists, and even some liberals. They reject dialogue in favor of intimidation, and force.\u000a\u000aAs a liberal, I will not give these hard-left violent bigots a pass. It is true that the Nazis and KKK are currently more dangerous in terms of physical violence than hard-left groups. (It is also true that the most violent groups by far are radical Islamic terrorists, who are not the targets of Antifa protests.) But the violence of the racist right (and radical jihadists) must not lead us to ignore the reality that Antifa and its radical allies pose real danger to the future of our nation, because of their increasing influence on university campuses where our future leaders are being educated. The recent events in Charlottesville and elsewhere have made them heroes among some mainstream liberals, who are willing to excuse their anti-liberal bigotry because they are on the barricades against fascism.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s far too easy to self-righteously condemn your political enemies when they step (or leap) over the line to bigotry and violence. It\u2019s far more difficult to condemn those who share your wing, whether left or right, but who go too far. But that is what morality and decency require, as Buckley taught us.\u000a\u000aSo President Trump must stop being even handed in his condemnations. He should focus his condemnation on extreme right-wing bigots who speak and act in his name, and leave it to those of us on the left to focus our condemnation on left-wing extremists and bigots.\u000a\u000aYou can follow Alan Dershowitz on Twitter (@AlanDersh) and Facebook (AlanMDershowitz).\u000a\u000aProfessor Alan Dershowitz is the author of "Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law" and most recently, "Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters."

aVU.S. officials are investigating a mystery in Cuba and are trying to determine if sonic weapons were used against diplomats at homes provided to them by the Cuban government, leaving at least 16 with serious injuries.\u000a\u000aThe State Department said Thursday that at least 16 Americans were injured, and an investigation is ongoing to determine the perpetrator, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aDiplomats started complaining about hearing loss, nausea symptoms, headaches, to balance disorders starting in late 2016, CBS News reported. U.S. and Canadian diplomats working in country's capital of Havana have been diagnosed with conditions including mild traumatic brain injury and possible damage to the central nervous system.\u000a\u000aSenior State Department officials told CNN that they believe sophisticated devices that operated outside the range of audible sound were deployed either inside or outside diplomats' residences in Havana.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental factors or human error in surveillance also may be to blame for the injuries, CNN noted.\u000a\u000a"There's 100 percent certainty that American diplomats were under Cuban surveillance. There's nowhere near that certainty that the Cubans were aiming sonic weapons at American diplomats. It could be harassment, but it's kind of weird," James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN, explaining his theory that surveillance equipment "screwed up."\u000a\u000aThe State Department told CBS News that even though they don't know a source of the attacks, it reminded Cuban authorities of their responsibility to protect diplomats. The U.S. expelled two Cuban embassy officials on May 23, the network wrote.\u000a\u000a"We hold the Cuban authorities responsible for finding out who is carrying out these health attacks on not just our diplomats but, as you've seen now, there are other cases with other diplomats involved," Rex Tillerson, the U.S. secretary of state, said earlier, CBS News noted.\u000a\u000aCuba rejected the idea that they have been involved in attacking Americans earlier this month, stating, according to CBS News, that it "has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception."\u000a\u000aDr. Hung Jeffrey Kim, a neurologist at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, told CNN that the diplomats were likely exposed to low frequency sound because it can travel much farther than ultrasound.\u000a\u000aNational Institutes of Health toxicologist Dr. Scott Masten told CNN that, "At certain amplitude infrasound can cause physiological effects -- it can change heart rate, respiratory rates, blood pressure."

"That was the reason something happened.\u000a\u000a"Charlottesville had 18 months of Democratic debate. They had a vote in the city council about the Robert E. Lee statue.\u000a\u000a"People can differ on it," Kristol said. "They had differed on it.\u000a\u000a"They had resolved it, to the credit of the city of Charlottesville peacefully \u2014 and then these troublemakers sought to cause trouble by coming.\u000a\u000a"The alt-left types, the Antifa types, obviously saw an opportunity to cause trouble themselves, but there's no moral equivalence here," Kristol told Tucker.\u000a\u000a"The president is being disingenuous and his defenders in my opinion are being disingenuous."

aVFormer House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said Friday that Robert Mueller's Russia investigators will look for "something of value" to determine criminality involving former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\u000a\u000a"They can they determine that in any exchange between Gen. Flynn and any of his foreign contacts he was seeking something of value for the campaign," Rogers, the former Michigan Republican congressman, told Wolf Blitzer on CNN.\u000a\u000a"That tips the scale for a criminal matter, if they can find that."\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mueller's investigators were probing any role Flynn might have had in trying to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from Russian hackers.\u000a\u000aThe Journal's report was based on "people familiar with the matter."\u000a\u000aAnother scenario Rogers proposed was that Mueller's probe would also "look for promises of other things, meaning, 'If you give me this, I'll do this for you later.'\u000a\u000a"If they can make those determinations, now, it rises to the level of criminally," he told Blitzer. "If not, there is not a lot there there.\u000a\u000a"Even this talk of collusion is not necessarily a crime," he explained. "You can talk to a foreign government. You can get their input.\u000a\u000a"You can do all of those things without being illegal.\u000a\u000a"What they're going to center on is the finances of this \u2014 and promises that may have been made \u2014 and anything of value not directly money-related that may have been asked for by the Russians or by Russian intelligence."
