VAn increasing number of people have been sickened by eating papaya now traced to a farm located in southern Mexico, U.S. public health officials said Monday in an update on the outbreak first reported more than two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aSalmonella has now sickened 109 people in 16 states and 35 were serious enough to be hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its web page dedicated to the outbreak. One person in New York City died.\u000a\u000aPapaya traced to the Carica de Campeche farm in Campeche, Mexico, appears to be the likely source, the FDA said. The farm is located on the Gulf of Mexico side of the Yucatan Peninsula.\u000a\u000aThe company did not immediately respond to an email and phones went unanswered on Tuesday. A storm warning was posted for the area as Tropical Storm Franklin was making its way across the Yucatan Peninsula.\u000a\u000aPapayas from the Carica de Campeche farm tested positive for five different strains of salmonella bacteria, which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and fever. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.\u000a\u000aCases in New York nearly tripled to 36 since the last report on July 21 and New Jersey cases have more than doubled to 26. Virginia has had 11 cases, Pennsylvania seven and Maryland has had six.\u000a\u000aConnecticut and Minnesota each have four cases, and Massachusetts has had three.\u000a\u000aIowa, Kentucky, North Carolina and Oklahoma have reported two cases and Delaware, Louisiana Michigan and Wisconsin have had one each.\u000a\u000aThe FDA said it is working with Mexican food safety authorities to conduct inspections and other follow up activities.\u000a\u000aThe Campeche farm has been added to an import alert which allows FDA field personnel to stop fresh produce from entering the U.S. from the farm until it's proven to have resolved issues that caused the bacterial contamination. It was not immediately clear how the papaya was contaminated, an FDA spokesman said.\u000a\u000a"The investigation is continuing and we'll post more information when it's available," said Peter Cassell.\u000a\u000aThe CDC said laboratory evidence using genetic testing has connected some of the illnesses to papaya from the farm.\u000a\u000aSo far the Caribena, Cavi and Valery brands of maradol papayas have been recalled but the CDC now recommends that consumers not eat, restaurants not serve, and retailers not sell maradol papayas from Mexico.

aVResearch conducted for the Democracy Fund\u2019s Voter Study Group found that 84 percent of voters believe that accepting people of diverse racial and religious backgrounds is important to being truly American.[1]\u000a\u000aThree other items also were viewed as important by more than 80 percent of voters: respecting American political institutions and laws (89 percent), having American citizenship (88 percent), and speaking English (83 percent).\u000a\u000aAt the other end of the spectrum, only 18 percent think that being of European heritage or descent is important. Seventy-four percent (74 percent) disagree.\u000a\u000aJust over half believe that being born in America (53 percent) or living here most of your life (54 percent) is important. Over 40 percent disagree on those points.\u000a\u000aThe survey did not ask about what professors Sid Milkis and Marc Landy call the "American Creed." They believe, "No other country has a set of key principles and statements to which its citizens adhere to the same degree that Americans adhere to the principles of 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'"[2]\u000a\u000aHowever, while the survey did not ask about it directly, the Democracy Fund's finding that American voters value diverse opinions over a European heritage is consistent with that creed. In my latest book, "Politics Has Failed: America Will Not," I describe that creed as a belief that we all have the right to do what we want with our own lives so long as we don\u2019t interfere with the rights of others to do the same. That creed developed in the popular culture and formed the foundation for our political institutions.\u000a\u000aThroughout our nation\u2019s history, the popular culture has led the way, and political institutions have followed. In fact, after the War for Independence began, the Continental Congress waited 443 days to issue the Declaration of Independence. By then, the colonies had already achieved what has been called "de facto independence."[3]\u000a\u000aScott Rasmussen\u2019s Number of the Day is published by Ballotpedia.

aVLONDON (AP) \u2014 A former British spy chief says parents should let kids spend more time online so they will learn vital cyber-skills, countering the conventional parenting advice.\u000a\u000aRobert Hannigan, ex-director of government electronic surveillance agency GCHQ, challenges "the assumption that time online or in front of a screen is life wasted."\u000a\u000aWriting in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph newspaper, Hannigan said: "We need young people to explore this digital world just as they explore the physical world."\u000a\u000aHannigan, who stepped down earlier this year, says Britain desperately needs more computer scientists and engineers, and one way to produce them is for children to learn "through seeing and doing online."\u000a\u000aHe tells parents unable to drag their children away from screens: "Do not despair. Your poor parenting may be helping them and saving the country."

aVAlong with aerobic and strength training, stretching is an important part of every workout routine. But many people make the mistake of skipping this key step or doing certain stretches at the wrong time.\u000a\u000aStretching improves flexibility and helps maintain good range of motion in your joints. It may even prevent injury. Timing is important, though.\u000a\u000aStarting your workout with dynamic stretches can prep your body for the exercise to come, according to the American Council on Exercise (ACE). These are stretches that take your body through a range of motions and raise your core temperature.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, static stretches -- stretches you get into and hold for a certain length of time without moving -- before exercise can strain or pull a muscle. So, save such stretches for after your workout when your muscles are warm and loose, the ACE says.\u000a\u000aIt's important to keep safety in mind when you're doing static stretches in particular. Ease into each stretch and move slowly until you feel the targeted muscle or muscles gently extend. Try to hold each position for 10 to 30 seconds. Relax and then repeat the stretch two or three times. Breathe slowly and naturally.\u000a\u000aBe sure to stretch the muscles on both sides of your body. If you stretch one hamstring, don't forget to do the other. And to avoid tearing a muscle don't bounce.\u000a\u000aRemember to listen to your body as you stretch. If a particular move causes a muscle cramp or pain of any kind, stop doing it.

aVIt is "terribly embarrassing" that Congress went home for its summer recess while leaving Obamacare in place and not touching tax code reform legislation, and if something not done, Senate Republicans will lose their majority, Rep. Louie Gohmert said Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"This is is something that everybody, most everybody, in the Senate that a Republican ran on, that we're going to repeal," the Texas Republican told Fox News' "Fox & Friends."\u000a\u000aPeople are saying that the Obamacare repeal legislation is dead, and that Congress must move on to tax reform, but Gohmert pointed out that there are too many people hurting from Obamacare.\u000a\u000a"I'm back in Texas, and I'm hearing from people all over," said Gohmert. "'We are hurting, please, you've got to do something. You guys promised to do something to repeal Obamacare.'"\u000a\u000aCongress still needs to do that, and Gohmert said it's "garbage" that the Senate believes its majority is safe.\u000a\u000a"I know that this is what's being said, all the Senate is safe. They will pick up seats," Gohmert said. "Garbage. If the Senate does not repeal Obamacare, at least most of it, they will lose the majority in the Senate."\u000a\u000aIf tax and healthcare reform are accomplished, however, the business community "can take off," said Gohmert.\u000a\u000a"They can start hiring like never before," he said. "We can bring jobs back to America. You know, the factory jobs, the production of things that we need to defend ourselves on our own soil. It's fine that China sends us tires and wheels to put on our Humvees, but we need to make those things here. We've got to."

aVThe media is protected by the First Amendment, but that doesn't give it unlimited power to publish absolutely anything it wants to, Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Trump, told Newsmax TV on Monday.\u000a\u000aEchoing Attorney General Jeff Sessions' warning that the press needs to restrain itself in publishing leaked classified information, or face the music in court.\u000a\u000a"A free press is one of the pillars of a democracy of a free society but even for journalists there have to be limits. The idea that there are no limits on journalists, what does that mean? Does that mean that the New York Times and CNN can publish our launch codes? No, of course not," Gorka told Rita Cosby, guest host of Newsmax's "The Todd Schnitt Show."\u000a\u000a"A free press is essential to a free society, but that does not mean you are completely immune from the laws that pertain to the national security of all Americans."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

Kelly address all the employees in the Eisenhower Executive Building \u2013 that's next to the West Wing \u2013 yes I am [encouraged]," he said.\u000a\u000a"In the first five months of this administration we've had 62 national security leaks in comparison to the first five months of the Obama administration that had eight leaks in the first five months of the Bush administration that had nine leaks. This is outrageous, it endangers all Americans and we will stop it."\u000a\u000aGorka, a counterinsurgency and counterterrorism expert, is the author of "Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War."

aVWhite House aide Sebastian Gorka on Tuesday said "there is no such thing as a lone wolf," insisting a "serious" lone-wolf attack has "never happened" and the idea of one was created by the Obama administration to "make Americans stupid."\u000a\u000aThe firebrand military and intelligence expert told "MSNBC Live" it is a "bogus" idea.\u000a\u000a"There's no such thing as a lone wolf," Gorka told MSNBC hosts Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle. "That is a phrase invented by the last administration to make Americans stupid.\u000a\u000a"There's never been a serious attack or a serious plot that was unconnected from ISIS or al-Qaida, at least through the ideology and TTPs, tactics and training and techniques and procedures that they supply through the internet. Never happened.\u000a\u000a"It is bogus, this is an international global threat."\u000a\u000aGorka said destroying ISIS must first start by calling it what it is \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism. Making that distinction is as important as calling "cancer" by its name.\u000a\u000a"If you, God forbid, caught cancer and the hospital was forbidden from calling it cancer and said you have the flu, go take aspirins, would you have the right treatment?" Gorka said.\u000a\u000a"A serious disease or international geopolitical threat, you'll never solve it in an administration that says it's economic, and these people are disenfranchised," Gorka said. "You cannot solve a problem unless you're allowed to talk truthfully about it. We call it radical Islamic terrorism.\u000a\u000a"What we have to do now is not only destroy organizations like ISIS, which they are doing \u2013 they will be annihilated," Gorka said. "But also delegitimize the ideology so it will be become as heinous and as rejected as Fascism and Nazism is today.\u000a\u000a"That black flag of ISIS has to be globally rejected like the swastika, and we'll work with Muslim partners to overtly and covertly delegitimize their message. That's the definition of victory; when people don't want to become jihadis, that's when we'll have won."

aVU.S. health insurer Anthem Inc. said it will no longer offer Obamacare plans in Nevada's state exchange and will stop offering the plans in nearly half of Georgia's counties next year.\u000a\u000aThe moves come after Republican senators last month failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018.\u000a\u000aHundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months.\u000a\u000aNevada had said in June that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges. Anthem's decision to leave the state entirely does not increase the number of "bare counties" in the state, Nevada Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe insurer will still offer "catastrophic plans," which can be purchased outside the state's exchange and are only available to consumers under 30 years old or with a low income.\u000a\u000aAnthem also said it will only offer Obamacare plans in 85 of Georgia's 159 counties. It said the counties it will continue to offer the plans in are mostly rural counties that would otherwise not have health insurance coverage for their residents.\u000a\u000aIt said these changes do not impact Anthem\u2019s Medicare Advantage, Medicaid or employer-based plans in either state.\u000a\u000aThe company said last week that it will pull out of 16 of 19 pricing regions in California in 2018 where it offered Obamacare options this year.\u000a\u000aAnthem blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Donald Trump last week threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower-income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed in Congress.\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly urged Republican lawmakers to keep working to undo Obama's Affordable Care Act.

aVDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee have requested documents from all cabinet secretaries on how much federal tax money is being spent at businesses owned by President Donald Trump, McClatchy reported on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"The president's financial entanglements make it impossible to know whether he is making his decisions in the public interest or to benefit him or his family members financially," the 18 congressmen wrote, requesting that they receive the documents by Aug. 25. "The president's continued ownership of private businesses also places federal employees in compromised positions when they work on official activities that create financial benefits for the president or his family members."\u000a\u000aTrump did not fully separate from his business interests when he became president, ignoring the tradition to divest as previous presidents have done. According to the arrangement Trump set up, he can draw down money from his businesses at any time.\u000a\u000aNo Republicans, who control the committee, joined in the investigation. Democrats alone can launch their own investigation, but they do not have the power to subpoena documents without the support of the majority party.\u000a\u000aThe Democrats cited numerous news reports indicating that the federal government has spent money at Trump-owned businesses, including that the State Department paid more than $15,000 on 19 rooms at a Trump-branded hotel in Vancouver while members of the Trump family were there for its grand opening, Talking Points Memo reported.\u000a\u000aThey also noted that Trump has an ownership stake in Starrett City Associates, a property that receives federal housing subsidies.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the Democrats expressed concern that the government has not disclosed the funds spent on the president's numerous trips to his own properties and that it is not clear "whether the president benefited financially from these expenditures," Talking Points Memo reported.\u000a\u000a"There may be other expenditures of American taxpayer funds at Trump properties that are not yet publicly known," the congressmen said. "Federal agencies and their employees may be hosting events or renting hotel rooms at Trump properties, eating meals at Trump property restaurants, or contracting for equipment rentals with Trump businesses."

aVClimate change is behind a rapid and drastic change in temperatures in the United States since 1980, according to a draft report that is awaiting approval from the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aThe New York Times, which obtained a copy of the draft report, said Monday the effects of global warming can already be felt in most parts of the United States with temperatures the highest they have been in the past 1,500 years.\u000a\u000aThe report projects the world temperature will rise an additional 0.50 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 or 0.30 degrees Celsius \u2014 in the coming century, and the Times noted even that small amount of temperature rise can cause longer heat waves, worse rainstorms, and the hastening of coral reef disintegration.\u000a\u000aThe report had a "very high" confidence the number and severity of cool nights have decreased while the warm days have increased since the 1960s, according to the Times. And extreme cold waves are less common while extreme heat waves are more common since the 1980s.\u000a\u000aThe report said it had a medium degree of confidence human-caused global warming had caused higher temperatures in the Western and Northern United States, though it found no such link in the Southeast.\u000a\u000aThe report is mandated by Congress every four years as part of the National Climate Assessment and was finished earlier this year. It has been approved by the National Academy of Sciences and is awaiting approval by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aBut scientists who spoke to the Times expressed fear it might not get that approval, especially since Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has expressed doubts about carbon dioxide being a cause of climate change.\u000a\u000aPruitt's EPA and 12 other federal agencies have an Aug. 13 deadline to approve the report.\u000a\u000a"It's a fraught situation," Princeton University professor of geoscience and international affairs Michael Oppenheimer told the Times. "This is the first case in which an analysis of climate change of this scope has come up in the Trump administration, and scientists will be watching very carefully to see how they handle it."\u000a\u000aRelated Stories

aVChina's foreign exchange reserves rose twice as much as expected in July to a nine-month high as tighter regulations and a weaker dollar keep capital outflows in check.\u000a\u000aA dramatic reduction in capital outflows - which are seen as one of China's biggest risks - has helped boost confidence in its economy this year as policymakers preach stability ahead of a key political leadership reshuffle in coming months.\u000a\u000aChina's forex reserves, the world's largest, rose $24 billion in July to $3.081 trillion, compared with an increase of $3.2 billion in June, central bank data showed.\u000a\u000aIt was the first time that China's reserves had climbed for six months in a row since June 2014, and lifted them to the highest level since last October.\u000a\u000aThe country's foreign exchange regulator said weakness in the dollar helped push up the value of non-dollar currencies in its holdings. The euro, in particular, gained more than 3 percent against the greenback last month.\u000a\u000aExcluding those valuation effects, China's reserves would have fallen by $5.2 billion in July, China Merchants Securities economists estimated in a research note following the data.\u000a\u000aChina burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year, but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the surging dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994.\u000a\u000aING economist Iris Pang estimated outflows eased to about $10 billion in July.\u000a\u000aSuch a modest level should reduce any pressures on the yuan for the rest of the year, she said, while adding she does not expect authorities to relax restrictions on capital outflows anytime soon.\u000a\u000aChina's forex pile fell below the closely watched $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years, raising market fears that Beijing may devalue its currency to relieve the pressure.\u000a\u000aBut the yuan has rebounded more than 3 percent so far this year, thanks largely to a reversal in the dollar, tougher policing of outflows and fresh steps by the central bank to flush out speculators who were betting the currency would continue to fall.\u000a\u000aThe yuan strengthened around 0.8 percent against the dollar in July, its third straight month of gains.\u000a\u000aThe strong rebound "has changed market expectations to yuan appreciation (from depreciation)," said ING's Pang.\u000a\u000aIn the first half of the year, Chinese commercial banks sold a net $93.8 billion of foreign exchange, down 46 percent from the same period last year.\u000a\u000a"The balance in the foreign exchange market in the first half of the year was the best in three years," the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said last month, adding that it expected cross-border flows to remain stable due to the country's strong economic performance and more benign conditions globally.\u000a\u000aFRESH MEASURES\u000a\u000aIn addition to clamping down on outflows since late last year via administrative measures, Beijing has more recently taken aim at some overseas investments by Chinese firms as it looks to keep the yuan on a more even keel.\u000a\u000aChina's non-financial outbound direct investment (ODI) fell by nearly half in the first half of 2017 as the tighter capital restrictions began to bite.\u000a\u000aReuters reported in July that China's regulators have told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda Group's overseas acquisitions as Beijing looks to curb the conglomerate's offshore buying spree.\u000a\u000aAuthorities will "severely crack down on underground banks and other foreign exchange violations to prevent and resolve risks from cross-border capital flows," the forex regulator said in an internal meeting last month.\u000a\u000aThe SAFE reiterated that it will back legitimate overseas investments by domestic firms and will continue to monitor overseas investments in property, hotel, entertainment, sports and movie industries.\u000a\u000aCombined, the more stringent regulatory measures, a weaker dollar and pressure on acquisition hungry domestic firms have helped pull the yuan away from the 7 to the dollar mark which is believed to be closely watched by China's top policymakers.\u000a\u000aStill, in 12 months' time the yuan is expected to have erased most of the gains made this year, providing the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks to a gradual policy tightening path, boosting the dollar, a Reuters poll showed last week.\u000a\u000aFrom current levels around 6.72, the yuan is forecast to weaken to 6.85 in six months and 6.90 in a year, according to the poll of over 60 foreign exchange analysts taken July 27-Aug 2.\u000a\u000aThe value of China's gold reserves rose to $75.084 billion at end-July, from $73.585 billion at end-June.

aVU.S. regulators warned a New York fertility doctor to stop marketing an experimental procedure that uses DNA from three people \u2014 a mother, a father and an egg donor \u2014 to avoid certain genetic diseases.\u000a\u000aThe doctor, John Zhang, used the technique to help a Jordanian couple have a baby boy last year.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, Zhang said his companies wouldn't use the technology in the U.S. again without permission, yet they continue to promote it.\u000a\u000aThe procedure is not approved in the U.S., and Congress has barred the FDA from even reviewing proposals to conduct such experiments.\u000a\u000aA receptionist at Zhang's New Hope Fertility Clinic in New York said late Friday that no one was available to comment. Zhang heads the clinic and a related company, Darwin Life Inc.\u000a\u000aNew Hope's website touts having achieved the "first live birth" using this technology, along with other advanced fertility treatments it offers. The FDA's letter to Zhang cites several other marketing claims, including a reference to "the first proven treatment for certain genetic disorders."\u000a\u000aThe birth of the boy was disclosed last September. The mother carries DNA that could have given her child Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that usually kills within a few years of birth.\u000a\u000aThe experimental technique involves removing some of the mother's DNA from an egg, and leaving the disease-causing DNA behind. The healthy DNA gets slipped into a donor's egg, which is then fertilized. As a result, the baby inherits DNA from both parents and the egg donor \u2014 producing what's been called "three-parent babies" \u2014 though the DNA contribution from the egg donor is very small.\u000a\u000aPeople carry DNA in two places, the nucleus of the cell and in structures called mitochondria, which lie outside the nucleus. The technique is designed to transfer only DNA of the nucleus to the donor egg.\u000a\u000aA medical journal report on the case said the procedure was done at the New York clinic and the embryo was taken to Mexico, where it was implanted. The procedure isn't illegal in Mexico.\u000a\u000aLast year, a report from a panel of U.S. government advisers said it is ethical to begin testing this approach in pregnancy as long as the first studies follow strict safety steps. The studies must include women at high risk of passing on a severe disease and, at first, implant only male embryos, so the alterations wouldn't pass to future generations.\u000a\u000aThe FDA had requested the report, though the law against such experiments remains in force.\u000a\u000aBritish regulators last year approved "cautious use" of the technique, and this year issued its first license to use it.\u000a\u000aThe child born last year through Zhang's clinic is not the first to inherit DNA from three people. In the 1990s, some children were born after researchers used a different technique. But federal regulators intervened, and the field's interest now has passed to the new approach.

aVNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat seeking re-election this year, proposed a tax on the wealthy to pay for repairs to the city\u2019s deteriorating subway system.\u000a\u000aThe plan would increase the city\u2019s highest income-tax rate to 4.41 percent from 3.88 percent on earnings above $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for couples. The move would affect about 32,000 people and raise as much as $800 million a year, de Blasio said Monday.\u000a\u000aMost of the revenue would go toward fixing a mass-transit system that has been plagued in recent months by breakdowns and delays, contributing to the first decrease in ridership in more than 20 years. About $250 million would subsidize half-price fares for 800,000 New Yorkers living below the federal poverty line, said de Blasio, 56, whose re-election campaign has focused on making the city more affordable.\u000a\u000a\u201cRather than sending the bill to working families and subway and bus riders already feeling the pressure of rising fares and bad service, we are asking the wealthiest in our city to chip in a little extra to help move our transit system into the 21st century,\u201d de Blasio said.\u000a\u000aThe idea is sure to provoke more disagreement between the mayor and Governor Andrew Cuomo, who have been feuding since de Blasio took office in 2014. Cuomo, also a Democrat, has insisted the city pay half of an $830 million emergency-overhaul proposed last month by his chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Joseph Lhota. The mayor has said the city already is giving its fair share.\u000a\u000aSplitting Bills\u000a\u000aWhile the city owns the subway system, the MTA runs it. Lhota\u2019s plan would add cars on trains to ease overcrowding, remove seats from some cars to increase capacity and step up maintenance.\u000a\u000aLhota rejected the mayor\u2019s tax-the-rich plan, saying that even in the unlikely event that the Republican-controlled state legislature approved it, the funding would come too late.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe challenges the subways are facing today need immediate resources and solutions right now, not years from now,\u201d Lhota said in a statement Monday.\u000a\u000aRepublican Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan also rejected de Blasio\u2019s proposal, saying the mayor \u201cdoesn\u2019t need to reach into the wallets of city residents.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe mayor has failed previously to get state approval to increase taxes on the wealthy, including his 2014 proposal to fund universal all-day pre-kindergarten. Cuomo instead persuaded the legislature to fund the program statewide out of general revenue.\u000a\u000aDe Blasio\u2019s call to finance affordable housing for seniors with a \u201cmansion tax\u201d on transfers of city apartments above $2 million also failed.\u000a\u000aMillionaires\u2019 Tax\u000a\u000aThis time, de Blasio said, his call to tax the rich will succeed because voters and lawmakers recognize New York\u2019s regional transit system is breaking down.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe voices of millions of New Yorkers is what\u2019s going to make the difference here,\u201d he said Monday during a news conference. \u201cThe 1 percent have been asked to pay less and less in terms of taxes. Change happens at the grassroots. More and more New Yorkers will say \u2018I want the wealthy to pay more.\u2019"\u000a\u000aDe Blasio has rejected the idea of raising revenue by establishing tolls on East River bridges connecting Manhattan with Brooklyn and Queens, or through congestion pricing, which would require Manhattan-bound drivers to pay a fee.\u000a\u000aLost Wages\u000a\u000aHe won support for his tax proposal from Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, who said it would provide a recurring revenue source for the subways; and John Raskin, executive director of The Riders Alliance, a transit advocacy group, who said fairness required the wealthiest residents to pay more.\u000a\u000a\u201cA millionaires\u2019 tax would require some New Yorkers to pay, but the status quo requires literally millions of New Yorkers to pay in the form of lost wages, missed work and days ruined by breakdowns and delays,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to ask the New Yorkers who benefit the most from our city\u2019s prosperity to pay a little more to repair the infrastructure that the entire economy relies on.\u201d\u000a\u000aKathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of corporate chief executives, said the mayor\u2019s plan would \u201cthrow the city\u2019s high earners under the bus.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group supported a state tax on millionaires when the 2008 recession created a fiscal crisis. The city, which has a budget surplus exceeding $4 billion, shouldn\u2019t demand more from its wealthiest residents, who are already paying large tax bills and have the option to flee, she said.\u000a\u000aThe mayor\u2019s proposal may backfire if it\u2019s seen as an election-year ploy to enhance his progressive image, said William Cunningham, a political adviser to former Governors Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. (Bloomberg is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.)\u000a\u000a\u201cIt has little to do with winning in Albany and more to do with a campaign ad in September and October championing transit riders,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cThe mayor thinks he outflanked the governor and will elude the need to have the city contribute. In fact, he may have blithely entered a trap set by the governor because the mayor is now on record that the city could pay extra.\u201d

aVPresidio Terrace is one of the most distinguished streets in all of San Francisco, and it was purchased by a couple for a mere $90,000.\u000a\u000aTina Lam and Michael Cheng purchased Presidio Terrace, home to 35 megamillion-dollar mansions, at a city-run auction in 2015 after the neighborhood failed to pay its annual $14 tax bill for 30 years, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Now, the couple is looking to make their investment pay off, including possibly charging the street's rich residents to park there.\u000a\u000aUnsurprisingly, homeowners on Presidio Terrace who didn't know their street was for sale and sold aren't happy about it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was shocked to learn this could happen, and am deeply troubled that anyone would choose to take advantage of the situation and buy our street and sidewalks,\u201d a Presidio Terrace homeowner told the Chronicle.\u000a\u000a"I thought they would reach out to us and invite us in as new neighbors," Cheng said, the Chronicle reported. "This has certainly blown up a lot more than we expected."\u000a\u000aLam and Cheng have been sued by the street's homeowners association to keep them from selling it while the HOA appeals the sale to the city. A hearing is scheduled for October.\u000a\u000aHome prices in San Francisco have skyrocketed, making it second only to New York City in the country's most expensive places to live. The median home price in San Francisco is $1.5 million, and on the prestigious Presidio Terrace street, the last home listed there was priced at $16.9 million, according to Curbed.

aVSpecial:\u000a\u000aTop Doc Shares Simple Daily Habits for Healthy Prostate\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aThe One Thing Your Prostate Needs Every Morning\u000a\u000aAdvanced technology has improved prostate cancer surgery to reduce the risks of erectile dysfunction following the procedure. However, possible nerve damage during surgery can still cause impotence in some men. Urinary incontinence is another possible side effect.A man\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain an erection after prostate cancer surgery may depend on age, sexual function before the operation, and whether certain nerves are cut during the procedure, according to the American Cancer Society . The organization stated that all men may experience some decrease in the ability to have an erection. But the younger the man, the better chances there are of maintaining the ability to have an erection.Surgeons attempt to avoid injuring the nerves in the prostate gland that enable men to have sexual function. If the cancer has grown near the nerves, the nerves on one side or both sides of the prostate might have to be removed, causing possible erectile problems.Impotence might be prevented through new procedures such as robotic surgery, although there are no guarantees. Robotic surgery includes a high-definition visual technique, called the da Vinci system, that allows surgeons to operate with better precision, dexterity and control than with other methods, according to da Vinci Surgery The advanced surgical technique results in more precise removal of cancerous tissue with less risk of damaging surrounding tissue and nerves. This has shown a faster return to erectile function for patients who have not had problems with impotence before the surgery.Fewer complications occur with robotic surgery than with traditional methods of prostate cancer surgery. Research shows more patients returning to the erectile function they had before the surgery than with other surgeries during checkups a year later, da Vinci Surgery noted. However, sexual dysfunction due to nerve damage remains a potential risk from the surgery.Laparoscopic surgery uses a tiny video camera inserted into the abdomen, making it possible to make smaller incisions than in traditional prostate surgery methods. Robotic surgery is a type of laparoscopic surgery. Instead of operating directly themselves, the surgeons operate from a panel that controls robotic arms.There is less of a risk of scarring with robotic surgery than with other surgeries, according to Dr. David B. Samadi, chief of robotic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. The build-up of scar tissue following surgery may cause complications in the proper function of the prostate gland. These complications are less likely with the minimal incisions used in robotic surgery.

aVBMW and Daimler, the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car.\u000a\u000aBut another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush.\u000a\u000aCarmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.\u000a\u000aThe trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case.\u000a\u000a"Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it," said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential.\u000a\u000aDozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers.\u000a\u000a"It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers," said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners.\u000a\u000aIn July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021.\u000a\u000aThe decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.\u000a\u000a"Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge," Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters.\u000a\u000a"Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."\u000a\u000aDaimler's Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch, three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars.\u000a\u000aEven deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May.\u000a\u000aSHARE THE BURDEN\u000a\u000aPartial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - "eyes off", "mind off" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality.\u000a\u000aKlaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker.\u000a\u000a"It is an enabling technology, not a business case," he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. "But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."\u000a\u000aOne of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities.\u000a\u000a"Robotaxis" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year.\u000a\u000aFord and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups.\u000a\u000aThe emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group.\u000a\u000aIndustry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies.\u000a\u000aALLIANCES, MERGERS\u000a\u000aIn September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles.\u000a\u000aThe regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident.\u000a\u000a"It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives," the guidance said.\u000a\u000a"Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."\u000a\u000aEuropean regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.\u000a\u000aPressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps.\u000a\u000aBMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google.\u000a\u000aWhat starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said.\u000a\u000a"Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?" asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells.

aVThe fuse on the public pension time bomb got a little longer.\u000a\u000aRecord-breaking equity markets boosted U.S. state and local-government pension investments the most in three years in fiscal 2017, easing pressure on governments that have to put more money into plans when investment returns fall short of expectations.\u000a\u000aPublic pensions booked a median gain of 12.4 percent for the fiscal year ended in June and have returned an annualized 20-year median return of 7 percent, according to the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.\u000a\u000a\u201cDiversification pays and stay the course,\u201d said Robert Waid, a managing director at Wilshire Associates Inc. in Santa Monica, California. \u201cWe had a couple really bad years and now long-term returns are coming back into view."\u000a\u000aThe gains may help ease the fiscal strain on state and local governments that have nearly $2 trillion less then they need to cover all the benefits that have been promised. Because they expect investment gains of more than 7 percent each year, when their returns fall short -- as in the last two fiscal years -- governments need to pay more into the funds or find a way to increase returns to make up for lost ground.\u000a\u000aPublic pensions had 71.8 percent of the assets required to meet obligations to retirees in fiscal 2016, a decline from 73.5 percent in the prior year, according to a report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The authors of the report expect the funding ratio to improve slightly as the stock market\u2019s revival helps assets recover.\u000a\u000aPublic pensions will have a funding ratio of about 73 percent in 2021, assuming they achieve annual expected returns of 7.6 percent, according to CRR. The ratio is expected to increase to 70.6 percent from about 68 percent, under new government accounting standards.\u000a\u000aThe health of government retiree funds would improve faster if states and cities contribute 100 percent of their actuarially required contribution and calculate that contribution using a \u201clevel-dollar\u201d amortization method, said Caroline Crawford, assistant director of state and local research at CRR. Level-dollar amortization is similar to a fixed-rate mortgage, where payments are constant. Most public pensions use the level percentage of payroll amortization method, where payments increase over time.\u000a\u000aThe Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index returned 18.5 percent for the year ending June 30, 2017, while international stocks did even better, rising 20.5 percent for the year. Larger pensions, which have more invested in foreign stocks and bonds, and \u201calternative" investments such as private equity, performed better than the median fund. Public retirement plans with more than $5 billion in assets logged a median 1-year return of 12.9 percent.\u000a\u000aPublic pensions from California to New York have been lowering their return goals, adopting a more modest outlook after being roiled by last decade\u2019s booms and busts and a long period of historically low interest rates. Of almost 130 public retirement funds, about three-fourths have reduced their targets since fiscal 2010, resulting in a decline in the average return assumption to 7.5 percent from 7.9 percent, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

"To me, it was about bring these characters to life."\u000a\u000aWhitmire said he was cast as Kermit after creator Jim Henson died in 1990, but had been working with Henson for 12 years before that.\u000a\u000a"I used to joke that I would never retire, I would be carried out of a sound stage with Kermit on my hand and a toe tag on my toe," he said. "As long as I was able, I certainly intended for this to be the rest of my life."\u000a\u000aBut when Disney took over the Muppets, things changed \u2013 and "rightly so," he said.\u000a\u000a"'The Muppets' had a little creative bubble, and my goal has always been to try to preserve that within Disney and integrate it into what Disney needed," Whitmire said.\u000a\u000aThe end came abruptly last October, after discussions about becoming a creative producer had been underway, Whitmire said.\u000a\u000a"I thought this phone call was to continue those discussions," he said. "I mean it was all but formalized, we were going down that path. And instead, they said basically 'we've decided not to do that, and we also decided to recast all your characters.'"\u000a\u000a"It was like someone slapped me as hard as they could. It was out of nowhere and I really had no warning at all . . . I was blindsided by the extent of this," he added.\u000a\u000aHe disputed claims Disney warned him about his business conduct.\u000a\u000a"Had I had an ultimatum, I would have worked to straightened that out," he said.

aVWhite House officials have been engaging Democrats on tax reform even though support from the left is likely not needed and definitely not wanted by congressional Republicans, Politico reported.\u000a\u000aRegardless, President Donald Trump's team has quietly been engaged with Democrats since June.\u000a\u000a"We'd prefer bipartisan support for the tax plan," Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, told Politico. "We still think we can earn the support of [Democrats] on the tax package."\u000a\u000aHowever, Republicans are more united on tax reform than they were on healthcare. House Speaker Paul Ryan said 97 percent of Republicans are in accord on tax relief.\u000a\u000aThough Democrats in the House and Senate are open to working on bipartisan tax reform, it's the easier fight for Republicans \u2014 no Democrats need apply, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said in essence last week.\u000a\u000aBut Senate Democrats also are warning their peers against using reconciliation \u2014 implementing a simple 51-vote majority \u2014 to pass tax cuts, especially if it adds to the deficit, Politico reported.\u000a\u000aMcConnell "did the same thing with healthcare," Democrats Sen.

aVJake Yanoviak is hunting for houses. On a weekday afternoon in North Philadelphia, the 23-year-old painter cruises along on his bike, its black paint obscured under stickers from breweries and rock bands. He turns onto a side street, where he spots a few elderly neighbors, standing on adjoining porches. He parks, leans on one handlebar and makes his pitch.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnybody on the block considering selling?\u201d Yanoviak asks gently. \u201cI\u2019m not a developer, I\u2019m not interested in renting to students. I\u2019m just a kid trying to buy a house, fix it up and live in it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not going no place,\u201d replies a 70-something woman, relaxing in fuzzy white pig slippers in the row house where she\u2019s lived twice as long as Yanoviak has been alive. \u201cAll these houses are taken.\u201d\u000a\u000aLike much of his generation, Yanoviak is desperate to get a piece of an increasingly scarce commodity: prime American real estate.\u000a\u000aMillennials are finding themselves out in the cold because building has slowed, and longer-living baby boomers are staying put, setting up a simmering conflict between the two biggest generations in U.S. history.\u000a\u000aTo succeed, buyers and real estate brokers must show uncommon persistence and, at times, diplomacy. Yanoviak has tried sheriff\u2019s sales, lost two bidding wars, ridden miles on potholed streets and left notes in mailboxes, all to no avail.\u000a\u000aPeople 55 and older own 53 percent of U.S. owner-occupied houses, the biggest share since the government started collecting data in 1900, according to real estate website Trulia. That\u2019s up from 43 percent a decade ago. Those ages 18 to 34 possess just 11 percent. When they were that age, baby boomers had homes at almost twice that level.\u000a\u000aPublic policy contributes to the generational standoff. Property-tax exemptions for longtime residents keep older Americans from moving. Zoning rules make it harder to build affordable apartments attractive to senior citizens.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe system is gridlocked,\u201d says Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe seniors aren\u2019t turning over homes as fast as they used to, so there are very few existing homes coming online. To turn it over, they\u2019ll have to have a landing place.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Lexington, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, broker Dani Fleming offers pizza and refreshments to entice the mostly elderly homeowners to attend seller seminars on \u201chow to unlock the potential of your home.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Alameda, California, east of San Francisco, 38-year-old Angela Hockabout, her husband and their two children live with her 76-year-old mother-in-law, who is holding onto the home because the real estate taxes are so low. Under the almost-40-year-old ballot measure Proposition 13, they are tied to the property\u2019s value when the house was purchased in the 1970s.\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Homeowner, I have been looking to buy a house for almost a year and have not found one.\u201d\u000a\u000aKale, Tomatoes\u000a\u000aIn Omaha, Nebraska, Bill and Peg Swanson, a couple in their late 60s, say they might move if they could find affordable single-family homes aimed at seniors nearby. Still, like many from their generation, they like aging in place, tending their garden of green peppers, kale and tomatoes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of reasons to stay here,\u201d Bill Swanson says. \u201cWe still enjoy putzing around the yard.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat kind of thinking ends up costing young home shoppers such as Yanoviak. After graduating from Carleton College in Minnesota with a degree in media studies, he now lives in West Philadelphia with his parents, an arborist and a director of a nonprofit. For a living, he does carpentry and helps paint movie sets. He\u2019s looking at homes costing as much as $200,000 and may rent out rooms to friends.\u000a\u000aYanoviak scouts property with Google Maps, Zillow and the city\u2019s property-record site. When he finds something, he calls his real estate agent, Cecile Steinriede, who checks it out. He also keeps an old-school sheaf of letters in the rear pocket of his pants, so he can hand them out or slip them in mailboxes.\u000a\u000a\u201cDear Homeowner,\u201d they read. \u201cI have been looking to buy a house for almost a year and have not found one.\u201d\u000a\u000aBrewerytown\u000a\u000aYanoviak has his sights on a neighborhood called Brewerytown, a community of brick, masonry and vinyl row houses that range from tidy to decaying, with paint peeling, holes in roofs and weeds growing from cracks in sidewalks.\u000a\u000aAlong with inter-generational tension, Yanoviak\u2019s search raises delicate questions of race and class. He\u2019s white and college-educated, and he\u2019s often knocking on the doors of working-class black homeowners who see their homes as key to an affordable retirement and a way to pass wealth to future generations. (None would give their names.) Yanoviak acknowledges the awkwardness. It doesn\u2019t help, he says, when developers assault residents with insulting, low-ball cash offers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable for me to be perceived as an outsider,\u201d Yanoviak says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to change the community. I\u2019m trying to contribute in positive ways and be a neighbor.\u201d\u000a\u000aResentments fester in neighborhoods of all ethnicities. In a traditionally Italian section of South Philadelphia, which is now out of Yanoviak\u2019s price range, 70-year-old Nick Ingenito, sits on the front steps of the three-story brick house his grandmother\u2019s aunt bought in the early 1900s.\u000a\u000a\u2018Wouldn\u2019t Move\u2019\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere do these young people get this money?\u201d he says, looking out at the street where he played stick ball as a kid. \u201cThis neighborhood still has the soul of the past. Everybody I know \u2014 people older than me \u2014 wouldn\u2019t move from here for nothing unless they couldn\u2019t afford it no more.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn a recent Thursday evening after work, Yanoviak, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and a brown belt emblazoned with the Schlitz logo, mounts his bike to make the housing round.\u000a\u000aOn one of his first stops, a black cat slinks under the wooden gate next to an abandoned house with bay windows that piqued Yanoviak\u2019s interest. Using his bike as a ladder, he stands on the seat and stretches his chin over barbed wire. All he can see are bed springs and junk.\u000a\u000aYanoviak starts cycling again, taking both hands off the handle bar to tap on his iPhone, noting the address of a property he might want to revisit.\u000a\u000aChurch Properties\u000a\u000aHe stops to chat with the pastor of a church, which owns a handful of properties but isn\u2019t selling.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo, we\u2019re holding out for God to do what he said he was going to do and that is to give us the block,\u201d the pastor tells Yanoviak.\u000a\u000aThen, he sees a gray-haired man puttering in his garage.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m looking at properties in the neighborhood, there isn\u2019t a whole lot on the market so I\u2019m cold calling,\u201d Yanoviak says.\u000a\u000a\u201cGive me $2 million,\u201d the homeowner replies. \u201cI don\u2019t want no low number.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt turns out the price is for the whole block. Even then, the potential seller has second thoughts.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wouldn\u2019t sell even if you gave me $2 million \u2014 this is my retirement,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you gave me a bag of money, I wouldn\u2019t sell.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter a few hours chatting with a half dozen owners and visiting eight properties, Yanoviak gets back on his bike, his pitch letters still hanging from the back pocket of his jeans. He heads back to his parents\u2019 house, deferring for yet another day his search for a home.

aVNorth Korea condemned the latest round of United Nations sanctions and reiterated that it wouldn\u2019t negotiate over its nuclear program until the U.S. ceases "hostile" policies.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s regime said it will "make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country," the Korean Central News Agency reported on Monday. In a separate statement to reporters in Manila, North Korea called President Donald Trump\u2019s "America First" policy dangerous and said its nuclear program was necessary to avoid a U.S. invasion similar to those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\u000a\u000a"We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on negotiating table," North Korea said. "Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves, unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the DPRK are fundamentally eliminated."\u000a\u000aThe response shows that tensions are showing no signs of abating after the UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved measures to restrict North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Trump\u2019s administration has threatened military action if necessary to stop North Korea from obtaining an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the U.S. with a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aChina, North Korea\u2019s biggest ally and trade partner, backed the sanctions in a bid to spur dialogue. It has urged North Korea to halt future ballistic missile and nuclear tests, while also calling on the U.S. and South Korea to cease military exercises.\u000a\u000a"North Korea\u2019s response is expected, because they have their own position," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Manila on Monday night. "The key is that we cannot let the situation to continue to escalate, and we need to find an opportunity to turn things around amid the crisis."\u000a\u000aThe KCNA report came as diplomats in Asia stepped up efforts to get North Korea to resume dialogue during a regional security meeting in the Philippines. Foreign ministers from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan all spoke with their North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho in Manila.\u000a\u000a"North Korea should realize that it will face stronger sanctions and pressure if it doesn\u2019t stop nuclear and missile provocation," Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, said on Tuesday in response to North Korea\u2019s statement. "We urge North Korea to make the right choice and come to the path of denuclearization."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged Ri on Sunday to respond as soon as possible to an offer to resume talks between the two countries, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified foreign ministry official from Seoul. Ri said the offer "lacks sincerity," according to the unnamed official.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s a positive but very small step, and can at least help the two Koreas exchange some views on the current state of affairs," Kim Jin-ho, a professor of political science at Dankook University in South Korea, said of the meeting between foreign ministers. "North Korea would use the talk as a bargaining chip with the U.S., as their goal is to have dialogue with Washington, not Seoul."\u000a\u000aIn a phone call on Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Trump that North Korean issues must be resolved peacefully and diplomatically. He said the countries needed to show Pyongyang that the door to dialogue was open if North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to a Moon spokesman.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is attending the security forum in Manila, said Monday that the best signal North Korea could give that it\u2019s ready for talks with the U.S. was to halt missile launches, the Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re not going to give someone a specific number of days or weeks," Tillerson said. "This is really about the spirit of these talks."\u000a\u000aJoint discussions between six nations \u2014 China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. \u2014 collapsed in 2009.\u000a\u000aMoon, who took office in May, has advocated engaging Pyongyang with dialogue and offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Kim\u2019s first successful ICBM test July 4.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is likely to continue pursuing ballistic missile tests at its current pace of about every three to four weeks despite the sanctions, according to John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at Harvard Kennedy School. He called the sanctions "too little, too late" to cut off financing for the nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"The North Korean program remains an unconstrained one with neither sanctions nor an operational diplomatic agreement holding it back," Park said

aVAmerican consumer credit rose to a fresh record of $3.86 trillion in June as student and auto loans reached a new high.\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve said Monday that overall consumer credit expanded by $12.4 billion in June, down from May's $18.3 billion increase and less than economists had been expecting.\u000a\u000aThe credit report is closely watched for clues about the direction of consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.\u000a\u000aNon-revolving credit, which includes auto and student loans, rose $8.3 billion, down from an $11.4 billion jump in May and the smallest amount since a $7 billion increase in June 2016. The category that includes credit cards climbed $4.1 billion, down from May's $6.9 billion gain.\u000a\u000aThe Fed's monthly credit report does not include mortgages or other debt secured by real estate, including home-equity loans.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. economy rose at a solid 2.6 percent annual pace from April through June on a healthy increase in consumer spending. The job market also looks good. Employers last month added 209,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low 4.3 percent.\u000a\u000aBut the Commerce Department reported last week that consumer spending slowed in June as incomes grew at the weakest pace in seven months.

aVExtracting venom from scorpions can be a dangerous, but rewarding, task.\u000a\u000aThe poisonous secretion, while fatal to humans, contains hundreds of components that have potential uses in the health sector when they are broken down to a molecular level.\u000a\u000aIn a bid to remove the venom safely, for both scorpion and extractor, a group of scientists in Morocco have developed a remote-controlled 'milking machine', which straps to the scorpion's tail and uses an electric impulse to stimulate the venom glands for the poison to be released.\u000a\u000a"What makes it special is that it is safe and fast," said Mouad Mkamel, a researcher at Ben M'sik Hassan II University in Casablanca who, along with a group of university scientists, developed the machine.\u000a\u000a"If we were able to extract venom from ten scorpions daily in the past, today we can do it with up to 150 of them in a day."\u000a\u000aAccording to the researchers, the business of scorpion-milking can be lucrative. They said that a gram of venom can be sold for around $8,000, with venom from rarer scorpions selling for up to $12,000 per gram.\u000a\u000aThe team are now waiting for their patent to be approved and to start mass-producing their machine.

aVSPECIAL:\u000a\u000aFeeling Down? Try These Six Super-Foods That Beat the Blues\u000a\u000aALERT:\u000a\u000aDepression Relief: 4 Supplements Better Than Antidepressants\u000a\u000aResearch has shown that certain exercises may help to ease depression. The reason is chemical. Exercise boosts endorphins, which offer powerful boosts to your sense of well-being, according to Everyday Health "Your favorite fitness routine can be an excellent addition to your depression treatment plan," Everyday Health noted.Among the top exercises for helping with depression is yoga. One study found that women who took a yoga class twice weekly showed a significant drop in symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to Everyday Health.\u201cEastern traditions such as yoga have a wonderful antidepressant effect in that they improve flexibility; involve mindfulness, which breaks up repetitive negative thoughts; increase strength; make you aware of your breathing; improve balance; and contain a meditative component,\u201d noted Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine.Weight-lifting is also good for those suffering with depression, according to BodyBuilding.com . It is especially helpful for women.The website cited research at Harvard University that determined that 10 weeks of weight training cut clinical symptoms of depression better than counseling.\u201cStrength training is about mastery and control,\u201d clinical psychologist Leslie Seppinni told Everyday Health. \u201cIt requires full attention and concentration. More importantly, people can see the results, the outline of the muscles forming, from dedication and training.\u201dRunning not only is a good aerobic exercise, but it also offers mental health benefits. Starting with a walk and continuing that daily, building up to a run, could help cut back feelings of depression, WebMD reported \u201cThe days you feel least like exercising are the most important days to get out and do it,\u201d author Keith Johnsgard, a psychology professor at San Jose State University, told WebMD. \u201cThose are the days when you will feel best after doing it.\u201d\u201cTo date, the strongest evidence seems to support aerobic exercise,\u201dDr. David Muzina told Everyday Health, which noted that studies found no correlation between exercise intensity and its benefit.\u201cThe most tangible example of exercise stimulating certain brain chemicals is the runner\u2019s high that many athletes report experiencing once crossing a certain threshold of exertion while running,\u201d explained Muzina said.

aVChronic stress takes a toll on both men and women\u2019s hearts. But there is evidence suggesting that women may be even more sensitive to stress.\u000a\u000aAccording to researchers at Emory University, stress may result in physiological changes that make women more prone to heart attack.\u000a\u000aThey found that women who have stable heart disease are more likely than men to suffer from reduced blood flow to their hearts when they are under emotional stress.\u000a\u000aThe researchers suggested that this may occur because young and middle-age women tend to have more stressful lives than men, in that they not only have jobs, but often are also cast in the role of primary caretakers for their kids and aging parents.\u000a\u000aBut the Emory researchers also believe the difference could be one of physiology, in that vessels bringing blood to the female heart tends to narrow under such conditions, constricting flow and setting the stage for a heart attack.\u000a\u000aDuke University researchers found just such a biological difference in a study they published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\u000a\u000aWhen people are under stress, their cardiac vessels should expand to accommodate an increased flow of blood to the heart.\u000a\u000aBut when the researchers reviewed data on 254 men and 56 women with histories of heart disease, they found that 57 percent of female participants experienced ischemia (inadequate blood supply), compared to 41 percent of the men.

aVAdults who don't get enough sleep are more likely to be overweight and obese than those who sleep well, and their waistlines are larger, says a study from the U.K.'s University of Leeds. In addition, those who sleep poorly also have poorer metabolic health, which can lead to Type 2 diabetes.\u000a\u000aResearchers found that people who slept an average of six hours a night had waistlines that were more than an inch larger than those who got nine hours of sleep a night. The shorter sleepers also weighed more.\u000a\u000a"The number of people with obesity worldwide has more than doubled since 1980," said Leeds researcher Greg Potter. "Obesity contributes to the development of many diseases, most notably Type 2 diabetes. Understanding why people gain weight has crucial implications for public health."\u000a\u000aShorter sleep was also linked to reduced levels of HDL cholesterol in the participants' blood \u2014 another factor that can cause health problems. HDL cholesterol is "good" cholesterol that helps remove "bad" fat from circulation and protects against conditions such as heart disease.\u000a\u000a"Because we found that adults who reported sleeping less than their peers were more likely to be overweight or obese, our findings highlight the importance of getting enough sleep," said lead researcher Dr. Laura Hardie. "How much sleep we need differs between people, but the current consensus is that seven to nine hours is best for most adults."\u000a\u000aThe study's findings were published in the journal PLOS ONE.\u000a\u000aAs many as 50 percent of American adults suffer from acute insomnia each year, which is defined as having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep at least three nights a week for between two weeks and three months.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 percent of Americans suffer from chronic insomnia, which is defined by difficulty falling and staying asleep that lasts longer than three months.\u000a\u000aWhat to do? Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say that getting up and out of bed when insomnia strikes may prevent it from becoming chronic. For example, say the researchers, if someone goes to sleep at 11 p.m. and wakes up at 5 a.m. (versus an intended 7:30 a.m.), they should get up and start their day, rather than lie awake in bed.\u000a\u000aChoosing to stay awake (rather than staying in bed trying to sleep) is not only a productive strategy for an individual with acute insomnia, it is also recommended by the American College of Physicians as a part of cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic insomnia.

aVIt can be tough for people with diabetes to choose appropriate over-the-counter medicines for a cold, cough or headache, a pharmacist explains.\u000a\u000aMany of these so-called OTC drugs contain carbohydrates (including sugar) that can affect blood sugar levels, or ingredients that can interact with diabetes medications, according to Miranda Wilhelm. She is a clinical associate professor at Southern Illinois University School of Pharmacy.\u000a\u000aBut labels on OTC medicines don't list carbohydrates, she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm was to present a report on the topic Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, in Indianapolis.\u000a\u000a"It's a dilemma because in some cases the carbs are so high it's equivalent to a snack," Wilhelm said in an association news release.\u000a\u000a"On the other hand, if you actually read the ingredients, you might be afraid to take something that's safe and could help with symptoms. In other words, you may not be limited to OTC medicines that are formulated for people with diabetes, and that's surprising for most people with the condition," she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm offered the following advice:\u000a\u000aGood diabetes management is important. "If your A1C levels are well-managed and your blood pressure is at or near your goal, you should be fine taking most OTC medicines -- whether or not they contain carbohydrates -- if you just need them for a few days," she said.\u000a\u000aRead the label. "If you're concerned about your blood sugar levels, look for medicines labeled 'sugar-free' or 'for people with diabetes,'" Wilhem suggested.\u000a\u000aTake pills instead of liquids. Liquid forms of medicines typically contain more carbohydrates, and sometimes as much alcohol as a glass of beer or wine, she said.\u000a\u000aIf possible, choose a "topical" medicine. The reason: They don't get into your bloodstream. For example, a nasal spray is better for treating a stuffy nose than a medicine you take by mouth. If you have muscle pain, ice the area and use a skin cream that treats pain instead of taking Motrin, Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen).\u000a\u000aGet OTC recommendations from health professionals. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you avoid ingredients that would interact with your other medicines. Check labels for ingredients that can pose problems, such as caffeine and acetaminophen.\u000a\u000a"Something that says it's safe for people with diabetes is fine, but if it doesn't address your symptoms, it's not going to help you, meaning it's medicine you don't need," Wilhelm said.

Advertising revenue also dipped about 12 percent, driven by declines in both print and digital advertising.\u000a\u000a"We believe our advertising revenues were negatively impacted by the public speculation about the ownership of the company and the trailing effect of the disruption from the reorganization of our advertising sales force," the company said in a statement.\u000a\u000aTime had come under pressure to explore a sale after activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC unveiled a 5 percent stake in the company last August.\u000a\u000aBattista told Reuters in April that Time was "definitely" not up for sale after reports that the company had been in talks with Meredith Corp about a potential deal.\u000a\u000aAny disruption to sales from speculation about a deal was largely over, Battista said on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThe company's total revenue fell 9.7 percent to $694 million, missing analysts' average expectation of $703.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\u000a\u000aTime reported a loss of $44 million, or 44 cents per share in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $18 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.\u000a\u000aExcluding items, the company earned 13 cents per share.

aVGolf is among the most solitary of sports, its players engaged in a constant struggle with themselves as they compete against the implacable opponent of par.\u000a\u000aBut for autistic newly qualified professional Simon Seungmin Lee, it is a way to escape from his enclosed self and engage with the world.\u000a\u000aThe 20-year-old South Korean, who grew up in the US, has been medically assessed as having the communication skills of a child half his age -- and the socialisation abilities of a 10-month-old baby.\u000a\u000aBut six years after taking up the clubs, and following five failed attempts, he secured professional status at a Korea PGA trial in May -- one of the few autistic people to do so anywhere in the world.\u000a\u000aHis next goal is a tour card at the Korea PGA qualifying school in November.\u000a\u000a"I love golf," said Lee, who has difficulty speaking and whose mother helped him communicate throughout the interview.\u000a\u000a"I want to win the Masters," he added.\u000a\u000aLee started showing symptoms in his early childhood in the United States where his father, a South Korean diplomat, was stationed.\u000a\u000a"He started avoiding eye contact and replying with what the other person had just said. My heart sank one day when I said, 'Good night Seungmin', and he replied 'Good night Seungmin', instead of 'Good night mother'," she said of the phenomenon known as echolalia.\u000a\u000aHe tends to show attachments to certain objects - another common symptom - most notably a Patrick the Starfish character doll he was given when the family went to the Universal Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida 10 years ago.\u000a\u000aAsked by his mother who he would rescue first from a sinking ship, her or the doll, Lee grimaced and groaned, unable to make up his mind.\u000a\u000aAt age eight, he was placed in a special education system in the US, where he started playing ice hockey as a sports therapy.\u000a\u000aSix years later, he turned to golf, which he had been practising during summer vacations.\u000a\u000aAutistic golfers are not completely unprecedented. Moe Norman, who won 55 Canadian Tour and other Canadian events from the 1950s to the 1970s, is believed to have suffered from the disorder. A metronomically reliable hitter of the ball, he has been described as "a supernaturally gifted yet cruelly misunderstood athlete."\u000a\u000aLee is cognitively impaired, but has a remarkable rote memory and his motor skills appear to be highly developed, according to his golf coach Kim Jong-Pil.\u000a\u000a"I think he was born as a golfer," he said.\u000a\u000aWhen they started working together, teaching him was harder than instructing 20 normal athletes at the same time, Kim said.\u000a\u000a"As he has trouble communicating, I had to teach him with actions and poses, not by words, showing him every right pose and proper muscle movement and fixing his own by touching him," he said.\u000a\u000aEtiquette was another challenge, with Lee not understanding why he should stay quiet when other players were teeing off.\u000a\u000aBut once he learned the ropes, he never looked back.\u000a\u000a"All I worry now is he is practising too hard," said the coach.\u000a\u000aBut Lee's autism may act as an advantage in competition, he said, when pressure can adversely affect performance.\u000a\u000a"Unlike ordinary athletes, he is not so tense in matches and his concentration remains high throughout a round," Kim said.\u000a\u000aLee's caddy Kim Bong-Sub, also a professional golfer, said Lee is especially strong in approach shots and putting, but has trouble making decisions -- often the case with autistics -- such as whether to lob the ball or roll it towards the hole.\u000a\u000aGolf is hugely popular in South Korea, whose women players dominate the global game, taking five of the top seven places on the current LPGA money list.\u000a\u000aLee made his debut on the country's professional golf tour at the KPGA Caido Golden V1 Open in June by invitation.\u000a\u000aHe failed to make the cut, but has secured sponsorship from South Korea's Hana Financial Group - a rarity for someone at his level.\u000a\u000a"As a patient suffering from developmental disorder, what he has achieved is remarkable indeed," said company spokesman Paul Park.\u000a\u000aLee's mother Bahk Jiae said she hoped to see her son set an example as a successful athlete with a disability.\u000a\u000a"We all hugged with each other and cried" when he qualified for the professional ranks, she said.\u000a\u000a"I was so moved when he said: 'Mom, thank you. I am sorry for having caused you so much trouble'," she said.\u000a\u000a"I never thought he was able to put his feelings into such phrases."

aVPresident Donald Trump's administration has opened the door to industry-friendly changes to a sweeping plan imposed by his predecessor to protect a ground-dwelling bird across vast areas of the West.\u000a\u000aWildlife advocates warn that the proposed changes would undercut a hard-won struggle to protect the greater sage grouse.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives of the ranching and energy industries cheered the policy shift as needed to give states flexibility.\u000a\u000aA document outlining the recommended changes was released Monday by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\u000a\u000aIt recognized for the first time the importance of livestock grazing on sage grouse habitat, said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association.\u000a\u000aIt also backed away from requirements to keep rangeland grasses and shrubs at a prescribed minimum height, which ranchers had complained was arbitrary.\u000a\u000a"I was very pleased with what I saw there in terms of the tone," Magagna said.\u000a\u000aThe ground-dwelling sage grouse has lengthy, pointed tail feathers and is known for the male's elaborate courtship display in which air sacs in the neck are inflated to make a popping sound.\u000a\u000aMillions of sage grouse once populated the West but development, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that encourages wildfires has reduced the bird's population to fewer than 500,000.\u000a\u000aStates affected by the conservation plan are California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\u000a\u000aJust how much Zinke intends to tinker with the plan that was years in the making remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aIt was hashed out under President Barack Obama and unveiled in 2015 as a solution to keeping the sage grouse off the endangered species list following a decade-long population decline caused by disease and pressure on the birds' habitat from energy development, grazing and wildfires.\u000a\u000aThe proposed changes, the result of a 60-day review of the plan by Zinke's agency, could give states wiggle room in areas such as setting population goals for sage grouse and drawing boundaries of recognized sage grouse habitat.\u000a\u000aAdvocacy groups such as The Wilderness Society and National Wildlife Federation said the proposal was a backdoor attempt to allow unfettered oil and gas development that ignored previous scientific studies showing that drilling too close to sage grouse breeding areas would harm the birds.\u000a\u000a"Wholesale changes to the plans are not necessary and could derail years of hard work," National Wildlife Federation President Collin O'Mara said in a statement. "We cannot fall victim to the false dichotomy that pits wildlife conservation against the administration's energy development goals."\u000a\u000aThe birds inhabit parts of 11 states including large swaths of Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Nevada \u2014 big ranching states that include areas with vast wind energy and gas drilling potential.\u000a\u000aWyoming has a larger number of greater sage grouse than any other state and keeping the bird off the endangered list remains a priority, Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead said.\u000a\u000a"We've come a long ways to get to this point," Mead said. "As we make changes \u2014 and certainly I think there's room for improvement \u2014 we have to move cautiously because we don't want to get to the point where the bird is listed."\u000a\u000aWyoming officials are glad the Trump administration has been talking to them about sage grouse policy, and the proposed changes include improvements, Mead said.\u000a\u000aOfficials remain concerned, however, by how the administration wants to set population goals for sage grouse. The birds are difficult to count and their numbers can fluctuate significantly from year to year in response to weather patterns, Mead said.\u000a\u000a"We want to move cautiously as to not disrupt the great work that has been done by so many over the many years," Mead said.\u000a\u000aIdaho Gov. Butch Otter said Zinke's announcement marked an appropriate step toward giving the state more power to manage sage grouse. Idaho, along with Utah and Nevada, had filed a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era conservation plans for the birds.\u000a\u000a"My staff and I stand ready to roll up our sleeves and work with the Department of the Interior to bring the federal plans into alignment with Idaho's science-based conservation plan," Otter said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe proposed changes drew a muted reaction from some other Western governors who had been heavily involved in crafting conservation plans for the birds.\u000a\u000aDemocrat Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who co-chaired a federal-state sage grouse task force established in 2011, was still reviewing Zinke's announcement, according to spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery.\u000a\u000aIn Nevada, Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval didn't have any immediate comment. Sandoval had worked closely with former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to develop sage grouse protection plans for the state.\u000a\u000aSandoval, Mead and Hickenlooper met with Zinke in April and urged him to coordinate with states before changing the Obama-era plans.\u000a\u000aAreas where sage grouse habitat and gas drilling overlap include the upper Green River Basin of western Wyoming, home of some of the biggest onshore natural gas fields in the U.S.\u000a\u000aA third gas field, the Normally Pressured Lance field, could add another 3,500 wells in a 220-square-mile area. Drilling could begin next year if the U.S. Bureau of Land Management signs off.\u000a\u000aJonah Energy LLC, recognizes the existence of sage grouse winter range in the southern part of its proposed gas field about 200 miles (321.85 kilometers) northeast of Salt Lake City, said Paul Ulrich, government affairs director at the Denver-based petroleum company.\u000a\u000a"From our perspective, that definitely presents challenges but also provides an opportunity to do what we've done from day one, which is follow the science," he said.

aVFish has long been called \u201cbrain food\u201d due to its beneficial effects on cognition. But it\u2019s not the only type of grub that\u2019s great for your noggin.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor brain health, you want foods that keep your weight down, control blood sugar and improve your vascular system,\u201d says Dr. Steven Platt, a La Jolla, Calif.-based ophthalmologist and board-certified integrative holistic medicine practitioner. \u201cFortunately, there are foods that help to do all of those things.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere are 10 of the best, according to Platt and other experts:\u000a\u000aWild Alaska salmon: Platt favors sockeye but says any variety of salmon from frigid Alaskan waters are great for the brain. \u201cWild salmon have a high concentration of essential fatty acids and DHA, the number one fat in the brain,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have a lot of other brain healthy nutrients, such as vitamin D, selenium and carotenoids, and are basically pesticide-free.\u201d\u000a\u000aAvocados: Creamy avocados have several nutrients good for gray matter. They are loaded with healthy monounsaturated fats, which help produce a neurotransmitter vital for memory and learning. They are also rich in tyrosine, an amino acid that helps with concentration, as well as brain function supporting B-complex, C, E and K vitamins.\u000a\u000aBlueberries: \u201cAll berries are good for the brain, but especially blueberries,\u201d says Platt, author of five books, including \u201cSuperfoods Rx: 14 Foods That Will Change Your Life.\u201d \u201cThey help to control blood sugar and blood pressure, and they\u2019re anti-inflammatories.\u201d The benefits come from a wide variety of flavonoids, potent antioxidants that are good for vascular health. \u201cBlueberries not only help to keep the brain young but the whole body as well,\u201d adds Platt.\u000a\u000aEggs: Unjustly maligned for decades due to their cholesterol content, eggs are now being hailed as a superfood for their wealth of nutrients. High in protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, eggs are also the best dietary source of choline, a nutrient that promotes cognition as well as the energy-producing process in brain cells. Use the whole egg because the yolk contains most of the nutrients.\u000a\u000aDark leafy greens: Kale, spinach, chard, mustard greens, watercress, and other greens offer a wide range of vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients packed into a small caloric package. \u201cThey also have nitrates, which turn into the nitric oxide, a vasodilator that improves blood flow,\u201d says Platt. \u201cAnything that gets the blood flowing better is good for the brain.\u201d\u000a\u000aWalnuts: All nuts are nutritional powerhouses, but none have the brain boosting properties of walnuts. They are one of the best sources of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant form of omega-3s, and one of the few foods that contain mood-elevating serotonin. Studies show that walnuts also have compounds that reduce inflammation and inhibit formation of the amyloid plaque, a marker of Alzheimer\u2019s. Eat them raw for best results.\u000a\u000aDark chocolate: \u201cOne of my favorite brain foods is the cacao bean, which is full of flavonoids that increase blood flow naturally,\u201d says Platt. \u201cThey\u2019re also a great anti-inflammatory, raise good cholesterol, lower bad cholesterol and have fiber and magnesium to help control blood pressure.\u201d He stresses to eat dark chocolate with at least a70 percent concentration of cacao.\u000a\u000aTea: Black tea has both calming and stimulating effects, thanks to the unique combination of the amino acid L-theonine and caffeine. The result is better concentration and memory. And studies suggest that the antioxidant catechins found in black and green tea may help prevent cognitive decline and memory loss, boost reaction time and improve mood.\u000a\u000aTurmeric: The spice commonly used in curry contains curcumin, an antioxidant that can pass through the protective blood-brain barrier to offer oxidative stress relief directly to brain cells. \u201cIn India, they eat about two grams of turmeric a day, and there is a very low incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d says Platt. \u201cThere\u2019s a study under way to see what that relationship is, but I\u2019m betting it\u2019s no coincidence.\u201d\u000a\u000aYogurt: Fermented foods like yogurt nourish the gut microbiome by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, and that\u2019s good for the brain. Too much \u201cbad\u201d gut bacteria creates toxic byproducts that damage brain cells. Make sure you choose plain yogurt with \u201clive and active cultures.\u201d Other fermented foods, such as kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, kefir and tamari, will also work.

aVWith Donald Trump vacationing at one of his golf resorts, the rest of us may have a chance to relax. But in truth, it's more like a short break in a continuing nightmare, with just enough time to turn on the light, look at the clock and ponder where we are before the nightmare envelopes us again.\u000a\u000aWhat can we ponder that will make all of this a bit less frightening? For one thing, it could be far worse. Trump could have fulfilled his campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, lock up Hillary Clinton, build a wall and throw out all immigrants without papers.\u000a\u000aBy now, he might have confused so many Americans about the truth that most of us would believe the words coming out of his mouth. Hell, by now he could have incited another civil war.\u000a\u000aActually, very little has happened. He's huffed and puffed, threatened and fumed, yet almost none of it has found its way into concrete laws. And maybe it never will: The typical "honeymoon" enjoyed by new presidents is over for him. His first hundred days came and went, almost without a trace.\u000a\u000aAnother thing is that Trump's "favorables," as pollsters call them, continue to tumble into territory never before seen at this stage of a presidency. Only about a third of the country still supports him; the opinions of the rest range from bad to awful. And Trump's credibility is shot.\u000a\u000aEven Republicans in Congress are now more willing to buck him. (Some are even talking about fixing what needs fixing in Obamacare.) Meanwhile, special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury with the power to subpoena Trump's financial records. Didn't Trump hint he'd fire Mueller if he did this? Wouldn't firing Mueller be the beginning of the end?\u000a\u000aTrump has also ignited a prairie fire of grassroots activism, almost all of it against him. Across the country, people who were never politically active are rolling up their sleeves and getting involved \u2014 attending congressional town hall meetings, writing letters to the editors of their local papers, organizing for the 2018 midterm elections. Some are even running for office themselves.\u000a\u000aThis outburst of political effort resisting Trump has no parallel in recent history. John F. Kennedy asked Americans to ponder what they might do for America; Donald Trump is getting them to actually do it.\u000a\u000aIn the middle of the night, one's thoughts also turn to where we are in life. Trump was born in 1946, the same year Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and, coincidentally, Clinton's own special prosecutor, Ken Starr, were born. And yours truly. We are all, shall we say, beyond our prime. There's only so much damage a septuagenarian can do from here on.\u000a\u000aTo put it another way, a few weeks from now I'll be returning to the classroom and a new crop of college freshmen. They were born in or around 1998. Chronologically, they're as far removed from Trump and the rest of us early boomers as we were, when we went to college, from Americans born in 1894. Which is to say, a very long way.\u000a\u000aSo unless Trump brings on a nuclear war that ends life on the planet as we know it, he is unlikely to have much influence on the lives of my incoming freshmen. His first (and perhaps only) term in office will be over when they're just 22. Think of being 22 years old and having your whole life ahead of you, without Trump.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Trump has been a boon to ethicists, moral philosophers and the rest of us who tend to wake up in the night and think about big scary things. Trump has brought the nation back to first principles.\u000a\u000aMost presidents spur debates over issues such as whether the economy needs a more stimulative fiscal policy, or whether America should support the expansion of NATO to the Baltic states. Trump has made us debate whether the U.S. economy can exist separate from the rest of the world, and whether we should even belong to NATO.\u000a\u000aSome presidents get us talking about civil rights and civil liberties. Trump has got us talking about democracy versus tyranny.\u000a\u000aI don't mean to minimize the damage he's already done. I don't remember America ever being so angry and divided \u2014 not even through the battles over civil rights and Vietnam. Trump has also demeaned the office of the presidency, licensed bigotry, appointed absurdly incompetent people to his Cabinet, violated every ethics and conflict-of-interest rule imaginable, reduced America's influence and moral authority in the world, and may even have conspired with a foreign power to rig a presidential election.\u000a\u000aThat's a lot in just under seven months. He deserves a vacation.\u000a\u000aBut taking the slightly longer view, the nation is still functioning. Our democratic institutions have so far withstood the test and remain strong, just as the Founding Fathers intended. Presidential power is checked and balanced, so the current occupant of the Oval Office is hemmed in. Plus, our friends and allies around the world understand that our condition is temporary. America will be back.\u000a\u000aIt has been an incredibly stressful time, but most of us are OK. In fact, I'd venture to say most Americans remain optimistic \u2014 especially my incoming college freshmen, who have their whole lives ahead of them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRobert Reich, a former U.S. Secretary of Labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of "Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few," now available in paperback.

aVThe Trump administration's attempt to cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities will fail in court, at least initially, Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said Monday.\u000a\u000aThat is because the money currently allocated for cities was approved during the Obama administration and came with no strings attached, Napolitano said Monday on Fox News' "America's Newsroom."\u000a\u000aChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced Monday his city is suing over the order announced last month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that funds will be withheld from cities, such as Chicago, who refuse to give federal immigration officials notice before they release illegal immigrants from police custody.\u000a\u000aBut, Napolitano said, Sessions is "trying to add a string after Congress gave the money out," and for that, "the courts will stop him."\u000a\u000aThat said, when the next budget is passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Trump, such strings can be attached.\u000a\u000aEmanuel and other mayors of sanctuary cities "will be in a bind when the money starts coming after October, which will be part of the Trump budget with those strings attached. . . . You accept cash from the federal government, and it's got strings attached, you have to comply with the strings."

aVPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut legal immigration to the United States in half over the next decade is a rock-solid idea that will shore up the middle class and boost the economy, Michael Cutler, a former top Immigration and Naturalization Service special agent, told Newsmax TV on Friday.\u000a\u000a"I hope it becomes law, I know there's too many politicians on both side of the aisle who are globalist. This isn't the left-right issue . . . This is about globalist versus populist. Donald Trump believes in sovereign borders," Cutler said to Newsmax's JD Hayworth.\u000a\u000a"To take the position of being pro-enforcement is not to take a position that's anti-immigrant. We admit more than 1 million lawful immigrants every year, the president says that's too much, let's cut it in half.\u000a\u000a"That would still make it, I would believe, the most generous immigration policy, admission policy, of any country on the planet."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

aVThe Justice Department is trying to shore up faltering confidence in forensic science and how its experts describe their findings in court, a push that comes months after similar efforts dating to the Obama administration were suspended.\u000a\u000aThe department said Monday it is reviving work on federal standards for forensic expert testimony, an effort initiated following revelations in 2015 that FBI experts had overstated the strength of evidence involving microscopic hair analysis in hundreds of cases dating back decades.\u000a\u000aLongstanding concerns remain about the reliability of certain forensics evidence in criminal cases across the country, as research increasingly shows that techniques such as comparisons of hair found at crime scenes, handwriting analyses, bite-mark evidence and certain ballistics tests are scientifically flawed.\u000a\u000aDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he is forming a "forensic science working group" whose top missions will be setting uniform standards for how experts testify about such evidence and creating a program to monitor the accuracy of forensic testimony. It will also conduct a broad look at the personnel and equipment needs of the nation's overburdened crime labs, among other aims. He made the announcement during a private gathering of forensics professionals in Atlanta.\u000a\u000a"We must use forensic analysis carefully, but we must continue to use it," he said, according to prepared remarks. "We should not exclude reliable forensic analysis \u2014 or any reliable expert testimony \u2014 simply because it is based on human judgment."\u000a\u000aThe working group takes the place of an Obama-era commission of independent scientists that aimed to improve the reliability of forensic science and advise the attorney general on the use of scientific evidence in the criminal justice process.\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions allowed the National Commission on Forensic Science to expire in April, raising concerns among defense attorneys and other advocates about the future of the Justice Department's work in that arena. They believed the commission and its array of voices offered a better chance for an independent look at questionable techniques that have long been used in American courtrooms than would an internal Justice Department committee.\u000a\u000aPeter Neufeld, a former member of the national commission and a co-founder of the Innocence Project, praised the effort to set guidelines for forensic testimony but said keeping the working group within the Justice Department is misguided.\u000a\u000a"What is most unfortunate is that they want to make the entire effort to improve forensic science an in-house working group, as opposed to an independent, transparent and science-driven, proactive entity," he said. "It misses the point that forensic science is not simply about public safety, it's about achieving justice."\u000a\u000aRosenstein said the working group would consider the more than 250 comments and suggestions the department received in response to the commission's disbanding.\u000a\u000aThe new group will be led by Ted Hunt, a longtime prosecutor from Missouri whose online biography says he has worked on more than 100 felony trials, most of which have involved DNA or other forensic evidence. He was also involved with the commission.\u000a\u000aA 2015 Justice Department review of lab examiners' testimony found errors relating to hair analysis in at least 90 percent of trial transcripts and covered a period before 2000. The FBI says it has improved its practices since the late 1990s. But following the discovery of flawed forensics, the department last year issued draft standards for examining and reporting forensic evidence in court.\u000a\u000aThe draft guidance covered seven forensic science disciplines, including drug and chemical analysis, body fluid testing, latent fingerprints and toxicology. And it was slated to apply to employees at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\u000a\u000aOfficials received public comment on the drafts, but the new administration halted work on them so Rosenstein could weigh in on the best course of action. A wider review that sought to determine whether other scientific disciplines have been tainted by flawed testimony was also suspended ahead of the new administration. It was not immediately clear whether that will resume.

"It's a trend that does not bode well for hopes of de-escalating tensions on the [Korean] peninsula."\u000a\u000aWhen asked about the story on "Fox and Friends," Ambassador Nikki Haley said, "I can't talk about anything that's classified and if that's in the newspaper that's a shame."\u000a\u000aShe added, when asked if the information was leaked, "it's one of those things I don't know what's going on. I will tell you it's incredibly dangerous when things get out into the press like that."\u000a\u000aHaley continued, "you are not only just getting a scoop on something, you are playing with people's lives, and this has got to stop. Wherever the leaks are coming from, if somebody thinks they are getting power or fame from it, all you are doing is putting Americans in danger."\u000a\u000aRep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., told CNN Tuesday that "It is alarming the casualness with which President Trump shares classifieds information," adding, "just because something is in the press doesn't make that information no longer classified, so the president should not be tweeting classified information just because he is the president."

Bar have open cases against Allred, who is famous for taking controversial celebrity cases and is representing a woman who has accused President Donald Trump of sexually harassing and assaulting her years ago.\u000a\u000a"Gloria Allred severely injured me and my family and refuses accountability," Kyle Hunter told LawNewz in a statement.

aVIt was a "tough decision" to switch party affiliations from Democrat to Republican, but at the end of the day, West Virginia's issues made the decision not so hard after all," Gov. Jim Justice said Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"Any time you make that decision you say lots of prayers, discuss it with your family," Justice, who announced his decision during a rally with President Donald Trump last Thursday, told Fox News' "Fox and Friends" program.\u000a\u000a"We've got real issues in West Virginia. I've inherited a dog's mess, that's all there is to it."\u000a\u000aJustice said that when it "got to crunchtime" and he needed the Democratic party, "They walked away from me, and we've let a lot of people in our state get hurt."\u000a\u000aThe governor said he has switched parties "for one reason and one reason only. That is to get something done and to do stuff for the great people of West Virginia."\u000a\u000aJustice, 66, is a businessman whose family owns coal mines and farms. He funded his own campaign, for the most part, against then-Republican State Senate President Bill Cole, and spoke often during the campaign and after about his friendship with the Trump family, and took Trump's son, Donald Jr., turkey hunting and trout fishing this year.\u000a\u000aHowever, the governor switched his party affiliation to Democrat in 2015, just before running for governor, saying that he wanted to put aside partisan politics and that he had changed his party registration multiple times.\u000a\u000a"I am much more suited to be a Democrat because I truly want to be the person who is trying to take up for the little guy," he said at the time.\u000a\u000aHe said Tuesday Democrats walked away when it got to "crunch time," as they "dove into the ditch" when it came to helping vote in many of his agenda items.\u000a\u000a"We had enough Republican votes and Republican Senate right with us and enough Republicans house votes with their votes to get passed my agenda," said Justice. "The reason they dove into the ditch, was just down-right, no good for nothing politics. When they dove into the ditch, everything eroded and lots and lots of our people got hurt."\u000a\u000aTrump won big in West Virginia in November, and Fox News host Steve Doocy said he thought that perhaps, when the president last week said he had a big announcement coming in the state, it would be that Sen. Joe Manchin was going to announce he would switch parties.\u000a\u000aJustice said he would love for that to happen. Manchin, though, said he will continue to do what he thinks best for the state, and that he doesn't really care if he is not re-elected as a result.\u000a\u000aThe governor continued on Tuesday that he wishes people and the press would get off Trump's back.\u000a\u000a"I mean, this man is trying," said Justice. "This man is a good man. He really cares. This is not reality TV show. This is serious stuff. I mean you think, our stock market is at all-time high. Unemployment going down the tubes, going away from us completely."\u000a\u000aThere are real issues all over the world, especially with North korea.\u000a\u000a"Don't think Rex Tillerson will show up with like John Kerry, with James Taylor singing 'You've Got a Friend,'" said Justice. "This is real issues and serious stuff."\u000a\u000aJustice said he does think the attacks on Trump are energizing him.\u000a\u000a"This is a determined man, that's for sure, but at the same time he is caring man, he has a sensitive part to him that a lot of people don't really realize or know," said Justice. "Even if you're a tough guy, that sensitive part you know, it wears on you, and that's why I wish to goodness we would all realize we're Americans."

aVA Missouri police officer was killed during a traffic stop, and authorities are searching for a 39-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said Monday.\u000a\u000aClinton police officer Gary Michael, 37, who had been on the force less than a year, died late Sunday near Clinton, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City, Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Lowe said. The traffic stop involved a registration violation, Lowe said.\u000a\u000aThe vehicle stopped was registered to Ian McCarthy of Clinton. Lowe said Monday that McCarthy is suspected in the killing. The driver fired at Michael, who was able to return fire, then he drove away but crashed and fled on foot, Lowe said. It was not clear if the driver was shot or injured in the crash.\u000a\u000aOfficers searched a house Monday morning where McCarthy was thought to be, but he was not there. Lowe said authorities believe he is still on foot somewhere in the Clinton area.\u000a\u000aCourt records indicate McCarthy pleaded guilty in November 2013 in Missouri to a misdemeanor driving without a valid license. In July 2015, he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm. Court records don't indicate the outcome of that case.\u000a\u000aMichael was a lifelong resident of Clinton and leaves behind a wife and stepsons.\u000a\u000a"In a small community, the police department is very tight-knit, so it's obviously devastating for the family and also for the police department," Lowe said. "(Michael) was heroic right to the end. He was protecting his community."

aVWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Ukraine and Lithuania are protesting a proposal by Poland's nationalist government to include images in Polish passports of landmarks in formerly Polish cities that are now within the borders of those neighboring countries.\u000a\u000aThe Polish proposal appears to break a longstanding practice of not making any claim, even symbolic, in former Polish territories lost in the redrawing of borders during the 20th century. The matter threatens to strain ties with both Lithuania, an ally in NATO and the European Union, and Ukraine, a neighbor that Warsaw has for years supported in its struggle for greater Western integration.\u000a\u000aThe new passports are to be introduced in 2018 as part of commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of Poland regaining its independence after more than a century of foreign rule. The pages will include background images of 13 national symbols that have already been chosen and 13 others which Poles have been called on to vote on.\u000a\u000aAmong those that have been chosen already is a Polish military cemetery in Lviv, Ukraine, while the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius, Lithuania, is among those Poles can pick. The voting is to run through Sept. 10.\u000a\u000aUkraine's Foreign Ministry said late Monday it had summoned the Polish ambassador, calling the inclusion of the Lviv cemetery "an unfriendly step that will have a negative impact on the development of the Ukraine-Polish strategic partnership."\u000a\u000aThe ministry urged Poland to refrain from "politicizing certain facts of history."\u000a\u000aThe step follows a similar move last week in Lithuania, where the Foreign Ministry summoned Poland's interim ambassador.\u000a\u000a"We explained the situation and told him that it is not the way things should be moving. We are watching the situation closely and have already informed Poles about our attitude regarding this episode," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told reporters last week.\u000a\u000aSome Polish commentators also criticized the proposals, saying it would be as if the German state in its official documents used symbols of previously German cities that were given to Poland in the redrawing of borders that followed World War II.

aVMiddle-aged people with risk factors for heart attacks and stroke may be more likely to develop dementia in old age than people with healthy cardiovascular systems, a U.S. study suggests.\u000a\u000aLike previous research, the current study linked so-called vascular risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, and high blood pressure to higher odds of dementia. However, the study also found an increased risk of dementia for older adults who had only slightly elevated blood pressure in middle age, a condition known as prehypertension.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis study showed associations, but doesn\u2019t prove that treating risk factors actually decreases risk,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Rebecca Gottesman of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat being said, we know that it is important otherwise for your heart and brain health to control obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and to quit smoking,\u201d Gottesman said by email. \u201cIt is likely that controlling these over time is helpful for reducing dementia risk.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe researchers examined data on 15,744 adults living in Maryland, North Carolina, Mississippi and Minnesota.\u000a\u000aAt the start, participants ranged in age from 44 to 66, with an average age of 57.\u000a\u000aRoughly 25 years later, 1,516 people had been diagnosed with dementia, researchers report in JAMA Neurology.\u000a\u000aThe oldest participants were about eight times more likely to develop dementia than the youngest people in the study.\u000a\u000aPeople with a gene, APOE, that\u2019s associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were twice as likely to develop dementia as individuals without this gene.\u000a\u000aSmoking in middle age was associated with 41 percent higher odds of dementia later on, while diabetes was linked to a 77 percent greater risk.\u000a\u000aSo-called prehypertension, when blood pressure is elevated but not high enough to be formally diagnosed as high blood pressure, was tied to a 31 percent higher likelihood of dementia. Full-blown hypertension was associated with 39 percent greater odds of dementia.\u000a\u000aThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove if or how poor cardiovascular health in middle age might contribute to dementia later in life.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that vascular risk factors lead to strokes, which damage the brain and cause cognitive impairment, said Dr. Andrew Budson, chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System and a researcher at Boston University.\u000a\u000aVascular disease might also hasten changes in the brain that contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common type of dementia, Budson, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of these modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension and diabetes, damage the endothelium - the inside of blood vessel walls - that in time, leads to strokes,\u201d Budson added.\u000a\u000aHealthy blood vessels in middle age may help protect against cognitive decline, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, co-director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center in Kansas City.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese findings underscore the importance of taking action in mid-life to reduce the long-term risk of dementia,\u201d Burns, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\u000a\u000aThis may include quitting smoking or changing diet and exercise habits to reduce the risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, said Hannah Gardener, a neurology researcher at the University of Miami Medical School in Florida who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000aThe American Heart Association recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats, eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry, and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt.\u000a\u000a\u201cPhysical activity and adherence to a healthy diet, like a Mediterranean-style diet, are powerful tools that can help at-risk individuals lose weight, reduce blood pressure and maintain healthy (blood sugar) levels,\u201d Gardener said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cFocusing on these risk factors even before midlife provides patients an opportunity to treat and reverse these risk factors with the goal of reducing their dementia risk before it is too late,\u201d Gardener said.

aVFormer Reagan administration appointee, talk show host, and conservative scholar Mark Levin asks a very pertinent question regarding our leviathan federal government during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), " . . . how are these people experts? They're part of the Civil Service; they're part of a public sector union, some of them have their jobs because of seniority; some of them have them because of affirmative action . . . So the whole myth that government is filled with these experts who are noble, who are going to improve healthcare and education and so forth, it's been a myth, it's been a lie from day one, from their philosophers, to their thinkers, to their current politicians, like Bernie Sanders."\u000a\u000aLevin is convinced conservatives are in a battle of ideas that we are losing.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why he\u2019s written his new book "Rediscovering Americanism," which is already a New York Times bestseller. In his book Levin teaches or rediscovers the philosophy of "natural law" that was the intellectual foundation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\u000a\u000aEqually important, Levin exposes the philosophy of the "expert class" of big government advocates working tirelessly to undermine both documents.\u000a\u000aLevin writes the Founding Fathers believed in the truth of natural law, "There are universal laws, there are universal, eternal truths; right and wrong, good and evil, a moral order. People are to be virtuous, prudential, and be temperate and so forth and so on. What does it mean, these universal truths? These God\u2013given universal truths, man can't make them, man can't take them away, whether it's in the form of a legislature or a dictator or a vote of your community."\u000a\u000aProgressives, or leftists, reject this belief in favor of a system of order built by "experts." Beginning with President Woodrow Wilson, the left has sought to replace the Constitution with an invented "living Constitution" that has its air pumped into it by the political fashion of the day. "The early progressives like Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and these fellows \u2014 they relied on philosophers like Karl Marx and Georg Friedrich Hegel and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, all of whom reject the notion of the laws of nature and nature's God," Levin explained.\u000a\u000aWilson comes in for particular scorn from Levin, "He relentlessly attacked the principles of the Declaration of Independence. He dismissed them and he dismissed the Declaration of Independence as a revolutionary document by pioneers that has nothing to do with a modern and complex society as he had to as a progressive."\u000a\u000aIf you agree with Wilson then this is probably not the book for you. But if you feel that our modern U.S. is missing a coherent philosophical center and you would like to learn more about what Levin feels the Founding Fathers believed and we are missing, then "Rediscovering Americanism" is a great place to start.\u000a\u000aAnd there is no time like now to begin. As Levin warns, ". . . if we do not engage in the battle of ideas \u2014 not so much against elites, but elitism \u2014 we're going to lose because most societies are formed by the elites, by the intellectuals by the academics whether we like it or not."\u000a\u000aMichael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

aVThe U.S. Department of the Interior said it has rescinded an Obama-era rule that reformed how energy companies value sales of oil, gas and coal extracted from federal and tribal land to protect taxpayers because it caused "confusion and uncertainty" for energy companies.\u000a\u000aInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the department's newly formed royalty policy committee would propose alternatives to the rule and "remain committed to collecting every dollar due."\u000a\u000a"Repealing the valuation rule provides a clean slate to create workable valuation regulations," Zinke said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe valuation rule was proposed by former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell last year to close a loophole that enabled companies to dodge royalty payments when mining on taxpayer-owned public land. It required energy companies to pay royalties on sales to the first unaffiliated customer, known as an arm's-length sale, as the fuel moves to market.\u000a\u000aA Reuters investigation found in 2012 that coal companies were using affiliated brokers to settle royalty payments on exports to Asia at much lower domestic prices.\u000a\u000aZinke said the valuation rule had increased costs for coal, oil and gas companies, which hampered production on federal lands, "making us rely more and more on foreign imports of oil and gas."\u000a\u000aIndustry stakeholders and trade associations filed three lawsuits challenging the Obama-era rule.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a taxpayer watchdog group, found that taxpayers missed out on nearly $30 billion in revenues over three decades because of the loophole.\u000a\u000aThe repeal of the valuation Rule was published in the Federal Register on Aug. 7 and will become effective on Sept. 6.

aVEating foods high in fiber, such as those found in a Mediterranean diet, was tied to a lower risk of gallbladder surgery in a recent French study.\u000a\u000aCompared to people who didn\u2019t follow a Mediterranean diet pattern, those who adhered to it most closely had a significantly lower likelihood of needing a cholecystectomy, which is the medical term for an operation to remove the gallbladder, say the authors.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe found that higher intakes of legumes, fruit, vegetable oil, and (whole grain) bread were associated with decreased cholecystectomy risk, and a higher intake of ham was associated with higher risk of cholecystectomy,\u201d wrote the authors in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\u000a\u000aAbout 700,000 cholecystectomies are performed every year in the United States, according to the American College of Surgeons. Most are the result of blockage due to gallstones.\u000a\u000a\u201cGallstones are very common, but most of them are asymptomatic, meaning people have no symptoms. If you don't have any symptoms from your gallstones, there's no reason to have your gallbladder removed,\u201d said Dr. James Lewis, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who was not part of the study.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of people with gallstones never have problems from them, Lewis said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen they do cause problems, then having your gallbladder removed is completely appropriate,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe new study, led by Dr. Amelie Barre at the University of Paris Sud in Orsay, used information on nearly 64,000 women who were born between 1925 and 1950 and covered by a national insurance plan. Every two years, they answered questions about their health status, medical history, and lifestyle.\u000a\u000aOver the course of 18 years, 2,778 of the women had their gallbladder removed.\u000a\u000aWomen who ate the most legumes, fruits, vegetable oil, and whole grain bread were anywhere from 13 to 27 percent less likely to have gallbladder surgery than were women who ate the least of those foods.\u000a\u000aA western dietary pattern - including high consumption of processed meat, canned fish, eggs, rice, pasta, appetizers, pizza, potatoes, cakes, and alcohol - was not linked with either a higher or lower risk for the surgery. There was, however, an association of ham intake with cholecystectomy risk.\u000a\u000aBut when researchers assigned a Mediterranean diet score to all participants, they found that women with the highest scores were 11 percent less likely to have the surgery compared to women with the lowest scores.\u000a\u000aThis type of observational study can\u2019t prove that a Mediterranean diet was the reason for women\u2019s lower risk of gallbladder surgery, or that ham intake caused a higher risk. Furthermore, dietary intakes were self-reported at just one point in time. The reports may not have been accurate, and women\u2019s diets may have changed over time.\u000a\u000aStill, Lewis said, the Mediterranean-style diet has consistently been shown to be associated with living longer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf people really want to think about what they should be eating in order to increase their longevity, it's very easy for me to recommend to them that they should try and follow a Mediterranean-style diet,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently advised Americans to follow a diet that is very similar to a Mediterranean-style diet, Lewis noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is just one of many reasons that we should be following that style diet. If you look at the published literature on dietary patterns, what you'll see is that Mediterranean-style diet has been associated with a reduced overall mortality but also reduced cardiovascular mortality (and) reduced risks of cancer,\u201d he said.

For current and former smokers, the added risk of a high fat diet was 15 percent.\u000a\u000aWhile the best way to lower the risk of lung cancer is to not smoke, \u201ca healthy diet may also help reduce lung cancer risk,\u201d said study co-author Danxia Yu of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\u000a\u000a\u201cSpecifically, our findings suggest that increasing polyunsaturated fat intake while reducing saturated fat intake, especially among smokers and recent quitters, may (help prevent) not only cardiovascular disease but also lung cancer,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aThe American Heart Association recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats, eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry, and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose guidelines are the same for avoiding heart disease, stroke and diabetes, and I would say they are also exactly the same for helping with cancer prevention in general and lung cancer in particular,\u201d said Dr. Nathan Berger, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean you need to throw away all the steak and butter in your freezer, but cutting back to once a week would be good for you,\u201d Berger said in a phone interview.\u000a\u000aFor the current study, researchers examined data from 10 previously published studies in the United States, Europe and Asia that looked at how dietary fat intake influences the odds of lung malignancies.\u000a\u000aCombined, the smaller studies had more than 1.4 million participants, including 18,822 with cases of lung cancer identified during an average follow-up of more than nine years.\u000a\u000aResearchers sorted participants into five categories, from lowest to highest consumption of total and saturated fats. They also sorted participants into five groups ranging from the lowest to highest amounts of dietary unsaturated fats.\u000a\u000aOverall, people who ate the most unsaturated fats were 8 percent less likely to develop lung cancer than people who ate the least amounts, researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\u000a\u000aSubstituting five percent of calories from saturated fat with unsaturated fat was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of small cell lung cancer and 17 percent lower odds of another type of lung malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma.\u000a\u000aOne limitation of the study is that dietary information was only obtained at one point, the authors note. This makes it impossible to track how changes in eating habits might influence the odds of cancer.\u000a\u000aThey also didn\u2019t account for two other things that may contribute to cancer \u2013 sugar and trans fats, Glen Lawrence, a biochemistry researcher at Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York, said by email. Previous research has also found that unsaturated oils may increase the risk of certain cancers, added Lawrence, who wasn\u2019t involved in the current study.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that other bad eating habits, not fat, contribute to the increased risk of lung cancer, said Ursula Schwab of the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need antioxidants, vitamins and minerals as well as unsaturated fatty acids,\u201d Schwab, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cA typical Western diet has a low content of these essential nutrients and a high content of saturated fat.\u201d

aVEvangelical supporters of President Donald Trump on Monday requested a meeting with Pope Francis over a recent critical article in a Vatican-vetted journal.\u000a\u000aJohnnie Moore, a leader of Trump's evangelical advisory board and a spokesman for some of its members, said he sent the request to Rome in response to an article published last month that accused some American Catholics of building an alliance of "hate" with evangelicals who backed the president.\u000a\u000aThe two authors of the piece are confidants of Francis. They published their article in the Jesuit journal La Civilta Cattolica, which is reviewed by the Vatican Secretariat of State.\u000a\u000aMoore said he sought the meeting with the pope and Vatican officials to address "efforts to divide Catholics and Evangelicals."\u000a\u000a"We think it would be of great benefit to sit together and to discuss these things. Then, when we disagree we can do it within the context of friendship," Moore wrote in his letter to the pontiff.\u000a\u000aThe July 13 article warned that the decades-old political alliance between some American Catholics and evangelicals had "gradually radicalized" to promote conflict and hatred and a "xenophobic and Islamophobic vision that wants walls and purifying deportations."\u000a\u000aFrancis has made helping refugees and immigrants a top priority of his papacy. Trump has sought to bar travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The president has said the measures were key to fighting terrorism and protecting national security.\u000a\u000aThe article has prompted an outpouring of criticism from conservative American Catholics and evangelicals, who contend the article grossly misrepresents their views to make a political point. The article's authors have stood by their conclusions, re-posting the piece regularly on Twitter over the last month.

aVSpecial:\u000a\u000aTop Doc Shares Simple Daily Habits for Healthy Prostate\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aThe One Thing Your Prostate Needs Every Morning\u000a\u000aRobotic surgery is a method of treating prostate cancer that allows doctors to make several small incisions in the abdomen to remove the prostate cancer with as little damage to surrounding tissue as possible. The surgeon controls robotic arms from a panel near the operating table.The robotic procedure results in less pain and blood loss as well as quicker recovery time than in traditional methods in which a surgeon makes a single long incision to remove the prostate and surrounding tissues.Robotic surgery is also called robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy or RALRP. According to the American Cancer Society , it has similar results for the patient to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, or LRP, which includes several small incisions using an instrument with a tiny video camera to let the surgeon see inside the abdomen.Robotic surgery has advantages over laparoscopic methods, da Vinci Surgery reported . More patients appear to return to normal erectile function following a 12-month checkup. Erectile dysfunction is a common concern for men undergoing prostate surgery.The da Vinci system provides a clearer vision for the surgeon to operate with precision, dexterity and control, da Vinci Surgery noted. It allows more precise removal of cancer tissue. This results in a shorter operation than with traditional laparoscopy. There is a lower risk of complications. Patients also find a quicker return of urinary continence.The precision of robotic surgery helps to avoid damaging or removing healthy prostate tissue and clearing away the prostate cancer, according to Dr. David B. Samadi, chief of robotic surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Other laparoscopic methods allow a lower resolution image through the small video camera, causing a limited field of vision for the surgeon, Samadi explained.With better vision through robotic surgery, the surgeon has an easier time removing malignant tissue with limited interference and harm to surrounding tissue. The potential for scarring is lessened and patients have a shorter recovery period.The risk of infection at the incision site is reduced through the da Vinci system. The size of the incision is smaller than with traditional methods. Fewer and smaller incisions with robotic surgery lead to little or no visible scarring. Scar tissue build-up may affect the full function of the prostate.The success of robotic surgery may depend on the experience of the surgeon, according to the Urology Care Foundation , which noted that the more surgeries a doctor has done, the better the chance he or she will have in performing the surgery with a reduced risk of complications.

aVThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday approved Celgene Corp and Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc's oral treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a rare genetic mutation.\u000a\u000aThe drug, Idhifa, will have a monthly list price of $24,872, Celgene said in an email, noting that the median time on therapy for patients was 4.3 months in the trial to secure the FDA's approval.\u000a\u000aThe list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Their 'out-of-pocket' cost is based on their individual healthcare insurance plans and duration of treatment.\u000a\u000aAML is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow and progresses rapidly, resulting in an abnormal increase in white blood cells. It is generally diagnosed in older people, and is uncommon before the age of 45.\u000a\u000aThe drug secured approval for relapsed or refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation. It is to be used along with a diagnostic test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, designed to detect the mutation.\u000a\u000a"While the product isn't expected to be a big needle mover for Celgene, it does represent the first approval for a partnered product," J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said, pointing out that the drug targeted "an area of clear high unmet need."\u000a\u000aNovartis AG's recently approved AML drug, Rydapt, has a list price of $7,495 for a 14-day treatment duration and $14,990 for a 28-day duration.\u000a\u000aHowever, Novartis' treatment is approved for newly diagnosed patients with AML carrying a specific genetic mutation called FLT3.\u000a\u000aIdhifa's approval comes with a boxed warning \u2014 the strongest mandated by the FDA \u2014 designed to call attention to the risk of differentiation syndrome, an adverse reaction that could be fatal if untreated.\u000a\u000aDifferentiation syndrome is characterized by fever, respiratory distress and multi-organ dysfunction.\u000a\u000aIdhifa is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with an IDH2 mutation, a group that accounts for 8 to 19 percent of all AML patients. In the United States, that translates to about 1,200 to 1,500 patients, Celgene said.\u000a\u000aOppenheimer's Leah Rush Cann said in a client note that the drug could generate sales of $1.4 billion in 2021.\u000a\u000aAbout 21,380 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in 2017 and some 10,590 patients will succumb to the disease this year, according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.

aVThe Trump administration is considering reducing the annual $1 million mortgage deduction cap for U.S. homeowners as a part of its broader tax reform, despite earlier promises to protect the tax advantage, Politico reported.\u000a\u000aPolitico said the popular deduction came up this week at a White House roundtable with real estate industry representatives led by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. The publication quoted an attendee as saying Cohn was willing to "ruffle some feathers" by putting everything on the table.\u000a\u000aThe Internal Revenue Service says homeowners can deduct all interest on mortgages of up to $1 million. Lowering the mortgage deduction cap could help pay for major tax cuts for businesses and individuals that Republicans view as crucial for driving U.S. economic growth.\u000a\u000aBut the White House pushed back on the notion that its position has changed.\u000a\u000a"As we've said since we introduced our principles in April, we intend to protect the homeownership deductions," White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said.\u000a\u000aCohn told Bloomberg TV Friday that the 35 percent U.S. corporate tax rate should be more in line with the 24 percent average rate among other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\u000a\u000a"We cannot be substantially higher than the OECD average tax rate out there," he said. "We've got to get in line with the rest of the world, we've got to entice capital to be invested in the United States."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump wants to cut the corporate rate far lower to 15 percent, a level that Republicans in Congress view as unlikely. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters this week it would be a challenge to get the rate to 25 percent.\u000a\u000aIn a separate Friday interview on Fox Business Network, Cohn said the administration and Congress are committed to get as low a rate as possible for businesses.\u000a\u000aTwo congressional tax committees are drafting tax legislation that is expected to be unveiled in September. Republicans hope to pass the bill before the end of 2017.\u000a\u000aCongress faces a packed legislative agenda when lawmakers return to Washington in September after their August break, including the task of raising the debt ceiling before October, when the Treasury Department is expected to fully exhaust its remaining borrowing capacity.\u000a\u000aCohn told Fox the administration is well aware of the calendar and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is working to ensure the debt ceiling gets raised.

Even if it's appropriately release to the public, it shouldn't be released through a leak.\u000a\u000a"If it's appropriate, then you issue a statement on White House stationery saying here's what we're doing, here's what's coming out, but the idea of having this continuum of illegal leaks, legal leaks, felonious leaks, non-felonious leaks . . ."\u000a\u000aDershowitz also said he believes the media encourages leaks.\u000a\u000a"Not only social media, the social media does, but The New York Times does," Dershowitz said. "The New York Times prints anonymously sourced damaging material and encourages leaks. There's a big difference between using leaks that come to you, that's protected by the First Amendment.\u000a\u000a"But encouraging people to engage in illegal behavior, that is not journalistically ethical, and I think that journalists from The New York Times down, or up, depending on where you see The New York Times, have to look in the mirror and ask themselves, are they becoming complicit in illegal behavior by encouraging and facilitating the leaks?"

aVIt can be tough for people with diabetes to choose appropriate over-the-counter medicines for a cold, cough or headache, a pharmacist explains.\u000a\u000aMany of these so-called OTC drugs contain carbohydrates (including sugar) that can affect blood sugar levels, or ingredients that can interact with diabetes medications, according to Miranda Wilhelm. She is a clinical associate professor at Southern Illinois University School of Pharmacy.\u000a\u000aBut labels on OTC medicines don't list carbohydrates, she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm was to present a report on the topic Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, in Indianapolis.\u000a\u000a"It's a dilemma because in some cases the carbs are so high it's equivalent to a snack," Wilhelm said in an association news release.\u000a\u000a"On the other hand, if you actually read the ingredients, you might be afraid to take something that's safe and could help with symptoms. In other words, you may not be limited to OTC medicines that are formulated for people with diabetes, and that's surprising for most people with the condition," she said.\u000a\u000aWilhelm offered the following advice:\u000a\u000aGood diabetes management is important. "If your A1C levels are well-managed and your blood pressure is at or near your goal, you should be fine taking most OTC medicines -- whether or not they contain carbohydrates -- if you just need them for a few days," she said.\u000a\u000aRead the label. "If you're concerned about your blood sugar levels, look for medicines labeled 'sugar-free' or 'for people with diabetes,'" Wilhem suggested.\u000a\u000aTake pills instead of liquids. Liquid forms of medicines typically contain more carbohydrates, and sometimes as much alcohol as a glass of beer or wine, she said.\u000a\u000aIf possible, choose a "topical" medicine. The reason: They don't get into your bloodstream. For example, a nasal spray is better for treating a stuffy nose than a medicine you take by mouth. If you have muscle pain, ice the area and use a skin cream that treats pain instead of taking Motrin, Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen).\u000a\u000aGet OTC recommendations from health professionals. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you avoid ingredients that would interact with your other medicines. Check labels for ingredients that can pose problems, such as caffeine and acetaminophen.\u000a\u000a"Something that says it's safe for people with diabetes is fine, but if it doesn't address your symptoms, it's not going to help you, meaning it's medicine you don't need," Wilhelm said.

"Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves, unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the DPRK are fundamentally eliminated."\u000a\u000aThe response shows that tensions are showing no signs of abating after the UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved measures to restrict North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Trump\u2019s administration has threatened military action if necessary to stop North Korea from obtaining an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the U.S. with a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aChina, North Korea\u2019s biggest ally and trade partner, backed the sanctions in a bid to spur dialogue. It has urged North Korea to halt future ballistic missile and nuclear tests, while also calling on the U.S. and South Korea to cease military exercises.\u000a\u000a"North Korea\u2019s response is expected, because they have their own position," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Manila on Monday night. "The key is that we cannot let the situation to continue to escalate, and we need to find an opportunity to turn things around amid the crisis."\u000a\u000aThe KCNA report came as diplomats in Asia stepped up efforts to get North Korea to resume dialogue during a regional security meeting in the Philippines. Foreign ministers from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan all spoke with their North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho in Manila.\u000a\u000a"North Korea should realize that it will face stronger sanctions and pressure if it doesn\u2019t stop nuclear and missile provocation," Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, said on Tuesday in response to North Korea\u2019s statement. "We urge North Korea to make the right choice and come to the path of denuclearization."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged Ri on Sunday to respond as soon as possible to an offer to resume talks between the two countries, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified foreign ministry official from Seoul. Ri said the offer "lacks sincerity," according to the unnamed official.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s a positive but very small step, and can at least help the two Koreas exchange some views on the current state of affairs," Kim Jin-ho, a professor of political science at Dankook University in South Korea, said of the meeting between foreign ministers. "North Korea would use the talk as a bargaining chip with the U.S., as their goal is to have dialogue with Washington, not Seoul."\u000a\u000aIn a phone call on Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Trump that North Korean issues must be resolved peacefully and diplomatically. He said the countries needed to show Pyongyang that the door to dialogue was open if North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to a Moon spokesman.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is attending the security forum in Manila, said Monday that the best signal North Korea could give that it\u2019s ready for talks with the U.S. was to halt missile launches, the Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re not going to give someone a specific number of days or weeks," Tillerson said. "This is really about the spirit of these talks."\u000a\u000aJoint discussions between six nations \u2014 China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. \u2014 collapsed in 2009.\u000a\u000aMoon, who took office in May, has advocated engaging Pyongyang with dialogue and offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Kim\u2019s first successful ICBM test July 4.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is likely to continue pursuing ballistic missile tests at its current pace of about every three to four weeks despite the sanctions, according to John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at Harvard Kennedy School. He called the sanctions "too little, too late" to cut off financing for the nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"The North Korean program remains an unconstrained one with neither sanctions nor an operational diplomatic agreement holding it back," Park said

aVThe tech industry refuses to "police itself" when it comes to discrimination against women, meaning it's time for women to use the law to force change, Anita Hill wrote in a column for The New York Times.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, class actions, Hill wrote.\u000a\u000a"We can't afford to wait for the tech industry to police itself \u2014 and there are few indications that it will ever do so," Hill wrote, reacting to the leaked memo out of Google that slammed the company's diversity initiatives.\u000a\u000a"Instead, women in the industry should collectively consider their legal options. Top among these would be class-action discrimination cases against employers," Hill wrote.\u000a\u000aHill, still best remembered for her claims of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, says Silicon Valley is just the latest "boys club" that needs disruption in order to exact "industrywide correction."\u000a\u000aHill cites the case of Wall Street, where rampant sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the \u201890s led to an industry where women are now advancing into leadership roles.\u000a\u000aThough not perfect, the lesson of Wall Street shows "class-action lawsuits can force industrywide change, even in the most entrenched, male-dominated industries," Hill wrote.\u000a\u000aThe male-dominated leadership of Silicon Valley has proved unwilling or unable to solve systemic gender inequality," Hill wrote. "It's time women in tech consider taking advantage of the law to disrupt the industry once and for all."

aVLifestyle factors like obesity and smoking are known to raise people\u2019s risk of developing sciatica, but a new study finds that regular walking and biking may have an opposite, and just as powerful effect.\u000a\u000aResearchers in Finland analyzed data on more than 35,000 people in that country who were followed for up to 30 years, and found that smoking and obesity each raised the risk of being hospitalized for sciatica by 33 percent or more, while regularly commuting on foot or by bicycle lowered the risk by 33 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe harmful effects of overweight, obesity and smoking, and the protective effect of walking or cycling to work on hospitalization are substantial,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Rahman Shiri of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese findings have important implications for prevention,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email.\u000a\u000aAbout 2 to 5 percent of people have sciatica, the authors note in the American Journal of Medicine. The painful condition typically results from a herniated disc in the lower back and a compressed nerve root, with shooting pain from the lower back along the sciatic nerve that extends down the back of the thighs and legs.\u000a\u000aSciatica rarely leads to surgery or hospitalization, but it\u2019s considered one of the more long-lasting and severe low back pain syndromes, Shiri said.\u000a\u000aThe study team analyzed data from four long-term studies with a total of 34,589 participants and 1,259 hospitalizations for sciatica during 12-30 years of follow-up. They looked at risk factors such as smoking, body mass index, obesity, age, sex, education and occupation, as well as the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity.\u000a\u000aAlthough smoking increased the risk of hospitalization for sciatica by 33 percent, former smokers were not at increased risk. Obesity increased hospitalization risk by 36 percent, especially abdominal fat, which pushed the increase to 41 percent.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, commuting to work by walking or cycling reduced the risk by 33 percent, which was true happened regardless of body weight and other activity.\u000a\u000a\u201cOther types of leisure time physical activities had no effect on hospitalization,\u201d Shiri added. \u201cThat was somewhat unexpected.\u201d\u000a\u000aRegular low-level physical activities such as walking and cycling may be helpful because they don\u2019t strain the lower back, the study authors note, as opposed to higher-intensity exercise that may be harmful.\u000a\u000aOne limitation of the study is that it relies on self-reported data, and the researchers are unable to verify what other health factors were involved with hospitalization for sciatica. The studies also used different questions about leisure-time physical activity, and two surveys didn\u2019t have enough information to distinguish between potential gender-related differences.\u000a\u000aFuture studies should analyze long-term data related to these factors and measure the physical activity directly, the study authors write.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt could be, for example, that there is something else associated with smoking and independently makes people more likely to be admitted to the hospital for sciatica,\u201d said David Coggon, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southampton in the UK.\u000a\u000aPerhaps more importantly, future studies should look at the major changes in back pain and sciatica occurrence over time, Coggon added. For example, long-term workplace absence due to low back pain has increased eightfold between the 1950s and 1970s, said Coggon, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat said, there are plenty of other good reasons not to smoke, not to be obese, and to exercise,\u201d Coggon said. Changing habits could have \u201cpractical implications for public health\u201d for many disorders or diseases, he added.

aVA new advisory issued by the American Heart Association unequivocally states that replacing foods high in saturated fats with those that contain unsaturated fats can reduce a person\u2019s risk of developing heart disease as much as cholesterol-lowering drugs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels,\u201d states lead author Dr. Frank Saks, leader of the advisory and professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\u000a\u000a\u201cSaturated fat increases LDL \u2014bad cholesterol \u2014 which is a major source of artery clogging plaque and cardiovascular disease,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aSaturated fats are found in meat, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm, and others.\u000a\u000aOther types of fat include polyunsaturated fats found in corn, soybean, peanut, and other oils and monounsaturated fats found in olive, canola, safflower, avocado, and other oils.\u000a\u000aThe AHA advisory is based on clinical trials that found lowering dietary intake of saturated fat and replacing it with polyunsaturated vegetable oils reduced cardiovascular disease by approximately 30 percent. That is roughly the same risk reduction achieved by cholesterol-lowering statins.\u000a\u000aThe advisory board was careful to point out that their fat recommendation should be only a part of an overall healthy diet such as the Mediterranean or DASH plans.\u000a\u000aThe researchers also noted the studies concluded that that replacing saturated fat with refined carbohydrates and sugars did not have any cholesterol-lowering benefits.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, controversial coconut oil, a saturated fat that many consider to be healthy, raised the LDL in carefully controlled studies more than safflower oil or olive oil.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven the lack of offsetting favorable aspects, we advise against the use of coconut oil, said the advisory.\u000a\u000aDr. Kevin Campbell, attending cardiologist at North Ridge Executive Wellness Center in North Carolina and a CBS on-air expert, tells Newsmax Health that not all fats are created equal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile the data is clear that a diet that is dominated by lots of saturated fats will promote fat in your arteries, including a mix of nutrients into your diet is a good thing,\u201d he explains.\u000a\u000a\u201cSome lean cuts of red meat, for example, can be part of a healthy diet. Avoiding one type of food will not provide perfect cardiovascular health. We must also take stock in our fitness levels, body weight and overall diet. Together we can use multiple strategies to live a heart healthy life.\u201d\u000a\u000aDr. Gabe Mirkin, author of \u201cThe Healthy Heart Miracle\u201d tells Newsmax Health that the recent advisory comes as no surprise to experts who have long espoused the idea that a healthy diet and lifestyle can beat medication, when it comes to combatting heart disease.\u000a\u000a\u201cStudies from all over the world are coming to the conclusion that your can prevent heart disease by changing your lifestyle and that this method is at least as effective as taking statin drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more recent data shows that lifestyle may even be more important than drugs.\u201d\u000a\u000aMirkin adds that modern scientists are also discussing the role of anti-inflammatory foods to prevent heart disease instead of focusing solely on saturated fats and cholesterol.\u000a\u000a\u201cHowever the rules remain the same whether you blame saturated fat and sugar or blame inflammation,\u201d he says. \u201cYour diet should be based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds. You should restrict red meat, and avoid all processed meat and foods with added sugar as well as fried foods.\u201d\u000a\u000aCampbell adds the voice of moderation.\u000a\u000a\u201cSaturated fats are best avoided if you have high cholesterol or are at high risk for heart disease,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever no diet should be completely exclusive of any one food. These diets are doomed to failure.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s far better to focus on moderation and variety as well as taking other preventive measures such as regular exercise and reducing stress to prevent heart disease.\u201d

aVU.S. employers hired more workers than expected in July and raised their wages, signs of labor market tightness that likely clears the way for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start shrinking its massive bond portfolio.\u000a\u000aThe Labor Department said that nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 jobs last month amid broad-based gains. June's employment gain was revised up to 231,000 from the previously reported 222,000.\u000a\u000aAverage hourly earnings increased nine cents, or 0.3 percent, in July after rising 0.2 percent in June. That was the biggest rise in five months. On a year-on-year basis, wages increased 2.5 percent for the fourth straight month.\u000a\u000a"The Fed set a low bar for balance sheet normalization to begin in September, and today's number cleared that bar with elan," said Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000aAlthough the economy is near full employment, wage growth has not been strong in part because many of the jobs being created are in low-wage sectors. Last month, restaurants and bars added 53,100 jobs.\u000a\u000aJuly's monthly increase in earnings could, however, offer Fed policymakers some assurance that inflation will gradually rise to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.\u000a\u000aEconomists expect the Fed will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September. The Fed bought these securities to lower interest rates in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\u000a\u000aSluggish wage growth and the accompanying benign inflation, however, suggest the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year and its benchmark overnight interest rate is in a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.\u000a\u000aThe dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on the jobs report, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher.\u000a\u000aEconomists had forecast payrolls increasing by 183,000 jobs and wages rising 0.3 percent in July.\u000a\u000aRepublican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, cheered Friday's employment data. "Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun," Trump said on Twitter. "Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!"\u000a\u000aExcellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes, cutting regulation and boosting infrastructure spending.\u000a\u000aBut after six months in office the Trump administration has failed to pass any economic legislation and has yet to articulate a plan for much of its economic agenda.\u000a\u000aUNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS\u000a\u000aWage growth is crucial to sustaining the U.S. economic expansion after output increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, an acceleration from the January-March period's pedestrian 1.2 percent pace.\u000a\u000aThe economy also got a boost from another report on Friday showing a sharp drop in the trade deficit in June.\u000a\u000aThe unemployment rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.3 percent in July, matching a 16-year low touched in May. It has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year and is now at the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017.\u000a\u000a"Stable year-on-year wage growth should decrease the perceived risk of further slowing in wages and prices," said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York.\u000a\u000a"Strong payroll gains that place downward pressure on the post-crisis low unemployment rate will keep the center of the Fed comfortable with increasing policy rates in December."\u000a\u000aJuly's decline in the jobless rate came even as more people entered the labor force, underscoring job market strength.\u000a\u000aThe labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.9 percent. The share of the population that is employed climbed to 60.2 percent, matching an eight-year high touched in April.\u000a\u000aA broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 8.6 percent last month. This alternative gauge of unemployment hit a 9-1/2-year low in May.\u000a\u000aMonthly job growth this year has averaged 184,000, close to the 2016 average of 186,000. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\u000a\u000aManufacturing payrolls advanced by 16,000 jobs in July, the largest gain since February. Employment in the automobile sector rose by 1,600 despite slowing sales and bloated inventories that have forced manufacturers to cut back on production.\u000a\u000aU.S. auto sales fell 6.1 percent in July from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.73 million units. General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co have both said they will cut production in the second half of the year.\u000a\u000aConstruction payrolls rose 6,000 last month as hiring at homebuilding sites increased 5,100. The professional and business services sector added 49,000 workers last month.\u000a\u000aRetail employment rose by 900 as hiring at motor vehicle and parts dealerships as well as online retailers offset a drop of 10,000 in employment at clothing stores.\u000a\u000aCompanies like major online retailer Amazon are creating jobs at warehouses and distribution centers. Amazon this week held a series of job fairs to hire about 50,000 workers. Government payrolls rose by 4,000 in July.

aVThroughout the developed world, central banks enjoy a large measure of independence.\u000a\u000aThis is considered desirable because it guards against elected officials\u2019 preference for overly easy monetary policy, as a means to generating jobs and votes.\u000a\u000aBut what if the central bank wants easier money than politicians do? This has been the case in the U.S. for much of the past decade, and it raises important questions about how independence should be defined.\u000a\u000aConsider the situation in late 2010. The Republican party won a huge victory in the midterm congressional elections, at least in part thanks to voters\u2019 unease with the $800 billion fiscal stimulus package that the Obama administration adopted the previous year. The newly elected Republicans largely opposed additional stimulus as a way of addressing the protracted recession.\u000a\u000aYet one day after the election, with unemployment still close to 10 percent and inflation falling toward 1 percent, the Federal Reserve began a new round of bond-buying designed to provide added economic stimulus (a policy that I, as a Fed official at the time, supported). This was no isolated event. Throughout the recovery, the Fed systematically sought to boost growth and inflation even as Congress made choices -- such as the budget sequestration of 2013 -- that seemed deliberately intended to constrain them.\u000a\u000aAt first glance, the Fed\u2019s policy choices could be seen as a great example of how an independent central bank works: By design, it acts in isolation of, and possibly in contradiction to, the wishes of the public\u2019s elected representatives. Stimulus was amply justified given the Fed\u2019s mandate to seek maximum employment and price stability. Indeed, I\u2019ve argued that it could and should have done more. It was right about the economy and Congress was wrong.\u000a\u000aStill, there\u2019s something wrong with this picture. It has to do with the governance of central bank policy. Congress has given the Fed -- a group of unelected technocrats -- the power to pursue a more pro-inflation and pro-growth policy than the public\u2019s elected representatives desire. What is the justification for this delegation?\u000a\u000aAs far as I know, the vast theoretical and empirical academic literature addresses central bank independence only as a way to counter the short-term pro-inflation biases of elected officials. It doesn\u2019t explain why central banks should be allowed to do the opposite.\u000a\u000aOne argument, I suppose, could be expertise: The unelected technocrats just know a lot more about monetary policy than Congress does. But, as someone who\u2019s been one of those technocrats, I\u2019m leery of this argument. The aura of expertise can end up being a way to hide political biases -- biases that should really be up to the electorate to adjudicate.\u000a\u000aTo arrive at a more defensible approach, Congress might have to rethink central bank independence as it is enshrined in the Federal Reserve Act. It could, for example, periodically establish a lower bound for the level of interest rates and an upper bound for asset holdings, leaving the Fed free to choose a higher interest rate and a smaller balance sheet. This would give the central bank ample power to keep inflation in check, but would prevent monetary policy from being too much easier than what Congress and the voters desire.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, this could on occasion prevent the Fed from doing the right thing when Congress is wrong -- as it did in 2010. But over the longer term, it would preserve the most important part of the central bank\u2019s independence, shielding it from accusations that it has become too unaccountable to the people.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aNarayana Kocherlakota is a Bloomberg View columnist.

aVIn the past, I\u2019ve frequently noted that geopolitical crises since the start of the 1960s have often created buying opportunities for stock investors (Fig. 1). Stocks would sell off quickly and sometimes sharply for a brief period, then rebound when the crises passed.\u000a\u000aThe two major exceptions were the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979, which triggered severe recessions as US consumers retrenched in the face of soaring gasoline prices, which boosted inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates significantly (Fig. 2).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn recent meetings with our accounts in the Mid-Atlantic states, I found that they all were fully invested in stocks and believed that the bull market could last for quite some time longer. Based on the S&P 500, on April 11, it became the second-longest bull market since the data started in 1928 (Fig. 3). On June 29, 2021, it would be the longest on record, if the bull continues to charge ahead that long.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn the past, the bulls were tripped up by recessions. The investors I\u2019ve met with recently are all hard-pressed to see what might cause the next recession anytime soon. A geopolitical crisis is not on their worry list. When they asked me for my opinion, I noted that Debbie and I started to predict back on October 27, 2014 that the expansion could be one of the longest on record, and we still think so. It is currently the third longest since the end of WWII. In May 2018, it would become the second-longest expansion and in July 2019 the longest, if it lasts so long (Fig. 4).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBarring a major geopolitical crisis, if there is trouble ahead for the stock market, it might be internally generated. The bulls could get too cocky, continuing to pour money into equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting new records for 12-month net inflows over the rest of this year and into next year. They have been doing just that since January, as we discussed last week (Fig. 5). That could cause a P/E-led melt-up, especially given the extraordinary complacency, as evidenced by the record-low readings for the S&P 500 VIX recently around 10.0, with Investors Intelligence reporting that only 16.2% of their respondents were bearish last week (Fig. 6).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBased on the record inflows continuing into ETFs and widespread complacency, Joe and I raised the odds of a Melt-Up scenario last week from 40% to 50%, while lowering the odds of a Nirvana scenario to 30% from 40%. We left the Meltdown scenario at 20%. But we will have to raise it, taking points away from the Melt-Up, if stocks do go into orbit first.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Melt-up/Meltdown tag team could set the bull up for a nasty fall. However, that would not necessarily cause a recession. So it might very well be like 1987 all over again, with a fast and furious bear market setting the stage for a resumption of the secular bull market, as earnings should continue to move higher if the economic expansion continues to set records and maybe break the record for the longest run.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn my conversions with our accounts, we all seemed to agree that this may be the most obvious and plausible outlook for stocks and the economy. But surely, it can\u2019t be that simple? What about geopolitical risk?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBefore we go there, let\u2019s consider domestic politics first. Then again, why bother when the stock market seems to be disinterested and totally tuning out all the melodrama? After all, the checks-and-balances system is working just as our Founders designed it to work; it is causing gridlock so that extremist policy initiatives on both sides of the aisle are stymied. Investors seem to agree with my long-held view: \u201cLook how well our economy is doing despite all the meddlers in Washington!\u201d Consider the following recent developments:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(1) Various indicators. The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index has rebounded from this year\u2019s low of -78.6 on June 16 to -40.8 on Friday (Fig. 7). Earlier this year, this was a widely followed indicator because it suggested that US economic growth might be slowing more than anyone expected. Turns out that real GDP rose 2.6% (saar) during Q2, well outpacing Q1\u2019s lackluster gain of 1.2%. On a y/y basis, real GDP growth continues to hover around 2.0%, as it has since mid-2010.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother weak indicator earlier this year was commercial and industrial, or C&I, loans at commercial banks (Fig. 8). The growth rate of this series definitely has slowed so far this year, but it remains in record-high territory.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInflation-adjusted exports rose to a record high during June (Fig. 9). Imports also edged up and are just below January\u2019s record high. Incredibly, US exports of crude oil and petroleum products rose to a record 5.9mbd during the four-week period through January 6 of this year, up from a low of 0.8mbd during late 2005 (Fig. 10). Net imports of this category is down to 4.5mbd currently from a record high of about 13.0mbd during 2005. Frackers continue to make America a great oil producer again.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(2) Employment & wages. As we do every month, Debbie and I go straight to the bottom line of the monthly employment report. Friday\u2019s data for July showed that the Earned Income Proxy (EIP) for private-sector wages and salaries rose 0.5% m/m and 4.6% y/y (Fig. 11). Our proxy was tracking wages and salaries very closely until mid-2016, but has been stronger than wages and salaries since then. Our hunch is that the latter variable could be revised higher substantially.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile wage inflation remained subdued at 2.5% y/y during July, as Debbie discusses below, it has been outpacing price inflation. As a result, real average hourly earnings (using the PCE deflator) rose to another record high in June (Fig. 12). This measure of purchasing power (and the standard of living) is up 0.9% y/y, 5.7% since January 2009, and 17.4% since January 2000. In other words, the notion that wages have been stagnating for several years is a HUGE myth.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGeopolitics: Bay of a Pig. Now let\u2019s consider geopolitical risk. President Donald Trump and his agenda are sinking in the swamp of domestic politics. He seems to score more points when he goes abroad, such as when he lobbed some cruise missiles into Syria on April 7, when he met with leaders in the Middle East and Europe during May, and when he gave his praiseworthy Western Civ speech in Warsaw on July 6. When he met with President Barack Obama on November 10 last year, the outgoing president told his successor that his number one geopolitical challenge would be posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile ambitions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSure enough, North Korea conducted its second ICBM test a week ago Friday in what it called a warning to the \u201cbeast-like US imperialists.\u201d It came less than a month after its first test, on July 4. This could develop into a geopolitical crisis that could have a bearish impact on the stock market, though more likely triggering a correction and a buying opportunity rather than a bear market. Consider the following:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(1) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hit back on Saturday, July 29, describing North Korea\u2019s launch as a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of multiple UN Security Council resolutions. He also blamed Beijing and Moscow: \u201cAs the principal economic enablers of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(2) This past Saturday, Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said in an interview with MSNBC that the US is preparing for all options to counter the growing threat from North Korea, including launching a \u201cpreventive war.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(3) A week ago Sunday, the US conducted a test of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) defense system in Alaska by launching a ballistic missile over the Pacific Ocean. The weapon was fired by a US Air Force plane and intercepted by the system, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said, describing the test as \u201csuccessful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTHAAD is designed as a \u201cbullet to hit a bullet.\u201d It carries no warhead, relying on its kinetic energy to destroy an enemy\u2019s incoming missile. That\u2019s to reduce the chances of exploding a conventional warhead or detonating a nuclear one. The system is designed, built, and integrated by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, acting as prime contractor. Key subcontractors include Raytheon, Boeing, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Honeywell, BAE Systems, Oshkosh Defense, MiltonCAT, and the Oliver Capital Consortium.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(4) China's state-owned Xinhua news agency blasted the South Korean government on Friday over its decision to deploy additional THAAD launchers. The Chinese are convinced that the system\u2019s very sophisticated radar will be used to track missiles launched from China. That\u2019s a fear that Trump could heighten for the Chinese by convincing Japan to install a THAAD system, in an effort to pressure the Chinese to stop the North Koreans.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(5) On Saturday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea. It targets the country's primary exports, including coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore, and seafood. Also targeted are other revenue sources, such as banks and joint ventures with foreign companies. The sanctions will slash North Korea's annual export revenue of $3 billion by more than a third, according to a statement from the office of Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN. Though it\u2019s doubtful, let\u2019s hope the sanction approach works.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(6) This rapidly evolving crisis remains under the stock market\u2019s radar screen for now. In many ways, it reminds me of the Cuban Missile Crisis during October 1962. Emboldened by America\u2019s botched April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco, aimed at toppling Fidel Castro, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev put nuclear missiles in Cuba. President John Kennedy called his bluff by imposing a naval blockade around the island nation. Khrushchev blinked and withdrew the weapons.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis time, the US is moving antimissile systems close to China, not only to defend against North Korean missiles but also to spur the Chinese to get rid of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who is certainly cruel and dangerous and probably crazy too. The deal: Make Kim go away, and we won\u2019t deploy THAAD.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(7) If China fails to make the deal, then the US might very well use THAAD to shoot down a North Korean missile test. That would certainly get everyone\u2019s attention, including complacent stock investors\u2019. It would also unambiguously resolve the question about Kim\u2019s sanity. If he does nothing to retaliate other than to kick and scream, he is sane. If he attacks South Korea with an artillery barrage, he is insane.\u000a\u000aDr. Ed Yardeni is the President of Yardeni Research, Inc., a provider of independent global investment strategy research.

I thought that our party was being compromised by concepts like nationalism or extreme nationalism, protectionism, populism," Flake told "Newsmax Now" host Bill Tucker. "Those may win you an election, but they're not much of a governing philosophy.\u000a\u000a"The principles that have animated the movement for generations now [are] limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, free trade. Those things have served us well as a country, and I fear that some of those principles are in danger."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"And I'm concerned about that kind of foreign policy positions that we've taken as a party."\u000a\u000aThe rise of populism is one issue, he told Tucker.\u000a\u000a"As a conservative, you owe honesty to your constituents and my concern is that with populism \u2013 I'm not denying the popularity of populism, it's called populism for a reason \u2013 it's easy for a politicians to point to a shuttered factory and say, for example, hey those jobs were gone because of a trade deal," he said.\u000a\u000a"China took those jobs, or Mexico, when the truth is it's probably more complex than that. We know it's more complex than that, and I'm not denying that you can win some elections that way.\u000a\u000a"What I'm skeptical of is if that is a governing philosophy, and if we can win future elections, because I think it's a bit of a sugar high, populism is, and when you come down it's not very pleasant politically."\u000a\u000aStill, he believes not all is lost, and the GOP can rally.\u000a\u000a"I think we can show progress, and I commend the president for putting a good Cabinet together and filling the administration posts with some good people," Flake said.\u000a\u000a"I put out a press release the other day from my office actually praising the EPA in working with some of the federal regulators that we just haven't been able to lately for years, and so there are some good changes on the regulatory front."\u000a\u000aChange in tax policy is also a must \u2013 and something that will need bipartisan work, Flake added.\u000a\u000a"[We have] to get a hold of our deficit, which could be $1 trillion again in a couple of years and our massive, massive debt, $20 trillion, we're going to have to strike a deal of some type that's going to be required, let's face it, to sitting down with our colleagues across the aisle," he said.\u000a\u000a"The prospect of that happening right now just seems almost nil, and I'm very concerned about that as a conservative that we aren't addressing those issues . . . The deficit is a perfect example.\u000a\u000a"The only good really restraints we've put on spending over the past four years have been when we have divided government, when both parties sat down and said let's share the political risk."\u000a\u000aHe believes, paradoxically, the party of limited government, Republicans, have "a hard time doing that when we're in charge of both chambers and the White House, because the Democrats aren't inclined to help, and they'll just say, 'we'll win in the next election.'"\u000a\u000a"So that makes it very difficult, but I have to say I think it's more difficult when we assume or ascribe the worst motives to our political opponents," Flake said. "If we call them losers or clowns, it's just tough to actually sit down and reach agreements that will fulfill a conservative objective, and that's one thing that concerns me about the administration."\u000a\u000a"Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle" is published by Random House.

aVBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 A powerful Iraqi Shiite militia said Tuesday that at least 40 of its militiamen were killed in an attack the previous day on its positions across the border in Syria. The militia blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the assault but the Islamic State group claimed its fighters had targeted the militiamen.\u000a\u000aThe deputy head of the militia, known as Kattaib Sayeed al-Shuhadaa, accused U.S. forces of carrying out the early Monday assault. The Baghdad-based spokesman of the U.S.-led coalition, Army Col. Ryan Dillon, dismissed the allegation, saying on Twitter that no coalition airstrikes took place in the area at the time.\u000a\u000aAccording to the militia's deputy, Ahmed al-Maksousi, they were hit by artillery fire in Syria's Jamouna area, about 12 kilometers (about 7.5 miles) from the Iraqi border.\u000a\u000aHe said the attack was launched from around Iraq's city of Mosul, recently recaptured by Iraqi forces from the Islamic State group, and was followed by an on-the-ground assault by S militants. Along with 40 killed, at least 30 militiamen were wounded, al-Maksousi added.\u000a\u000aThe militia vowed "this act will not pass without punishment."\u000a\u000aIn an online statement, IS said it staged a three-pronged attack that included a suicide bombing, followed by fighters storming the militiamen's positions. The group added that one IS fighter was captured.\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi, speaking at a press conference Tuesday, said he spoke with the militia's leadership and that reports of the incident were still being confirmed.\u000a\u000aSeveral Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militias have been fighting in Syria alongside Syrian government troops.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press writers Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.

aVBMW and Daimler, the world's top luxury carmakers, have announced alliances with suppliers, talking up the virtues of having a bigger pool of engineers to develop a self-driving car.\u000a\u000aBut another motive behind these deals, executives and industry experts told Reuters, is a concern that robocars may not live up to the profit expectations that drove an initial investment rush.\u000a\u000aCarmakers are increasingly looking to forego outright ownership of future autonomous driving systems in favour of spreading the investment burden and risk.\u000a\u000aThe trend represents a clear shift in strategy from little more than a year ago when most automakers were pursuing standalone strategies focussed on tackling the engineering challenge of developing a self-driving car, rather than on the business case.\u000a\u000a"Although it is a substantial market, it may not be worth the scale of investments currently being sunk into it," said a board member at one of the German carmakers, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential.\u000a\u000aDozens of companies - including carmakers and tech firms like Google and Uber - are vying for a market which, according to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, will only make up about 10 to 15 percent of vehicles in Europe by 2030. There are sure to be losers.\u000a\u000a"It's impossible for me to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle software producers," said John Hoffecker, global vice chairman of Michigan-based consulting firm AlixPartners.\u000a\u000aIn July last year, BMW became the first major carmaker to abandon its solo development of self-driving cars in favour of teaming up with chipmaker Intel and camera and software manufacturer Mobileye to build a platform for autonomous cars technology by 2021.\u000a\u000aThe decision followed a trip by senior executives to visit startups and suppliers to gauge BMW's competitive position.\u000a\u000a"Sitting at other companies, one rattles off the technological challenges and safety aspects, and you come to realise that many of us are swimming in the same sludge," Klaus Buettner, BMW's vice president autonomous driving projects, told Reuters.\u000a\u000a"Everybody is investing billions. Our view was that it makes sense to club together to develop some core systems as a platform."\u000a\u000aDaimler's Mercedes-Benz has since combined efforts with supplier Bosch, three months ago, while Japanese carmaker Honda has said it is open to alliances in the area of autonomous cars.\u000a\u000aEven deep-pocketed tech companies are teaming up. San Francisco-based transport app operator Lyft and Alphabet Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo pooled their resources in May.\u000a\u000aSHARE THE BURDEN\u000a\u000aPartial autonomy is already a reality in higher-end cars that keep in lane and adjust their speed in motorway driving. Each of the next stages - "eyes off", "mind off" and ultimately driverless autonomy - will likely take years to become reality.\u000a\u000aKlaus Froehlich, BMW's board member responsible for development, said the company was likely to lose money with its first fully autonomous vehicles, just like it did with its first-generation electric cars. But developing the technology remains a necessity in order to stay relevant as a carmaker.\u000a\u000a"It is an enabling technology, not a business case," he said about BMW's decision to develop autonomous vehicles. "But if the burden can be shared on a platform, I have nothing against that."\u000a\u000aOne of the most financially promising markets that autonomous technology will open up is driverless on-demand taxis, which may one day come to replace regular cabs and parts of public transport in large cities.\u000a\u000a"Robotaxis" are expected to drive the wider market for car sharing and ride-hailing, which was worth $53 billion last year and could be worth $2 trillion by 2030, according to a McKinsey study published earlier this year.\u000a\u000aFord and General Motors are investing at least $2 billion each to develop self-driving vehicles for urban ride-sharing fleets beginning in 2021, competing with incumbents and start-ups.\u000a\u000aThe emergence of alliances involving the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz comes at a time when regulators are pushing for a creation of standards for the new technology, which has the potential to improve vehicle reflexes and cut accidents by up to 90 percent, according to Boston Consulting Group.\u000a\u000aIndustry experts say such standardisation could make it much harder to develop a product which stands out, calling into question the wisdom of high-stakes, go-it-alone strategies.\u000a\u000aALLIANCES, MERGERS\u000a\u000aIn September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transport and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration released guidance for heavily automated vehicles.\u000a\u000aThe regulator urged carmakers to disclose how vehicle reflexes are programmed, particularly when cars are faced with a dilemma, such as choosing between hitting a cyclist or accelerating beyond legal speeds to avoid an accident.\u000a\u000a"It is important to consider whether highly automated vehicles are required to apply particular decision rules in instances of conflicts between safety, mobility, and legality objectives," the guidance said.\u000a\u000a"Algorithms for resolving these conflict situations should be developed transparently using input from federal and state regulators, drivers and passengers."\u000a\u000aEuropean regulators too are debating whether to standardise speeds and distances which autonomous cars need to adhere to while weaving in and out of traffic or joining lanes.\u000a\u000aPressure not to waste development costs is laying the groundwork for alliances and even mergers between the various companies supplying technology for autonomous cars, including makers of vehicles, software, computer chips, radar, camera and laser sensors and high-definition maps.\u000a\u000aBMW, Mercedes and Audi put aside their rivalry and teamed up to buy mapping firm HERE, for example, in order to cut their dependence on Google.\u000a\u000aWhat starts out as arms-length agreements designed to capture market share, much like code-sharing deals between airlines, may evolve further into takeovers once the next investment round is due, executives and advisers said.\u000a\u000a"Will we see what is happening in aviation be adopted in automotive - where first we see alliances, collaborations and consortiums, and then we see full out market combinations?" asked Bill Curtin, head of mergers and acquisitions at global law firm Hogan Lovells.

The good performance of these large companies is masking the fact that many stocks, including REITS and those in the retail sector, have already entered bear market territory," he said.\u000a\u000a"An alarming percentage" of NYSE and Nasdaq stocks are hitting 52-week lows even though the S&P 500 has marked several new highs.\u000a\u000aThe S&P has gained about 11 percent this year. However, the run-up has also sparked concerns about stretched valuations. The S&P is trading at 18 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.\u000a\u000a"Recently there were more than 340 securities that sank to 52-week lows, the second highest level going back as far as 1965," Lamensdorf said. "Similar spikes occurred in 1973 and 1999, both directly preceding significant corrections," he warned.\u000a\u000aA "correction" is commonly defined as a temporary drop of at least 10 percent adjust for an overvaluation.\u000a\u000a\u201cSerious market corrections do not occur out of the blue. Indicators help investors identify when corrections are long in the tooth and rallies are beginning to wane. Presently the indicators are suggesting a top. We remain 50% short,\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOver the last year fewer and fewer stocks have participated in the market rally,\u201d he explained.\u000a\u000aHe explained a unique indicator that quantifies the narrowing of stocks participating in a rally. The indicator went back to 1995 and analyzed closes on the Russell 2000 that were at\u000a\u000athree-year highs while less than 5% of the stocks were at 52-week highs, indicating sell signals.\u000a\u000a"There have been five sell signals over the last 20 years, and one of them is occurring now. The 1996 signal was followed by a year-long flat market. The 2000 and 2007 signals identified incredibly rough bear markets, and the 2015 signal coincided with a 20% Russell correction," he warned.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, ratings agency Fitch this week lifted its outlook for the world economy for this year and next, Reuters said.\u000a\u000a"Data continue to suggest a synchronized global expansion across both advanced and emerging market economies. Spill-overs from the rebound in emerging market demand are reflected in the fastest growth in world trade since 2010," said Fitch chief economist Brian Coulton.\u000a\u000aHowever, many other respected investment gurus would welcome a temporary stock-market dip.\u000a\u000aCNBC's Larry Kudlow advises savvy investors to expect a slight dip in the current bull market and be prepared to buy more shares if stocks fall up to 10 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cStocks, for the long run, are a great bet in America, a great bet in our free-market capitalism. You don\u2019t want to sell now,\u201d the CNBC senior contributor told "Big John & Ramblin' Ray" on WLS (890AM) in Chicago.\u000a\u000a\u201cI probably would love to see a 5-to-10 percent correction in the not-too-distant future,\u201d the Newsmax Finance Insider explained, \u201cbecause that would be an even better buying opportunity.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Leon Cooperman says he isn\u2019t afraid of the market correction that some others insist is coming. "The market is fully valued, but it's not overvalued," the head of Omega Advisors told CNBC.\u000a\u000aCooperman said if the market does suffer a sudden tumble, he would buy banks including Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.\u000a\u000a(Newsmax wires services contributed to this report).

aVVeterans often feel they have entered a new world with unexpected obstacles when returning back home. The civilian standards they had long ago are far different from rigorous military standards they just experienced.\u000a\u000aIt might seem as if they are living in a different culture at times. They need to re-establish their relationships with family and friends. They also face financial and employment challenges. Psychological effects may interfere with the readjustment to civilian life.\u000a\u000aTransitioning from military to civilian life can be difficult, but working along with family, friends, and counselors makes the move a bit easier. Here are six obstacles veterans can overcome when returning back home:\u000a\u000a1. Dealing with emotional issues \u2014 Veterans are sometimes trained to avoid opening up about their feelings, notes Brook Price in HuffPost. But talking with other vets about shared experiences can provide support. Getting involved in military-type routines offers similar conditions to help with the transition. Exercising with other people at a gym or running through obstacle courses can bring a sense of comfort to the new environment.\u000a\u000aSpecial: Your Tiny Thyroid Causing Hidden Problems: Heart, Obesity, Worse\u000a\u000a\u2014 The working atmosphere in civilian life is different from military service. Employment in the military has fixed terms, and concerns such as being laid off are unheard of. Finding a job and understanding new workplace issues are part of the transition into civilian life for returning vets. The Department of Veterans Affairs has resources and programs to help vets explain their skills and goals for employment.\u000a\u000a3. Education \u2014 Starting on or returning to a college education may present some difficulties for veterans who are in an atmosphere with younger classmates. Accommodating programs through the American Council on Education can help apply translate military training into college credits to shorten the time in college, writes James Hinton for Student Advisor. There are also scholarships available under the VFW, American Legion, and DAV that offer expenses not covered through the GI Bill.\u000a\u000aAlert: Do You Often Feel Tired and Sluggish? Take Simple Online Quiz\u000a\u000a4. Housing \u2014 The rate of mortgage problems is quite high among returning veterans and their families. Many have experienced improper foreclosures, but those issues are being dealt with through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to Think Progress. Funding for housing vouchers and rental assistance to help veterans and their families is provided through the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.\u000a\u000a5. Homelessness \u2014 About 10 percent of homeless people in the U.S. are veterans and the issue is often due to mental illness or substance abuse disorders, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Veterans can get valuable information for themselves and their families on programs for affordable housing from SAMHSA.\u000a\u000a6. Post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 PTSD not only affects vets who experience the trauma of combat, but it also includes emotional distress in those who weren\u2019t involved in a war zone. Isolation and loneliness can develop in returning home to a disconnected society, explains journalist and filmmaker Sebastian Junger in Business Insider. Some vets may feel separated from the tribe-like community they had and detached from modern, civic life. Counseling helps in readjustment. The Veterans Crisis Line provides help for vets and their families.\u000a\u000aTip: How to Retire Comfortably on $2,000

aVFree Retirement Calculator: When Can You Retire? \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here to Find Out\u000a\u000aHow Soon Can You Retire? Free Test Shows You When \u2014\u000a\u000aClick Here\u000a\u000aThose who are self-employed are wise to make strong choices on how best to save and protect their money in planning for retirement, experts say.Here are the four top retirement plans for those who are self-employed. Forbes recommended a SEP-IRA as its top choice for self-employed people. SEP stands for simplified employee pension. This IRA is a simple way to put money aside, pre-tax, as savings, the magazine noted. Under this IRA, investors can contribute as much as 25 percent of their income \u2014 up to $49,000 annually.This plan is a simple incentive-match plan for employees at small businesses as well as the self-employed, Forbes noted. "If you have a few employees, say, less than 10, who make more than $5,000, but far from six figures, and want to offer a plan for them as a perk, this is probably the one for you. It was designed for firms with no more than 100 employees," Forbes wrote.Small business owners or those who are independently employed may contribute up to $16,500, Forbes reported. "With a solo 401(k), as an employee, you can stash away as much as $16,500. As the employer, you can contribute another 25 percent of compensation, up to a ceiling of $49,000 including your employee contribution. If you\u2019re 50 or older, you can toss in another $5,500 extra."There are two types of Keogh plans \u2014 defined contribution and defined benefit. They are popular for those who are self-employed and earn large incomes, CNN noted . Under a defined benefit plan, you must fund it yourself. Under a defined contribution plan, you have two options \u2014 profit-sharing and money-purchase, CNN said."The profit-sharing version of the Keogh is most like the SEP; there's a ceiling on contributions \u2014 25 percent of compensation \u2014 up to $49,000, and below that limit you can put in whatever you can spare. You also can change your contribution each year. With the money-purchase plan, you pick a percentage of income you'll contribute every year, and stick with it," CNN wrote of the differences.\u000a\u000aThe IRS posts contribution limits for each plan every year.

aVAverage folks may one day be able to use a Star Trek-inspired home medical device to diagnose a dozen different ailments and track five major vital signs, all without needing to draw blood or visit a doctor's office.\u000a\u000aEngineers developed the DxtER device as part of a competition to create a modern-day version of the "tricorder" that Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy waved over patients on the starship Enterprise to diagnose illnesses.\u000a\u000aThe DxtER combines an array of different sensors with intelligent diagnostic software in a package weighing less than 5 pounds, said technology design expert Philip Charron, a member of the team that created the device.\u000a\u000aA person using the DxtER at home can test themselves for anemia, urinary tract infections, diabetes, atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), sleep apnea, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), pneumonia, ear infection, whooping cough, high blood pressure, mononucleosis and increased white blood cell counts, Charron said.\u000a\u000a"A regular consumer can sit down with our device, answer some questions, and it will come back with a diagnosis," Charron said.\u000a\u000aThe DxtER also can monitor five vital signs continuously: blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory rate and blood oxygen levels.\u000a\u000aAll of the sensors are noninvasive. No blood needs to be drawn and nothing needs to be inserted into the body, he explained.\u000a\u000aCharron said that his group, Final Frontier Medical Devices, received a $2.6 million award in April for developing the DxtER and demonstrating an accuracy rate higher than 70 percent.\u000a\u000aFinal Frontier was to present the DxtER this week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) in San Diego. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\u000a\u000a"Now it's up to the peers in the scientific community to see if it works the way it's supposed to," said AACC President Michael Bennett, director of the Palmieri Metabolic Laboratory at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\u000a\u000aCharron said the DxtER combines:\u000a\u000aA chest sensor for monitoring heart rate, respiration and temperature.\u000a\u000aA wrist and hand sensor that checks blood pressure, blood sugar levels, hemoglobin, white blood cell counts and blood oxygen levels.\u000a\u000aA digital stethoscope that listens to sounds from breathing.\u000a\u000aA spirometer, which is a device to measure the air capacity of the lungs when people breathe into the machine.\u000a\u000aAll of these devices interact with diagnostic software running on a tablet, Charron noted.\u000a\u000a"You apply some of these devices to your body, and then answer questions on the tablet about your symptoms, just like you would with a doctor in a doctor's office," Charron said.\u000a\u000aThe competition, called the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE, kicked off in 2012 and involved 300 different engineering teams.\u000a\u000a"It really was a five-year mission, just like in Star Trek," Charron said.\u000a\u000aThe Final Frontier team put about a half million dollars out of their own pockets into the endeavor, which ate up as many as 24,000 hours of combined effort, according to Charron.\u000a\u000aThe team tested its diagnostic software against an approved set of anonymous patient charts, to see if it would accurately diagnose illnesses when provided the proper vital signs and body chemistry readings, Charron said.\u000a\u000aFor the contest, researchers handed the device to patients with diagnosed medical conditions. The patients had to be able to use the device on themselves, unaided, to accurately diagnose their specific illness.\u000a\u000aThe point was to develop a home health care kit that could help families figure out basic illnesses, preventing unnecessary trips to the emergency room or doctor's office, Bennett said.\u000a\u000aBecause of this, it was built to be affordable. The DxtER should cost between $200 and $400 retail, Charron said, although insurers might chip in to bring the cost down even lower if the device proves accurate enough to cut down on visits to the hospital or doctor.\u000a\u000aAlongside home health care, the DxtER also could prove of great benefit for disaster relief, in refugee camps, as part of military medicine, and even as a means of diagnosing health problems during space travel, Charron suggested.\u000a\u000aThe DxtER now will proceed to clinical trials. The device's accuracy will be tested against tried-and-true equipment now being used in hospitals, and the results will help researchers better hone the diagnostic software, Charron said.\u000a\u000aJames Nichols is medical director of clinical chemistry at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. He said, "As with any new device, we need to see what its performance is. We want it to be reproducible and be accurate and compare well with traditional known tests. When we see how it actually performs once it's put in the hands of laypeople, then we'll know a little better what still needs to be worked out with the device."\u000a\u000aAs part of development, Nichols added, engineers also need to consider how the data gathered by DxtER will be uploaded and shared with a person's primary care doctor.\u000a\u000a"The data is not of much use in the device itself," Nichols said. "It needs to connect with the person's medical record."

aVMost of Anthony Weiner's neighbors in his Union Square building in New York blame him for Hillary Clinton's loss in the presidential election, Page Six reported Monday.\u000a\u000a"Nobody speaks to him," one source told the New York Post. "He is truly ostracized. People won't even get on the elevator with him."\u000a\u000aWeiner, the former U.S. representative who in May pled guilty to criminal charges in connection with his online communications with a 15-year-old girl, has been living alone in his apartment since estranged wife Huma Abedin left him.\u000a\u000aFBI agents seized Weiner's laptop during their investigation of his sexting case and discovered a new cache of emails Clinton had sent to Abedin, one of Clinton's top aides from her time in the State Department and on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aAs a result, the FBI reopened its investigation into Clinton's handling of State Department business on a private email server. The inquiry was brief as Comey announced the new emails contained nothing to change his view Clinton should not be charged with a crime, but Clinton partly blamed her loss to President Donald Trump on Comey's October announcement.\u000a\u000aMost of Weiner's neighbors, according to Page Six, were Clinton supporters. Weiner will be sentenced in federal district court in Manhattan on Sept. 8. and is looking at 21 to 27 months in prison for sharing obscene photos with a minor.

aVGolf is a highly individual sport. Even though all golfers share the goal of getting the ball in the hole in the fewest number of swings, the ways they go about it are as individual as fingerprints. Even the pros have their quirks.\u000a\u000aHere are some of the game\u2019s most unique swings and their proud owners:\u000a\u000a1. Eammon Darcy \u2013 This Irish golfer may have had an unconventional swing, but it earned him four victories on the European Tour, and he competed in the Ryder Cup four times, according to Golf Magazine. What makes this swing so unusual is the positioning of Darcy\u2019s arms in the beginning and the \u201cwhirlybird\u201d motion that follows.\u000a\u000aURGENT:\u000a\u000aWho's The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

Vote Now\u000a\u000a3. Jim Furyk \u2013 The Bleacher Report says that, although Furyk\u2019s swing is indeed strange-looking, it has earned him some major wins, including the 2010 FedEx Cup. The swing is characterized by a double overlapping grip, a looping takeaway to the outside, and finally a looping drop back to the inside on the downswing.\u000a\u000a4. Moe Norman \u2013 This Canadian champ was shy and eccentric, says the Golf Channel, and while his personality may have limited his pro career, his unorthodox swing earned him two Canadian PGA titles. He was known for how straight he could hit the ball using his rigid arm position and minimal hand and knee action.\u000a\u000a5. Nancy Lopez \u2013 This LPGA superstar won 48 tournaments, four team events, and three majors with her unusual swing that she herself described once as, \u201cno uglier than Arnold Palmer\u2019s\u201d and \u201cthe same ugly swing every time.\u201d Golf Magazine says her swing is characterized by a dramatically inside takeaway and the club pointing well right of the target at the top.\u000a\u000aVOTE:\u000a\u000aWho Is The Greatest Golfer Of All Time?

aVJamie Dimon is siding with the bond-market bears.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do think that bond prices are high,\u201d the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co. said Tuesday in an interview on CNBC. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call it a bubble, but I wouldn\u2019t personally be buying 10-year sovereign debt anywhere around the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe remarks echo a chorus of bears in the Treasury market who say an expanding economy will boost yields as the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark rate. Dimon, 61, didn\u2019t go as far as former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said last month that the bond market is experiencing an actual bubble, warning that real long-term interest rates are too low to be sustainable. Signs of economic expansion in Europe are also feeding concern fixed-income prices in the region could be headed for a fall.\u000a\u000aIn the wide-ranging interview Dimon also said he believes his bank has moved beyond the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d debacle, when JPMorgan traders were accused of hiding more than $6.2 billion in trading losses on wrong-way derivative bets five years ago. Dimon said he doesn\u2019t blame Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case, for the incident. Iksil said last year he wasn\u2019t responsible, and blamed his managers.\u000a\u000aDimon, a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, also said in the interview that he\u2019s not interested in taking a more formal role in politics. The chief executive has been criticized for his support for the president and he\u2019s said he helps Trump because he\u2019s a patriot.

aVSecretary of State Rex Tillerson held a door open for dialogue with North Korea on Monday, saying Washington was willing to talk to Pyongyang if it halted a series of recent missile test launches.\u000a\u000aTillerson's comments at a regional security forum in Manila were the latest U.S. attempt to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs after months of tough talk from U.S. President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday imposed its toughest round of sanctions yet against Pyongyang over its two intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in July.\u000a\u000aBut Tillerson appeared more conciliatory on Monday.\u000a\u000a"When the conditions are right, then we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so they feel secure and prosper economically," Tillerson told reporters.\u000a\u000a"The best signal that North Korea can give us that they are prepared to talk would be to stop these missile launches," said Tillerson, adding that "other means of communications" were open to Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThere was no direct reaction from North Korea to Tillerson's remarks but in a statement after the U.S. secretary of state made his comments, Pyongyang responded robustly to the new sanctions by saying it was ready to teach the United States a "severe lesson" if it attacked.\u000a\u000aThe U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea aimed at pressuring Pyongyang to end its nuclear program. The sanctions could further choke North Korea's struggling economy by slashing its $3 billion annual export revenue by a third.\u000a\u000aThe United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty. The past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration's attempts to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear and missile ambitions have so far gained little traction, and Pyongyang has only stepped up its tests, launching two ICBM tests last month.\u000a\u000aFIRST STEP?\u000a\u000aTillerson's remarks might be an attempt to try another tack by the United States, which also has tried to get Pyongyang's ally China to use its influence to prevent North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from building a nuclear arsenal.\u000a\u000aTillerson said halting missile test launches, which have worried neighbors South Korea and Japan, was a first step toward dialogue.\u000a\u000aHe said Washington would not "specify a specific number of days or weeks" before deciding that North Korea had indeed halted its tests.\u000a\u000aJoel Wit, director of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said he did not think North Korea would agree to a suspension of missile tests unilaterally as a precondition to talks without, for example a suspension of large-scale military exercises held regularly by the United States and South Korea, which it has denounced as a prelude for invasion.\u000a\u000aThe latest U.N. resolution bans North Korean exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. It also prohibits countries from increasing the numbers of North Korean labourers currently working abroad, bans new joint ventures with North Korea and any new investment in current joint ventures.\u000a\u000aTillerson said the support of China and Russia for the sanctions sent a strong message to North Korea about what was expected of it.\u000a\u000aChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged "the North Korean side to calmly handle the resolutions". He said in Manila on Sunday that Pyongyang should "not do anything unbeneficial towards the international community such as a nuclear test."\u000a\u000aIn a statement to the Manila forum on Monday, Pyongyang said it would never place its nuclear program on the negotiating table as long as the United States maintained a hostile policy against the North.\u000a\u000aIt noted its intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month proved the entire United States was in its firing range.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea says its ICBMs are a legitimate means of defense. It has long accused the United States and South Korea of escalating tensions by conducting military drills.\u000a\u000aThe Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with South Korea that could allow Seoul to have more powerful missiles.\u000a\u000aUnder the current guidelines, last changed in 2012, South Korea can develop missiles up to a range of 800 km (497 miles) with a maximum payload of 500 kg (1,102 pounds).\u000a\u000aChina's Wang said the core of the Korean Peninsula issue is a security issue, not an economic one, as North Korea believes it faces an external security threat, while other parties believe Pyongyang's nuclear and missiles programs are a threat.\u000a\u000aIn a phone call, South Korea's Moon and Trump said they would continue cooperating to rein in North Korea, particularly ahead of a regular joint military drill set for late August, South Korean presidential office spokesman Park Su-hyun said.\u000a\u000aThe White House said the two leaders "affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat" to most countries around the world.

aVA device developed at The Ohio State University can heal damaged organs by causing existing skin cells to develop into vascular cells.\u000a\u000aThe device has been undergoing testing on mice and pigs, and has been effective 98 percent of the time, an Ohio State news release said. Mice with badly injured legs that lacked blood flow were healed within three weeks and blood flow was restored.\u000a\u000aThe process works simply by touching the skin near the injury with a nanochip to introduce the desired DNA. A small, barely detectable electric pulse stimulates the existing cells. The procedure only takes a second and is not invasive.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the device is small and treatment can be delivered anywhere, including on a battlefield, so that injured soldiers could be treated in the field, USA Today noted.\u000a\u000aIt is the first time scientists have reprogrammed cells within a live body. There were no side effects reported with the treatment, which also was used to grow brain cells in mice who suffered strokes.\u000a\u000aChandan Sen, the director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cell-Based Therapies and co-leader of the study, said he expects the technology will be tested on humans within the next year and that he\u2019s currently in talks with Walter Reed National Medical Center about human trials, USA Today reported.

This tax-advantaged plan provides incentives for long-term savings. But there are some advantages to withdrawing money from an IRA.Here three times to consider withdrawing money from an IRA:IRA distributions specifically for buying your first house avoid the early withdrawal penalty from the IRS. This benefit can also be used to help a child or grandchild buy a home, Charles Schwab adviser Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz said . The maximum withdrawal without penalty is $10,000. Because a house is generally considered an investment, some advisers say taking money from your IRA might be a good idea.There are several circumstances in which the IRS recognizes that you might need the money now rather than later. In these situations, the 10 percent penalty does not apply. It may be an advantage to withdraw money from your IRA to pay for high medical bills or education. These are among the expenses exempt from penalties. Any money that comes out of an IRA, even if it is penalty free, will be considered as income.At age 70  you must start taking a withdrawal from your IRA. If you do not, the IRS will take a penalty tax. A delay on taking your distribution past April 1 of the year after you turn 70  may result in extra income tax, CBS News reported . The exact timing is best figured by a financial professional.

aVGenetics play a huge role in hair loss, but let\u2019s not forget that if you dye your hair and put other chemical products into it constantly, hair will lose its youthful luster, start breaking, and fall out.\u000a\u000aYou have more power than you think to preserve your hair.\u000a\u000aHair loss is a symptom of low thyroid. So make sure you take thyroid hormones under the care of a knowledgeable prevention expert.\u000a\u000aBlood tests don\u2019t show the way your thyroid functions nearly as accurately as your hair does.\u000a\u000aTreat your hair gently. Wash it with shampoos that are organic and plant-based. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t dye your hair because our culture feels very strongly that women with white or grey hair are old.\u000a\u000aBut until we change that cultural mindset, use organic dyes.\u000a\u000aSupplements like biotin, B12, and marine algae extracts such as Viviscal help as well.\u000a\u000aSkin care begins with sun protection. Keep your face out of the sun whenever possible and use sunscreen, but only on your face.\u000a\u000aIf you managed to avoid a bad sunburn before the age of 16, you have pretty much done a great job of ensuring your face won\u2019t prematurely age.\u000a\u000aUse body moisturizers after showers to keep your skin soft and prevent wrinkles. Do not use powders or drying agents.\u000a\u000aYour skin likes moisture \u2014 so give it moisture. Drink lots of water. The better hydrated you are, the less likely you are to get wrinkles.\u000a\u000aIt will also eliminate liver toxins that leave you with dark circles and bags around the eyes.\u000a\u000aEat fresh vegetables and fruit, and stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and sugar substitutes.\u000a\u000aWhen you drink a cup of caffeinated tea or coffee, you need three glasses of water to make up for the dehydration they cause.\u000a\u000aPlane travel is hugely dehydrating, so when you fly be sure to drink plenty of water.\u000a\u000aTake milk thistle, a supplement that clears your liver, and watch your skin improve rapidly.\u000a\u000aConsider growth hormone. If saggy skin runs in your family, you may start using human growth hormone (HGH) in your late 40s under the supervision of a knowledgeable physician.\u000a\u000aCost can be a factor here because HGH is quite expensive. Don\u2019t buy inexpensive HGH drops or lozenges on the Internet. HGH gets absorbed only if injected.\u000a\u000aOne more thing: Avoid weight swings. Try to stay within 5 pounds as much as possible, with the exception of pregnancy.\u000a\u000aPeople who keep their weight stable don\u2019t get saggy skin.

aVRide-hailing company Uber is evaluating options for its capital-intensive U.S. car-leasing business, including a sale of the unit, a source familiar with the matter said.\u000a\u000aThe Xchange Leasing business, which has about 40,000 vehicles and 14 showrooms in the United States, has attracted interest from some buyers who are considering buying it outright, according to the source.\u000a\u000aOther options include a partnership or winding down the unit by reducing its presence in a number of cities that may lead to lay offs, the person said.\u000a\u000aThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday that as many as 500 jobs could be affected by the program, representing about 3 percent of Uber's 15,000-employee staff. (http://on.wsj.com/2vgn7gQ)\u000a\u000aThe plan comes after Uber executives were informed that losses were $9,000 per car on average, steeply above the previous estimates of around $500 per car, according to the report.\u000a\u000aEarlier this month, the Journal reported that Uber's Singapore unit knowingly rented its drivers defective cars that were at risk of catching fire.

aVCoffee gives you much more than just a morning energy boost, say recent studies which point to health benefits that cover you from head to toe. They also show that the more coffee you drink throughout the day, the more health benefits your caffeine fix provides. Here's a rundown of the latest reasons for you to sit, relax, and enjoy another cup of java.\u000a\u000aLongevity. Studies show that coffee drinkers live longer than those who don't, and that it offers protection from many of the diseases of aging including cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. Researchers at Stanford found that inflammation drives the aging process, and that compounds associated with caffeine act as antioxidants and counter metabolites that trigger inflammation. They analyzed the genes of seniors and found that those with the lowest levels of inflammation drank caffeine.\u000a\u000aOne study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that those who drank five cups of coffee every day had the lowest risk of dying prematurely, and scientists found no long-term health risks.\u000a\u000aLiver cancer. Coffee could be an important weapon in the fight against liver cancer, and the more you drink, the lower your risk, says a British study published in BMJ Open. Researchers discovered that drinking one cup of coffee a day cuts the risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, by 20 percent and two cups drop the risk by 35 percent. But according to the data, five cups of coffee a day slashes your risk in half.\u000a\u000aA study published in the journal Hepatology found that coffee also reduces the risk of dying from cirrhosis of the liver by 66 percent in patients whose cirrhosis was caused by non-viral hepatitis.\u000a\u000aDementia. Caffeine may boost an enzyme in the brain that protects against dementia, say researchers from Indiana University. The enzyme, called NMNAT2, reduces the damage caused by harmful Tau proteins in the brain which accumulate due to aging and from brain-destroying plaques.\u000a\u000aWhen researchers gave caffeine to mice modified to produce lower levels of NMNAT2, they began to produce the same levels of the enzyme as normal mice. According to researcher Hui-Chen Lu, substances that increase levels of NMNAT2 in the brain could create a "blockade" against neurological disorders.\u000a\u000aAge-Related Macular Degeneration. A Portuguese study found that drinking about 78 milligrams of caffeine daily \u2014 about the amount in one shot of espresso \u2014 lowered the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in seniors.\u000a\u000aThe study found that higher consumption of antioxidants such as caffeine, beta-carotene and vitamins C and E, reduced the risk of AMD by 35 percent. "This work is a stepping stone towards effective preventive medicine in AMD," said lead author Rufino Silva, M.D., Ph.D.\u000a\u000aErectile dysfunction. Men who drink two or three cups of coffee every day are less likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED) than men who don't. A study published in PLOS ONE found that men who consume 85 to 170 milligrams of caffeine a day \u2014 the amount found in two to three cups of coffee \u2014 were 42 percent less likely to have ED than men who consumed zero to seven milligrams a day. Researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston suspect that caffeine triggers a series of events that relaxes arteries in the penis which increases blood flow.\u000a\u000aProstate cancer. An Italian study found that men who drank three cups of Italian-style coffee every day reduced their risk of prostate cancer by 53 percent. The coffee was prepared "Italian Style" using high pressure, very high water temperature, and no filters. The benefit is probably due to the caffeine, but may also be increased due to the method of preparation, say scientists, which could lead to a higher concentration of the helpful bioactive substances.\u000a\u000aMelanoma. The more coffee you drink every day, the lower your risk of malignant melanoma, which is the most deadly form of skin cancer. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that people who drank four or more cups of coffee daily lowered their risk by 20 percent when compared to those who didn't drink coffee.\u000a\u000aStress. Although many claim caffeine causes the jitters, many people believe a cup of coffee or tea is calming. Scientists from Portugal, the United States, and Brazil gave mice caffeine in their drinking water and then subjected them to stress. Although stress usually quickly causes symptoms such as anxiety and memory problems, caffeine had a calming effect, and most of the usual symptoms didn't develop. Professor Rodrigo Cunha from the University of Coimbra said caffeine blocked a stress-related chemical.\u000a\u000aStill more studies found that coffee reduces the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and suicide, and helps with weight loss.

aVPeople whose blood pressure varies widely from day to day may be more likely to develop dementia than adults who have fairly steady blood pressure, a Japanese study suggests.\u000a\u000aResearchers examined data from one month of daily home blood pressure readings for 1,674 older adults without dementia. During the next five years, compared to individuals with little to no fluctuation, people with the most variations in blood pressure were more than twice as likely to develop dementia.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe present study demonstrated that an increased day-to-day blood pressure variation (measured at home) was significantly associated with the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, regardless of average home blood pressure,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Tomoyuki Ohara, of the Graduate School of Medical Sciences at Kyushu University in Fukuoka City.\u000a\u000aWhile the study didn\u2019t assess why this might be the case, it\u2019s possible that daily variation in blood pressure might cause changes in the brain\u2019s structure and function that contribute to the development of dementia, Ohara said by email.\u000a\u000aConsistently high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a known risk factor for dementia. Previous research has also shown a link between cognitive impairment and dementia and different blood pressure readings at the doctor\u2019s office.\u000a\u000aHome monitoring might give a more reliable snapshot of blood pressure than tests at the doctor\u2019s office because stress or anxiety about these exams sometimes leads patients to have higher blood pressure at the office than they do at home, a so-called \u201cwhite coat\u201d effect.\u000a\u000aParticipants in the current study were 71 years old on average. For one month, they typically measured their blood pressure three times each morning before eating breakfast or taking medication. About 43 percent of them took drugs to manage high blood pressure.\u000a\u000aResearchers reviewed data from blood pressure readings taken during that month, conducted cognitive testing to uncover the development of dementia, and reviewed medical records for the occurrence of stroke.\u000a\u000aFive years later, 134 participants had developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease and 47 had developed what\u2019s known as vascular dementia, which results from diminished blood flow to the brain and is often related to the occurrence of small strokes.\u000a\u000aPeople with the most variation in daily blood pressure readings at the start of the study were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease and almost three times more likely to develop vascular dementia, researchers report in Circulation.\u000a\u000aAmong participants with the most variability in blood pressure, higher systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) in particular increased the risk of vascular dementia but didn\u2019t appear to heighten the odds of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Systolic pressure is the pressure blood exerts against artery walls when the heart beats.\u000a\u000aOne limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on changes in blood pressure after the initial home monitoring period and didn\u2019t have information on any lifestyle changes or medications people may have used to control blood pressure during the five-year follow-up period, the authors note.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also possible that fluctuations in blood pressure could be a symptom of cognitive decline in progress rather than a risk factor for developing dementia in the future, Dr. Costantino Iadecola, director of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York writes in an accompanying editorial.\u000a\u000aIadecola noted that, presently, doctors don\u2019t know how to reduce variability in blood pressure.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe key question to be answered is whether interventions to control blood pressure variation, once available, would reduce dementia risk,\u201d he said by email.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the meantime, the take-home message is that the health of the cardiovascular system is of paramount importance to the health of the brain,\u201d Iadecola added. \u201cEven if specific measures to target blood pressure variation may not be available at this time, maintaining general cardiovascular health through lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, etc.) and control of risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, etc.) remain the most sensible approaches to stave off dementia.\u201d

aVThe U.S. military could be granted permission to conduct airstrikes against ISIS in the Philippines if given the nod from the Pentagon.\u000a\u000aTwo defense officials told NBC News that this potential military operation could be announced as early as Tuesday.\u000a\u000aPentagon spokesperson Capt. Jeff Davis said the U.S. military has had a presence in the Philippines for 15 years.\u000a\u000aWhile in Manila on Monday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. was providing the Philippines government with "intelligence capabilities" to offer their support to the country as they fight against ISIS.\u000a\u000aThose capabilities include "some recent transfers of a couple of Cessnas and a couple of UAVs (drones) to allow them to have better information with which to conduct the fight down there," Tillerson said, according to NBC News.\u000a\u000a"We're providing them some training and some guidance in terms of how to deal with an enemy that fights in ways that are not like most people have ever had to deal with," he added.\u000a\u000aTillerson said he sees no problem with the U.S. deciding to help the people of the Philippines in this way.\u000a\u000aDespite reports about the use of armed drones in the potential airstrikes, the Department of National Defense (DND) and Armed Forces of the Philippines denied those claims on Tuesday, according to Update Philippines.\u000a\u000a"Direct military actions are only allowed during actual foreign invasion by another state actor. Hence, such a proposition has to undergo a process and an agreement must be reached that should have the approval of both the highest officials of our nations," the DND said, according to Update Philippines.\u000a\u000a"Both officials, however, expressed their appreciation for the reported desire of the U.S. to help the Philippines fight Daesh/ISIS-inspired terrorists groups locally," the DND added.

aVPublic pension fund investments returned only 0.6 percent on average in fiscal year 2016, according to a report by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, far lower than their 7.6 percent average target rate.\u000a\u000aLower than expected returns did little to improve the nation\u2019s growing unfunded pension liabilities. Of the 170 plans studied, the average funding ratio was 72 percent for the fiscal year, about the same level as the year before, according to the report. Under new accounting standards introduced in 2014, however, the plans were only 68 percent funded.\u000a\u000aLower than anticipated investment returns have plagued pension funds since the financial crisis as many public retirement systems have failed to earn enough to close their chronic shortfalls. Growing unfunded pension liabilities \u2014 the difference between what governments\u2019 owe public workers versus what has been set aside \u2014 has weighed on the finances of states and cities across the country, threatening the credit ratings of Illinois, New Jersey, Kentucky, and others.\u000a\u000aSome plans have responded to adverse market conditions by lowering the assumed rate their investments would gain during an average year. However, lower assumed rates of return mean that governments must contribute more to public pension systems to make up the difference, a move that lawmakers in some states and cities have been hesitant to do in the past.\u000a\u000aThe authors of the report noted that even though returns for fiscal year 2017 are better, the recovery will likely do little to improve funding ratios. They estimate that even if pension systems achieve their estimated rates of return over the next few years, they will only be 72.9 percent funded by 2021.

aVThe Twitter user President Donald Trump praised last Saturday does not really exist, and the account might actually have ties to a Russia-backed disinformation campaign targeting the U.S. political system, The Washington Post reported Monday.\u000a\u000a"The president doesn't know whether it's a Russian bot or not," Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told the Post. "He's just pushing a narrative, whether it's true or false. This provides a window not just for Russia but for any adversary to both influence the president or discredit him."\u000a\u000aTrump retweeted a post by someone who used the handle @ProTrump45 and said her name was Nicole Mincey. She described herself as a "black conservative" who sells Trump merchandise, but Twitter users quickly realized it was a fake, and the account was suspended by Twitter on Monday following complaints. Twitter would not comment on why it took the account down, but the company regularly suspends fake accounts or accounts that have been hacked.\u000a\u000aLeading up to the election, many automated Russia-linked Twitter accounts flooded social media with pro-Trump rhetoric and made up news to aid the Republican nominee's campaign. Trump has dismissed the investigation into Russia meddling, but brought attention to the issue with his retweet.\u000a\u000a"His use of Twitter has elevated the platform," said Jamie Fly, a former adviser to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who helped create a project which tracks the influence of Russian-backed propaganda on the Internet. "It's created a situation where it's probably even more useful for a foreign power like Russia to try to influence the debate on Twitter."

aVRedditt Hudson, a former St. Louis police officer, has been quoted as saying, "There is one criminal justice system for citizens \u2014 especially black and brown ones \u2014 and another for police in the United States."\u000a\u000aPresident Trump needs to be reminded that no one is above the law, especially the police.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, Trump and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, head of the Justice Department (much like their predecessors) appear to have few qualms about giving police the green light to kill, shoot, taser, abuse, and steal from American citizens in the name of so-called law and order.\u000a\u000aBetween Trump\u2019s pandering to the police unions and Sessions\u2019 pandering to Trump, this constitutionally illiterate duo has opened the door to a new era of police abuses.\u000a\u000aAs senior editor Adam Serwer warns in The Atlantic, "When local governments violate the basic constitutional rights of citizens, Americans are supposed to be able to look to the federal government to protect those rights. Sessions has made clear that when it comes to police abuses, they\u2019re now on their own. This is the principle at the heart of 'law and order' rhetoric: The authorities themselves are bound by neither."\u000a\u000aBrace yourselves. Things are about to get downright ugly.\u000a\u000aBy shielding police from charges of grave misconduct while prosecuting otherwise law-abiding Americans for the most trivial "offenses," the government has created a world in which there are two sets of laws: one set for the government and its gun-toting agents, and another set for you and me.\u000a\u000aNo matter which way you spin it, we the people are always on the losing end of the deal.\u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re a cop in the American police state, you can now break the law in a myriad of ways without suffering any major, long-term consequences.\u000a\u000aIndeed, not only are cops protected from most charges of wrongdoing \u2014 whether it\u2019s shooting unarmed citizens (including children and old people), raping and abusing young women, falsifying police reports, trafficking drugs, or soliciting sex with minors \u2014 but even on the rare occasions when they are fired for misconduct, it\u2019s only a matter of time before they get re-hired again.\u000a\u000aFor example, Oregon police officer Sean Sullivan was forced to resign after being accused of \u201cgrooming\u201d a 10-year-old girl for a sexual relationship. A year later, Sullivan was hired on as a police chief in Kansas.\u000a\u000aSt. Louis police officer Eddie Boyd III was forced to resign after a series of incidents in which he "pistol-whipped a 12-year-old girl in the face in 2006, and in 2007 struck a child in the face with his gun or handcuffs before falsifying a police report," he was quickly re-hired by another Missouri police department.\u000a\u000aAs The Washington Post reports, "In the District, police were told to rehire an officer who allegedly forged prosecutors\u2019 signatures on court documents. In Texas, police had to reinstate an officer who was investigated for shooting up the truck driven by his ex-girlfriend\u2019s new man. In Philadelphia, police were compelled to reinstate an officer despite viral video of him striking a woman in the face. In Florida, police were ordered to reinstate an officer fired for fatally shooting an unarmed man."\u000a\u000aMuch of the "credit" for shielding these rogue cops goes to influential police unions and laws providing for qualified immunity, police contracts that "provide a shield of protection to officers accused of misdeeds and erect barriers to residents complaining of abuse," state and federal laws that allow police to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing, and rampant cronyism among government bureaucrats.\u000a\u000aWhether it\u2019s at the federal level with President Trump, Congress and the judiciary, or at the state and local level, those deciding whether a police officer should be immune from having to personally pay for misbehavior on the job all belong to the same system, all with a vested interest in protecting the police and their infamous code of silence: city and county attorneys, police commissioners, city councils and judges.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a pretty sweet deal if you can get it, I suppose: protection from the courts, immunity from wrongdoing, paid leave while you\u2019re under investigation, the assurance that you won\u2019t have to spend a dime of your own money in your defense, the removal of disciplinary charges from your work file, and then the high probability that you will be rehired and returned to the streets.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a chilling prospect, isn\u2019t it?\u000a\u000aAccording to the New York Times, "Some experts say thousands of law enforcement officers may have drifted from police department to police department even after having been fired, forced to resign or convicted of a crime."\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s happening all across the country.\u000a\u000aThis is how perverse justice in America has become.\u000a\u000aIncredibly, while our own protections against government abuses continue to be dismantled, a growing number of states are adopting Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBoR) \u2014 written by police unions \u2014 which provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the LEOBoR protects police officers from being treated as we are treated during criminal investigations.\u000a\u000aNot only are officers given a 10-day "cooling-off period" during which they cannot be forced to make any statements about the incident, but when they are questioned, it must be "for a reasonable length of time, at a reasonable hour, by only one or two investigators (who must be fellow policemen), and with plenty of breaks for food and water."\u000a\u000aThese LEOBoRs epitomize everything that is wrong with America today.\u000a\u000aNow once in a while, police officers engaged in wrongdoing are actually charged for abusing their authority and using excessive force against American citizens.\u000a\u000aOccasionally, those officers are even sentenced for their crimes against the citizenry.\u000a\u000aYet in just about every case, it\u2019s still the American taxpayer who foots the bill.\u000a\u000aHuman Rights Watch notes that taxpayers actually pay three times for officers who repeatedly commit abuses, "once to cover their salaries while they commit abuses; next to pay settlements or civil jury awards against officers; and a third time through payments into police \u2018defense\u2019 funds provided by the cities."\u000a\u000aThis is a recipe for disaster. "In a democratic society," observed Oakland police chief Sean Whent, "people have a say in how they are policed."\u000a\u000aYet as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, America is a constitutional republic, not a democracy, which means that we the people not only have a say in how we are policed \u2014 we are the chiefs of police.\u000a\u000aConstitutional attorney and author John W.

aVThe arraignment planned for Tuesday of a British cybersecurity researcher, who was arrested last week in Las Vegas on federal charges that he created and distributed a malware program to obtain banking passwords from unsuspecting computer users, has been postponed until next week.\u000a\u000aThe court date for Marcus Hutchins, 23, of Ilfracombe, England, was reset for Aug. 14 in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, according to Elizabeth Makowski, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.\u000a\u000aHutchins was released Monday from a jail outside Las Vegas, where he had been held following his arrest last week at McCarran International Airport on his way home from the Def Con computer security convention in Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aPrison spokeswoman Kayla Gieni said Tuesday that jailers at the Nevada Southern Detention Center outside Las Vegas no longer knew where Hutchins was. Makowski also did not know where Hutchins is now.\u000a\u000aElectronic Frontier Foundation general counsel Kurt Opsahl said Monday he was awaiting word that bail had been posted and that Hutchins had been released from federal custody. The foundation, a digital civil-liberties nonprofit, was helping Hutchins obtain legal counsel.\u000a\u000aHutchins' attorney in Las Vegas, Adrian Lobo, didn't immediately respond to telephone and email messages from The Associated Press.\u000a\u000aHutchins is facing six federal charges dating to 2014, including conspiracy to commit computer fraud. He is accused of creating and distributing malicious software called Kronos designed to steal banking passwords.\u000a\u000aHutchins was credited with helping in May to curb the spread of WannaCry ransomware during an attack that crippled thousands of computers worldwide.\u000a\u000aU.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Koppe in Las Vegas on Friday set Hutchins' bail at $30,000. The judge ruled that Hutchins was not a danger to the community and wasn't a risk not to appear for future court proceedings.\u000a\u000aBut Koppe ordered Hutchins to surrender his passport and not use any device that has access to the internet. She restricted Hutchins' travel to Nevada's Clark County and, for court purposes, to Milwaukee. He was also ordered to stay at a halfway house until he secures a residence, where he would be subject to home detention and would have to wear an ankle-monitoring bracelet.\u000a\u000aHutchins did not enter a plea at Friday's hearing. Other charges he faces are distributing and advertising an electronic communication interception device, attempting to intercept electronic communications and trying to access a computer without authorization. He could face decades in federal prison if he is convicted.\u000a\u000aThe indictment filed last month in Milwaukee alleges that Hutchins and another defendant, whose name was redacted, conspired between July 2014 and July 2015 to advertise, sell and profit from the Kronos banking Trojan malware.\u000a\u000aHutchins is accused of creating the malware and enabling cybertheft by spreading a program that can infect web browsers and capture usernames and passwords.\u000a\u000aHutchins has support in the information-security community, where some call him a principled, ethical hacker.\u000a\u000aHis mother, Janet, said it was unlikely that her son was involved in illegalities because he spends much of his time combatting malware attacks.\u000a\u000aIn May he was credited with discovering a so-called "kill switch" that slowed the unprecedented WannaCry outbreak, and with continuing for several days to fight the worm that crippled British hospitals and factories, government agencies, banks and other businesses around the world.\u000a\u000aThough Hutchins previously worked under the alias MalwareTech, cracking WannaCry led to the loss of his anonymity and propelled him to cyber stardom, public appearances and a $10,000 cash prize that he said he planned to donate to charity.\u000a\u000aHe told The Associated Press at the time that he didn't think he would ever return to being the "MalwareTech" that everyone knew.

aVThe growing phenomenon of loneliness, which international experts have described as a global epidemic, may be responsible for as many deaths as obesity, according to the results of two meta-analyses presented at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association in Washington.\u000a\u000aTo examine the impact of social isolation and solitude on the risk of premature mortality, researchers conducted an initial meta-analysis of 148 studies that involved 300,000 participants.\u000a\u000aThe results confirmed the longevity benefits of a rich social life: a greater social connection is associated with a 50 percent reduction in the risk of premature mortality.\u000a\u000aA second meta-analysis that brought together data from 70 studies involving some 3.4 million individuals, mainly in North America, but also in Europe, Asia and Australia, highlighted the same conclusions and drew attention to a major cause for concern: social isolation and solitude constitute risk factors that are at least as significant as others that have been previously identified, like obesity.\u000a\u000a"With an increasing aging population, the effect on public health [of social isolation] is only anticipated to increase," explains the lead author of the analysis, Dr Julianne Holt-Lunstad, Professor of Psychology at Brigham Young University, Utah.\u000a\u000aPhysical impact of loneliness\u000a\u000aPrevious studies have shown that social isolation is not good for the heart or arteries. In 2016, researchers at the University of York in England found that people living alone faced a 29 percent greater risk of heart attack and angina, and a 32 percent greater risk of stroke.\u000a\u000aResearchers have demonstrated that loneliness has an impact on lifestyle including on high blood pressure, high cholesterol counts, and diabetes. People who live alone tend to exercise less, smoke more, and eat a less well-balanced diet.\u000a\u000aFamily, friends and the workplace\u000a\u000aSocial involvement in activities, like in the pursuit of hobbies or spending time with family and friends, is one of the keys to good health and psychological wellbeing.\u000a\u000aThe researchers recommended that people should prepare for retirement socially as well as financially, as for many people, the workplace is their biggest source of companionship.\u000a\u000ain the United States, the most recent census found that more than a quarter of the population lives alone.\u000a\u000aIn France, a 2016 study conducted by Crdoc for the Fondation de France found that social isolation affects one person in ten.

aVThe United Nations has placed sanctions against North Korea, but those sanctions will not be enough to put the country's regime in check, according to The Washington Post's editorial board.\u000a\u000a"Going beyond alarm to effective action has long been the hard part and is not getting any easier," the board wrote.\u000a\u000aThe sanctions, which were voted in unanimously by the 15-member UN Security Council, will take time to work and may have little effect, the board wrote, pointing to a study by the Royal United Services Institute.\u000a\u000aAndrea Berger, the writer of the institute study, said sanctions against North Korea are "fiction in practice." Berger said that North Korea uses "illicit" networks to get supplies, and private sector companies can get around the restrictions.\u000a\u000a"The bellicose North Korean leader" Kim Jong-un has not been moved by sanctions, according to the board.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump appears to understand North Korea's threat, but the actions he plans to take are unclear.\u000a\u000a"This is the kind of security problem that requires deft diplomacy and alliance-building \u2014 not the forte of this administration, at least so far," the board wrote.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea on Monday threatened to retaliate a "thousand-fold" against the United States over the UN sanctions.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday said that Washington would be willing to talk to North Korea if the regime stopped testing missile launches.

aVThe Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider whether to pay farmers, business owners and others in three states for economic losses caused by a mine waste spill that government crews accidentally triggered in 2015, the agency's leader said during a visit to the site.\u000a\u000aEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who toured Gold King Mine with Colorado lawmakers Friday on the eve of the disaster's second anniversary, said he told people to resubmit claims rejected under the Obama administration. It's not clear if the agency could pay on its own or how much of the potential payouts would need to be approved by Congress.\u000a\u000aThe spill sent 3 million gallons of tainted wastewater from the old gold mine into rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, causing an estimated $420 million in economic damages. The EPA has designated the area a Superfund site to pay for a broad cleanup.\u000a\u000aStretches of waterways turned an eerie orange-yellow, and the rivers were temporarily off-limits for agriculture and water utilities, as well as fishing and boating \u2014 important contributors to the area's recreational economy. The EPA has said water quality has returned to the conditions before the spill.\u000a\u000aNative American reservations along the rivers also were affected.\u000a\u000aPruitt, who had promised to visit the mine during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, said he has sent letters to people whose claims were rejected by former President Barack Obama's EPA.\u000a\u000aIn January, the agency said federal law prevented it from paying claims because of sovereign immunity, which prohibits most lawsuits against the government.\u000a\u000aThe "EPA should be held to the same standard as those we regulate," he said in a statement. "The previous administration failed those who counted on them to protect the environment."\u000a\u000aIt's uncertain whether the White House and Congress, both controlled by Republicans, are willing to pay for any of the economic losses, although the GOP has been most vocal in demanding the EPA make good.\u000a\u000aIt's not clear how much money would be at stake in a new round of claims.\u000a\u000aClaims for $1.2 billion in lost income, property damage and personal injuries were initially filed with the EPA, but attorneys for some of the larger claimants later reduced the amounts they were seeking. A review by The Associated Press estimated the damages sought at $420 million.\u000a\u000aThe EPA has spent more than $31.3 million on the spill, including remediation work, water testing and payments to state, local and tribal agencies.\u000a\u000aThe agency said last year it would pay $4.5 million to state, local and tribal governments to cover the cost of their emergency response to the spill, but it rejected $20.4 million in other requests for past and future expenses, again citing federal law.

aVFormer Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agent Michael Cutler told Newsmax TV's "Newsmax Now" on Friday the media needed to "fire" their reporters and "start over with new employees" in order to get the message out about the violence posed by gangs and the horrific acts attributed to the infamous MS-13 gang.\u000a\u000a"Fire them and start over with new employees," Cutler said. "They've been brainwashed or they have a real problem with the truth. I'm talking about the media. Fire them right now."\u000a\u000aCutler said the media had blurred "the distinction between citizens, immigrants and illegal aliens." He explained immigration laws were designed to "keep out aliens who pose a threat to national security and public safety and make certain that aliens who do enter the United States don't pose a threat to the livelihoods of Americans."\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

He attributed the rise to "not so benign neglect."\u000a\u000a"We've got to go after these people. They are killing children. They are recruiting kids as young as eight years old in public school. They're responsible for an estimated 20 homicides in less than two years just out on Long Island," he said.\u000a\u000a"How in the world do you ignore that threat and accuse law enforcement of being violent when these folks are carving up children, young girls, wreaking havoc in the ethnic immigrant communities," he added.\u000a\u000aNews programs that referred to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration as a "travel ban of aliens from Muslim majority countries" should actually call it by its official title, which is "Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States," Cutler maintained.\u000a\u000aOn Friday Trump traveled to Long Island to urge Congress to increase funding for his crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime. Targeting MS-13 is a top priority of his administration.\u000a\u000a"Together we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities and we're going to destroy the vile, criminal cartel MS-13 and many other gangs," Trump said Friday, CNN reported.

aVHope is fading for a feel-good ending at the U.S. box office.\u000a\u000aAfter several months of flops like Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cKing Arthur\u201d and EuropaCorp\u2019s \u201cValerian,\u201d movie studios and theaters are beginning to acknowledge that their streak of record-setting ticket sales may be coming to an end. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the world\u2019s biggest cinema chain, laid out a worse-than-projected outlook for the North American box office this week.\u000a\u000aThat announcement dragged down shares of theater stocks, wiping out $1.3 billion from the value of the top four cinema operators in North America since Aug. 1. Even with a new \u201cStar Wars,\u201d a Marvel superhero movie and the sequel to \u201cBlade Runner\u201d on the docket for the holiday season, the box office is unlikely to make up for a \u201csevere hit\u201d in the third quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. To date, receipts are down 2 percent in 2017, and AMC is projecting a 1.5 percent decline for the full year.\u000a\u000aThe concern is that the slump isn\u2019t just a run of bad luck. Cinema operators have managed for years to keep increasing sales by raising ticket prices amid stagnant attendance, but a sharp drop in filmgoing would make that harder to sustain. And the tried-and-true formula of churning out big-budget sequels and cinematic universes populated with superbeings seems to be wearing on filmgoers. Movies featuring once-reliable draws Jack Sparrow, the Transformers and the Mummy did poorly in the U.S.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, competition is heating up. Netflix Inc. and other digital distributors are creating more original movies, and consumers have more demands on their attention than ever, from Snapchat to YouTube. Further exacerbating the trend, studios are expected to push for a new premium video-on-demand window this year.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that Hollywood could reverse the trend next year, when a new movie about Han Solo, an Avengers film, and sequels to \u201cDeadpool\u201d and \u201cJurassic World\u201d are scheduled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is very typical of the movie business,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cYou could make the argument that the slate for next year looks really good, which should grow the market next year in North America. That part\u2019s a cyclical thing, and it\u2019s likely to come back.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd movie-theater operators Regal Entertainment Group, Cinemark Holdings Inc. and Imax Corp. aren\u2019t facing the same level of pressure as AMC, which is carrying almost $5 billion in debt after expanding its empire to Europe, with acquisitions in the U.K. and Sweden.\u000a\u000aControlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group Co., AMC has become the poster child for China\u2019s incursion into Hollywood. Concern that Dalian Wanda\u2019s international investments may wane is adding to AMC\u2019s troubles. \u201cWith China cracking down on funding for AMC\u2019s majority shareholder, Dalian Wanda, the cinema chain faces murky prospects given its high debt level and appetite for global M&A,\u201d wrote Geetha Ranganathan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\u000a\u000aAs an expression of confidence in its future, the theater operator late Thursday announced its board approved as much as $100 million in repurchases of its Class A stock, or about 5 percent of its total equity market value, which includes Class B shares held by Wanda.\u000a\u000aChief Executive Officer Adam Aron said he also plans to buy shares personally over the next 60 days.\u000a\u000aAMC said Tuesday it will cut jobs and plans to write off its investment in National CineMedia LLC, resulting in a loss of as much as $178.5 million. The company will also pursue \u201cstrategic pricing\u201d -- possibly selectively charging more for hot tickets or offering discounts to fill seats -- and cut back on investments in improvements to its theaters, such as reclining seats.\u000a\u000aThe revised outlook means AMC\u2019s indebtedness is likely to be higher by the end of the year, though probably not enough to lead to a downgrade, said Jason Cuomo, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Dialing back on investments will help the company weather the storm, he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have some levers they can pull and manage, and they\u2019re not going to stand still,\u201d Cuomo said.\u000a\u000aCanada\u2019s Cineplex Inc. also reported poor second-quarter results as movie fans grow tired of franchises, so-called \u201csequel-itis.\u201d It too will cut spending and jobs, even as it considers price hikes to offset higher minimum wages in Canada. Regal\u2019s earnings missed estimates, while Imax\u2019s were in line with analysts\u2019 projections. Cinemark is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Friday.\u000a\u000aThe big shadow hanging over the industry is whether studios will push to shorten the time between theater and home release of their movies, from the standard three months to within weeks after theater attendance has dropped off. The concern is that such a premium video-on-demand offering would give consumers less incentive to go see a movie in theaters, knowing they could watch it at home within weeks.\u000a\u000aThe studios are negotiating with cinema operators over the matter, pushing for an agreement as soon as the end of this year. Reaching a deal may be tricky. Studios are restricted from coordinating among themselves because of antitrust rules -- while exhibitors have said they will only agree to deals that boost their bottom line.\u000a\u000aMeantime, the industry is counting on Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d opening Nov. 3, and \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d on Dec. 15, to make the picture brighter.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil you see box office turn, people have to assume the worst for everything and that is why see people stay relatively concerned on the space until you get to Q4,\u201d said Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. While he has a buy rating on the stock, he says in the past he may have been too positive. \u201cYou have got zero opportunity for positive news until maybe November of Q4 when the slate looks a little bit better.\u201d

aVWell, finally we are getting that "summer of recovery."\u000a\u000aThe July jobs report released Friday was a blockbuster \u2014 solid job gains across the economy, the lowest unemployment rate in more than a decade and a nice bump in wages.\u000a\u000aThis was a report that transcends spin. You just have to tip your hat to American businesses and say, "Well done."\u000a\u000aWill Donald Trump get any of the credit? Even though nearly every poll for the past six years tells us that Americans care most about jobs and the economy (with terrorism occasionally taking over first place), the media naturally won't cover the undeniable economic speed-up since Election Day.\u000a\u000aWith the Dow at 22,000, solid job gains, confidence high and growth jumping to 2.6 percent in the last quarter under Trump, the economy clearly has a new bounce in its step.\u000a\u000aThe gains to investors and pension funds (for tens of millions of middle-class families) is on the magnitude of $4 trillion.\u000a\u000aIf the economy and jobs had done this well under Barack Obama, he and the media would have been doing cartwheels down Pennsylvania Avenue.\u000a\u000aEven worse, when the media does cover the jobs-and-growth story, every reporter asks me: "Does Trump deserve credit for these numbers?" Well, if he doesn't, who does? Liberals argue that this is a continuation of the Obama recovery, but there's a big problem with that analysis: The economy was decelerating under Obama, not speeding up. In Obama's last year in office, 2016, the economy was barely limping to keep ahead of another recession.\u000a\u000aI've argued that this Trump bounce is the result of two factors. First is the relief felt by investors, workers and employers that the Obama eight-year assault against business is over. No more tax increases, spending stimulus bills, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, minimum wages increases, the war on fossil fuels and so on. They were all bad for growth.\u000a\u000aThe second factor that has injected optimism into the economy has been the anticipation effect: People are expecting good things to come. Obamacare repeal (whoops); less regulation; the biggest tax cut since Reagan; pro-America energy policies; and so on. On the regulatory front, a lot has already happened in this regard.\u000a\u000aThe White House reports that instead of two regulatory rollbacks for every new regulation enacted, as Trump promised, there have so far been 16 rollbacks for every new rule. Hallelujah! Deregulation has caused a renewed surge in American energy production - including a big lift for coal. Obama and Hillary Clinton promised to put coal out of business; under Trump, America is now exporting American coal to places in East Europe, such as Croatia.\u000a\u000aA note of caution: It's easy to get too carried away by a buoyant stock market, as George W. Bush discovered at the end of his administration, and these equity markets can turn on a dime. So Trump would be wise not to get too carried away with the runaway stock market.\u000a\u000aThe bigger peril: What if Republicans don't get their act together and they strike out on the tax cut as they did last month on Obamacare repeal? In that case, the roaring stock market is likely to turn into a bearish sell-off. Put simply, if the GOP whiffs on the tax cut, it will harm the economy and the stock market.\u000a\u000aThat is why GOP leaders would be wise to downsize their grand ambitions of a total rewrite of the tax code and simply sell the American people on a job-creation tax cut that will benefit all American companies, including 26 million small businesses, and put about $2,000 of tax relief into the pockets of financially stressed workers.\u000a\u000aWith a pro-growth tax-cutting plan, 3 percent-plus GDP growth is right around the corner. This won't just mean more jobs but also pay raises for workers in a tighter labor market. In that case, the Trump bounce that we are seeing today will be a moon bounce in 2018. So just do it.\u000a\u000aStephen Moore is a distinguished visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, economics contributor to FreedomWorks and author of "Who's the Fairest of Them All?"

aVGerman biotech group Morphosys expects to receive royalties for its psoriasis drug guselkumab for five months this year, its Chief Executive Simon Moroney said, after its licensee received U.S. regulatory approval.\u000a\u000a"We hope to be able to say in the near future how much the royalties will amount to," Moroney told Reuters.\u000a\u000aLicensee Janssen Biotech, part of Johnson & Johnson, said late on Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Tremfya, or guselkumab, to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\u000a\u000aThat brings Morophosys a step closer to launching its first antibody drug on to the market, pushing its shares as much as 9 percent higher on Friday.\u000a\u000a"While it was largely expected, this approval marks a turning point in Morphosys' story as it prepares to receive its first royalty stream," Berenberg analysts, who recommend buying shares in Morphosys, said in a note.\u000a\u000aThey see the drug taking 15 percent of the U.S. market for moderate to severe psoriasis at the expense of Janssen's existing Stelara, of Novartis's Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's Taltz.\u000a\u000aMorphosys has so far not yet said how much Janssen would owe it in royalties, noting only that payments would likely come to a medium single-digit percentage of sales.\u000a\u000aBerenberg's analysts estimate that guselkumab could reach peak annual sales of about 3.2 billion euros ($3.65 billion) eventually, which would mean royalties of up to 185 million.\u000a\u000aMorphosys' stock rose about 9 percent in early trade on Friday and was up 8 percent at 67.41 euros by 1025 GMT, hitting its highest level in almost two years.\u000a\u000aAccording to CEO Moroney, royalties are not yet included in Morphosys 2017 guidance.\u000a\u000aThe group has so far said it expected its loss before interest and tax to widen to between 75 million and 85 million euros this year from about 60 million in 2016 as its costs for research and development rise.\u000a\u000aMorphosys, founded in 1992, has more than 100 drugs in research and development, more than a dozen of which are undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials in partnership with drugmakers including Bayer, Novartis and Pfizer.

"I'm trying to get the president to act right now, but we will also revisit this thing throughout the next six months and as Obamacare dies a slow ugly death. . . .

aVSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Police in three countries arrested 17 people on Tuesday and seized nearly 2 tons of drugs in connection with what Australian authorities said was an effort by organized crime groups to transport large amounts of drugs into Australia.\u000a\u000aTen people in Sydney, five Australians in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and two people in the Netherlands were arrested as part of an investigation into what Australian police say were two interlinked crime syndicates operating across the three countries. Officials in the Netherlands seized 1.8 tons of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, 136 kilograms (300 pounds) of cocaine and 15 kilograms (30 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine, all bound for Australia, the Australian Federal Police said. The drugs were worth around 810 million Australian dollars ($640 million).\u000a\u000a"We will allege that the two syndicates have long been involved in organizing high-volume imports of illegal substances into Australia, and laundering millions of dollars and dealing in the proceeds of crime, both domestically and internationally," Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan told reporters.\u000a\u000aThe five Australians arrested in Dubai were expected to be extradited to Australia within the next 60 days, Gaughan said. Those arrested in Sydney face a variety of charges, including conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of drugs, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\u000a\u000aA statement from officials in Dubai said the police arrests there reflect the country's "strong stance against drug trafficking." The UAE's Ministry of Justice and the Dubai Public Prosecution Office were involved in the sting.

aVA set of new strict sanctions from the United Nations Security Council won't stop the United States' problems with North Korea, but they'll send a strong message, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Tuesday, days after the council passed the measures with a unanimous vote.\u000a\u000a"We don't know that it's going to work this time," the former South Carolina governor told NBC's "Today" show. "It was a strong day for the United States. It was a strong day for the United Nations. You had the entire international community tell Kim [Jong-un] to stop."\u000a\u000aOther resolutions against North Korea have not worked, and while getting China and Russia onboard to vote for the measure is being considered a diplomatic feat, they also will need to be held accountable to enforce the sanctions.\u000a\u000a"We will be watching to see who is enforcing," Haley said. "More importantly than that, [China] stepped up and said, they're not only going to vote for this, they announced they're going to enforce it and urged other countries to enforce. The missile launch took place right next to their border. Their ground shook. The Chinese people felt it. They know this is serious."\u000a\u000aShe acknowledged that Kim may not negotiate, despite the sanctions, because he's finally gotten missiles with the potential of reaching the United States mainland.\u000a\u000a"I think what we did was, we sent a message," Haley said. "Now we have gone directly after their hard currency. Think about it. All of the revenue that comes into North Korea, it doesn't go to feeding their people. It goes to a ballistic missile program. They will no longer have the money to do that."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Haley said she knows President Donald Trump is prepared to protect the American people, responding to comments made by Sen. Lindsey Graham, who last week told the program war with North Korea may be "inevitable" unless North Korea changes its aggressions.\u000a\u000a"All of the balls lie in Kim's court," said Haley. "He has to decide, how far do you want to take this rhetoric?"\u000a\u000aTrump, though, has not said war may be inevitable, but instead that "all options are on the table," said Haley, "and the discussions we had, we'll do whatever it takes to counter North Korea."\u000a\u000aHaley later told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" that the sanctions included one of the primary banks that deals with North Korea, and also targeted coal, lead, iron, and seafood.\u000a\u000a"Then we went a step further, with no new laborers leaving North Korea," she said. "No joint ventures."\u000a\u000a"He is going to watch his hard currency go way down," said Haley. "If he chooses to do something more dangerous, the United States will respond accordingly. I think the international community will respond accordingly."\u000a\u000aShe does believe that Russia wanted to delay the sanctions initially, even though China ended up stepping up after "heavy negotiations."\u000a\u000aHaley also on Tuesday said she has "no reason" to comment on a story on Fox News' website's front page, which was retweeted by Trump, about anti-ship cruise missiles being loaded onto a patrol boat.\u000a\u000a"I can't talk about anything that's classified," said Haley. "If that's in the newspaper, that's a shame. I will tell you it's incredibly dangerous when things get out into the press like that. You are not only just getting a scoop on something, you are playing with people's lives. And this has got to stop. Whatever the leaks are coming from, if somebody thinks they are getting power or fame from it, all you are doing is putting Americans in danger."\u000a\u000aThe story was not referenced to a newspaper, however, but came from an anonymous source speaking with Fox News.

aVSix inmates snatched keys from three correctional officers at a maximum security prison in Arkansas on Monday and held the officers in an area of the facility for about three hours, the second major disturbance to occur at the penitentiary in less than a month.\u000a\u000aThe Arkansas Department of Correction said the inmates overpowered the officers and took the keys during recreation call at the Maximum Security Unit in Tucker, 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock.\u000a\u000aThe three officers were later released with scrapes, bruises and other minor injuries, while an inmate who was not involved in the initial disturbance was taken to a hospital. Shortly after the last officer was released, corrections department spokesman Solomon Graves said the inmates surrendered and the prison began returning to normal operations.\u000a\u000aGraves said the injured inmate was in stable condition after suffering injuries that could not be treated by the prison infirmary. Graves said the inmates who had taken the keys had been moved to the Varner Supermax Unit after the incident. The department did not say how the prisoners took the keys from the officers, or whether the inmates had any kinds of weapons.\u000a\u000aThe disturbance occurred a week after officials revealed that a guard at the same prison fired three warning shots into the air on July 22 after two guards and an inmate were attacked. The department said it was not informed of the shots fired until it was reported by the Arkansas Times.\u000a\u000aArkansas State Police had been on standby outside the prison during Monday's incident and was waiting to enter to begin its investigation, said spokesman Bill Sadler.\u000a\u000a"Once that occurs, our agents will enter the cellblock to begin an investigation to determine and identify any criminal activity that occurred leading up to this incident and any criminal activity that may have occurred during the course of the incident," Sadler said.\u000a\u000aGraves said the department's director and the state Board of Corrections would conduct their own investigation into the incident, including whether it was related to the July 22 attack.\u000a\u000aGraves said the incident showed the risks that the state's correction officers face on a daily basis.\u000a\u000a"Today is indicative of the inherent dangers of their work, but our staff performed admirably today and at this point we are just glad that the situation was resolved without any serious injuries to inmates or to our staff," Graves said.\u000a\u000aThe maximum security prison has a capacity of 532 inmates and has 295 employees, according to the Department of Correction website.

aVDespite President Donald Trump's bellicose rhetoric that Barack Obama's strategy against North Korea was a "total failure," his administration has basically adopted the former president's policy in its confrontation with Pyongyang, Politico reported Tuesday.\u000a\u000aEven with Trump's vow for a "very severe" response to North Korea's continuing testing and development of nuclear weapons and missiles, his administration has utilized a strategy very similar to Obama's.\u000a\u000aVeteran intelligence agent Bruce Klingner told Politico that administration officials are saying privately that a preventive military attack is "not on the table." They instead are relying on an Obama-type policy that concentrates on increasing pressure on both Pyongyang and those nations who aid the country in its weapons programs, while also boosting military readiness and capabilities and expressing the possibility of diplomatic talks if North Korea leader Kim Jong-un agrees with the principle that he must give up his country's nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"The Trump administration to date has not yet distinguished its policy toward North Korea from that of Obama," Klingner said. "The president and others have been talking tough about sanctions, as Obama did, but have not yet followed through on any significant increase."\u000a\u000aTrump's harsh criticism of the Obama administration as not tough enough against Pyongyang has now evolved into Secretary of State Rex Tillerson soothing words last week that "We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th Parallel," The Washington Post reported.\u000a\u000aIt was those words, according to the Post, that enabled China and Russia to support the sanctions resolution at the United Nations over the weekend in an international partnership that Obama also cultivated.\u000a\u000aIn any case, Politico reported most experts believe that more of the same strategy is the best path to a situation that has no magic solution and that taking military action will not bring the desired result.

"It undermines the premise of noncitizen voting to try to draw a distinction."\u000a\u000aThe College Park city council is poised to vote on the measure Tuesday, the Sun reported.

aVThe people within the White House who are leaking information, such as the transcripts of phone conversations between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia, are probably people the president trusts, former Michigan GOP Rep. Pete Hoekstra said on Newsmax TV's "The Joe Pags Show" Friday.\u000a\u000a"It's just a close-knit group of people you have to almost think that this is somebody that inherently the president may trust and would believe that the person is loyal to him and to the country and to the law.

And, The New York Times did not publish. They held back," he added.

aVPresident Donald Trump's first six months in office will cost American businesses almost $4 billion less than in his predecessor's initial half-year, according to a report from the conservative American Action Forum.\u000a\u000aFinal rule costs for Trump amount to roughly $378 million per year, while President Barack Obama's first six months cost businesses $4.2 billion.\u000a\u000a"The results are substantial," AAF's Dan Goldbeck wrote in the report. "New regulatory burdens are a fraction of those established under President Obama's first six months; overall regulatory volume has slowed to historically low levels; and a number of notable deregulatory measures have been initiated."\u000a\u000aWhen "compared to the Obama administration, the Trump administration has imposed: 1/20th of the lifetime costs, 1/11th of the annual costs, and 1/8th of the paperwork. With nearly 6 million fewer paperwork burden hours, that amounts to the workload savings of roughly 3,000 full-time employees."\u000a\u000aGoldbeck has more good news for Trump supporters who hoped he'd lower the cost on business, finding a low number of highly expensive rules imposed by Trump.\u000a\u000a"In terms of both overall rulemakings and only those designated as 'economically significant' (an annual economic impact of more than $100 million), the Trump administration has set record lows in overall rulemaking volume. Only 41 rules," he wrote. "For perspective, the next-lowest amounts for either measure were 180 and 28, respectively (both in 2001). The highest amount for either measure was 460 (in 1994) and 80 (in 2016), respectively."\u000a\u000aThe report concludes, "Both the volume and impact of new regulatory burdens have slowed dramatically . . . Beyond these first six months, the administration's ambition is clearly to go even farther and deeper."

aVU.S. job openings jumped to a record high in June, outpacing hiring, the latest indication that companies are having trouble finding qualified workers.\u000a\u000aThe monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday also underscored labor market strength that will likely encourage the Federal Reserve to continue tightening monetary policy despite benign inflation and concerns about consumer spending.\u000a\u000a"Companies are running out of workers to hire to do the job or even train to do the work, and this is a ticking time bomb for economic growth," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "Today's JOLTS data bring a September meeting balance sheet unwind announcement a little closer to reality."\u000a\u000aJOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September.\u000a\u000aTame inflation and worries about consumer spending amid tepid wage growth and faltering motor vehicle sales, however, suggest the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.\u000a\u000aJob openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 461,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million. That was the highest level since the data series started in December 2000 and pushed the job openings rate up two-tenths of a percentage point to a near one-year high of 4.0 percent.\u000a\u000aThe monthly increase in job openings was the largest since July 2015. The surge in job openings was almost broad-based.\u000a\u000aThere were 179,000 additional vacancies in the professional and business services industries. The health care and social assistance sector had 125,000 more job openings and construction companies had an additional 62,000 unfilled positions. In June, job openings were concentrated in the Midwest and West regions.\u000a\u000aSKILLS MISMATCH\u000a\u000aThe ratio of job openings to unemployment hit a 16-year high. Hiring was little changed at 5.4 million in June, leaving the hiring rate steady at 3.7 percent.\u000a\u000aThe gap between job openings and hiring points to a skills mismatch, which was also corroborated by a separate report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business.\u000a\u000aThe NFIB survey showed job openings at a 16-year high in July. Small businesses cited a lack of skills as the main reason for the vacancies. Others also blamed "unreasonable" wage expectations, attitude, appearance as well as drug addiction for disqualification of job seekers.\u000a\u000aEconomists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth. Annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent, contributing to inflation persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target.\u000a\u000a"The JOLTS report continues what has been a reasonably strong run for the labor market data, and we expect continued improvement in the job market to keep upward pressure on wages," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000aOther details of the JOLTS report were mixed. About 3.1 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in June, down from 3.2 million in May. As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in May.\u000a\u000aLayoffs rose 28,000 to 1.7 million in June, lifting the layoffs rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent.\u000a\u000a"Layoff rates are historically low. But the recent increase may be worth watching," said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job site Indeed in San Francisco.

aVIn the past few months I've been building a collection of some of the silly, outrageous, hurtful, and goofy statements people sometimes make. Here are a few of these foolish comments.\u000a\u000aUpon seeing her husband, a wife says, "You look nice. You must be planning on going somewhere." The husband, not to be outdone, retorts, "Why, yes, I'm going out to chase women."\u000a\u000aWe're in church. The congregation is following along in the prayer books and every once in a while the people intone Alleluia. The woman behind me, however, instead of saying Alleluias shrieks AMEN. With that I hear another voice say, "That's okay, Grandma, you can say whatever you want."\u000a\u000aSomeone calls my office and asks for an appointment. I offer three possibilities. His response: "Business must really be bad."\u000a\u000aIt's early morning and the wife walks into the kitchen. Her husband is reading the paper. On seeing his wife the husband says, "What are you doing up so early?"\u000a\u000aA friend tells me that he ran into one of our mutual college friends. He then says, "I asked the guy if he remembered you...and he didn't remember you at all!"\u000a\u000aA woman notices that her friend has obviously put a color on her hair. Her comment to the friend: "What color is your hair anyway?"\u000a\u000aIt's noontime and I'm standing and eating a pretzel in my office. This woman comes in, sees me, and says, "Is that your lunch?"\u000a\u000aOne man asks another where he is going. The fellow responds that he is going to the store to do some shopping. His compatriot's comment: "On a beautiful day like this?"\u000a\u000aA woman is talking to her friends about plastic surgery and she says, "If I had $4,000 and could take a month off work, I'd seriously consider having my neck done." At this point, her friend responds, "It would take a lot more than $4,000 to fix you up."\u000a\u000aHow about this one? An elderly friend has been working outside in the garden almost the whole day so I say, "Come on in and take a rest." Before he has a chance to answer, a woman visitor jumps in and says, "He won't come in, he's afraid he'll miss something."\u000a\u000aThen there is the woman who is definitely looking for sympathy from her husband when she says, "I think I'm coming down with the flu." Instead of sympathy her husband says, "Oh, no, now I'll get it."\u000a\u000aA husband and wife are at a party, and she is telling everyone about her birthday the week before. As she's telling the story, the wife looks at her husband and says, "He sent me the nicest card. I was shocked."\u000a\u000aAt another party a man asks his wife, "What time is it getting to be?" His wife's response: "You're the one who has all the watches."\u000a\u000aSome things are simply better left unsaid.\u000a\u000aCheck out Doris\u2019 latest books, \u201cThe Boy Whose Idea Could Feed the World\u201d (a middle grade read) as well as, \u201cThe Parent Teacher Discussion Guide\u201d at www.doriswildhelmering.com

aVPolice in Dauphin County, Penn., will no longer conduct field tests on confiscated drugs for fear of accidentally overdosing on fentanyl, PennLive reported Monday.\u000a\u000aDauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico recently issued the directive following reports in other parts of the country of police officers who got sick after handling fentanyl, which comes in the form of a white powdery substance and is more potent than morphine and heroin.\u000a\u000a"Normally they would put a small amount of that into what we call a field test kit to make sure that it was a controlled substance," Marsico told Fox43 News. "Because of the dangers involved and the risk associated with that, we advised the police to stop doing those field tests."\u000a\u000aLimited exposure to the drug can result in a potential overdose, says Matthew Null, a referral development manager with Gaudenzie, a nonprofit organization that offers drug and alcohol addiction treatment and recovery services at facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware.\u000a\u000a"It's not where someone is necessarily smoking it or injecting it, but just coming in contact with your hands because your hands being porous, it's going to get into your blood system, or by inhaling it, and that\u2019s where the danger occurs," said Null.\u000a\u000aDrug samples will instead be submitted to the Pennsylvania State Police lab for testing.

aVAging populations in China and Europe are poised to transform the global economy by sparking a jump in interest rates that may set the stage for a showdown between the old and the young.\u000a\u000aSo say Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan, painting a sweeping picture of the future economic landscape in a new paper published by the Bank for International Settlements.\u000a\u000aIn it, the London School of Economics professor and former Morgan Stanley economist push back against the popular view that an aging population will slow growth and drag down rates. The research contrasts with models cited by the Federal Reserve, which project that inflation-adjusted real rates are intrinsically tied to potential growth.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe demographic sweet spot is already behind us, and both the equilibrium real interest rate and inflation have probably already stopped falling,\u201d write Goodhart and Pradhan. \u201cFuture problems may now intensify as the demographic structure worsens, growth slows, and there is little stomach for major inflation.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead More: Economic Research Roundup\u000a\u000aA three-decade rush of new workers from Asia and other emerging markets has juiced returns for bond investors thanks to weak price growth, creating a sweet spot for capital owners that\u2019s now reversing, the authors write.\u000a\u000aBut demographic trends are poised to be the driving force for the price of labor and capital across large economies and a graying population will in turn drain savings ratios and offset a corresponding reduction in investment spending, which tends to fall when demand is lower.\u000a\u000aThat dynamic should spur a rise in the effective cost of capital, or real rates, the authors reckon, pushing back against a view held by Fed researchers that real rates will stay low amid weak potential growth.\u000a\u000aA key reason for Goodhart and Pradhan\u2019s belief that workers will adjust their savings rates while still in the labor force, thereby anchoring rates, is their projection that a social-safety net will stay in place in advanced economies. That would reduce the incentive for workers to up their savings, and spur a rapid \u2018dissaving\u2019 upon retirement.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no shortage of counterpoints to this view, including savers\u2019 enduring need for \u2018safe assets\u2019 that boosts demand for highly-rated debt and caps yields. Meanwhile, the purchasing power of retired consumers isn\u2019t guaranteed if the young begin to fight back, while technological innovations may reshape the landscape for productivity and rates.\u000a\u000aThe authors acknowledge some of these counterpoints but argue demographics are consistently more powerful than typical models project.\u000a\u000aAs more companies give the proverbial retirement watch to a growing number of workers, tighter labor markets should also push wages up, helping to reduce inequality across advanced economies along the way, they say. As global savings ratios drain out, the debt time-bomb is ticking, they conclude.

aVOne of the more potent inhibitors of prostate cancer development, growth, and invasion is silibinin (silymarin compound).\u000a\u000aIt has been shown to increase the ability of doxorubicin to kill both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.\u000a\u000aDoxorubicin is a very toxic chemotherapy drug. Combining it with silibinin allows a lower and therefore safer dose without diminishing its ability to kill prostate cancer cells.\u000a\u000aSilibinin is quite safe, even in larger doses. It has the added advantage of protecting the liver, which can be damaged by many chemotherapy agents.\u000a\u000aA final example of the anticancer synergy of natural plant extracts can be found in pomegranates. Several studies have shown that pomegranate extract can inhibit prostate cancer.\u000a\u000aAnd when it is combined with quercetin and resveratrol, it inhibits leukemia cells.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s believed that the active component in pomegranate is ellagic acid, which can also be purchased as a pure natural supplement.\u000a\u000aIt is becoming obvious that complex mixtures of whole herbs and plant extracts, when properly compounded, can control even advanced cancers.\u000a\u000aOne such anticancer mixture was originally made by a Canadian nurse named Rene Caisse. It is now sold as Essiac tea (her last name spelled backward) with ingredients that include:\u000a\u000a\u2022 Burdock root\u000a\u000a\u2022 Sheep sorrel\u000a\u000a\u2022 Slippery elm bark\u000a\u000a\u2022 Turkish rhubarb\u000a\u000a\u2022 Blessed thistle herb\u000a\u000a\u2022 Organic red clover blossom\u000a\u000aAll of those plant extracts contain high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and other anticancer compounds, giving Essiac tea powerful anticancer synergy.\u000a\u000aThe tea has been shown to provide long-term control of some advanced cancers.\u000a\u000aIn addition, plant extracts have shown considerable safety and effectiveness.\u000a\u000aBy enhancing the cancer-killing and -suppressing ability of chemotherapy drugs and radiation treatments, they not only make those treatments more effective, they also make them safer by protecting normal cells and organs from damage caused by conventional treatments.\u000a\u000aYet I still have patients say that their oncologist told them to avoid these compounds because they \u201cmay interfere with their treatment.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis lack of familiarity with modern medicalliterature is inexcusable in any doctor \u2014 and is costing many cancer patients their lives.

aVPeople whose sense of taste is less acute than normal tend to choose sweeter foods that are higher in calories than those with normal ability to taste food. The diminished sense of taste can lead to obesity, say Cornell University food scientists.\u000a\u000a"We found that the more people lost sensitivity to sweetness, the more sugar they wanted in their foods," said lead author Robin Dando.\u000a\u000aExperts have suspected a link between dulled taste and obesity, but no tests had been conducted to see if losing taste changed the amount of food a person ate. In the new study, which was published in the journal Appetite, Dando temporarily dulled the taste buds of study participants and had them sample foods of varying sugar concentrations.\u000a\u000aResearchers provided volunteers with an herbal tea with low, medium or high concentrations of a naturally occurring herb, Gymnema Sylvestre, which is known to temporarily block sweet receptors. During the testing, participants added sugar to the unsweetened tea until it achieved their desired level of sweetness.\u000a\u000aStudy participants added 8 to 12 percent sucrose to the tea. (Soft drinks are generally around 10 percent sugar.) Those who ingested the tea with the largest concentrations of the taste-blocking herb preferred higher concentrations of sugar.\u000a\u000a"Others have suggested that the overweight may have a reduction in their perceived intensity of taste. So, if an overweight or obese person has a diminished sense of taste, our research shows that they may begin to seek out more intense stimuli to attain a satisfactory level of reward," explained Dando. This can influence their eating habits to compensate for a lowered sense of taste, he said.\u000a\u000aThe study showed that for a regular, sugary 16-ounce soft drink, a person with a 20 percent reduction in the ability to taste sweet would add an extra teaspoon of sugar to reach an optimal level of sweetness, as compared to someone with normal taste response.\u000a\u000aThe sense of taste may help experts understand the development of obesity, said Dando, and "taste dysfunction should be considered as a factor."\u000a\u000aAnother sense, the sense of smell, is also implicated in weight control, but the loss of smell had the opposite effect on weight. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that obese mice who lost their sense of smell also lost weight. But mice that retained their sense of smell ballooned to twice their normal weight by eating the same amount of fatty food as the mice with no sense of smell.\u000a\u000aThe study suggested that the odor of what we eat may play an important role in how the body deals with calories. If you can't smell your food, you may burn it rather than store it. But simply being able to smell your food may pack on the pounds.

aVAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has fired an employee who wrote an internal memo blasting the web company\u2019s diversity policies, creating a firestorm across Silicon Valley.\u000a\u000aJames Damore, the Google engineer who wrote the note, confirmed his dismissal in an email, saying that he had been fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe imbroglio at Google is the latest in a long string of incidents concerning gender bias and diversity in the tech enclave. Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick lost his job in June amid scandals over sexual harassment, discrimination and an aggressive culture. Ellen Pao\u2019s gender-discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 2015 also brought the issue to light, and more women are speaking up to say they\u2019ve been sidelined in the male-dominated industry, especially in engineering roles.\u000a\u000aEarlier on Monday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent a note to employees that said portions of the memo \u201cviolate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d But he didn\u2019t say if the company was taking action against the employee. A Google representative, asked about the dismissal, referred to Pichai\u2019s memo.\u000a\u000aDamore\u2019s 10-page memorandum accused Google of silencing conservative political opinions and argued that biological differences play a role in the shortage of women in tech and leadership positions. It circulated widely inside the company and became public over the weekend, causing a furor that amplified the pressure on Google executives to take a more definitive stand.\u000a\u000aAfter the controversy swelled, Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s new vice president for diversity, integrity and governance, sent a statement to staff condemning Damore\u2019s views and reaffirmed the company\u2019s stance on diversity. In internal discussion boards, multiple employees said they supported firing the author, and some said they would not choose to work with him, according to postings viewed by Bloomberg News.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company,\u201d Brown said in the statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe memo and surrounding debate comes as Google fends off a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor alleging the company systemically discriminates against women. Google has denied the charges, arguing that it doesn\u2019t have a gender gap in pay, but has declined to share full salary information with the government. According to the company\u2019s most recent demographic report, 69 percent of its workforce and 80 percent of its technical staff are male.\u000a\u000aFollowing the memo\u2019s publication, multiple executives shared an article from a senior engineer who recently left the company, Yonatan Zunger. In the blog post, Zunger said that based on the context of the memo, he determined that he would \u201cnot in good conscience\u201d assign any employees to work with its author. \u201cYou have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment,\u201d he wrote. He also said in a email, \u201cCould you imagine having to work with someone who had just publicly questioned your basic competency to do your job?\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, some right-wing websites had already lionized the memo\u2019s author, and firing him could be seen as confirming some of the claims in the memo itself \u2013 that the company\u2019s culture makes no room for dissenting political opinions. That outcome could galvanize any backlash against Alphabet\u2019s efforts to make its workforce more diverse.\u000a\u000aIn her initial response to the memo, Brown, who joined from Intel Corp. in June, suggested that Google was open to all hosting \u201cdifficult political views,\u201d including those in the memo. However, she left open the possibility that Google could penalize the engineer for violating company policies. \u201cBut that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws,\u201d she wrote.\u000a\u000aThe subject of Google\u2019s ideological bent came up at the most recent shareholder meeting, in June. A shareholder asked executives whether conservatives would feel welcome at the company. Executives disagreed with the idea that anyone wouldn\u2019t.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe company was founded under the principles of freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness and science-based thinking,\u201d Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019ll also find that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.\u201d

aVU.S. regulators have approved the first drug to treat all forms of hepatitis C in as little as eight weeks.\u000a\u000aThe pill combination from AbbVie Inc. was approved Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration for adults without significant cirrhosis, a type of liver disease, and many patients who were not cured by prior treatment.\u000a\u000aMavyret joins two other AbbVie hepatitis C drugs, one from Merck & Co. and four from Gilead Sciences Inc. on the market. That gives doctors and patients more options, and insurers more leverage to wring discounts out of companies to cover the pricey drugs.\u000a\u000aAn estimated 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually develops slowly over decades, with no symptoms until serious damage is done. Without treatment, the virus can cause liver failure and liver cancer, often requiring a liver transplant or resulting in death.\u000a\u000aFor decades, hepatitis C treatment required a year of grueling shots and pills that gave patients flu-like symptoms and still barely cured half of them. Starting late in 2013, Gilead revolutionized treatment with the first pill-only medicines that brought cures in 12 weeks for more than 90 percent of patients.\u000a\u000aGilead has been raking in billions on the drugs. Insurance plans and government health programs have been straining to cover the huge cost \u2014 up to $94,500 for a course of treatment with its second drug, Harvoni \u2014 and initially limited coverage to the sickest patients.\u000a\u000aAbbvie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, said Mavyret's list price without insurance will be $26,400 for eight weeks' treatment, $39,600 for 12 weeks' treatment and $52,800 for 16 weeks' treatment.\u000a\u000aAs the latest entrant in a competitive market in which commercial insurers mostly have deals giving them discounts of up to 50 percent in exchange for not covering rivals' hepatitis C drugs, Maryvet is priced well below the other approved drugs. AbbVie spokesman Morry Smulevitz said the company initially will focus on getting coverage approved by Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration.\u000a\u000aThe key to how much market share Maryvet can get will depend on the discounts it offers payers, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote to investors.\u000a\u000aMavyret is the latest drug to treat all six forms of hepatitis C, following Gilead's Epclusa. Earlier drugs generally are limited to patients with just one or a few hepatitis C types or at certain stages of the disease.\u000a\u000aIn testing that included 2,300 adult patients, 97.5 percent who didn't have cirrhosis were cured, meaning the virus was undetectable in their blood, in eight weeks after taking Mavyret. Among patients with severe kidney damage, 98 percent were cured after 12 weeks of treatment, according to AbbVie.\u000a\u000aMaryvet combines two hepatitis C medicines, glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, taken as three pills together once a day. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, fatigue and itchy skin. In patients who previously had hepatitis B infections, treatment with Maryvet can reactivate that virus, causing potentially fatal liver problems.\u000a\u000aFollow Linda A.

A key warning sign on this scam is if a financial adviser recommends moving an asset into a Roth IRA at less than its full value. The IRS defines these as \u201cdeductions for contributions of an employer to an employee's trust or annuity plan and compensation under a deferred payment plan.\u201dThis is a common problem to be aware of in retirement. This involves an e-mail sent by a fake tax preparer asking for someone to update their online IRS information. It is an attempt to get at usernames and passwords. The IRS also warns retirees to be aware of phone scams that go around at tax time asking for tax bills to be paid. Victims are threatened and told they must pay immediately. Often callers can alter caller ID to make it look like the IRS is calling. The IRS does not call and demand immediate payment in that way.

aVThe U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday asked a federal judge to dismiss a criminal charge against Toyota Motor after the Japanese automaker completed three years of monitoring as part of a $1.2 billion settlement over claims of sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.\u000a\u000aThe request, filed in federal court in Manhattan, should bring to an end Toyota's legal woes stemming from its admission that it misled U.S. consumers by concealing and making deceptive statements about the extent of sudden acceleration problems in 2009 and 2010.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the world's second-largest automaker paid what was then a record fine for a car company to settle the case and reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. That agreement included three years of oversight by an independent monitor, which ended on Monday.\u000a\u000aFormer U.S. attorney David Kelley, who acted as the monitor, declined to comment, citing confidentiality rules.\u000a\u000aToyota spokesman Scott Vazin said the automaker was pleased the government confirmed Toyota's compliance with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement and was moving to dismiss the case.\u000a\u000a"Over the past three years, we have worked hard in the spirit of continuous improvement to make Toyota a stronger company that serves its customers better," he said.\u000a\u000aIn bringing charges, the Justice Department said that Toyota minimized problems, misled regulators and provided inaccurate information to Congress in the scandal linked to at least five deaths.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the case presented a "reprehensible picture of corporate misconduct" and expressed hope the government would ultimately hold responsible decision-makers at Toyota accountable. "This, unfortunately, is a case that demonstrates that corporate fraud can kill," he said.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the Justice Department did not bring criminal charges against current or former Toyota executives.\u000a\u000aThe $1.2 billion settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen AG admitted to diesel emissions fraud earlier this year and paid $4.3 billion in fines.\u000a\u000aToyota made significant changes to its safety practices after the recall crisis that briefly forced it to halt sales of nearly half of its vehicles in 2010 and led to company president Akio Toyoda appearing before Congress to apologize.\u000a\u000aToyota settled other related suits, including an agreement covering as many as 22 million current and former Toyota owners over sudden acceleration claims valued at as much as $1.63 billion.

aVMartin Shkreli, the eccentric former pharmaceutical CEO notorious for a price-gouging scandal and for his snide "Pharma Bro" persona on social media, was convicted Friday on federal charges he deceived investors in a pair of failed hedge funds.\u000a\u000aA Brooklyn jury deliberated five days before finding Shkreli guilty on three of eight counts. He had been charged with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\u000a\u000aProsecutors had accused Shkreli of repeatedly misleading investors about what he was doing with their money. Mostly, he was blowing it with horrible stock picks, forcing him to cook up a scheme to recover millions in losses, they said.\u000a\u000aShkreli, 34, told "lies upon lies," including claiming he had $40 million in one of his funds at a time when it only had about $300 in the bank, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said in closing arguments. The trial "has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is \u2014 a con man who stole millions," added another prosecutor, Jacquelyn Kasulis.\u000a\u000aBut the case was tricky for the government because investors, some wealthy financiers from Texas, testified at the trial conceded that Shkreli's scheme actually succeeded in making them richer, in some cases doubling or even tripling their money on his company's stock when it went public. The defense portrayed them as spoiled "rich people" who were the ones doing the manipulating.\u000a\u000a"Who lost anything? Nobody," defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors had to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was "the greatest investment I've ever made," he added.\u000a\u000aFor the boyish-looking Shkreli, one of the biggest problems was not part of the case - his purchase in 2014 of rights to a life-saving drug that he promptly raised the price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. Several potential jurors were kept off the panel after expressing distain for the defendant, with one calling him a "snake" and another "the face of corporate greed."\u000a\u000aThe defendant also came into the trial with a reputation for trolling his critics on social media to a degree that got him kicked off Twitter and for live-streaming himself giving math lessons or doing nothing more than petting his cat, named Trashy. Among his other antics: boasting about buying a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album for $2 million.\u000a\u000aDuring about a month of testimony, Shkreli appeared engaged at times, grinning when his lawyer described him as a misunderstood misfit. Other times he looked bored, staring into space and playing with his hair.\u000a\u000aShkreli, who comes from an Albanian family in Brooklyn, was arrested in 2015 on charges he looted another drug company he founded, Retrophin, of $11 million in stock and cash to pay back the hedge fund investors. Investors took the witness stand to accuse Shkreli of keeping them in the dark as his scheme unfolded.\u000a\u000a"I don't think it mattered to him \u2014 it was just what he thought he could get away with," said Richard Kocher, a New Jersey construction company owner who invested $200,000 with Shkreli in 2012. "It was insulting."\u000a\u000aShkreli's lawyer agreed his client could be annoying, saying, "In terms of people skills, he's impossible," and referring to him as a "nerd" and a "mad scientist." But he said his hedge fund investors knew what they were getting.\u000a\u000a"They found him strange. They found him weird. And they gave him money. Why? Because they recognized genius," Brafman said, adding that they had signed agreements that his client wasn't liable if they lost their money.\u000a\u000aJurors also heard odd vignettes befitting the quirky defendant: how Shkreli slept on the floor of his office in a sleeping bag for two years; how a drug company board member and former American Express executive wrote an email saying he'd meet with Shkreli "only if I can touch your soft skin"; how Shkreli wrote a letter to the wife of an employee threatening to make the family homeless if the man didn't settle a debt.\u000a\u000aShkreli didn't testify. But rather than lay low like his lawyers wanted, he got into the act by using Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case. In one recent post, he wrote, "My case is a silly witch hunt perpetrated by self-serving prosecutors. ... Drain the swamp. Drain the sewer that is the (Department of Justice.)"\u000a\u000aThe judge ordered Shkreli to keep his mouth shut in and around the courtroom after another rant to new reporters covering the trial.\u000a\u000aProsecutors "blame me for everything," he said. "They blame me for capitalism."

aVA tax on sugary drinks in Philadelphia has made those drinks more expensive in the city than beer, according to a Tax Foundation report.\u000a\u000aThe 1.5-cent per ounce excise tax is 24 times higher than the Pennsylvania tax rate on beer. "Purchases of beer are also now less expensive than nonalcoholic beverages subject to the tax in the city," according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe Tax Foundation noted that Philadelphia installed the tax as a means to raise revenue, not as a way to fight obesity.\u000a\u000aThe tax is also on diet soda, as a means to raise money for pre-kindergarten programs. However, less than half of the $39.4 million collected since the tax took effect Jan. 1 has gone to education, the study reported.\u000a\u000a"In practice it awards just 49 percent of the soda tax revenues to local pre-K programs. Another 20 percent of the soda tax revenues fund government employee benefits or city programs, while the rest of the money will go towards parks, libraries, and community schools."\u000a\u000aDrink maker PepsiCo announced a layoff of 100 workers and said a 43-percent decline in business as the result of the tax, according to The New York Post in March.\u000a\u000aIn April, Coca-Cola said the Philadelphia tax led to a 32-percent drop in Coke product sales in the city.\u000a\u000aThe $39.4 million is short of the $92 million that was anticipated for the tax, according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe report also said that soda taxes hurt low-income customers most.

aVDemocrats are optimistic about their chances in the midterm elections, but Republicans still have a clear advantage, according to CNN top editor-at-large Chris Cillizza.\u000a\u000a"Midterm elections are historically terrible for the president's party," Cillizza wrote on Tuesday. "In 18 of the last 20 midterm elections, the president's party has lost seats. In those 18 elections, the average seat loss is 33. Those numbers are even more daunting for presidents under 50 percent job approval \u2014 as [President] Donald Trump is right now. Since 1946, the average seat loss in the House in that situation is 36 seats."\u000a\u000aHe then refers to FiveThirtyEight's David Wasserman, who wrote on Monday that "Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats."\u000a\u000aClinton won 23 districts now held by Republicans, but only eight of those 23 were won by former President Barack Obama in 2012, and even winning each of these seats without losing one Democrat from a district Trump won would still leave the progressive party short of a majority. Cillizza notes that 25 Democratic seats are at risk in 2018, or 52 percent of the party's seats, while Republicans must only defend eight, or 15 percent of their total.\u000a\u000a"In short: The political environment is looking very, very good for Democrats. But the math is unchanging \u2014 and bad \u2014 for them," he writes.\u000a\u000a"History suggests that political environments can sometimes overwhelm raw numbers. But, for that to happen you need a gale-force wind blowing in one direction. And that is a very rare thing."

aVGardening is an enjoyable hobby, but it is also a wonderful way to reduce your dependence on store-bought food, which is often not grown locally or organically. Even if you don\u2019t have a lot of space or time, these tips will help you make the most of your garden and provide your family with as much high-quality food as possible.\u000a\u000a1. Start with great soil \u2013 Your growing medium will be your plants\u2019 home for as long as it is producing for you. Natural Living Ideas suggests adding plenty of compost to garden soil as an amendment. Healthy plants grow stronger and produce a bigger harvest.\u000a\u000aSpecial: The Eating Cure for Your Arthritis Pain\u000a\u000a2. Extend the seasons \u2013 Mother Earth News says to \u201cstart early, end late.\u201d Pushing your harvest time window earlier in the spring and later into the fall or winter means using cloches to protect plants from frost or cloth row covers for larger areas.\u000a\u000a3. Plant perennial crops \u2013 Many gardeners overlook perennials, but they can bring big harvests that just return and get bigger every year, advises Mother Earth News. Fruits like blackberries, blueberries, and rhubarb produce every year, and an asparagus patch, when properly maintained, will produce for decades.\u000a\u000aAlert: GMO Food Linked to Accelerated Aging and Death\u000a\u000a4. Succession planting \u2013 According to Earth911, this method of staggering the timing of your plantings will produce more food over a longer period of time. For example, you might plant an initial crop of lettuce from seed in early April and then plant again three weeks later. Then, you\u2019ll have your new lettuce maturing just as the first crop is finishing up. When one crop is finished, remove it and plant something new in its place.\u000a\u000a5. Harvest early and often \u2013 Natural Living Ideas says that most gardeners get lazy about harvesting crops later in the season. They recommend harvesting vegetables as soon as they are ready; don\u2019t wait. They also say regular harvesting keeps the plant producing better than if you leave vegetables on plants for too long.\u000a\u000a6. Cut-and-come-again crops \u2013 These are crops that produce more than one harvest, says Mother Earth News. For example, Swiss chard can be harvested just a few leaves at a time while leaving the plant in the ground. It will continue to produce over a long period of time. Broccoli will often produce side shoots and smaller heads once the main head is harvested.\u000a\u000aShocking: Brain Toxins Found in Common Foods You Eat\u000a\u000aBrande Plotnick is an ambitious home cook, gardener, beekeeper, writer, and speaker who started her website, Tomato Envy, to inspire others to find their deliberately decadent life at home.

These plans let employees invest part of their paycheck before taxes. That money can grow tax free until retirement. Then the money will be taxed as income when it is paid out. Many companies offer the added benefit and incentive to employees of matching money the employee saves. This is like getting a small raise.There are many circumstances in which a saver can take money out of a 401(k) before retirement, taking a personal loan on money they invested, or paying for certain large expenses, like medical bills, education or buying a house. However, there are several drawbacks to withdrawing money from a 401(k).Money taken early from a 401(k) gets hit with a double whammy tax burden. The IRS can take 10 percent additional tax as a penalty for taking that money before retirement. The money will also be taxed as income.Withdrawals from a 401(k) before age 59  are going to be more costly than you expect, CNN Money said . Aside from the early withdrawal penalties and extra taxes, there is a lost opportunity to have that money grow into the nest egg you will need later in life.Many employers will allow an employee to borrow money out of their 401(k) as a low interest loan. However, most plans have a very short pay-back window. In most cases, if you leave your employment for any reason, that money is due immediately, Bankrate said

Male police recruits in North Rhine-Westphalia state have to be at least 168 centimeters tall.\u000a\u000aDuesseldorf administrative court judges noted Tuesday that the state's differing height requirements were introduced to correct the gender imbalance among applicants, which is skewed toward men.\u000a\u000aIn disqualifying the height requirement for men, the court automatically eliminated it for women too.\u000a\u000aThe court ordered authorities to reinstate the application of the 22-year-old plaintiff, Johanna Fee Dillmann.

aVSupport for a "clean" debt ceiling increase is a "tough sell" for Republicans, according to Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.\u000a\u000a"Most Republicans want to do something to lower the trajectory of the debt. I mean, a clean debt ceiling hike is like having a credit card and saying 'I've reached my limit, I'm just going to change the limit higher without changing any of my spending habits,'" Cole said Tuesday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."\u000a\u000a"That's a tough sell to Republicans. Democrats seem to be fine with that, but I think most of my colleagues aren't," Cole said on the MSNBC show.\u000a\u000aCole noted that President Donald Trump's administration had called for a clean hike.\u000a\u000a"What administration doesn't ask for that?" Cole said in the interview.\u000a\u000aThe congressman said that he wants a measure to increase the debt ceiling, but he wants to add policies that will improve government spending and debt rules.\u000a\u000a"This idea we can go on spending interminably and just simply raise the debt ceiling every time \u2014 sooner or later the credit markets are going to make that impossible to do. So let's reassure them and show them we're serious about lowering the deficits and eventually the long-term debt," Cole said in the "Morning Joe" interview.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., agreed with Cole on Thursday.\u000a\u000a"There is no reason that when Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House that the debt ceiling should be lifted without putting in place measures to get a hold of our out-of-control spending and address our national debt," Meadows said in The Daily Beast.\u000a\u000aCongress' deadline for a debt ceiling increase is Sept. 29, according to The Hill.

John Kelly will crack the whip and bring discipline to the White House in his new role as President Donald Trump's chief of staff \u2014 but don't expect him to be able to rein his boss in, veteran political journalist and bestselling author Edward Klein told Newsmax TV on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"No one, including Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, has ever been able to rein in Donald Trump.

He was so arrogant that he didn't know what he didn't know, which is always a terrible thing. And finally he reinforced Donald Trump's worst instincts.\u000a\u000a"Now, compare him, say, with Kellyanne Conway who is in the running for that job. When she goes on television, you don't hear her trying to make herself more important. She always talks about how great Donald Trump is and I think that's a key to that job."\u000a\u000aKlein said there is only one "star" in the White House \u2014 Trump himself \u2014 which should be a "warning" to Kelly.\u000a\u000a"Now if Gen. Kelly starts getting great press, which he already started getting, and he suddenly emerges as the star in the White House, I'm not so sure Donald Trump is going to like that," Klein told Khan.\u000a\u000aKlein said Trump liked Scaramucci at first because of his "blatant attacks and kind of macho attitude."\u000a\u000a"But when he realized that this was something that was not going down well not only with his base \u2014 especially because of that profanity \u2014 but also with the Republican Party, I think he then stepped away from Scaramucci," he said.\u000a\u000a"I think it was a brilliant move on the part of Gen.

aVPeople who drink moderately on a regular basis have a better chance of reaching the ripe old age of 85 free of dementia and other age-related cognitive impairments, according to a study led by the University of California San Diego School of Medicine.\u000a\u000aWhile other studies have found an association between drinking alcohol and longevity, the new study examined drinking's link with cognitive health in old age.\u000a\u000a"This study is unique because we considered men and women's cognitive health at late age and found that alcohol consumption is not only associated with reduced mortality, but with greater chances of remaining cognitively healthy into older age," said senior author Linda McEvoy, Ph.D.\u000a\u000aResearchers found that among men and women 85 and older, those who consumed "moderate to heavy" amounts of alcohol five to seven days a week were twice as likely to be cognitively healthy than non-drinkers. Cognitive health was assessed every four years over the course of the 29-year study, using a standard dementia screening test.\u000a\u000a"This study shows that moderate drinking may be part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain cognitive fitness in aging," said lead author Erin Richard. "However, it is not a recommendation for everyone to drink. Some people have health problems that are made worse by alcohol, and others cannot limit their drinking to only a glass or two per day. For these people, drinking can have negative consequences."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\u000a\u000aFor those who do not drink, studies have shown that other lifestyle choices can help keep aging brains healthy. A long-term study at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that seniors who danced regularly showed a 67 percent reduction in the risk of developing dementia.\u000a\u000aA diet rich in healthy oils is also essential. Researchers at Rhode Island Hospital found that the brains of older adults who took fish oil, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, suffered significantly less cognitive decline and brain shrinkage when compared to those who didn't take fish oil.\u000a\u000aAnother study found that a substance in olive oil called oleocanthal helps decrease the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain \u2014 the abnormal proteins that clump together and cause memory loss.

Half the group was asked how likely it was that the person was an atheist, and the other asked how likely he was a person of faith, according to the journal.\u000a\u000aPeople in the study were twice as likely to assume the fictional person was an atheist, the journal said.\u000a\u000a"Entrenched moral suspicion of atheists suggests that religion\u2019s powerful influence on moral judgments persists, even among non-believers in secular societies," the journal report said.\u000a\u000aOnly Finland and New Zealand did not show evidence in the experiment of a bias against atheists, the journal reported.\u000a\u000a"It is striking that even atheists appear to hold the same intuitive anti-atheist bias," Will Gervais, University of Kentucky in Lexington psychology professor, said about the study in Agence France-Presse.\u000a\u000aAtheists are not trusted in the "most highly religious states" including the U.S., United Arab Emirates, and India, Gervais said in the Agence France-Presse report.

"That's a great sadness, and a danger."\u000a\u000aThe retired intelligence chief made his comments while discussing North Korea, and while discussing the president's tweet Tuesday of a Fox News story, which quoted unnamed sources reporting that spy agencies detected North Korea loading anti-ship cruise missiles on a patrol boat.\u000a\u000aU.S. spy satellites detect North Korea moving anti-ship cruise missiles to patrol boat https://t.co/BPFXsLffgy \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe tweet drew criticism on CNN and from other networks, who said it was a link to a story based on an unnamed source and that contained potentially classified information.\u000a\u000aIt's unusual for Trump to tweet such a story, said Hayden.\u000a\u000a"It's an echo of what happened in February, when he retweeted, appears to have retweeted accusations that President [Barack] Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower," said Hayden. "He's the president. He can get the answer with a phone call. The same with this."\u000a\u000aSuch tweets, said Hayden are leading to a lack of credibility from Trump and the White House.\u000a\u000a"We saw this coming," Hayden said. "That was one of the great fears of people like me, the announcements, tweets, positions taken by the White House on important and less important issues were going to erode overall confidence in what the president and the White House says."\u000a\u000aThe world is at the point in which everyone needs to "take America's word for something," said Hayden, but he believes that people are going to "become very skeptical."\u000a\u000aHayden also commented on the decision of government scientists to leak a report, approved by 13 agencies, saying that climate change is real, to The New York Times because they feared the Trump administration would suppress it.\u000a\u000aIn an unusual break from the Trump administration, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, admitting she had not seen the report, told NBC's "Today" show that climate change "is real."\u000a\u000a"The magic word came at the end of your statement there, the word 'leak,'" Hayden told New Day anchor Chris Cuomo. "I'm an intelligence guy. I oppose an awful lot of leaks, certainly any leak of classified information, but what bureaucracies do when they feel as if their views cannot get a fair hearing, is you create pressure, and this kind of information comes out one way or another."\u000a\u000aAs a result, the Times was able to put the entire report out because, "as you suggest, these folks felt this would not get a fair hearing," said Cuomo. "Not that it had to be accepted, Chris, but that it would not get a fair hearing within the government."\u000a\u000aAlso on the program, Hayden discussed the growing rhetoric coming from North Korea, which has threatened to make America "pay dearly" for pushing for sanctions approved 15-0 by the UN Security Council.\u000a\u000a"We've seen an awful lot of this kind of rhetoric from the North Koreans, so I wouldn't attach any special meaning to it," said Hayden. "Now, that said, the reality behind it is gradually, inexorably changing that they are increasing their capacity to actually do some of the things they're saying. But the rhetoric is pretty standard."\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration, though, "deserves some fair criticism for their strategic patience, which was frankly paying this problem forward and not solving it on their launch," said Hayden. Instead, it passed the issue on to the Trump administration, and now the "clock's ticking."\u000a\u000a"Sanctions are slow moving," said Hayden. "They're like rust as opposed to an explosion which are identical chemical reactions but one obviously takes a lot more time ... the Trump team deserves some credit for getting these sanctions. They are very tough. They kept the Russians on our side. They got the Chinese to agree to them as well, but this will be a slow-moving mechanism."

aVSteady improvements in American life expectancy have stalled, and more Americans are dying at younger ages. But for companies straining under the burden of their pension obligations, the distressing trend could have a grim upside: If people don't end up living as long as they were projected to just a few years ago, their employers ultimately won't have to pay them as much in pension and other lifelong retirement benefits.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the American death rate \u2014 the age-adjusted share of Americans dying \u2014 rose slightly for the first time since 1999. And over the last two years, at least 12 large companies, from Verizon to General Motors, have said recent slips in mortality improvement have led them to reduce their estimates for how much they could owe retirees by upward of a combined $9.7 billion, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company filings. "Revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity," for instance, led Lockheed Martin to adjust its estimated retirement obligations downward by a total of about $1.6 billion for 2015 and 2016, it said in its most recent annual report.\u000a\u000aMortality trends are only a small piece of the calculation companies make when estimating what they'll owe retirees, and indeed, other factors actually led Lockheed's pension obligations to rise last year. Variables such as asset returns, salary levels, and healthcare costs can cause big swings in what companies expect to pay retirees. The fact that people are dying slightly younger won't cure corporate America's pension woes \u2014 but the fact that companies are taking it into account shows just how serious the shift in America's mortality trends is.\u000a\u000aIt's not just corporate pensions, either; the shift also affects Social Security, the government's program for retirees. The most recent data available "show continued mortality reductions that are generally smaller than those projected," according to a July report from the program's chief actuary. Longevity gains fell short of what was projected in last year's report, leading to a slight improvement in the program's financial outlook.\u000a\u000a"Historically, mortality rates annually have tended to come down year-over-year," says R. Dale Hall, managing director of research at the Society of Actuaries. The professional association compiles mortality data that many private pension plans use in their projections. "There really has been a little bit of slowdown in mortality improvement in the United States," Hall says.\u000a\u000aAbsent a war or an epidemic, it's unusual and alarming for life expectancies in developed countries to stop improving, let alone to worsen. "Mortality is sort of the tip of the iceberg," says Laudan Aron, a demographer and senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "It really is a reflection of a lot of underlying conditions of life." The falling trajectory of American life expectancies, especially when compared to those in some other wealthy countries, should be "as urgent a national issue as any other that's on our national agenda," she says.\u000a\u000aActuaries use two main factors to project death rates into the future: They start with current mortality levels \u2014 the percentages of people who die at a given age \u2014 and then make predictions about how those percentages might change with developments, such as new medical treatments or changes to smoking or obesity rates. For instance, the widespread prescribing of cholesterol-lowering statins in the 1990s was "a huge driver of mortality improvement," says Eric Keener, senior partner and chief actuary at Aon's U.S. retirement practice. If medical science produces new treatments for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they could have similar effects.\u000a\u000aDeath rates for Americans over the age of 50 have improved, on average, by 1 percent each year since 1950, according to a report by the Society of Actuaries. From 2000 to 2009, that long-term trend seemed to be accelerating, with annual improvements of 1.5 to 2 percent \u2014 but then those gains stalled. From 2010 to 2014, death rates were only improving by about half a percent per year.\u000a\u000aIn 1970, a 65-year-old American could to live another 15.2 years on average, until just past their 80th birthday. By 2010, a 65-year-old could expect to live to 84.\u000a\u000aBut the increases have slowed down since then. Life expectancy at 65 rose by just about four months between 2010 and 2015 \u2014 half the improvement recorded between 2005 and 2010.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the Society of Actuaries updated its baseline mortality tables for the first time since 2000 to reflect significant gains in life expectancies seen through 2008 \u2014 a major revision that predicted future improvements based partly on that trend. That led many companies, expecting their retired employees to live longer and longer, to revise their estimates of pension obligations upward.\u000a\u000aBut as it turned out, those assumptions were too optimistic about how fast death rates would keep improving. Updates in the last two years, based on more recent mortality data, have pulled down companies' estimates of what they'll owe future retirees. The 2016 update would lower pension obligations by about 1.5 percent to 2 percent, all else being equal, according to the Society of Actuaries. (The group draws on data from the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)\u000a\u000aAnd because accurate death records take a long time for the government to compile, the revised estimates published in 2016 incorporated mortality data only through 2014. The picture for 2015 still looks bleak. The overall U.S. death rate increased that year.\u000a\u000aIt's still unclear exactly how Americans' waning life-expectancy gains will mean for public-sector pension obligations, but the effect will likely be similar. The Society of Actuaries' tables are designed for private-sector retirement plans; the group is still working on an update for public-employee pensions.\u000a\u000aThere's no simple answer for why longevity gains are slowing. For years, economists and public health experts have been trying to ascertain what's behind America's troubling death trends, among them a rise in death rates for certain demographic groups. A much-discussed 2015 report suggested that mortality was rising for middle-aged white Americans, citing suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol.\u000a\u000aWhile overall mortality rates are influenced by deaths from infancy to old age, pension payouts primarily reflect how long people survive after retirement. But looking just at people over 65, the death rate worsened in 2015 for that group as well, according to a July report published by the Society of Actuaries. That was the first reversal for retirement-age Americans since 1999.\u000a\u000a"That's actually rather remarkable," says Keener. "Even in the previous years, you've seen a slower degree of improvement for the pensioners, but you haven't seen a decline in life expectancy."\u000a\u000aThe broader trend isn't unique to the U.S. A July report from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the United Kingdom found that the U.S., Canada, and Britain have all experienced similarly slowing gains since 2011. That report suggested the combination of the recession and cuts to social safety-net programs may have played a role. "These signs should be taken as warnings that worsened healthcare, behavior and environment can reverse decades of success in health and longevity," wrote Joseph Lu, chair of the Institute's mortality research committee.\u000a\u000aChanges to life expectancy in the U.K. could cut 310 billion pounds from British private-sector pension obligations, or 15 percent of the total liability.\u000a\u000aThe question actuaries can't yet answer is whether the slowdown is a short-term blip or a more permanent shift. If mortality improved by 1 percent a year for most of the past 70 years, might the U.S. revert to that soon? Or, Keener asks, "is this really a new reality that we're living in?"

"There really has been a little bit of slowdown in mortality improvement in the United States," Hall says.\u000a\u000aAbsent a war or an epidemic, it's unusual and alarming for life expectancies in developed countries to stop improving, let alone to worsen. "Mortality is sort of the tip of the iceberg," says Laudan Aron, a demographer and senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "It really is a reflection of a lot of underlying conditions of life." The falling trajectory of American life expectancies, especially when compared to those in some other wealthy countries, should be "as urgent a national issue as any other that's on our national agenda," she says.\u000a\u000aActuaries use two main factors to project death rates into the future: They start with current mortality levels \u2014 the percentages of people who die at a given age \u2014 and then make predictions about how those percentages might change with developments, such as new medical treatments or changes to smoking or obesity rates. For instance, the widespread prescribing of cholesterol-lowering statins in the 1990s was "a huge driver of mortality improvement," says Eric Keener, senior partner and chief actuary at Aon's U.S. retirement practice. If medical science produces new treatments for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they could have similar effects.\u000a\u000aDeath rates for Americans over the age of 50 have improved, on average, by 1 percent each year since 1950, according to a report by the Society of Actuaries. From 2000 to 2009, that long-term trend seemed to be accelerating, with annual improvements of 1.5 to 2 percent \u2014 but then those gains stalled. From 2010 to 2014, death rates were only improving by about half a percent per year.\u000a\u000aIn 1970, a 65-year-old American could to live another 15.2 years on average, until just past their 80th birthday. By 2010, a 65-year-old could expect to live to 84.\u000a\u000aBut the increases have slowed down since then. Life expectancy at 65 rose by just about four months between 2010 and 2015 \u2014 half the improvement recorded between 2005 and 2010.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the Society of Actuaries updated its baseline mortality tables for the first time since 2000 to reflect significant gains in life expectancies seen through 2008 \u2014 a major revision that predicted future improvements based partly on that trend. That led many companies, expecting their retired employees to live longer and longer, to revise their estimates of pension obligations upward.\u000a\u000aBut as it turned out, those assumptions were too optimistic about how fast death rates would keep improving. Updates in the last two years, based on more recent mortality data, have pulled down companies' estimates of what they'll owe future retirees. The 2016 update would lower pension obligations by about 1.5 percent to 2 percent, all else being equal, according to the Society of Actuaries. (The group draws on data from the Social Security Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)\u000a\u000aAnd because accurate death records take a long time for the government to compile, the revised estimates published in 2016 incorporated mortality data only through 2014. The picture for 2015 still looks bleak. The overall U.S. death rate increased that year.\u000a\u000aIt's still unclear exactly how Americans' waning life-expectancy gains will mean for public-sector pension obligations, but the effect will likely be similar. The Society of Actuaries' tables are designed for private-sector retirement plans; the group is still working on an update for public-employee pensions.\u000a\u000aThere's no simple answer for why longevity gains are slowing. For years, economists and public health experts have been trying to ascertain what's behind America's troubling death trends, among them a rise in death rates for certain demographic groups. A much-discussed 2015 report suggested that mortality was rising for middle-aged white Americans, citing suicides, drug overdoses and alcohol.\u000a\u000aWhile overall mortality rates are influenced by deaths from infancy to old age, pension payouts primarily reflect how long people survive after retirement. But looking just at people over 65, the death rate worsened in 2015 for that group as well, according to a July report published by the Society of Actuaries. That was the first reversal for retirement-age Americans since 1999.\u000a\u000a"That's actually rather remarkable," says Keener. "Even in the previous years, you've seen a slower degree of improvement for the pensioners, but you haven't seen a decline in life expectancy."\u000a\u000aThe broader trend isn't unique to the U.S. A July report from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries in the United Kingdom found that the U.S., Canada, and Britain have all experienced similarly slowing gains since 2011. That report suggested the combination of the recession and cuts to social safety-net programs may have played a role. "These signs should be taken as warnings that worsened healthcare, behavior and environment can reverse decades of success in health and longevity," wrote Joseph Lu, chair of the Institute's mortality research committee.\u000a\u000aChanges to life expectancy in the U.K. could cut 310 billion pounds from British private-sector pension obligations, or 15 percent of the total liability.\u000a\u000aThe question actuaries can't yet answer is whether the slowdown is a short-term blip or a more permanent shift. If mortality improved by 1 percent a year for most of the past 70 years, might the U.S. revert to that soon? Or, Keener asks, "is this really a new reality that we're living in?"

aVNorth Korea condemned the latest round of United Nations sanctions and reiterated that it wouldn\u2019t negotiate over its nuclear program until the U.S. ceases "hostile" policies.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s regime said it will "make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime it commits against the state and people of this country," the Korean Central News Agency reported on Monday. In a separate statement to reporters in Manila, North Korea called President Donald Trump\u2019s "America First" policy dangerous and said its nuclear program was necessary to avoid a U.S. invasion similar to those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\u000a\u000a"We will, under no circumstances, put the nukes and ballistic rockets on negotiating table," North Korea said. "Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves, unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the DPRK are fundamentally eliminated."\u000a\u000aThe response shows that tensions are showing no signs of abating after the UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved measures to restrict North Korea\u2019s exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Trump\u2019s administration has threatened military action if necessary to stop North Korea from obtaining an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike the U.S. with a nuclear weapon.\u000a\u000aChina, North Korea\u2019s biggest ally and trade partner, backed the sanctions in a bid to spur dialogue. It has urged North Korea to halt future ballistic missile and nuclear tests, while also calling on the U.S. and South Korea to cease military exercises.\u000a\u000a"North Korea\u2019s response is expected, because they have their own position," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Manila on Monday night. "The key is that we cannot let the situation to continue to escalate, and we need to find an opportunity to turn things around amid the crisis."\u000a\u000aThe KCNA report came as diplomats in Asia stepped up efforts to get North Korea to resume dialogue during a regional security meeting in the Philippines. Foreign ministers from China, Russia, South Korea and Japan all spoke with their North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho in Manila.\u000a\u000a"North Korea should realize that it will face stronger sanctions and pressure if it doesn\u2019t stop nuclear and missile provocation," Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, said on Tuesday in response to North Korea\u2019s statement. "We urge North Korea to make the right choice and come to the path of denuclearization."\u000a\u000aSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged Ri on Sunday to respond as soon as possible to an offer to resume talks between the two countries, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unidentified foreign ministry official from Seoul. Ri said the offer "lacks sincerity," according to the unnamed official.\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s a positive but very small step, and can at least help the two Koreas exchange some views on the current state of affairs," Kim Jin-ho, a professor of political science at Dankook University in South Korea, said of the meeting between foreign ministers. "North Korea would use the talk as a bargaining chip with the U.S., as their goal is to have dialogue with Washington, not Seoul."\u000a\u000aIn a phone call on Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Trump that North Korean issues must be resolved peacefully and diplomatically. He said the countries needed to show Pyongyang that the door to dialogue was open if North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to a Moon spokesman.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is attending the security forum in Manila, said Monday that the best signal North Korea could give that it\u2019s ready for talks with the U.S. was to halt missile launches, the Associated Press reported.\u000a\u000a"We\u2019re not going to give someone a specific number of days or weeks," Tillerson said. "This is really about the spirit of these talks."\u000a\u000aJoint discussions between six nations \u2014 China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and the U.S. \u2014 collapsed in 2009.\u000a\u000aMoon, who took office in May, has advocated engaging Pyongyang with dialogue and offered to hold rare military talks with the North to ease tensions after Kim\u2019s first successful ICBM test July 4.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is likely to continue pursuing ballistic missile tests at its current pace of about every three to four weeks despite the sanctions, according to John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at Harvard Kennedy School. He called the sanctions "too little, too late" to cut off financing for the nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"The North Korean program remains an unconstrained one with neither sanctions nor an operational diplomatic agreement holding it back," Park said

A number of veterans support organizations are focused on the needs of women and the unique issues they face.Here are five doing this work as women become a larger percentage of both the armed forces and the veterans population.Founded in 2009, the Service Women's Action Network advocates for women veterans and current service members alike in areas as diverse as health, PTSD, legal services and the planned integration of women into front-line combat roles.Grace After Fire, based in Texas, offers itself as a social network of veterans working on behalf of one another to smooth the return to civilian life especially for women working through service-related difficulties.Disabled American Veterans is a gender-neutral organization, but one that has committed resources to addressing issues raised by the growing contingent of U.S. women veterans. A widely circulated 2014 report by DAV, "Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home," found "gaps for women in health care, transition services, disability compensation, employment and housing," and recommended several steps for addressing them.A division of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Center for Women Veterans is a government resource for connecting women to VA health care and benefits. The Center also monitors VA programs to ensure that they're addressing the needs of the estimated 2 million U.S. women veterans.Fatigues to Fabulous says its core tasks are "to provide valuable job training skills" in rsum-building, interviewing and workplace attire as part of the transition back to civilian life, and also to fund "continued research on health conditions women veterans face returning from service."

What he is saying is \u2018all of those black people are there and they don't like Trump and so he's not going to get a fair trial and so they should take it out of that jurisdiction. It shouldn't be there to begin with.' I don't like that, and I'm surprised that Alan Dershowitz is talking like that.... We will not stand for it. We will push back against that because that is absolutely racist."\u000a\u000aBut Dershowitz on Monday strongly disagreed.\u000a\u000a"Look, every criminal lawyer I know, prosecutor, defense attorney, would agree with me that when you take a case from Virginia and put it in the District of Columbia, you are gaining a tactical advantage for the prosecution in a case in which the defendants are likely to come from the Trump administration," he said.\u000a\u000a"Politics matters. Race matters. Ethnicity matters. Every lawyer know that. I learned it from Johnnie Cochran who Maxine Waters praised to the hilt when he died and wanted to have Congress pass a resolution recognizing his greatness. Would she have called Johnnie Cochran a racist?\u000a\u000a"Or does she revere it only for people that are not of her race? It absurdly throws around a word that should be reserved for true racists. When she calls a real racist a racist, nobody is going to believe her. She's crying wolf and it dilutes the meaning of the word 'racism.' So shame on Maxine Waters."\u000a\u000aThe renowned Harvard Law professor emeritus also called out Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, who demanded in a tweet that Dershowitz "stop the racist B.S."\u000a\u000a"He's just dead wrong. And he's been wrong about so many things. He is so determined to find criminal conduct on the part of Trump that he's prepared to make up crimes that don't exist. How he served as an ethics lawyer for any administration is unclear to me," Dershowitz told Cosby.\u000a\u000a"I think he has to look in the mirror and question his own ethics using the word 'racism' to describe what he understands because he's a lawyer. He understands that what I'm saying is factually, absolutely correct.\u000a\u000a"And I challenge him to deny that it's correct, that you'll get a different composition of a jury pool in the District of Columbia than in Virginia and that the different composition will favor the prosecution over what they would've gotten in Virginia."\u000a\u000aDershowitz compared Mueller's probe into Russia and Trump to the characters in Herman Melville's classic 1851 novel, "Moby Dick," in which a vengeful sea captain named Ahab hunts a gigantic whale that chewed off his leg.\u000a\u000a"This is Ahab and the white whale Moby Dick. When you give a special counsel or a special prosecutor a job their job is to come back with something. If Mueller does two years of investigation extraordinary expense to the American public and says there's nothing there, many people will say he failed at his job," Dershowitz said.\u000a\u000a"So there's an incentive to find something. Remember with Bill Clinton. They started out with Whitewater and ended up with Monica Lewinsky. So in practice there's very little constraint on what Mueller can find.\u000a\u000a"Good lawyers don't stumble. They discover something because they're looking for it. I think Mueller will be looking to try to find crime wherever it is and then try to relate it back to the Russia probe."

The administration has touted the successes of his administration, such as clamping down on immigration (legal and illegal) and job growth, while others have pointed out he has lagged behind other presidents in terms of nominating people to fill various jobs across the government.

aVImmigration policy is like dating policy: It sets boundaries for how one expects to be treated. Western countries have been in an unspoken competition to come across as the least uptight about immigration. Meanwhile, countries that take a hard-line approach to immigration are viewed like a controlling boyfriend rather than someone who simply refuses to buy into the idea of an open relationship with the rest of the world.\u000a\u000aMaybe it was inevitable that someone who's immune to peer pressure would decide to put his foot down on the subject. That person is U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration announced planned immigration reforms last week that have already prompted whining.\u000a\u000aMuch of the outrage has been directed toward Trump's support of a bill to implement a meritocratic, points-based immigration system that favors professional skills rather than family relations. (Canada and Australia already have such systems, but they're seemingly immune to criticism simply because those nations seem pretty chill.) Some of the points awarded in the new system would be based on salary level, rewarding foreign nationals who have been offered high-paying jobs in the United States \u2014 an attempt to reverse the cheap imported labor trend that has done so much harm to the U.S. economy.\u000a\u000aEssentially, former Miss Universe pageant owner Trump wants to favor perfect 10s with his immigration reforms. This was destined to get some folks riled up, particularly in an era when rewarding the pursuit of excellence is considered anti-democratic at best and bigoted at worst.\u000a\u000aAt a press conference to announce the reforms, CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta recited part of the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."\u000a\u000a"It doesn't say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer," Acosta said.\u000a\u000aAcosta has confused sensible immigration policy with a barfly's late-night dating strategy. While in politically correct company, most people will talk about how everyone is equal and beautiful, and blah, blah, blah, but let's face it: Most people don't just take anyone home. Neither should America.\u000a\u000aAt least Trump's "perfect 10" immigrant-recruitment strategy favors talent over eveningwear. Trump wants to eliminate the shallow, skin-deep Diversity Visa lottery program and supports a Senate bill seeking to do just that. A strictly talent- and merit-based system means applicants with desire, dedication and determination, as proven by their effort to meet the high standards required for immigration, will be rewarded. "Potential" doesn't count, nor should it. Just consider all the guys you knew in high school who boasted of their "potential" to play pro football to understand why.\u000a\u000aI'm a "chronic immigrant" myself (to both the U.S. and Europe), and I've always immigrated in professional categories that require mountains of paperwork to justify one's skills, abilities and revenues. When you have to jump through so many hoops, it can be frustrating to encounter people in your adopted country who did nothing more than marry a native citizen (or who had the good fortune to come from a country with a high immigration quota) to gain their visa or residency status.\u000a\u000aThe version of immigration that Acosta gleaned from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, while poetic, doesn't reflect reality. Worldwide immigration isn't always blind and has long been discriminatory, favoring certain groups over others. A points-based meritocracy puts more power into the hands of the individual applicant, regardless of race or origin.\u000a\u000aTaken a step further, meritocratic immigration allows people to play the globalization game to their own benefit, providing freedom to the individual. When countries drop their immigration barriers in order to compete with one another for foreign talent, immigrants can move around as they please, choosing the countries that deliver the greatest personal benefit. The ideal outcome would be for a large group of such individuals to become powerful enough to influence policy decisions that favor individual freedoms over the whims of special interest groups.\u000a\u000aWhat are the odds that powerful lobbying groups will condone government policies that empower the individual to opt out of the traditional rat race, control their own destiny, and live and work on their own terms anywhere in the world that they choose?\u000a\u000aIf a U.S. president takes steps to empower immigrants to support themselves independently, it's inevitable that there will be pushback from those who thrive on the dependency of immigrants. That's exactly what we're witnessing right now.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRachel Marsden is a Paris-based conservative commentator, political strategist and professor.

aVThe dangers of excess aluminum in food sources has been known for many years.\u000a\u000aIn 1911, after seven years of testing both humans and animals for the effects of oral ingestion of aluminum in baking powders and food preservatives, Dr. William Gies wrote, \u201cThese studies have convinced me that the use in food of aluminum or any other aluminum compound is a dangerous practice. That the aluminum ion is very toxic is well known. That such soluble aluminum is in part absorbed and carried to all parts of the body by the blood can no longer be doubted. That the organism can \u2018tolerate\u2019 such treatment without suffering harmful consequences has not been shown. It is . . . my conviction that aluminum should be excluded from food.\u201d\u000a\u000aOnce again, that quote was written in 1911. More than 100 years later, we are still suffering from the effects of excess aluminum in many common food products.

aVU.S. health insurer Anthem Inc. said it will no longer offer Obamacare plans in Nevada's state exchange and will stop offering the plans in nearly half of Georgia's counties next year.\u000a\u000aThe moves come after Republican senators last month failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018.\u000a\u000aHundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months.\u000a\u000aNevada had said in June that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges. Anthem's decision to leave the state entirely does not increase the number of "bare counties" in the state, Nevada Insurance Commissioner Barbara Richardson said in a statement.\u000a\u000aThe insurer will still offer "catastrophic plans," which can be purchased outside the state's exchange and are only available to consumers under 30 years old or with a low income.\u000a\u000aAnthem also said it will only offer Obamacare plans in 85 of Georgia's 159 counties. It said the counties it will continue to offer the plans in are mostly rural counties that would otherwise not have health insurance coverage for their residents.\u000a\u000aIt said these changes do not impact Anthem\u2019s Medicare Advantage, Medicaid or employer-based plans in either state.\u000a\u000aThe company said last week that it will pull out of 16 of 19 pricing regions in California in 2018 where it offered Obamacare options this year.\u000a\u000aAnthem blamed the moves in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Donald Trump last week threatened to cut off subsidy payments that make the plans affordable for lower-income Americans and help insurers to keep premiums down, after efforts to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, failed in Congress.\u000a\u000aTrump has repeatedly urged Republican lawmakers to keep working to undo Obama's Affordable Care Act.

aVSen. Richard Blumenthal, who came under fire Monday from President Donald Trump about the Russia investigation during a CNN interview, said Tuesday that he can't explain either the president's "obsession" with him or the targets of his tweets.\u000a\u000a"There is an ongoing special counsel investigation," the Connecticut Democrat told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program. "It is real. It is based on facts. That's where the issue is. That's where the focus ought to be. Our national security and the rule of law are at serious risk. So it is not about me."\u000a\u000aAfter the senator defended FBI special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling, Trump launched a series of tweets, slamming him as a "phony Vietnam con artist" and later saying he should take a vacation in Vietnam.\u000a\u000aI think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aBlumenthal fired back about Trump's "bullying," saying that it did not change the matter of the Russia investigation.\u000a\u000a"It's really not about me," Blumenthal said Tuesday. "I have no idea what is in the president's head, but I can tell you I'm determined not to be distracted. I think they are designed to distract, these bullying tweets."\u000a\u000aTrump's actions, he continued, "only reinforce my determination to protect the special counsel, because he has used the same tactics in seeking to bully and intimidate the special counsel, Bob Mueller."\u000a\u000aTrump has been "drawing red lines and implying conflicts of interest, vaguely and unspecifically," said the senator.\u000a\u000aThe president also is trying "other kinds of tactics that we're trying to prevent through the legislation that we offered, bipartisan legislation to Republicans for Democrats to stop him from firing Bob Mueller unless he can show a court that there is good cause under established standards."\u000a\u000aThe legislation will "have legs" when the Senate returns to full session in September, "regardless of all [his] tweets," said Blumenthal. "I'm determined not to be distracted."\u000a\u000aBlumenthal said the legislation, already sponsored as a bipartisan effort, will most likely face broad bipartisan support when Congress returns to session.\u000a\u000a"Firing Bob Mueller would provoke a firestorm, a constitutional crisis," said Blumenthal. "Our goal is to avert it by sending a message to the president that this kind of dictatorial act would be intolerable. Checks and balances are what our democracy is about, and the grand jury provides some permanence and protection. It's an arm of the court. He can't fire the grand jury or the court. Even if he tries egregiously."\u000a\u000aThe senator then shifted to discuss his party's economic message heading into the 2018 elections, saying that the goals are to drive down the cost of living, while creating more jobs through skills training.\u000a\u000a"In Connecticut there are jobs now, there are going to be jobs in the future," he said. "People lack the skills to fill the jobs. It has to be an economic message of fairness and inclusiveness."

aVSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea vowed Monday to bolster its nuclear arsenal and launch "thousands-fold" revenge against the United States in response to tough U.N. sanctions imposed after its recent intercontinental ballistic missile launches.\u000a\u000aThe warning came two days after the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions to punish North Korea, including a ban on coal and other exports worth over $1 billion. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, called the U.S.-drafted resolution "the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against" North Korea.\u000a\u000aIn a statement carried by state media, the North Korean government said the sanctions were a "violent infringement of its sovereignty" that was caused by a "heinous U.S. plot to isolate and stifle" North Korea.\u000a\u000aIt said the U.N. sanctions will never force the country to negotiate over its nuclear program or to give up its push to strengthen its nuclear capability as long as U.S. hostility and nuclear threats persist. The North said it will take an "action of justice," but didn't elaborate.\u000a\u000a"It's a wild idea to think the DPRK will be shaken and change its position due to this kind of new sanctions formulated by hostile forces," said the statement, carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. DPRK stands for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\u000a\u000aThe North's statement "rhetorically expresses its anger" against the U.N. sanctions, but the country is not likely to launch a direct provocation against the United States, said Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University. He said the North could still carry out new missile tests or a sixth atomic bomb test in the coming months under its broader weapons development timetable.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea test-launched two ICBMs last month as part of its efforts to possess a long-range missile capable of striking anywhere in the mainland U.S. Both missiles were fired at highly lofted angles and analysts say the weapons could reach parts of the United States including Alaska, Los Angeles and Chicago if fired at a normal, flattened trajectory.\u000a\u000aThe centerpiece of the U.N. sanctions is a ban on North Korean exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood products \u2014 and a ban on all countries importing those products, estimated to be worth over $1 billion a year in hard currency. The resolution also bans countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers, another source of foreign currency for the North, and prohibits all new joint ventures with North Korean companies.\u000a\u000aAccording to a Security Council diplomat, coal has been North Korea's largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year. It was then restricted by the Security Council in November to a maximum of $400 million. This year, Pyongyang is estimated to have earned $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from fish and seafood exports, the diplomat said. The diplomat was not authorized to speak publicly and insisted on anonymity.\u000a\u000aAnalysts say that North Korea, already under numerous U.N. and other international sanctions, will feel some pains from the new U.N. sanctions but won't likely return to disarmament negotiations anytime soon because of them.\u000a\u000aLim, the North Korea expert, said the North will likely squeeze its ordinary citizens to help finance its nuclear and missile programs. Shin Beomchul of the Seoul-based Korea National Diplomatic Academy said the North won't likely return to disarmament talks unless there are sanctions that require China to stop sending its annual, mostly free shipment of 500,000 tons of crude oil to North Korea and order U.N. member states to deport the existing tens of thousands of North Korean workers dispatched abroad.\u000a\u000aAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.

Noted Medical News Today : "One person's ideal body weight may be completely different from another's. If you compare yourself to family and friends you risk either aiming too high if you are surrounded by obese or overweight people, or too low if everyone around you works as fashion models. Even comparing yourself with people outside your immediate surroundings may not work."The health website suggested looking at many factors when tabulating a good weight, including age, height, sex, bone density and muscle-to-fat ratios.The medical standard is called Body Mass Index. It is one way doctors determine proper weight for maximum health. There are many BMI calculators online including one from the federal government's National Institutes of Health website . A Body Mass Index calculates weight in relation to height.Medical professionals caution that making a comparison with body weight from person to person is a bad idea. Such comparisons are rarely accurate.However, researchers noted that in the United States, obesity levels far outpace other nations around the world, making a global standard for body mass nearly impossible, Medical News Today said.The website added: "Researchers found that overweight people have a lower all-cause mortality risk compared to those of normal weight."Those with a BMI between 18.5 and 25 are considered in the ideal range. Those with a BMI between 25 and 30 are overweight. Over 30 BMI numbers are considered obese, WebMD said Some medical professionals also calculate waist-to-hip ratios to determine obesity or fitness. They also caution, however, that someone could have a BMI in the normal range for height and weight, "but your health may still be at risk if you are not getting regular physical activity and practicing healthy eating."Added WebMD: "It's important to remember that your BMI is only one measure of your health. A person who is not at a \u2018normal\u2019 weight according to BMI charts may be healthy if he or she has healthy eating habits and exercises regularly. People who are thin but don't exercise or eat nutritious foods aren't necessarily healthy just because they are thin."

Once she gets used to that role, I think she's going to be the best."\u000a\u000aBut Gilliam said Trump needs to do more to drain the Washington swamp.\u000a\u000a"He needs to look and stop looking for people that have these big flashy things to show off, and start looking for people who have real substance," he said, adding Washington "reflects overspending and massive budgets and very wealthy people.

'General, what do you think about this tweet?'" Gilliam added. "If he had that . . . I think that would clean up the 'oops' tweets, and he could continue to just hammer.

aVTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 After decisively winning re-election almost three months ago, Iran's president on Tuesday proposed a new Cabinet for his second term that cuts out the hard-line Revolutionary Guard from controlling the Defense Ministry for the first time in nearly 25 years.\u000a\u000aHowever, Hassan Rouhani's Cabinet for now also fails to include women and his pick for the Justice Ministry is on a European Union sanctions list over human rights abuse allegations.\u000a\u000aThe Cabinet selection shows Rouhani, a cleric whose stances are moderate compared to others in the Islamic Republic, remains pragmatic about how far he can push his administration that is under the ultimate control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Rouhani's Cabinet picks ultimately must be approved by parliament, which is expected to take up the issue next week.\u000a\u000aRouhani's presidential website offered the list he presented to lawmakers, filling 17 of the 18 positions he'll have in his Cabinet.\u000a\u000aAccording to the proposal, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that saw sanctions lifted in exchange for limits of Iran's enrichment of uranium, would remain the country's top diplomat. Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who oversaw Iran's rush by into the global energy market following the atomic accord, and Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi also would retain their posts.\u000a\u000aRouhani nominated Iran's acting defense minister, Gen. Amir Hatami of the Iranian army, to permanently take over the position. That represents a major departure from previous Iranian presidents who have since 1993 appointed members of the Revolutionary Guard to the position.\u000a\u000aThe Guard, a paramilitary force answering only to Khamenei, controls Iran's disputed ballistic missile program and regularly has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf. It has deployed into Iraq as part of the fight against the Islamic State group and into Syria to support embattled President Bashar Assad. It also holds vast economic interests in Iran.\u000a\u000aRouhani, who was sworn in on Saturday, strongly criticized the Guard during his presidential campaign for trying to sabotage the nuclear deal.\u000a\u000aAfter the election, Rouhani met with the Guard and acknowledged their role in Iran's defense. But his passing over them for the defense minister position will likely draw hard-line criticism.\u000a\u000aRouhani played it safe with the rest of his Cabinet, with analysts describing his choices as the oldest overall Cabinet since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.\u000a\u000aAs in Rouhani's previous Cabinet, there are no women nominated for ministerial posts though he still has three female vice presidents who are expected to keep their posts. Rouhani's senior vice president, Eshaq Jahangir, is staying on.\u000a\u000aWhat also may trouble European nations is Rouhani's choice of Alireza Avaee as justice minister. Avaee is on a European Union sanctions list for alleged human rights violations from when he served as president of the Tehran judiciary, from 2005 to 2014.\u000a\u000a"He has been responsible for human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, denials of prisoners' rights and an increase in executions," the EU said.\u000a\u000aEight of the 17 nominees are new to their posts, including Habibollah Bitaraf, an energy minister under former reformist President Mohammad Khatami. Bitaraf was among the militant students who stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage there for 444 days.\u000a\u000aOnly the position of science minister remains unselected \u2014 a position that saw Rouhani get into a legislative dogfight in parliament over in 2014. The science minister oversees Iran's universities and hard-line lawmakers worry about allowing anyone who offered any sympathy with reformists or the West. That remains especially sensitive following the unrest that followed Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election as university students took part in the street demonstrations.\u000a\u000aGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

aVObese women have a higher risk of breast cancer than their slimmer counterparts. Numerous studies have provided explanations for the discrepancy which include that after menopause fat tissue manufactures estrogen and the estrogen stimulates tumor growth. But obese women continue to have more aggressive tumors than thinner women, even after anti-estrogen treatment.\u000a\u000aWhy does this happen, experts ask, when estrogen has been removed?\u000a\u000aResearchers at the University of Colorado Cancer Center have discovered a possible explanation: In an animal model of obesity and breast cancer (affectionately referred to as the "fat rat"), tumor cells in obese animals, but not lean animals, had especially sensitive androgen receptors.\u000a\u000aAndrogen is a hormone mainly associated with males, and androgen receptors, along with their hormone partner, testosterone, have long been known as drivers of prostate cancer. But the researchers found that the androgen receptor cells magnified growth signals from the hormone testosterone in obese female rats with breast cancer as well.\u000a\u000aSimilar to the way in which many breast cancers drive their growth with estrogen receptors, these tumors in obese rats drove their growth with androgen receptors.\u000a\u000a"Because fat cells in these rats don't make estrogen, they are like human breast cancer patients treated to remove estrogen," said Elizabeth Wellberg, Ph.D. "This allowed us to ask what is responsible for obesity-associated tumor progression in conditions of low estrogen availability," she said.\u000a\u000aPreviously, the Colorado researchers had shown that levels of a component of inflammation known as interleukin 6 (IL-6), were higher in obese rats compared to lean rats. In the current paper, the group shows that administering IL-6 to breast cancer cells amplifies the activity of androgen receptors and drives breast cancer even when estrogen levels are low. When researchers treated their obese rats with the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide, existing tumors shrank and new tumors failed to form.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the journal Hormones & Cancer.\u000a\u000aAccording to the Susan G. Komen foundation, women who are obese have up to an overall 60 percent higher risk of breast cancer than women who are slim. Postmenopausal women who are obese increase their risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 70 percent.\u000a\u000aAbout 12 percent of American women will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. In 2016, 246,660 new cases of invasive cancer are projected to be diagnosed, along with 61,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer. Over 40,000 American women die from the disease each year.

aVU.S. job openings jumped to a record high in June, outpacing hiring, the latest indication that companies are having trouble finding qualified workers.\u000a\u000aThe monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday also underscored labor market strength that will likely encourage the Federal Reserve to continue tightening monetary policy despite benign inflation and concerns about consumer spending.\u000a\u000a"Companies are running out of workers to hire to do the job or even train to do the work, and this is a ticking time bomb for economic growth," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. "Today's JOLTS data bring a September meeting balance sheet unwind announcement a little closer to reality."\u000a\u000aJOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's so-called dashboard. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will announce a plan to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its next policy meeting in September.\u000a\u000aTame inflation and worries about consumer spending amid tepid wage growth and faltering motor vehicle sales, however, suggest the Fed will delay raising interest rates again until December. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year.\u000a\u000aJob openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 461,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million. That was the highest level since the data series started in December 2000 and pushed the job openings rate up two-tenths of a percentage point to a near one-year high of 4.0 percent.\u000a\u000aThe monthly increase in job openings was the largest since July 2015. The surge in job openings was almost broad-based.\u000a\u000aThere were 179,000 additional vacancies in the professional and business services industries. The health care and social assistance sector had 125,000 more job openings and construction companies had an additional 62,000 unfilled positions. In June, job openings were concentrated in the Midwest and West regions.\u000a\u000aSKILLS MISMATCH\u000a\u000aThe ratio of job openings to unemployment hit a 16-year high. Hiring was little changed at 5.4 million in June, leaving the hiring rate steady at 3.7 percent.\u000a\u000aThe gap between job openings and hiring points to a skills mismatch, which was also corroborated by a separate report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business.\u000a\u000aThe NFIB survey showed job openings at a 16-year high in July. Small businesses cited a lack of skills as the main reason for the vacancies. Others also blamed "unreasonable" wage expectations, attitude, appearance as well as drug addiction for disqualification of job seekers.\u000a\u000aEconomists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will spur faster wage growth. Annual wage growth has struggled to break above 2.5 percent, contributing to inflation persistently running below the Fed's 2 percent target.\u000a\u000a"The JOLTS report continues what has been a reasonably strong run for the labor market data, and we expect continued improvement in the job market to keep upward pressure on wages," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\u000a\u000aOther details of the JOLTS report were mixed. About 3.1 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in June, down from 3.2 million in May. As a result, the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, dipped to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in May.\u000a\u000aLayoffs rose 28,000 to 1.7 million in June, lifting the layoffs rate one-tenth of a percentage point to 1.2 percent.\u000a\u000a"Layoff rates are historically low.

aVChina's exports and imports grew much less than expected in July, raising concerns over whether global demand is starting to cool even as major Western central banks consider scaling back years of massive stimulus support.\u000a\u000aChina and Europe have been driving an increasing share of global growth this year as political conflict stymies stimulus policies being pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aBut while China's overall trade continued to grow at a healthy clip in July, at 8.8 percent it was the slowest rate this year.\u000a\u000aSome analysts chalked up the softer readings to seasonal or one-off factors, but others said weaker import growth could be the first tangible sign of a long-expected slowdown in the world's second-largest economy after a surprisingly strong first half.\u000a\u000a"External demand is not really worrying in terms of the outlook," said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ in Hong Kong.\u000a\u000a"But we have to be cautious about the import outlook," said Yeung, while noting that bad weather may have been a factor.\u000a\u000aChina's export growth slowed to 7.2 percent in July from a year earlier, the weakest pace since February and cooling from an 11.3 percent rise in June, official data showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a 10.9 percent gain.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, neighboring South Korea saw its export growth accelerate in July while Taiwan's held roughly steady.\u000a\u000aChina's imports rose 11.0 percent, the slowest growth since December and down from a 17.2 percent rise in the previous month. That also missed expectations of 16.6 percent growth.\u000a\u000aThat left the country with a trade surplus of $46.74 billion for the month, the highest since January, compared with forecasts for $46.08 billion and June's $42.77 billion. The July trade figures are preliminary.\u000a\u000aThe disappointing China data came a day after ratings agency Fitch upgraded its outlook for the world economy for this year and next, citing recoveries in China and other emerging markets.\u000a\u000a"Despite an uptick at the end of the second quarter, (China's) trade growth now appears to be on a downward trend. In particular, the sharp decline in import growth since the start of the year suggests that domestic demand is softening," Capital Economics said in a note.\u000a\u000aImproving global demand, particularly for electronics, has boosted exports for China and other trade-reliant Asian economies in recent months after several lean years of declining shipments.\u000a\u000aBut investors have been more focused on its strong appetite for imports, particularly industrial commodities such as iron ore and coal, which have sparked a global price rally and fueled higher earnings and share prices for many resource-related companies.\u000a\u000aChina's iron ore imports in July fell from 2.4 percent from a year earlier as a recent buying spree eased, even though higher steel prices and a year-long construction boom have spurred mills in the world's biggest steel producer to ramp up output.\u000a\u000aDespite a sharp rebound in the value of the yuan versus the dollar in recent months -- the yuan has gained 3.5 percent so far this year -- analysts downplayed its impact on trade flows.\u000a\u000aIn yuan terms, growth in exports and imports also downshifted markedly, to 11.2 and 14.7 percent, respectively.\u000a\u000aTRADE FRICTIONS\u000a\u000aTuesday's data also showed China's exports to the United States rose 8.5 percent in July on-year, the slowest pace since February, while imports from the U.S. rose 24.2 percent.\u000a\u000aBut that is unlikely to ease trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Korea's missile program.\u000a\u000aChina reported a trade surplus with the U.S. of $25.2 billion for July, down only slightly from June, which was a near two-year high.\u000a\u000aFor the first seven months of the year, China's trade surplus with the U.S., its largest export market, rose 5.9 percent to $142.75 billion, even as China's overall trade surplus has fallen.\u000a\u000aChina may have more at stake than past years if relations with Washington sharply deteriorate.\u000a\u000aIts surplus with the U.S. accounted for 61.5 percent of China's total trade surplus in the first seven months of the year, compared to just 44 percent in the year-ago period.\u000a\u000aThe United State and China failed last month to agree on major new steps to reduce the U.S. trade gap.\u000a\u000aTrump had been expected to unveil new measures last week, as Washington prepares to launch an inquiry into Beijing's intellectual property and trade practices. But an announcement on Friday was postponed.\u000a\u000aThe White House said on Saturday that Trump appreciated China's cooperation on new sanctions against North Korea that were passed over the weekend.

aVBerkshire Hathaway Inc. shares have done nothing but rise so far this month. It may be time for a breather.\u000a\u000aWarren Buffett's ever-expanding conglomerate reported second-quarter results last week that again missed the mark. An insurance underwriting loss overshadowed the resurgence at BNSF railroad, as well as continued profit growth in its energy division and the segment that houses a hodgepodge of manufacturing, service and retail businesses.\u000a\u000aOperating earnings totaled $2,505 a share, missing analysts' average estimate by 10 percent and even falling short of the lowest forecast provided to Bloomberg.\u000a\u000aBerkshire's class A shares ended Friday at $270,000 apiece before the results were released. They climbed for 10 consecutive days and appeared well on their way to a record winning streak -- the longest being 13 days in April 1989, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that dates back 30 years. The class B shares were already on a record 15-day run.\u000a\u000aInvestors will continue to focus on big M&A, as Berkshire's cash has now risen to nearly $100 billion. Excluding what's needed to fund recently announced deals and the cushion Buffett likes to maintain, Morningstar Inc. analyst Gregory Warren figures there's more than $60 billion of excess cash available for acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and dare we say, a dividend.\u000a\u000aIs Buffett's phone ringing yet? He had expressed frustration at the annual shareholder meeting about not hearing from many willing sellers. Since then, he was said to have been approached by Masayoshi Son, who is desperately seeking a partner for Sprint Corp., the $35 billion struggling wireless carrier. But I explained here why I don't think those talks will amount to anything.\u000a\u000aQuestion For Buffett: What's The Deal?\u000a\u000aSo far, Berkshire's biggest purchase this year has come out of its energy division, which is buy the parent of Oncor Electric Delivery Co., the largest electric-transmission operator in Texas, for $9 billion. Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp. is trying to intercept the transaction, but even if Berkshire succeeds, the deal won't put much of a dent in its cash. Berkshire's operations generated more than $8 billion of cash in the past three months alone.\u000a\u000aThe Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 22,000 last week and the S&P 500 index is also near a high, so potential takeover candidates aren't get any cheaper for Buffett. Despite these rich valuations, competition for acquisitions is fierce right now as most large U.S. corporations confront a growth challenge that they're finding can most easily be met via dealmaking. That said, I did compile this list of companies that meet Buffett's takeover criteria, some being more realistic options than others.\u000a\u000aWhile Berkshire's equity investments -- such as Apple Inc., Kraft Heinz and the airlines -- are helping book value continue to climb, the latest mixed bag of operational results felt like they deserved some kind of commentary from Buffett. That's not something he does; remarks are usually saved for his once-a-year letter and investor gathering and the occasional TV appearance. But just dropping a filing without any update on the elephant in the room (the cash issue) feels increasingly awkward.\u000a\u000aAs I've said before, this lack of transparency relative to most other public companies is a luxury exclusive to Buffett. His successor will have to answer to investors when one large division drags down profit and cash piles up without high-return deployment opportunities.\u000a\u000aBerkshire's stock has been on a tear, but to keep the momentum Buffett needs to work his deal magic.\u000a\u000aThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\u000a\u000aTara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering deals.

aVAmerica's need for China to back tougher sanctions against North Korea ended up killing the U.S. effort to strike back at China over intellectual property violations, Asia expert Gordon Chang tells Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration had been looking at enforcing Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, but needed China to support a U.N. Security Council resolution against China's ally, North Korea. The effort appears to have worked, with the sanctions passing the Security Council on Saturday 15-0.\u000a\u000aNow, the effort to punish China for its "predatory, intellectual property rules" is "probably dead for a long time," Chang told "Newsmax Now" host Bill Tucker on Monday.\u000a\u000a"It affects so many U.S. companies," Chang said. "It goes to the heart of U.S. economic strength and we really need to do this."\u000a\u000aThe United States refuses to get firm, he added, because we are "sort of afraid of China."\u000a\u000aAmerica has always wanted to integrate China into the international system so it has placed a much higher priority on that than disarming North Korea, he said.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump doesn't want to cave in to China, but, like previous administrations, still does at critical times, Chang said.\u000a\u000a"Across the board we have deferred acting on trade, which is I think so important to American workers," he said. "The president was elected to help American workers, help American businesses. \u2026 Right now American workers have been used as bargaining chips, they've been traded away, and the president has got to do something because after 200 days, and today is the 200th day of his presidency, there's been very little done on Chinese predatory trade practices."\u000a\u000aAs for North Korea's threats of "thousands-fold" retribution against the United States for the increased sanctions, Chang said the bigger threat is Pyongyang's ability within a year to hit virtually the entire U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile.\u000a\u000a"It may not be a great weapon, it might have a guidance system which means they're a couple miles off, but nonetheless it doesn't really matter when you aim a weapon toward a city like New York," he said. "So clearly this is a time frame for us. If we don't think we can deter the North Koreans, and that's a very important issue, but if we don't think that we can deter the North Koreans, we're going to use force."

aVGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 New Israeli restrictions on Palestinians exiting the blockaded Gaza Strip, including a ban on laptop computers, hard-shell suitcases and even shampoo and toothpaste, have further disrupted travel for the lucky few who are allowed to cross the border into Israel.\u000a\u000aIsrael is citing unspecified security concerns as the reason for forcing engineers, journalists, business people and human rights workers to leave their electronic work tools behind. For those affected, the restrictions are unfair, inexplicable and mean new headaches in the struggles of daily life in Gaza.\u000a\u000a"My work laptop that has all my work files that I can't take back with me is a big problem for me," said Ahmed Abu Shahla, an employee of an intellectual property firm in the United Arab Emirates who was returning to the Gulf after visiting relatives in Gaza.\u000a\u000aAs he boarded a bus at the border, he was forced to leave his laptop behind. He said he didn't bother to put his projects on flash drives because he feared they would be confiscated.\u000a\u000a"My loss is high because you have to move all the data by email or any other means which is almost impossible," he said. "This affects you in all directions, professionally, unfortunately."\u000a\u000aThe ban, which took effect on Aug. 1, applies to all Palestinians who want to travel to Israel, or through Israel to the West Bank and neighboring Jordan. With Israel and Egypt maintaining a tight blockade on Hamas-ruled Gaza, the Erez crossing is virtually the only way out of the territory.\u000a\u000aIsrael and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas won parliamentary elections in 2006 and routed forces loyal to the internationally recognized government of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas the following year. Israel, the U.S. and much of the West consider Hamas a terrorist group, and Israel says the blockade is needed to isolate Hamas and prevent it from smuggling in weapons.\u000a\u000aThe Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border has traditionally been Gaza's main gateway to the outside world. But Egypt keeps the crossing closed for months at a time. The last time it opened for travelers was in March, and tens of thousands of people are on wait lists to travel once Egypt opens the crossing.\u000a\u000aThe Egyptian closure has made Israel's Erez crossing vital to Gazans who need to travel abroad for business, medical care, studies or to see relatives.\u000a\u000aYet Israel, accusing Hamas of trying to exploit travelers to carry money or information to its agents abroad, has imposed a series of restrictions in recent years that has limited the flow of people across the border.\u000a\u000aIsrael allows only small numbers of people in special categories, such as students, aid workers and medical patients, to cross through the border, and all travelers go through a heavily fortified terminal where they pass through scanners, can have their luggage opened and are subject to strip searches. In recent years, Israel also has called in hundreds of people for day-long "interviews" with security agents before granting them travel permits.\u000a\u000aThe restrictions mean that the vast majority of Gaza's 2 million residents remain trapped in the impoverished territory. Small numbers of merchants and aid workers \u2014 the engines of what remains of Gaza's economy \u2014 along with medical patients and other humanitarian cases are the people who usually use the Erez crossing.\u000a\u000aThe new Israeli guidelines, outlined in an email obtained by The Associated Press, set out strict restrictions on electronics, baggage and personal items.\u000a\u000aFor Palestinian merchants, aid workers or travelers headed to Jordan, "personal mobile phones only, no food stuff or toiletries allowed," says the email. Food is also banned, except for medical patients that can take food for "personal consumption."\u000a\u000aThe email was sent on July 19 to international aid organizations that operate in Gaza and was signed by an officer with COGAT, an Israeli defense body that enforces policies toward Palestinian civilians. An updated email next day showed that these procedures are applicable on people exiting Gaza, not entering it.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, a Palestinian reporter for the AP was barred from bringing his laptop into Gaza. He was told that he would not be allowed to take it out of Gaza once he enters.\u000a\u000aForeigners were exempted from the restrictions.\u000a\u000aCOGAT said the new rules were ordered by Israel's Shin Bet internal security service. In a short statement, the Shin Bet said travel regulations through Erez were updated recently and that exceptional cases can be tested "case by case." The agency provided no reason for the ban.\u000a\u000aShai Grunberg, a spokeswoman for Gisha, an Israeli advocacy group pushing for Palestinian freedom of movement, said there was no clear explanation for the change in policy.\u000a\u000a"Security checks are conducted, understandably, in transit stations around the world. This new directive is punitive, damaging, and must be stopped immediately," she said. About 6,500 Gazans pass through Erez each month, about half the year-earlier level, according to Gisha.\u000a\u000aThe measures have caused an outcry among Palestinian too.\u000a\u000a"These restrictions are aimed at harassing people and we reject them because Israel already has the best checking and security screening technology," said Walid Wahdan, spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Affairs Ministry, which carries out civilian coordination with Israel. "These suitcases are used in all airports and terminals. Why they are banned here?" he said.\u000a\u000aEach week, Israel allows a bus load of Gazans to ride a shuttle to the West Bank border with Jordan. After receiving permission from Jordan, thousands of people apply to catch a ride on the 50-passenger bus.\u000a\u000aOn a recent morning, a group of travelers lined up at 7 a.m. outside the Gaza branch of the civil ministry to catch the bus, most of them carrying gym or sport bags.\u000a\u000aA young woman had an iPad, but a Palestinian official accompanying the bus told her that she can't travel with it and that they are not responsible if the Israelis confiscate it. Neither of them agreed to be interviewed.

aVIf you\u2019ve tried everything to lose weight by counting calories, joining a gym, or and even fasting for days with no success, then you may be the victim of secret weight-loss saboteurs. These stealthy roadblocks are more common than you think and may be hampering your best intentions.\u000a\u000aFor folks over 50, part of the problem may be a slower metabolism or shifting hormones, but there are other culprits that can be causing your weighty stalemate.\u000a\u000aMaybe it\u2019s your meds. Almost half the American population took at least one prescription medicine in the past month and a side effect of many of these medicines is significant weight gain.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnti-depressants are well known in the medical literature to cause weight gain,\u201d Dr. Aaron Tabor, a noted weight loss expert and founder of Health Directions tells Newsmax Health. \u201cIt may also be a combination of the anti-depressants decreasing metabolism and physical activity, both leading to weight gain.\u201d\u000a\u000aAntihistamines are another popular class of drugs that targets a receptor that\u2019s involved with both allergies and appetite. So suppressing that receptor\u2019s activity can make you hungrier. Beta Blockers, diabetes medication, corticosteroids, and antipsychotic drugs can also cause weight gain.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t quit your medications before you talk to your doctor and ask for possible options,\u201d says Tabor.\u000a\u000aLack of sleep. It isn\u2019t a coincidence that, according to the centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one-third of Americans get less than six hours shut-eye a night and about the same percentage are obese.\u000a\u000aIn a recent study of older adults, getting only five hours of sleep instead of the recommended seven to eight tripled obesity risks in men and doubled them in women.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe more sleep deprived you are, the more you increase the hormone cortisol which increases your appetite,\u201d says Tabor. Establish a healthy sleep routine and aim for seven to eight hours nightly. Set a schedule in which you go to bed and get up at the same time every day\u2014including weekends. This helps regulate the sleep-wake cycles and other body rhythms, including your appetite.\u000a\u000aIt could be your gut. Bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can be helpful to break down food, absorb nutrients, regulate insulin sensitivity and produce fuel for cells. But new research reveals that gut bacteria may also play a role in regulating your weight.\u000a\u000aIn one study, germ-free mice got fatter when they received bacteria from obese mice but when the identical mice eating the same diet had their gut populated by bugs from lean mice, they stayed lean themselves.\u000a\u000aAvoid taking antibiotics unless absolutely necessary and eat foods that that nurture healthy microbes like yogurt and fiber rich foods like broccoli and whole grains. Try for a variety of foods, says Tabor, to ensure you are getting a wider selection of healthy bacteria.\u000a\u000aFeel the heat. Keeping your house too comfy cozy may sabotage your weight loss. When temperatures dip, the white fat in our cells turns to brown fat which burns more calories, say researchers at the University of Kentucky, Lexington.\u000a\u000aBy lowering your thermostat, you can boost your body\u2019s fat-burning metabolic activity. Experts recommend setting the temp to 68 degrees for maximum effect.\u000a\u000aViruses can be the villain. A certain strain of cold virus called the adenovirus 36 could be making you fat. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison discovered that 30 percent of obese people have been infected by this virus, but only 11 percent of thin people have it.\u000a\u000aDr. Richard Atkinson, emeritus professor at the university speculates that catching the virus can boost weight gain by 12-15 percent. It appears to flood cells with glucose while turning on an enzyme that converts sugar to fat.\u000a\u000aAvoid catching the virus the same way you protect yourself against any other virus by washing your hands frequently, avoiding g touching your nose or face when coming into contact with a sick person, boosting your immune system and getting enough rest.\u000a\u000aDistracted eating. Just like distracted driving can be a killer, distracted eating can destroy your weight loss goals. Laura Cipullo, a well-known nutrition expert and author of \u201cEveryday Diabetes, Meals for 1 or 2,\u201d tells Newsmax Health that eating meals while working on mobile devices or watching television can sabotage your diet by inhibiting your ability to truly taste and enjoy our meal.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis can easily lead to overeating and weight gain,\u201d she says. \u201cEating in a mindful manner will allow you to consume the appropriate amount of calories and obtain the proper nutrients your need.\u201d\u000a\u000aJunk food. \u201cWe have a lot of research linking junk food to weight gain,\u201d Dr. Cate Shanahan, author of \u201cDeep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food,\u201d tells Newsmax Health.\u000a\u000a\u201cA major factor in the obesity epidemic is that we\u2019ve found certain foods, such as highly processed foods, make us lose our desire to move. The proper term is Non Exercise Physical Activity or NEPA.\u201d\u000a\u000aShanahan says that highly processed oils such as soy, corn and canola which were not part of the human food chain until the industrial era now constitute 25-45 % of the average Americans\u2019 daily calories.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not clear as to why these processed foods lead to this effect, but one thing we do know is that they interact directly with a part of the brain responsible for motivation, called the mesolimbic pathway. That means the processed ingredients in junk foods may be reducing our desire to do anything from washing floors to finishing our homework to packing our gym bag.\u201d\u000a\u000aEating wholesome foods can trigger the mesolimbic reward circuit and get us moving once again.\u201d

aVSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sequentially played the role of superhero, villainous traitor (to Republicans), and savior (to Obamacare) as the Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., "skinny repeal" lost by one vote \u2014 his.\u000a\u000aFirst, he dropped in for the crucial vote on bringing the issue to the Senate floor, to a thunderous standing ovation, days after brain surgery (not "eye surgery," as it was repeatedly billed by the press covering "healthcare"matters).\u000a\u000aThis is not his first such performance. He interrupted his 2008 presidential campaign to vote for TARP, the financial system bailout.\u000a\u000aOnce repeal itself was up for a vote, Sen. McCain ostentatiously cast the decisive "nay," in a stunning violation of the vehement promises made during his senatorial campaign.\u000a\u000aSomebody had to do it, since a lot of the Republicans really didn\u2019t want to kill a cash cow for their state or donors. McCain is at the start of his term and has less to lose.\u000a\u000aThen he made a speech that former Sen. Joe Lieberman said was "one of his finest hours." Sen. McCain called for a "return to the bipartisan cooperation that can lead to real legislative accomplishments."\u000a\u000aBipartisan is not the same thing as wise or good, and bipartisan mistakes are even harder to get rid of. But why the stark party-line divide here? Why did no Democrats offer any suggestions? Are they interested in helping their constituents, or just in obstructing Republicans? Do they believe the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Barack Obama\u2019s precious legacy, is functioning perfectly?\u000a\u000aHardly. Everybody seems to agree that the insurance market needs stabilizing. That means it needs more taxpayer dollars to bail it out. And if there aren\u2019t enough votes to appropriate the money for cost-sharing subsidies properly, ACA partisans want the illegal funding begun by Obama and being paid month-to-month by Trump to continue.\u000a\u000aThe lawsuit against this brought by the U.S. House of Representatives is sitting in the D.C. Court of Appeals, which just agreed to allow 18 attorneys general (17 states plus D.C.) to intervene on the side of lawlessness.\u000a\u000aAnd, why do insurers need the money? It\u2019s because ACA allows them to offer only unaffordable, money-losing products. Premiums must escalate to the point that nobody can pay them without huge taxpayer subsidies. So why no bipartisan amendments to ACA\u2019s price controls and larded-up "essential" benefits?\u000a\u000aWhy not an amendment to legalize a genuine market for real insurance? The Democrats ought to have to explain why they object to actuarially fair premiums for low-risk persons, or why they insist on adding third-party overhead to routine costs that should be paid out of pocket. If the object is to help a few people with known high costs ("pre-existings"), why do they have to wreck the insurance market for the 95 percent who could get a policy they liked?\u000a\u000aWhy don\u2019t any Democrats speak up for repealing mandates? Why do they insist on punishing people for not buying an overpriced product they don\u2019t want? Do politicians really believe that coverage is the same as care?\u000a\u000aAnd, do they swallow the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) fictions:\u000a\u000a1. That the individual mandate has worked.\u000a\u000a2. That choosing not to buy something is the same as "losing" it? Are they all that lacking in understanding and judgment, or is it all partisan politics?\u000a\u000aOr, do they understand perfectly well that ACA is a wealth transfer mechanism from those who receive or provide brain surgery or other actual care to Congress\u2019s real constituents, the money-changers?\u000a\u000aConsider, for example, the really big cash sinkhole \u2014 Medicaid. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t bother to enroll in Medicaid, even though it is free, if they didn\u2019t have to pay to avoid it (the individual mandate). Then the states and managed-care contractors would lose the constant flow of federal dollars for patients who are not getting care.\u000a\u000aAnd what about the neediest patients, say an American Charlie Gard? Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover experimental treatments. Would Charlie\u2019s parents be allowed to raise money and pay privately?\u000a\u000aThe question of whether Medicaid recipients are restricted to care available within the system comes up frequently. In Sen. McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona, we are trying to get a clear answer.\u000a\u000aWhy do we need to ask the question? Because when government pays, your medical care is a partisan political issue.\u000a\u000aJane M. Orient, M.D. is executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.

Representing the United States at the dinner was Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs.\u000a\u000aBefore Tillerson's trip, the U.S. had said he had no plans to interact with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, who was spotted at the gala smiling and toasting with the other foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aTensions have risen the past several months as North Korea has conducted nuclear weapons testing, and concerns heightened with two successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles which experts say could possibly reach the United States. North Korea is in violation of international law and of U.N. Security Council resolutions by conducting the tests.\u000a\u000aThough the U.S. is interested in negotiating with North Korea, Tillerson said this week such talks would have to be predicated on the North giving up its nuclear weapons aspirations and that the conditions for such talks haven't yet been met by North Korea's government.

aVReports that North Korea has developed miniaturized nuclear weapons that can be fitted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile means the United States will have to accept the fact that it will need to it will have to move into a period of "mutual deterrance," retired NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"We're going to have to accept the fact that if their capability stands, that in the event of war on the Korean peninsula, the United States homeland is not safe, and therefore this makes deterrence more complicated," Clark said during a panel discussion on MSNBC's "Craig Melvin" show.\u000a\u000aDeterrence can work, as it did during the Cold War, Clark continued, but he compared protecting South Korea to protecting Hamburg, Germany against the Soviet Union, if the then-USSR had decided to use nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000a"If we defended against the Soviet attack in Germany, and they used nuclear weapons, then it would bring the conflict to the United States," he explained. "That is the same question that is going to have to be asked and answered in terms of protecting the government and the people of South Korea now."\u000a\u000aClark said he would suggest to President Donald Trump to open talks with North Korea, and they have to be held "without the precondition that has been put on them that [they] have to give up their nuclear programs."\u000a\u000aThat is "not realistic," Clark said. "That is their guarantee of survival. The North Korean regime has to understand, 'okay, so you have a nuclear weapon with a missile. Now behave yourself and be a normal country, and stop threatening people and you don't have to worry about the United States threatening you.'"\u000a\u000aThat may lead to a series of agreements so that northeast Asia can be stabilized while keeping U.S. determent in place in Japan and South Korea, Clark said.\u000a\u000aHowever, the United States must understand that it is in the best interests of China and Russia to push the United States out of South Korea and ultimately away from its relationship of Japan, said Clark.\u000a\u000aIf the United States does enter talks with North Korea, that would not necessarily discourage other countries from also arming themselves with nuclear weapons, Clark conceded.\u000a\u000a"The point is, starting in 2002, once we declared an Axis of Evil, President [George W.] Bush said we can't let the worst countries have the worst weapons," said Clark. "It was a challenge. We were focused on the Middle East, but North Korea already had a head start in the nuclear weapons program. They took up the challenge and now they have the weapon. So the situation is different. We have to do what is best for the American people and our allies."\u000a\u000aIt would be better if a "rogue nation" like North Korea didn't have such weapons, he continued, but it does, so the United States must "recognize that and deal with it."\u000a\u000a"Yes, we could try to prevent other countries from getting nuclear weapons," said Clark. "But North Korea has nuclear weapons."\u000a\u000aClark said a military strike against North Korea would have to target a number of facilities, and it is not known where the warhead are.\u000a\u000a"You have to target all of those," the retired general said. "You have to assume that some you haven't found. You launch a surprise strike by Special Forces, maybe you have to take out some of their defense to in there. It has to be as effective as possible."\u000a\u000aHowever, Clark said military experts would determine there would be possibly a 70 percent or 80 percent chance of getting the warheads, and they won't all be destroyed.\u000a\u000a"You've got to be prepared for the North Korean reaction," said Clark. "The North Korean reaction could be to step back stunned that the United States has done this. But this would be uncharacteristic of North Korea's previous propensity to take aggressive action. So it's more likely that they would then respond with artillery and missiles across the demilitarized zone. That is the most likely option other than a general war on the Korean peninsula."\u000a\u000aClark said he does not think economic sanctions have been effective, and China has several interests in play.\u000a\u000a"The tighter the sanctions, the greater the likelihood of some collapse that would unleash millions of North Koreans into China," said Clark. "They don't want the collapse of the regime which would lead to a South Korean and U.S. expansion of our domain and move us closer to China's border. And so they don't like that option. And they don't want warfare, but they would like the United States to leave the Korean peninsula. So they are like a guy with a skeleton key jiggling the key in the lock trying to make the lock turn."

aVResistance training may help slow progression of multiple sclerosis, a small study suggests.\u000a\u000a"Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal," said study researcher Ulrik Dalgas. "Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimizes brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication."\u000a\u000aMoreover, "we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training," said Dalgas, an associate professor of public health at Aarhus University in Denmark.\u000a\u000aMS is a potentially disabling disease of the central nervous system. It occurs when the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, disrupting communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Symptoms vary in severity, but some patients lose the ability to walk.\u000a\u000aFor this study, the researchers followed 35 patients for six months. Half of them did resistance training twice a week, while the other half (the control group) did no formal exercise.\u000a\u000aResistance training -- formerly called weight training -- simply means using your muscles against an opposing force.\u000a\u000aMRI scans before and after the six months showed that the patients who did resistance training had less brain shrinkage than those in the control group, according to the study.\u000a\u000aThe results appear in the Aug. 1 Multiple Sclerosis Journal.\u000a\u000aBut the study only found an association between this type of training and protection of the nervous system, not a cause-and-effect relationship. Further research is needed to explore this potential benefit, the study authors said.\u000a\u000aWhile exercise may offer another treatment option for patients, it can't replace medications, Dalgas emphasized.\u000a\u000a"On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed. This aspect needs to be thoroughly explored," he said in a university news release.\u000a\u000aPreviously, MS patients were advised not to exercise for fear that doing so would worsen the disease. However, it's now understood that exercise can ease many symptoms, including extreme fatigue and mobility problems, the researchers said.\u000a\u000aStill, the researchers suggest talking with your doctor before beginning an intensive physical training regimen.

Like Howard Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Group LLC, who last month warned that markets had crossed into \u201ctoo-bullish territory,\u201d Gundlach says it\u2019s better to be cautious now than to hold on until it\u2019s too late.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for the catalyst to show itself, you\u2019re going to be selling at a lower price," he said in a phone interview Monday from DoubleLine\u2019s office in Los Angeles. \u201cThis is not the time period where you say, \u2018I can buy anything and not worry about the risk of it.\u2019 The time to do that was 18 months ago.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Turning Money Away\u2019\u000a\u000aGundlach is taking a similarly conservative approach to building his eight-year-old firm. While some competitors embrace the mantra \u201csize matters,\u201d he believes there\u2019s a limit to how much DoubleLine can manage well and says the firm may stop marketing altogether once assets reach $150 billion, up from about $110 billion today.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve actually been turning money away in our institutional business,\u201d Gundlach said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to manage $500 billion. I don\u2019t really want to manage $200 billion.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat attitude is out of step with an industry that prioritizes asset growth, both as a means to generate more revenue and as a way to defray fixed expenses such as technology and compliance. Janus Capital Group and Aberdeen Asset Management Plc each combined with other firms in part to gain scale. Vanguard Group has more than quadrupled its assets to $4.4 trillion in less than a decade, and in an interview in March, Larry Fink, whose BlackRock Inc. oversees $5.7 trillion, said \u201cscale has become a greater necessity -- and for us a greater advantage.\u201d\u000a\u000aBill Gross once managed a single fund with $293 billion in assets, the Pimco Total Return Fund. By comparison, Gundlach, who co-founded DoubleLine in 2009, said he\u2019s debated whether to close the $54 billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund, the firm\u2019s largest, to new money.\u000a\u000aInvesting Style\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t do $100 billion in the Total Return Bond Fund,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market isn\u2019t big enough for our style, the things we invest in.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat fund has invested largely in mortgage-backed securities and returned 3.5 percent annually for the past five years, outperforming 92 percent of its peers as measured by Bloomberg. In 2016 it trailed the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate bond index for the first time, a lag Gundlach said was mostly because the fund doesn\u2019t invest in corporate debt.\u000a\u000aHe also said a decline in the Total Return Bond Fund\u2019s assets from $62 billion last September, traditionally seen as a warning sign, reflects a decision to concentrate less on a single product. While other firms discounted fees to lure more investors, DoubleLine sought instead to attract assets to its other funds, including the Core Fixed Income and Shiller Enhanced CAPE, both co-managed by the firm\u2019s deputy chief investment officer, Jeffrey Sherman.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want one $150 billion fund, I want 10 $15 billion funds. A diversified business,\u201d Gundlach said in the interview. \u201cWe lose business because our fees are too high and I say, \u2018Fine, that\u2019s a way of regulating growth.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aDoubleLine has adapted the \u201csmart beta\u201d programmatic approach to investing in stocks, first used in the Shiller CAPE fund, to a similar product for European markets, and Gundlach said the next step may be a global stock fund.\u000a\u000aDoubleLine\u2019s funds have consistently outperformed their peers. That\u2019s what appeals to investors even if its fees aren\u2019t the industry\u2019s lowest, according to Todd Rosenbluth, fund research director at CFRA, a New York-based investment research firm. An example is the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, which has continued to attract assets and has a $3.4 billion market cap.\u000a\u000aDoubleLine Driven\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople were driven to buy a Gundlach-driven portfolio -- DoubleLine-driven, not just him,\u201d Rosenbluth said. \u201cAs long as the firm follows the same approach and delivers the same return, I think investors are going to be very pleased.\u201d\u000a\u000aGundlach started DoubleLine after a dispute with management at TCW Group led to his ouster and prompted a legal battle. Oaktree took a 20 percent stake. When DoubleLine\u2019s Total Return Bond Fund hit $50 billion in 2015, many speculated Gundlach had ambitions to build a giant firm.\u000a\u000aInstead, his goal is to keep DoubleLine small enough that it can continue buying a range of assets at good prices and outperform its benchmark indexes and peer funds. Anything larger would require a corporate infrastructure at a "totally different level" and many more employees than the more than 200 DoubleLine has now, Gundlach said.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo get to $300 billion, I think you need a thousand people," he said. "You need offices in Beijing and Mumbai and London, because you really have to go big on sovereign wealth funds and a lot of wholesalers in the retail industry. And it just becomes a very big company, and I don\u2019t want that."\u000a\u000aTokyo Office\u000a\u000aCurrently, DoubleLine has only two corporate offices, its headquarters in Los Angeles and an outpost in Tokyo, where the firm oversees about $1 billion in assets. Gundlach said his strategy has Oaktree\u2019s full support.\u000a\u000aThe challenge right now is figuring out how quickly to dump lower-quality but higher-yielding assets in favor of safer securities that return less. In the meantime, Gundlach said he recently bought five-and eight-month put options on the S&P 500, positions that could generate returns of 400 percent if the index drops by enough.\u000a\u000a"Volatility is about to go up," he said. "That\u2019s my highest-conviction trade right now."\u000a\u000aGundlach took such concerns to Twitter last week, cautioning his some 32,000 followers that bond investors were buying into \u201criskier and riskier" strategies. More recently he\u2019s been tweeting about a potential news story \u2014 a \u201cfake news ruse" \u2014 he expects will be critical of DoubleLine and which he believes is being motivated by a competitor. He declined to identify the rival firm in the interview.\u000a\u000aThe complacency in markets is understandable. Gundlach acknowledges that there are no obvious signs of a recession within six months, the only thing he says would bring about a major correction in asset prices. Everything from consumer confidence to employment to gauges of manufacturing health are strong.\u000a\u000aHe expects the Federal Reserve to raise rates again in December and in successive quarters so long as the data are supportive. He doesn\u2019t see the unwinding of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet as a threat because Chair Janet Yellen and others have communicated their plans \u201cextremely well.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlso, while optimism for tax reform and infrastructure spending have faded, Gundlach said it\u2019s not clear when doubts about the Trump presidency will start to weigh heavily on investors.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t see the big drop, unless there\u2019s something out of left field, like some sort of really escalating conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re supposed to be gradualistically moving toward the exits.\u201d

aVPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed The New York Times and The Washington Post after published emails showed their reluctance to report the meeting last year between former President Bill Clinton and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport.\u000a\u000aHere's Trump's tweet:\u000a\u000aE-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2017\u000a\u000aThe American Center for Law and Justice, the Washington-based watchdog group, published the emails Friday after obtaining them through a Freedom of Information Act request.\u000a\u000aClinton and Lynch met in June 2016 for about a half hour aboard the attorney general's private plane parked on the tarmac at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix.\u000a\u000aThe meeting occurred hours before the special House Benghazi Committee released its report on the 2012 Libyan attacks that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens and two former Navy SEALs.\u000a\u000a"Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned he played golf in Phoenix," Lynch said of the meeting at the time.\u000a\u000aClinton's wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, also was under investigation by the FBI for her private email server use as secretary of state.\u000a\u000aFBI Director James Comey later announced that he would not recommend charges against Clinton, though she was "extremely careless" in using the private account.\u000a\u000aIn the emails published via The Washington Examiner Friday, Post reporter Matt Zapotosky emailed the Justice Department about the meeting because he said his editors "are still pretty interested" in the story, but that he wanted to "put it to rest."\u000a\u000aA reporter for the Times, Mark Landler, wrote a Justice official saying that he had been "been pressed into service to write about the questions being raised" about the meeting.\u000a\u000aWhen the story first broke, the Times published no articles about the meeting for more than 24 hours, the Examiner noted.

aVEarly-term babies face health challenges that last long past birth. A new study by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) found that early-term babies \u2014 babies who were not premature but had been born during the early weeks of what is considered full term \u2014 had an increased risk of diabetes and other obesity-related diseases as well as a shortened lifespan when compared to those who were born a couple of weeks later.\u000a\u000a"Early-term" babies are defined as those delivered between 37 and 39 weeks. Although pregnancy is considered at full term when gestation lasts between 37 and 42 weeks, babies born between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation have better outcomes than those born either before or afterward.\u000a\u000aFor the study, researchers investigated hospitalizations of 225,073 children up to age 18 to determine the impact that early-term versus full-term gestation had on pediatric health and hospitalizations.\u000a\u000a"We found that hospitalizations up to the age of 18 involving endocrine and metabolic morbidity were found to be more common in the early-term group as compared with the full-term group, especially at ages five and older," says Eyal Sheiner, M.D., Ph.D. In addition, "Obesity was significantly more frequent among the early term."\u000a\u000aChildren older than five who were born early exhibited significantly higher rates of Type I diabetes than those who were full-term deliveries.\u000a\u000aCesareans were more common in early-term deliveries, and birthweights were significantly less, said Sheiner.\u000a\u000aThe researchers concluded that these diseases could increase the risk of other associated ills that have a long-term negative impact on health, including a shorter lifespan.\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\u000a\u000aThe Ben-Gurion study wasn't the first to show differences between early-term and full-term babies. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that early-term babies were at a disadvantage. "Even though we consider babies born at 37 or 38 weeks almost term, they are still, to a large extent, physiologically immature," said lead researcher Shaon Sengupta.\u000a\u000a"We were seeing a significant number of infants born at 37 weeks who looked big and pretty healthy, but who, within a few hours of birth were developing low blood sugar, difficulty in breathing or needed antibiotics, necessitating admission to the neonatal intensive care unit," said senior author Satyan Lakshminrusimha, M.D.\u000a\u000aResearchers also found that their learning ability was also affected years later. The reading scores of early-term babies were significantly lower than those of full-term babies, and math scores were also lower.\u000a\u000a"Although these early-term babies appeared to be mature, providing a false assurance to clinical providers and parents, and they did well on the Apgar scores, they are nevertheless physiologically immature," said Lakshminrusimha.

aVTesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk is selling his dream. Bond investors seem to be closing their eyes and buying it.\u000a\u000aMusk brought his charm offensive to the debt market at a meeting for bond buyers in Manhattan on Monday and came away with orders for $600 million after just a few hours, according to investors briefed on the matter. The session was part of a four-day debt-marketing extravaganza aimed at raising $1.5 billion to support the electric carmaker\u2019s new mass-market Model 3.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a well-oiled routine. Musk previously tapped his cult-like followers in the equity market for capital eight times in seven years to fund Tesla\u2019s growth. Apparently, his pitch works on debt investors, too: The company could wind up paying no more than 5 percent on the junk-rated bonds, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential.\u000a\u000aIn a world where some interest rates are still hovering near zero, that\u2019s enough to seal the deal, even for a company whose managers burned through a record $1.16 billion of cash in the second quarter.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for them, which by definition means it can\u2019t be a great deal for the investors,\u201d said Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors LLC. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re getting a good deal is because yields are near record lows and risk premiums are much less than they should be. Tesla is taking advantage of that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe campaign kicked off with a presentation at the New York Palace Hotel that had the billionaire personally answering investor questions while a gleaming blue Model 3 sat on display in the courtyard. Musk, 46, also invited his audience to a visit scheduled for later this week at the company\u2019s assembly plant in Fremont, California. Representatives for the company didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\u000a\u000aTo be fair, bond market investors for years have suspended reality and their basic training to buy into ever-riskier credits as interest rates shriveled. But Tesla has something else going for it: the halo effect, says Kevin Mathews, global head of high yield at Aviva Investors Americas.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe halo effect is real,\u201d said Mathews. \u201cWe saw that with Netflix. As a brand name, people know it, they know the situation from a financial standpoint, so when it came to market, people bought it.\u201d\u000a\u000aNetflix Inc. sold $1 billion of bonds with a 4.375 percent coupon in October. The bonds are now trading with a yield of about 4.2 percent, as investors continue to bet on the growth story and ignore the cash burn.\u000a\u000aMusk is asking his investors to do the same. The Model 3 is the linchpin of his plans to turn Tesla into more of a mass-market manufacturer. With a $35,000 starting price that\u2019s about half the base cost of the Model S, Musk\u2019s new smaller sedan has racked up almost half a million reservations. The carmaker plans to turn out a total of 500,000 vehicles in 2018 and a million in 2020.\u000a\u000aQuickTake: Why Electric Vehicles Are Coming But Not Yet Here\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s likely to boost the fortunes of shareholders and owners of debt that can be converted to stock, but there\u2019s no bonus for buyers of the new bonds; their reward is limited to the income from their coupon for eight years.\u000a\u000aAmong those containing their enthusiasm is Bruce Clark at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which rated Tesla\u2019s deal at B3 -- six steps deep in the bond market\u2019s junkyard. An onslaught of electric models from other carmakers is coming, Clark wrote, and besides, ramping up factory output to such high volumes is risky.\u000a\u000a\u201cGetting production levels up to where they want them and doing it in a glitch-free manner -- that is not easy,\u201d Clark said in an interview.

Once they pass committee, I think two hours of debate will be more than enough time.

aVBefore he was fired, Anthony Scaramucci had a mano a mano talk with President Donald Trump in which the commander in chief told his new communications director he was toast because of his profanity-laced rant in The New Yorker, Trump's former political adviser Sam Nunberg revealed to Newsmax TV.\u000a\u000aGen. John Kelly, in his first act as Trump's new White House chief of staff, canned Scaramucci \u2013 known by his nickname "The Mooch" \u2013 and had him escorted off the grounds of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\u000a\u000aBut, as Nunberg told Miranda Khan on Newsmax's "America Talks Live," Scaramucci already had an inkling the ax was dangling over his head because of a private meeting in which Trump bluntly \u2013 but apologetically \u2013 gave him the news.\u000a\u000a"It's my understanding that the president talked to Anthony about this," said Nunberg, an attorney. "He wasn't just summarily dismissed by John Kelly.\u000a\u000a"He went to go talk to the president. The president basically said 'look, I apologize, but this isn't going to work out after that Lizza incident.'"\u000a\u000aImportant: Newsmax TV is available on DirecTV Ch. 349, U-Verse 1220, and FiOS 615.

"Your behavior in a campaign can be a little out of the box, a little feisty.\u000a\u000a"But going into the White House, you're representing the country, and you're working in the greatest office in the world, and you have to conduct yourself in a professional manner. This Ryan Lizza interview, I think Anthony would admit this 10 times out of 10 \u2013 objectively \u2013 you would get fired for it.\u000a\u000a"I hope that Anthony is able to keep a relationship with the president. The president has his respect, and the president likes him a lot."\u000a\u000aNunberg said Scaramucci's enthusiastic style worked well at his first public press conference, in which "The Mooch" repeatedly said he loved Trump and would always be upfront with reporters.\u000a\u000a"He was a breath of fresh air," Nunberg told Khan. "It was something new. It was something different. It was out of the box. It looked like it was going to work.\u000a\u000a"But something I've been through, too, is when you work around Donald Trump \u2013 and he's this fantastic character, this man, he has it, he's a superstar \u2013 and he brings you in, but something that you have to remember \u2013 I had to learn this \u2013 is you're not Donald Trump. And Donald Trump can act any way he wants.\u000a\u000a"But when you work for him, you work for him, and you're not him. And you're there to serve him and to help him.

It's very hard to adapt to."\u000a\u000aAnd with his jaw-dropping comments to The New Yorker, Scaramucci sealed his own fate, according to Nunberg.\u000a\u000a"At the end of the day this was really a tragedy because . . . that Ryan Lizza interview he did was a big problem, and I think he would admit he made a mistake there," Nunberg said. "It was certainly out of the norm.\u000a\u000a"But the real tragedy here I think is with Anthony and Reince, who were fighting since around the transition. Reince made a point of keeping Anthony outside of the administration, which by the way strategically was a mistake. It's a life lesson, I learned . . . You want to keep your enemies closer, not out."\u000a\u000aHe said Scaramucci would have been a good change from the traditional Republican way of doing things.\u000a\u000a"We have a president who is a first citizen president," Nunberg said. "He's certainly our first celebrity president. He's a mogul. He's a magnet. He's different. And the kind of just button-up type skills you're going to get from the RNC [Republican National Committee] were never really going to work . . . It's cost the president, I believe, approval ratings.\u000a\u000a"Before Anthony took this position, let's remember they couldn't even have on-camera briefings anymore. What White House in modern day America can't have on-camera briefings? . . . Anthony screwed up.\u000a\u000a"But Anthony will be fine out of this. Anthony is going to be successful in whatever Anthony does."

aVAttorney General Jeff Sessions recently ordered the Justice Department to increase the use of civil asset forfeiture, thus once again endorsing an unconstitutional, authoritarian, and increasingly unpopular policy.\u000a\u000aCivil asset forfeiture, which should be called civil asset theft, is the practice of seizing property believed to be involved in a crime. The government keeps the property even if it never convicts, or even charges, the owner of the property.\u000a\u000aPolice can even use civil asset theft to steal from people whose property was used in criminal activity without the owners\u2019 knowledge. Some have even lost their homes because a renter or houseguest was dealing drugs on the premises behind the owners\u2019 backs.\u000a\u000aCivil asset theft is a multi-billion dollar a year moneymaker for all levels of government. Police and prosecutors receive more than their "fair share\u201d of the loot. According to a 2016 study by the Institute for Justice, 43 states allow police and prosecutors to keep at least half of the loot they got from civil asset theft.\u000a\u000aObviously, this gives police an incentive to aggressively use civil asset theft, even against those who are not even tangentially involved in a crime. For example, police in Tenaha, Texas literally engaged in highway robbery \u2014 seizing cash and other items from innocent motorists \u2014 while police in Detroit once seized every car in an art institute\u2019s parking lot. The official justification for that seizure was that the cars belonged to attendees at an event for which the institute had failed to get a liquor license.\u000a\u000aThe Tenaha police are not the only ones targeting those carrying large sums of cash. Anyone traveling with "too much" cash runs the risk of having it stolen by a police officer, since carrying large amounts of cash is treated as evidence of involvement in criminal activity.\u000a\u000aCivil asset theft also provides an easy way for the IRS to squeeze more money from the American taxpayer. As the growing federal debt increases the pressure to increase tax collections without raising tax rates, the IRS will likely ramp up its use of civil asset forfeiture.\u000a\u000aGrowing opposition to the legalized theft called civil asset forfeiture has led 24 states to pass laws limiting its use.

After all, Sessions is a cheerleader for the drug war, and civil asset theft came into common usage as a tool in the drug war.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump could do the American people a favor by naming a new attorney general who opposes police state policies like the drug war and police state tactics like civil asset theft.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRon Paul is a physician, author, and former Republican congressman.

aVAT&T won't sell CNN after buying its parent company, Time Warner, according to AT&T Entertainment Group head John Stankey, despite reports that circulated Monday.\u000a\u000aDeadline Hollywood reported that once the Justice Department signs off on Time Warner's sale, AT&T is looking to offload CNN and celebrity news website TMZ, with CBS as a possible buyer for the network.\u000a\u000aThe incoming head of Time Warner told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview released Tuesday that he views news, like sports, as unique, urgent content that can be watched on a number of different devices.\u000a\u000a"It would be a strategically missed opportunity if we weren't in that business," he said, adding that CNN's editorial independence will not change with the acquisition, saying, "You can't run a national news organization with that importance to our society without maintaining its editorial independence."\u000a\u000aStankey also denied rumors that AT&T hired a firm to find an executive that would work under him to oversee Time Warner assets, saying "unequivocally no," and saying those reports are "entirely inaccurate and untrue."\u000a\u000aHe added that "Because this is a vertical deal with no overlap in our businesses, you won't see layoffs, with a few exceptions of duplication at the corporate level. We want those people [at Time Warner] to be around."

aVThe fate of Obamacare rests in the hands of state insurance commissioners who are trying to figure out their healthcare business in the absence of guidance from Washington and, perhaps, a multi-billion dollar safety net, The New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aCongress failed to pass healthcare reform, President Donald Trump has threatened to kill up to $10 billion in federal subsidies to the insurance industry for 2018, so it's up to commissioners gathered in Philadelphia to figure out what to do next, the Times reported.\u000a\u000aIt's a big guess for commissioners \u2014 should they assume Trump spikes the subsidies and raise premiums? By how much and to whom?\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this past weekend that Republicans are working on "some kind of bipartisan approach" to pay insurers in 2018, but that wouldn't be until next month until the earliest, assuming they can even reach an agreement.\u000a\u000a"We are holding off making those decisions until the very last possible minute," Julie Mix McPeak, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, told the Times. "In doing so, we are really making it difficult for consumers who need information about open enrollment \u2014 who's participating in the market and what the rates might be. We don't know the answers to any of those questions."\u000a\u000aOfficials from the Trump administration were invited to speak to the commissioners and were listed on the program, but did not show, the Times reported.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, the business challenges vary from state to state, further complicating the commissioners' efforts.\u000a\u000a"Most of us are hoping and praying that this gets resolved," David Shea, a health actuary at the Virginia Bureau of Insurance, told the Times. "But that's not the case right now."

aVA new study suggests -- but doesn't prove -- that certain players of action video games may lose gray matter in a part of the brain that's linked to mental illness.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, the Canadian study suggests, other players may actually benefit from the games.\u000a\u000aAnd a psychologist not involved with the study said there's no evidence that video games are harmful to the brain.\u000a\u000aThe results indicate that the reported benefits of playing shooting-style video games -- such as improved attention and short-term memory -- "might come at a cost" in terms of lost brain matter in some players, said the study's lead author, Gregory West. He is an assistant professor with the department of psychology at the University of Montreal.\u000a\u000aThe difference may be the style of playing, the researchers noted.\u000a\u000aThe new study aimed to better understand the brain effects of so-called first-person and third-person shooting games -- such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, Killzone, or Medal of Honor -- compared to "3-D platform" games in the Super Mario series.\u000a\u000aThe researchers used a virtual-reality test, MRIs and 90 hours of game-playing involving 100 people who were either expert or nonexpert players. They also used MRIs to assess the impact on the hippocampus, the part of the brain that helps spatial and episodic memory.\u000a\u000aThe results showed evidence that gray matter in the hippocampus grew in those players who used so-called spatial strategies to find their way in the action video game. But the gray matter shrunk in those who navigated the same games by learned response.\u000a\u000aSpatial players create maps in their heads to understand the geography of the world within the game, the researchers explained. And response players use an approach akin to learning a route that you travel every day -- make a right turn here, then a left, then a right -- so that you can drive on mental auto-pilot without thinking.\u000a\u000aThose who played the Super Mario games, meanwhile, showed signs of growth in either the hippocampus or another part of the brain called the entorhinal cortex.\u000a\u000aThe study authors emphasized that they aren't saying that anyone who plays video games will develop a mental illness.\u000a\u000a"But we know that those with less gray matter in the hippocampus are more at risk to get conditions like schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and Alzheimer's disease," said study co-author Veronique Bohbot. She is an associate professor with the department of psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal.\u000a\u000aA video game expert called brain studies of game players problematic.\u000a\u000a"Given that there are so many areas in the brain, it stands to reason that, by chance alone, some of these areas may randomly differ between any two groups of people," said Chris Ferguson, a professor of psychology with Stetson University in DeLand, Fla.\u000a\u000a"Researchers can sometimes make a big deal out of these random differences and ascribe them to something like video games," he said.\u000a\u000aFerguson noted that overall brain research into the effects of the games hasn't revealed problems.\u000a\u000a"Despite some wild headlines and press releases from time to time, the research suggests that video game playing is entirely safe for the brain," Ferguson said.\u000a\u000a"The aggregate of studies have not suggested that playing video games, even 'violent' ones, cause either short- or long-term brain changes that are problematic or could be called 'brain damage,' " he added.\u000a\u000a"Most studies also don't connect the brain differences to actual behavior. So brain studies often function like Rorschach cards, telling you more about what the researchers want to believe than anything actually happening with human behavior," Ferguson suggested.\u000a\u000aWhat should video game players do? Study lead author West suggests that adults play shooter games for only two to three hours a week.\u000a\u000aFerguson noted that research is hinting that video games may reduce stress and improve problem-solving abilities.\u000a\u000a"Playing video games should be balanced with other activities: offline socialization, exercise, work and school, family and good sleep," he said. "As long as games are part of a balanced lifestyle, there's no evidence that they cause harmful brain changes."\u000a\u000aThe study was published in the Aug. 7 issue of Molecular Psychiatry.

aVA group of hackers posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online Monday, and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom from the network to prevent the release of entire television series and other sensitive proprietary files.\u000a\u000aHBO, which had previously acknowledged the theft of "proprietary information," said it's continuing to investigate and is working with police and cybersecurity experts.\u000a\u000aIn a swaggering five-minute video from "Mr. Smith" to HBO CEO Richard Plepler included in the dump, the hackers used white text scrolling on a black background to deliver an ultimatum. In short: Pay up within three days or see the group, which claims to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of HBO shows and confidential corporate data, upload entire series and sensitive proprietary files.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, the hackers demanded "our 6-month salary in bitcoin," and claimed they earn $12 million to $15 million a year from blackmailing organizations whose networks they have penetrated. They said they would only deal directly with "Richard" and only send one "letter" detailing how to pay.\u000a\u000aThe dump itself was just 3.4 gigabytes \u2014 mostly technical data that appears to provide a topography of HBO's network and to list network-administrator passwords. It includes what appear to be draft scripts from five "Game of Thrones" episodes, including one upcoming episode, and a month's worth of email apparently from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming.\u000a\u000aThe network reiterated Monday that it doesn't believe that its email system as a whole has been compromised.\u000a\u000aThe video text was written in often flawed but fluent English peppered with misspellings and pop-culture references.\u000a\u000aThe hackers claimed it took them about 6 months to breach HBO's network. Their biggest threat appears to be dumping videos of future shows online with their logo "HBO Is Falling" superimposed.\u000a\u000aMany of the more than 50 internal documents in the dump were labeled "confidential," including a spreadsheet of legal claims against the network, job offer letters to several top executives, slides discussing future technology plans and a list of 37,977 emails called "Richard's Contact list," an apparent reference to Plepler.\u000a\u000aOne screenshot labeled "Highly Confidential" by the hackers listed folders such as "Penguin Random House," \u2033Licensing & Retail," \u2033Legal," \u2033International" and "Budgets." Another document appears to contain the confidential cast list for "Game of Thrones," listing personal cellphone numbers and email addresses for actors such as Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey and Emilia Clark.\u000a\u000aSo far, however, the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers possibly associated with North Korea unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\u000a\u000aThe video letter uploaded Monday claimed the hackers spend a half million dollars a year to purchase "zero-day" exploits that let them break into networks through holes not yet know to Microsoft and other software companies. It claims HBO is the hackers' 17th target and that only three of their past targets refused to pay.

aVIt appears unlikely that the Senate will get rid of its filibuster rule, even though President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for it, according to a report by CBS News.\u000a\u000aThe rule, which requires 60 votes to stop debate and push bills forward to a final vote, is an intrinsic part of the Senate, according to Rich Arenberg, co-author of "Defending the Filibuster: Soul of the Senate" and a Congressional staffer for decades.\u000a\u000a"I think that would damage the Senate and its historic role and it would be a disaster to do that . . . it's important in that it requires the majority to work with the minority and come to a compromise," Arenberg told CBS News.\u000a\u000aArenberg said he believed that the Senate is moving toward dumping the filibuster.\u000a\u000a"I hope we don't get to that, but I do fear that," he told CBS News.\u000a\u000aSenate Republicans got rid of the rule when they confirmed Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But after that, a bipartisan collection of 61 senators called for the filibuster to stay intact for legislation, according to Politico.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said there were not enough Republican votes to change the rules of the Senate.\u000a\u000a"There are not the votes in the Senate, as I've said repeatedly to the president and to all of you, to change the rules of the Senate. There are not enough. It would require 50 or 51 Republicans to agree to do that and the votes are simply not there," McConnell told reporters, according to CBS News.\u000a\u000aSeveral Republicans in the Senate said they want to keep the rule but change the threshold for pushing bills forward. "I think changing the rules to streamline the process in an appropriate way \u2014 I mean, we should take a look at this," Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said in the CBS news report.\u000a\u000aSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he supports keeping the filibuster because Republicans need to keep the future in mind.\u000a\u000a"There are going to be times when the Republicans are in the majority, and there are going to be times when we're in the minority. I still think there's a need for a body where consensus has to take place," Wicker told CBS News.\u000a\u000aThe need for compromise and to earn the minority's support is a key reason for keeping the filibuster, Arenberg said in January in The New York Times.\u000a\u000a"Both parties must renew their respect for Senate rules\u2014and the views of the people," Arenberg wrote.

aVBEIJING (AP) \u2014 A strong earthquake shook a mountainous region in southwestern China near a famous national park Tuesday evening, killing five tourists and injuring 63 other people, while causing power to be cut and phone networks to be knocked out.\u000a\u000aThe magnitude 6.5 quake struck a region bordered by the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu at a depth of just 9 kilometers (5.5 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.\u000a\u000aThe China Earthquake Networks Center measured the earthquake at magnitude 7.0 and said it struck at a depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles). The quake occurred at about 9:20 p.m. near Jiuzhaigou, or Jiuzhai Valley, a national park known for spectacular waterfalls and karst formations, the Chinese agency said.\u000a\u000aThe area is located on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau in northern Sichuan province, home to many Tibetan and other ethnic minority villages.\u000a\u000aA man surnamed Song who answered the phone at a local emergency office in Aba prefecture, where the Jiuzhaigou national park is located, said the nearby town of Zhangzha reported the deaths and injuries. Song did not say where the five tourists who died were from.\u000a\u000aEarthquakes are common in China's west, although the low population density there often means casualties are low. China's deadliest earthquake this century, a magnitude 7.9 temblor with a depth of 19 kilometers (12 miles), struck Sichuan province in May 2008, killing nearly 90,000 people.\u000a\u000aThe epicenter in Tuesday's quake was about 39 kilometers (24 miles) from the county of Jiuzhaigou, which has a population of around 80,000, in an area that's 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) above sea level. It was 285 kilometers (177 miles) from Chengdu, the densely populated capital of Sichuan province, according to the Chinese center.\u000a\u000aThe official Xinhua News Agency said strong tremors could be felt in Chengdu. The Sichuan provincial government's news website said that after the quake struck, a number of train services to Chengdu and other cities were suspended.\u000a\u000aJiuzhaigou county was suffering from a massive power outage following the quake, Song said. Local officials were being sent to the town of Zhangzha, which was closest to the quake's epicenter.\u000a\u000a"The tremors were very strong," said a woman in Jiuzhaigou town who gave only her surname, Wang, and said she worked for a travel company. She said the damage in the town center seemed minimal other than the suspension of electricity. "People from other regions are a pretty frightened," Wang said.\u000a\u000aXinhua cited a worker at the Jiuzhaigou park named Sangey as saying that some houses in the tourist site collapsed or cracked following the quake and that authorities were organizing evacuations of residents.\u000a\u000aImages circulating on Chinese social media sites showed rocks scattered on roads and people running out of bars and cafes in Jiuzhaigou town onto the street.\u000a\u000aA report on the news site's official microblog also cited Zhao Wei, the party secretary of the Communist Youth League's Jiuzhaigou division, as saying some telephone communications networks were down, making it difficult to determine the scale of the damage caused.\u000a\u000aAnother Jiuzhaigou government official was quoted as saying that many people had run onto the streets after the earthquake struck, but that there were no immediate signs of any major damage to houses or other buildings, and that the situation was orderly.\u000a\u000aThe China Earthquake Networks Center said the quake was followed about 20 minutes later by a temblor measuring 3.3 in magnitude at a depth of 9 kilometers (5.5 miles).\u000a\u000aAssociated Press researcher Fu Ting contributed to this report.

aVStudents often consider the location, programs, and campus advantages when choosing a college, but they shouldn\u2019t forget about the financial factors involved. Finances greatly affect a student\u2019s functions and accomplishments during and after college.\u000a\u000aReading literature, obtaining information from school websites, going through the interview process, and visiting campuses help in making the right choice. Students and their parents, however, should also take into account the money that will be shelled out for a good education.\u000a\u000aHere are six financial factors to consider when choosing a college:\u000a\u000a1. Costs \u2014 Parents and students might focus on tuition when evaluating the cost of a college education, but there are many other fees involved. Expenses can include costs for textbooks, housing, food, parking, and other various things, notes CollegeAtlas.org. Certain college courses have fees for supplies or equipment. Then there are costs for health services and extracurricular activities, as well as different expenses for living on- or off-campus, which should also be factored in.\u000a\u000aTip:\u000a\u000aImagine No Student Loans\u2026 It\u2019s Easy When You Know This Secret\u000a\u000a2. Application fees \u2014 Before a student even enters college, application fees can take a bite out of finances. Some students intend to apply to different schools, which have high and low fees. If so, they may want to avoid schools with higher application fees if they know they have better chances of getting into a smaller school, Moneycrashers advises.\u000a\u000a3. Financial aid \u2014 Closely research financial aid packages offered at different colleges. Information on financial aid can usually be found through a particular school\u2019s website. Student loans may sound attractive, but parents may have to consider if a child\u2019s selected major will lead to a lucrative job, future debt, and the return on investment, the Charlotte Observer reports.\u000a\u000a4. Work opportunities \u2014 Along with available scholarships or grants, many schools offer work-study programs that may reduce the costs or need for financial aid or loans. Many students work their way through college. Jobs also offer additional skills and experience that can increase income after graduation.\u000a\u000aSpecial:\u000a\u000aHow to Graduate From College Without Debt\u000a\u000a5. Paying down debt \u2014 Repaying loans can lead to financial struggles for students when they start out in the workforce. The costs in the future and ability to pay off loans are among the financial factors to consider, according to the Home Room blog of the Department of Education.\u000a\u000a6. After-college earnings \u2014 When choosing a college and major, potential salaries in careers play an important role for a financially secure future, especially if students need to pay off student loans. The Department of Education has a scorecard with information on average earnings for students after enrolling in certain colleges.\u000a\u000aAlert:\u000a\u000aHow to Tap Into $250 Billion in College Aid \u2014 Legally!

The general public didn't necessarily want to accept the fact that she's a Christian because there's so many critics out there about the Clintons," he said.\u000a\u000aShillady's book contains 365 devotions and a forward by Clinton herself.\u000a\u000a"It's an inspirational book. I do not believe that she encouraged me to write this book in any way to change the image of her," Shillady told the mag.\u000a\u000a"She really found [the devotionals] so helpful to her in the midst of the contentious campaign that she felt that people would find some hope \u2026 from it."

aVIn the last month, the eyes of the Western Hemisphere have been focused on Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro. The successor to the late Marxist President Hugo Chavez is tightening his control over Venezuela and is now poised to convene a "constituent assembly" likely to give him near-dictatorial powers.\u000a\u000aFor its part, the Trump administration has been announcing a string of sanctions and its intention of cooperating with the Organization of American States (OAS) on the growing Venezuelan situation.\u000a\u000a"Our objective is not to do anything that hurts the people of Venezuela," Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin told reporters at the White House July 31, "But let me just say, we will continue to monitor all of our specific options."\u000a\u000aThere is one "specific option" that has been speculated on in the press but will almost surely not come about: a U.S.-sponsored coup to overthrow Maduro.\u000a\u000aBefore 2001, U.S. intelligence did work covertly in several Latin American countries to depose leaders who were considered hostile to the U.S. In 1954, for example, the CIA crafted and executed "Operation PBSUCCESS" to overthrow Guatemala's leftist President Jacobo Arbenz in favor of a pro-U.S. regime headed by Col. Carlos Castilo Armas.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. was involved in successful coups in Bolivia and Brazil in 1964, in another Bolivian coup in 1971, and in the unsuccessful efforts of the anti-Communist "contras" in Nicaragua against Marxist ruler Daniel Ortega in the 1980s.\u000a\u000aAlthough the CIA has never confirmed it was involved in the overthrow (and execution) of Chile's Marxist President Salvador Allende in 1973, American intellligence operatives did try to thwart his election in 1970 and supported demonstrations against the Allende regime for three years.\u000a\u000aSuch activities by the U.S. were ended on the memorable date of September 11, 2001.\u000a\u000aThat is when then-Secretary of State Colin Powell signed the Inter-American Democratic Charter at the General Assembly of the OAS in Lima, Peru. Under the Charter, all 34 OAS members agreed that "The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it."\u000a\u000aThat means no coups against elected governments, or as the charter characterized them, "an unconstitutional interruption of the democratic order or an unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic order in a member state."\u000a\u000aArticle 19 of the charter further condemns a coup as "an insurmountable obstacle to its government's participation in sessions of the General Assembly, the Meeting of Consultation, the Councils of the Organization, the specialized conferences, the commissions, working groups, and other bodies of the Organization."\u000a\u000a"In the long run, it always hurts the United States to promote the overthrow of Latin American governments," Stephen Kinzer, former New York Times bureau chief in Central America, told Newsmax, "The new regimes are always tainted by the fact that they were helped to power by Americans."\u000a\u000aKinzer pointed out that "in many cases \u2014 most recently Honduras \u2014 they turn brutal or corrupt, and the U.S. gets the blame. Upheaval in Venezuela does not affect any of our vital interests. The blowback from more than a century of U.S. involvement in Latin American coups should have taught us by now that we're usually better off letting countries sort out their own problems."\u000a\u000aOn July 31, Newsmax cited the Democratic Charter of 2001 and asked Secretary Mnuchin whether the U.S. would flatly rule out supporting a coup against Maduro.\u000a\u000a"We are focused on the democratic process," he told us, "and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now."\u000a\u000aJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.
