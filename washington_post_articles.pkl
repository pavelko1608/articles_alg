V\u201cOur plan is to have a full-blown release of the plan in the beginning of September," Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said. White House yielding to Congress on tax details\u000a\u000aThe White House does not plan to release its own version of a tax reform plan and will instead leave that to the congressional leadership and the major tax-writing committees, a senior administration official said Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe decision to hand off the specifics of tax reform comes after the administration promised earlier this summer to release a full tax plan when Congress returned from its August recess. It also follows President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated promises to deliver the biggest tax cut in American history.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cOur plan is to have a full-blown release of the plan in the beginning of September, with being able to vote and getting this passed before the end of the year,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in July.\u000a\u000aInstead, the so-called Big Six tax reform negotiators \u2014 a group that includes Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch \u2014 will essentially turn over what they have done to the committees and let them fill in the particulars.\u000a\u000aThe move to turn over most of the detail work to Congress follows some progress from the Big Six to identify possible ways to pay for a cut in the corporate rate \u2014 to between 22 percent and 25 percent \u2014 including by capping the mortgage interest deduction, eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes, reducing the interest that companies can deduct and possibly taxing contributions to 401(k) retirement plans.\u000a\u000aMorning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

By handing off to Republicans in Congress, the White House could avoid some of the political fallout from the proposed changes.\u000a\u000aSo far, the White House has publicly released only a short set of goals for tax reform without getting into detail on where to set individual and corporate rates and how to reduce the impact on the deficit. Trump initially said he wanted a corporate rate of 15 percent. But that is widely viewed as impossible to reach without a big impact on annual deficits.\u000a\u000aThere is still no agreement on whether or how any cuts could be made permanent under the set of rules Republicans plan to use to pass a tax plan through the Senate with a simple majority.\u000a\u000aThere have also been conflicting signals from the White House on what to expect on tax reform in the coming days. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday hinted at a possible tax reform event.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at a lot of different ways in which to talk about that and present that to the American people, working with Congress to make sure that that happens,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that you can expect some of that to take place in the very short order, probably next week and following through to the fall.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut other White House officials cautioned against expecting any kind of formal tax-plan rollout next week. And any such move now appears likely to come from Republicans on Capitol Hill rather than the White House. Trump, however, is expected to focus on tax reform in the coming days and then make a strong sales pitch for whatever eventually emerges from Congress.\u000a\u000aJosh Dawsey and Brian Faler contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThat fundamental tension between Clinton and the president would continue to be a defining feature of her four-year tenure as secretary of state. In the administration\u2019s first high-level meeting on Russia in February 2009, aides to Obama proposed that the United States make some symbolic concessions to Russia as a gesture of its good will in resetting the relationship. Clinton, the last to speak, brusquely rejected the idea, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up anything for nothing.\u201d Her hardheadedness made an impression on Robert Gates, the defense secretary and George W. Bush holdover who was wary of a changed Russia. He decided there and then that she was someone he could do business with.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

It was July 2010, four months after the North Korean military torpedoed a South Korean Navy corvette, sinking it and killing 46 sailors. Now, after weeks of fierce debate between the Pentagon and the State Department, the United States was gearing up to respond to this brazen provocation. The tentative plan \u2014 developed by Clinton\u2019s deputy at State, James Steinberg \u2014 was to dispatch the aircraft carrier George Washington into coastal waters to the east of North Korea as an unusual show of force.\u000a\u000aBut Adm. Robert Willard, then the Pacific commander, wanted to send the carrier on a more aggressive course, into the Yellow Sea, between North Korea and China. The Chinese foreign ministry had warned the United States against the move, which for Willard was all the more reason to press forward. He pushed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, who in turn pushed his boss, the defense secretary, to reroute the George Washington. Gates agreed, but he needed the commander in chief to sign off on a decision that could have political as well as military repercussions.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aGates laid out the case for diverting the George Washington to the Yellow Sea: that the United States should not look as if it was yielding to China. Clinton strongly seconded it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to run it up the gut!\u201d she had said to her aides a few days earlier. (The Vince Lombardi imitation drew giggles from her staff, who, even 18 months into her tenure, still marveled at her pugnacity.)\u000a\u000aObama, though, was not persuaded. The George Washington was already underway; changing its course was not a decision to make on the fly.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t call audibles with aircraft carriers,\u201d he said \u2014 unwittingly one-upping Clinton on her football metaphor.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t the last debate in which she would side with Gates. The two quickly discovered that they shared a Midwestern upbringing, a taste for a stiff drink after a long day of work and a deep-seated skepticism about the intentions of America\u2019s foes. Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama\u2019s initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: \u201cI think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very left-of-center administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state who\u2019s a little bit right of them on these issues \u2014 a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Hillary Clinton makes another run for president, it can be tempting to view her hard-edged rhetoric about the world less as deeply felt core principle than as calculated political maneuver. But Clinton\u2019s foreign-policy instincts are bred in the bone \u2014 grounded in cold realism about human nature and what one aide calls \u201ca textbook view of American exceptionalism.\u201d It set her apart from her rival-turned-boss, Barack Obama, who avoided military entanglements and tried to reconcile Americans to a world in which the United States was no longer the undisputed hegemon. And it will likely set her apart from the Republican candidate she meets in the general election. For all their bluster about bombing the Islamic State into oblivion, neither Donald J. Trump nor Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has demonstrated anywhere near the appetite for military engagement abroad that Clinton has.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000a\u201cHillary is very much a member of the traditional American foreign-policy establishment,\u201d says Vali Nasr, a foreign-policy strategist who advised her on Pakistan and Afghanistan at the State Department. \u201cShe believes, like presidents going back to the Reagan or Kennedy years, in the importance of the military \u2014 in solving terrorism, in asserting American influence. The shift with Obama is that he went from reliance on the military to the intelligence agencies. Their position was, \u2018All you need to deal with terrorism is N.S.A. and C.I.A., drones and special ops.\u2019 So the C.I.A. gave Obama an angle, if you will, to be simultaneously hawkish and shun using the military.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike other recent presidents \u2014 Obama, George W. Bush or her husband, Bill Clinton \u2014 Hillary Clinton would assume the office with a long record on national security. There are many ways to examine that record, but one of the most revealing is to explore her decades-long cultivation of the military \u2014 not just civilian leaders like Gates, but also its high-ranking commanders, the men with the medals. Her affinity for the armed forces is rooted in a lifelong belief that the calculated use of military power is vital to defending national interests, that American intervention does more good than harm and that the writ of the United States properly reaches, as Bush once put it, into \u201cany dark corner of the world.\u201d Unexpectedly, in the bombastic, testosterone-fueled presidential election of 2016, Hillary Clinton is the last true hawk left in the race.\u000a\u000aFor those who know Clinton\u2019s biography, her embrace of the military should come as no surprise. She grew up in the buoyant aftermath of World War II, the daughter of a Navy petty officer who trained young sailors before they shipped out to the Pacific. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was a staunch Republican and an anticommunist, and she channeled his views. She talks often about her girlhood dream of becoming an astronaut, citing the rejection letter she got from NASA as the first time she encountered gender discrimination. Her real motive for volunteering, she has written, may have been because her father fretted that \u201cAmerica was lagging behind Russia.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aPolitical conversion came later, after Vietnam and the \u201960s swept over Wellesley College, where she spoke out against the establishment at her graduation. But even in the tumultuous year of 1968, she was still making her transition from Republican to Democrat, managing to go to the conventions of both parties. As a Republican intern in Washington that summer, she questioned a Wisconsin congressman, Melvin Laird, about the wisdom of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s escalating involvement in Southeast Asia.\u000a\u000aIt was after law school that she had her most curious encounter with the military. In 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton, she stopped in at a Marine recruiting office in Arkansas to inquire about joining the active forces or reserves. She was a lawyer, she explained; maybe there was some way she could serve. The recruiter, she recalled two decades later, was a young man of about 21, in prime physical condition. Clinton was then 27, freshly transplanted from Washington, teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and wearing Coke-bottle eyeglasses. \u201cYou\u2019re too old, you can\u2019t see and you\u2019re a woman,\u201d he told her. \u201cMaybe the dogs will take you,\u201d he added, in what she said was a pejorative reference to the Army.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was not a very encouraging conversation,\u201d Clinton said at a lunch for military women on Capitol Hill in 1994. \u201cI decided, Maybe I\u2019ll look for another way to serve my country.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome reporters have cast doubt on the veracity of this story, which she repeated in the fall of 2015 over breakfast with voters in New Hampshire: certainly, there\u2019s no concrete evidence that it happened, and Bill gave a different account of it in 2008, substituting the Army for the Marines. Why would a professionally minded Yale Law graduate, on the cusp of marriage, suddenly want to put on a uniform? It\u2019s impossible to decipher her possible motives, but Ann Henry, an old friend who taught at the university after Clinton moved to Little Rock, offers a theory: During those days, she recalls, female faculty members, as an exercise, would test the boundaries of careers that appeared closed to women. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s made up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was consistent with something she would have done.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Libya Gamble An examination of the American intervention in Libya and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in it.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s next sustained exposure to the military did not come until she was first lady, almost two decades later. Living in the White House is, in many ways, like living in a military compound. A Marine stands guard in front of the West Wing when the president is in the Oval Office. The Mili­tary Office operates the medical center and the telecommunications system. The Navy runs the cafeteria, the Marines transport the president by helicopter, the Air Force by plane. Camp David is a naval facility. The daily contact with men and women in uniform, Clinton\u2019s friends say, deepened her feelings for them.\u000a\u000aIn March 1996, the first lady visited American troops stationed in Bosnia. The trip became notorious years later when she claimed, during the 2008 campaign, to have dodged sniper fire after her C-17 military plane landed at an American base in Tuzla. (Chris Hill, a diplomat who was onboard that day and later served as ambassador to Iraq under Clinton, didn\u2019t remember snipers at all, and indeed recalled children handing her bouquets of spring flowers.) But there was no faking the good vibes during her tour of the mess and rec halls. With her teenage daughter at her side, she bantered and joked with the young servicemen and women \u2014 an experience, she wrote, that \u201cleft lasting impressions on Chelsea and me.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Clinton was elected to the Senate, she had strong political reasons to care about the mili­tary. The Pentagon was in the midst of a long, politically charged process of closing military bases; New York State had already been a victim, when Plattsburgh Air Force Base was closed in 1995, a loss of 352 civilian jobs for that hard-luck North Country town. New York\u2019s delegation was determined to protect its remaining bases, especially Fort Drum, home of the Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division, which sprawls over a hundred thousand acres in rural Jefferson County. In October 2001, a month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Clinton traveled to Fort Drum at the invitation of Gen. Buster Hagenbeck, who had just been named the division\u2019s commander and would be deployed to Afghanistan a month later. Like many of the officers I spoke with, he had preconceptions of Clinton from her years as first lady; the woman who showed up at his office around happy hour that afternoon did not fulfill them.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe sat down,\u201d he recalls, \u201ctook her shoes off, put her feet up on the coffee table and said, \u2018General, do you know where a gal can get a cold beer around here?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aIt was the start of a dialogue that stretched over two wars. In the spring of 2002, Hagenbeck led Operation Anaconda, a 16-day assault on Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the Shah-i-Kot Valley that was the largest combat engagement of the war to date. When the general came back to Washington to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Clinton took him out to dinner on Capitol Hill for her own briefing. They also spoke about the Bush administration\u2019s preparations for war in Iraq, something which Hagenbeck was following anxiously. The general, it turned out, was more of a dove than the senator. He warned her about the risks of an invasion, which was then being war-gamed inside the Pentagon. It would be like \u201ckicking over a bee\u2019s nest,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHagenbeck excused Clinton\u2019s vote in 2002 to authorize military action in Iraq. \u201cShe made a considered call,\u201d he says. And \u201cshe was chagrined, much after the fact.\u201d For him, what mattered more than Clinton\u2019s voting record was her unstinting public support of the military, whether in protecting Fort Drum or backing him during a difficult first year in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s education in military affairs began in earnest in 2002, after the Democratic Party\u2019s crushing defeat in midterm elections moved her up several rungs in Senate seniority. The party\u2019s congressional leaders offered her a seat on either the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the Senate Armed Services Committee. She chose Armed Services, spurning a long tradition of New York senators, like Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob Javits, who coveted the prestige of Foreign Relations. Armed Services deals with more earthbound issues, like benefits for veterans, and it had long been the preserve of Republican hawks like John McCain. But after 9/11, Clinton saw Armed Services as better preparation for her future. For a politician looking to hone hard-power credentials \u2014 a woman who aspired to be commander in chief \u2014 it was the perfect training ground. She dug in like a grunt at boot camp.\u000a\u000aAndrew Shapiro, then Senator Clinton\u2019s foreign-policy adviser, called upon 10 experts \u2014 including Bill Perry, who was defense secretary under her husband, and Ashton Carter, who would eventually become President Obama\u2019s fourth defense secretary \u2014 to tutor her on everything from grand strategy to defense procurement. She met quietly with Andrew Marshall, an octogenarian strategist at the Pentagon who labored for decades in the blandly named Office of Net Assessment, earning the nickname Yoda for his Delphic insights. She went to every committee meeting, no matter how mundane. Aides recall her on C-SPAN3, sitting alone in the chamber, patiently questioning a lieutenant colonel. She visited the troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving Day in 2003 and spoke at every significant military installation in New York State. By then \u2014 30 years after she recalled being rejected by a Marine recruiter in Arkansas \u2014 Hillary Clinton had become a military wonk.\u000a\u000aJack Keane is one of the intellectual architects of the Iraq surge; he is also perhaps the greatest single influence on the way Hillary Clinton thinks about military issues. A bear of a man with a jowly, careworn face and Brylcreem-slicked hair, Keane exudes the supreme self-confidence you would expect of a retired four-star general. He speaks with a trace of a New York accent that gives his pronouncements a rat-a-tat urgency. He is also a well-compensated member of the military-industrial complex, sitting on the board of General Dynamics and serving as a strategic adviser to Academi, the private-security contractor once known as Blackwater. And he is the chairman of an aptly named think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Though he is one of a parade of cable-TV generals, Keane is the resident hawk on Fox News, where he appears regularly to call for the United States to use greater military force in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. He doesn\u2019t shrink from putting boots on the ground and has little use for civilian leaders, like Obama, who do.\u000a\u000aKeane first got to know Clinton in the fall of 2001, when she was a freshman senator and he was the Army\u2019s second in command, with a distinguished combat and command record in Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. He had expected her to be intelligent, hard-working and politically astute, but he was not prepared for the respect she showed for the Army as an institution, or her sympathy for the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families. Keane was confident he could smell a phony politician a mile away, and he didn\u2019t get that whiff from her.\u000a\u000a\u201cI read people; that\u2019s one of my strengths,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t be fooled, but I\u2019m not fooled often.\u201d\u000a\u000aClinton took an instant liking to Keane, too. \u201cShe loves that Irish gruff thing,\u201d says one of her Senate aides, Kris Balderston, who was in the room that day. When Keane got up after 45 minutes to leave for a meeting back at the Pentagon with a Polish general, she protested that she wasn\u2019t finished yet and asked for another appointment. \u201cI said, \u2018O.K., but it took me three months to get this one,\u2019 \u201d Keane told her dryly.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aClinton exploded into a raucous laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of that problem,\u201d she promised.\u000a\u000aShe was true to her word: The two would meet many times over the next decade, discussing the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Iranian nu­clear threat and other flash points in the Middle East. Sometimes he dropped by her Senate office; other times they met for dinner or drinks. He escorted her on her first visit to Fort Drum and set up her first trip to Iraq.\u000a\u000aThey generally agreed to forgo talk of politics, but at a meeting in Clinton\u2019s Senate office in January 2007, Keane tried to sell her on the logic of a troop surge in Iraq. The previous month, he had met with President Bush in the Oval Office to recommend that the United States deploy five to eight Army and Marine brigades to wage an urban counterinsurgency campaign; only that, he argued, would stabilize a country being ripped apart by sectarian strife. His presentation angered some of Keane\u2019s fellow generals, who feared that such a strategy would deepen Iraq\u2019s dependency and prolong America\u2019s involvement. But it had a big impact on the commander in chief, who soon ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aClinton was another story. \u201cI\u2019m convinced it\u2019s not going to work, Jack,\u201d she told him. She predicted that the American soldiers patrolling in Iraqi cities and towns would be \u201cblown up\u201d by Sunni militias or Al Qaeda fighters. \u201cShe thought we would fail,\u201d Keane recalls, \u201cand it was going to cause increased casualties.\u201d\u000a\u000aPolitics, of course, was also on her mind. Barack Obama was laying the groundwork for his candidacy in mid-January with a campaign that would emphasize his opposition to the Iraq War and her vote in favor of it \u2014 a vote that still shadows her in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries. Obama was setting off on a fund-raising drive that would net $25 million in three months, sending tremors through Clinton\u2019s political camp and establishing him as a formidable rival. Although she disagreed with Keane about Iraq, Clinton asked him to become a formal adviser. \u201cAs much as I respect you,\u201d he replied, \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d Keane\u2019s wife had health problems that had moved up his retirement from the Army, and he did not, as a policy, endorse candidates. Sometime during 2008 \u2014 he doesn\u2019t remember exactly when \u2014 Clinton told him she had erred in doubting the wisdom of the surge. \u201cShe said, \u2018You were right, this really did work,\u2019 \u201d Keane recalls. \u201cOn issues of national security,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought she was always intellectually honest with me.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and Clinton continued to talk, even after Obama was elected and she became secretary of state. More often than not, they found themselves in sync. Keane, like Clinton, favored more robust intervention in Syria than Obama did. In April 2015, the week before she announced her candidacy, Clinton asked him for a briefing on military options for dealing with the fighters of the Islamic State. Bringing along three young female analysts from the Institute for the Study of War, Keane gave her a 2-hour-20-minute presentation. Among other steps, he advocated imposing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria that would neutralize the air power of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, with a goal of forcing him into a political settlement with opposition groups. Six months later, Clinton publicly adopted this position, further distancing herself from Obama.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m convinced this president, no matter what the circumstances, will never put any boots on the ground to do anything, even when it\u2019s compelling,\u201d Keane told me. He was sitting in the library at his home in McLean, Va., which is lined with books on military history and strategy. His critique of Obama was hardly new or original, but much of it mirrors the thinking of Clinton and her policy advisers. \u201cOne of the problems the president has, which weakens his diplomatic efforts, is that leaders don\u2019t believe he would use military power. That\u2019s an issue that would separate the president from Hillary Clinton rather dramatically. She would look at military force as another realistic option, but only where there is no other option.\u201d\u000a\u000aBefriending Keane wasn\u2019t just about cultivating a single adviser. It gave Clinton instant entree to his informal network of active-duty and retired generals. The most interesting by far was David Petraeus, a cerebral commander who shared Clinton\u2019s jet-fueled ambition and whose life stories would mix heady success with humbling setbacks. Both would be accused of mishandling classified information \u2014 Clinton because of her use of a private server and email address to conduct sensitive government business, a decision that erupted into a political scandal; Petraeus because he had given a diary containing classified information to his biographer and mistress (he was eventually charged with a misdemeanor for mishandling classified information).\u000a\u000aOn Clinton\u2019s first trip to Iraq in November 2003, Petraeus, then a two-star general commanding the 101st Airborne Division, flew from his field headquarters in Mosul to the relative safety of Kirkuk to brief her congressional delegation. \u201cShe was full of questions,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was the kind of gesture that means a lot to a battlefield commander.\u201d On subsequent trips, as he rose in rank, Petraeus walked her through his plans to train and equip Iraqi Army troops, a forerunner of the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It worked to their mutual benefit: Petraeus was building ties to a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate; Clinton was burnishing her image as a friend of the troops. \u201cShe did it the old-fashioned way,\u201d he says. \u201cShe did it by pursuing relationships.\u201d When Petraeus was sent back to Iraq as the top commander in early 2007, he gave every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee a copy of the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, which he edited during a tour at Fort Leavenworth. Clinton read hers from cover to cover.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aAlthough Clinton\u2019s reservations about the surge were valid \u2014 the stability that the additional troops brought to Iraq didn\u2019t last \u2014 her opposition to it, like her vote for the war, came back to haunt her. This time, it was her ally Bob Gates who summoned the ghost. In his memoirs, Gates wrote that she confessed to him and the president that her position had been politically motivated, because she was then facing Obama in the Iowa caucuses. (Obama, he wrote, \u201cvaguely\u201d conceded that he, too, had opposed it for political reasons.) Clinton pushed back, telling Diane Sawyer of ABC News that Gates \u201cperhaps either missed the context or the meaning, because I did oppose the surge.\u201d Her opposition, she told Sawyer, was driven by the fact that at that time, people were not going to accept any escalation of the war. \u201cThis is not politics in electoral, political terms,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThis is politics in the sense of the American public has to support commitments like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe next time she found herself in a debate over sending troops into harm\u2019s way, she voiced no such reservations.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need maps,\u201d Hillary Clinton told her aides.\u000a\u000aIt was early October 2009, and she had just returned from a meeting in the Situation Room. Obama\u2019s war cabinet was debating how many additional troops to send to Afghanistan, where the United States, preoccupied by Iraq, had allowed the Taliban to regroup. The Pentagon, she reported, had used impressive, color-coded maps to show its plans to deploy troops around the country. The attention to detail made Gates and his commanders look crisp and well prepared; the State Department, which was pushing a \u201ccivilian surge\u201d to accompany the troops, looked wan by comparison. At the next meeting, on Oct. 14, the team from State unfurled its own maps to show the deployment of an army of aid workers, diplomats, legal experts and crop specialists who were supposed to follow the soldiers into Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s fixation with maps was typical of her mind-set in the first great war-and-peace debate of the Obama presidency. She wanted to be taken seriously, even if her department was less central than the Pentagon. One way to do that was by promoting the civilian surge, the pet project of her friend and special envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke. \u201cShe was determined that her briefing books would be just as thick and just as meticulous as those of the Pentagon,\u201d a senior adviser recalls. She also didn\u2019t hesitate to get into the Pentagon\u2019s business, asking detailed questions about the training of Afghan troops and wading into the weeds of military planning.\u000a\u000aShe resolved not to miss out on anything \u2014 a determination that may have been rooted in a deeper insecurity about her role in what was to become the most White House-centric administration of the modern era. On the morning of June 8, 2009, she emailed two aides to say: \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?\u201d On Feb. 10, 2010, she dialed the White House from her home, but couldn\u2019t get past the switchboard operator, who didn\u2019t believe she was really Hillary Clinton. Asked to provide her office number to prove her identity, she said she didn\u2019t know it. Finally, Clinton hung up in frustration and placed the call again through the State Department Operations Center \u2014 \u201clike a proper and properly dependent secretary of state,\u201d as she later wrote to one aide in a mock-chastened tone. \u201cNo independent dialing allowed.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Afghan troop debate, a three-month drama of dueling egos, leaked documents and endless deliberations, is typically framed as a test of wills between the Pentagon\u2019s wily military commanders and an inexperienced young president, with Joe Biden playing the role of devil\u2019s advocate for Obama. While that portrait is accurate, it neglects the role of Clinton. By siding with Gates and the generals, she gave political ballast to their proposals and provided a bullish counterpoint to Biden\u2019s skepticism. Her role should not be overstated: She did not turn the debate, nor did she bring to it any distinctive point of view. But her unstinting support of General McChrystal\u2019s maximalist recommendation made it harder for Obama to choose a lesser option. (McChrystal was later fired by Obama after his aides made derogatory remarks about almost every member of his war cabinet to Rolling Stone magazine; she was the exception. \u201cHillary had Stan\u2019s back,\u201d one of his aides told the reporter, Michael Hastings.)\u000a\u000a\u201cHillary was adamant in her support for what Stan asked for,\u201d Gates says. \u201cShe made clear that she was ready to support his request for the full 40,000 troops. She then made clear that she was only willing to go with the 30,000 number because I proposed it. She was, in a way, tougher on the numbers in the surge than I was.\u201d Gates believed that if he could align Clinton; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen; the commander of Central Command, David Petraeus; and himself behind a common position, it would be hard for Obama to say no. \u201cHow could you ignore these Four Horsemen of national security?\u201d says Geoff Morrell, who served as the Pentagon press secretary at the time.\u000a\u000aJust as Clinton benefited from her alliance with the military commanders, she gave them political cover. \u201cHere\u2019s the dirty little secret,\u201d says Tom Nides, her former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. \u201cThey all knew they wanted her on their side. They knew that if they walked into the Situation Room and they had her, it made a huge difference in the dynamics. When she opened her mouth, she could change the momentum in the room.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aDavid Axelrod recalls one meeting where Clinton \u201ckicked the thing off and pretty much articulated their opinion; I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one that they remember. There\u2019s no doubt that she wanted to give them every troop that McChrystal was asking for.\u201d Still, Clinton didn\u2019t prevail on every argument. After agreeing to send the troops, Obama added a condition of his own: that the soldiers be deployed as quickly as possible and pulled out again, starting in the summer of 2011 \u2014 a deadline that proved more fateful in the long run than a difference of 10,000 troops. Clinton opposed setting a public deadline for withdrawal, arguing that it would tip America\u2019s hand to the Taliban and encourage them to wait out the United States \u2014 which, in fact, was exactly what happened.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aIn the final days of the debate, Clinton also found herself at odds with her own ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry. He, too, held different views than she did on the wisdom of a surge, which he put into writing. On Nov. 6, 2009, in a long cable addressed to Clinton \u2014 and later leaked to The New York Times \u2014 he made a trenchant, convincing case for why the McChrystal proposal, which she endorsed two weeks earlier in a meeting with Obama, would saddle the United States with \u201cvastly increased costs and an indefinite, large-scale military role in Afghanistan.\u201d\u000a\u000aMuch of Eikenberry\u2019s analysis proved prescient, particularly his warnings about the threadbare American partnership with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. It carried an extra sting because he was a retired three-star Army general who was the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007. Clinton, who had not asked for the cable, was furious, fearing it could upset a debate in which she and the Pentagon were about to prevail.\u000a\u000aWhat the cable made clear was the degree to which the Afghanistan debate was dominated by military considerations. While Clinton did raise the need to deal with Afghanistan\u2019s neighbor, Pakistan, her reflexive support of Gates, Petraeus and McChrystal meant she was not a powerful voice for diplomatic alternatives. \u201cShe contributed to the overmilitarizing of the analysis of the problem,\u201d says Sarah Chayes, who was an adviser to McChrystal and later to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen.\u000a\u000aIn October 2015, the persistent violence in Afghanistan and the legacy of Karzai\u2019s misrule forced Obama to reverse his plan to withdraw the last American soldiers by the end of his presi­dency. A few thousand troops will stay there indefinitely. And for all of Clinton\u2019s talk about a civilian surge, it never really materialized.\u000a\u000aFor Clinton, the Afghanistan episode laid bare a vexed relationship between her and Eikenberry, one of the few generals with whom she didn\u2019t hit it off. A soldier-scholar with graduate degrees from Harvard and Stanford, Eikenberry was brilliant but had a reputation among his colleagues for being imperious. Clinton had a similarly chilly relationship with Douglas Lute, another Army lieutenant general with a graduate degree from Harvard, who also fought with Holbrooke. \u201cShe likes the nail-eaters \u2014 McChrystal, Petraeus, Keane,\u201d one of her aides observes. \u201cReal military guys, not these retired three-stars who go into civilian jobs.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Hillary Clinton\u2019s more muscular brand of American foreign policy is better matched to 2016 than it was to 2008,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, her top policy adviser at the State Department, who plays the same role in her campaign.\u000a\u000aIt was De­cem­ber 2015, 53 days before the Iowa caucuses, and Sullivan was sitting down with me in Clinton\u2019s sprawling Brooklyn headquarters to explain how she was shaping her message for a campaign suddenly dominated by concerns about national security. Clinton\u2019s strategy, he said, was twofold: Explain to voters that she had a clear plan for confronting the threat posed by Islamic terrorism, and expose her Republican opponents as utterly lacking in experience or credibility on national security.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThere were good reasons for Clinton to let her inner hawk fly. After the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Americans\u2019 concern about a major attack on the nation spiked. A CNN/ORC poll taken after Paris showed that a majority, 53 percent, favored sending ground troops to Iraq or Syria, a remarkable shift from the war-weary sentiment that prevailed during most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The Republican candidates were reaching for apocalyptic metaphors to demonstrate their resolve. Ted Cruz threatened to carpet-bomb the Islamic State to test whether desert sand can glow; Donald Trump called for the United States to ban all Muslims from entering the country \u201cuntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet such spikes in the public appetite for mili­tary action tend to be transitory. Three weeks later, the same poll showed an even split, at 49 percent, on whether to deploy troops. Neither Trump nor Cruz favors major new deployments of American soldiers to Iraq and Syria (nor, for that matter, does Clinton). If anything, both are more skeptical than Clinton about intervention and more circumspect than she about maintaining the nation\u2019s post-World War II military commitments. Trump loudly proclaims his opposition to the Iraq War. He wants the United States to spend less to underwrite NATO and has talked about withdrawing the American security umbrella from Asia, even if that means Japan and South Korea would acquire nuclear weapons to defend themselves. Cruz, unlike Clinton, opposed aiding the Syrian rebels in 2014. He once supported Pentagon budget constraints advocated by his isolationist colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Thus might the gen­eral election present voters with an unfamiliar choice: a Democratic hawk versus a Republican reluctant warrior.\u000a\u000aTo thwart the progressive insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton carefully calibrated her message during the Democratic primaries to align herself closely with Barack Obama and his racially diverse coalition. But as she pivots to the general election, that balancing act with Obama will become trickier. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge amount of interest in the press to score-keep,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cIt just so easily can become a sport that distracts from her ability to make an affirmative case.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn showing her stripes as a prospective commander in chief, Clinton will no doubt draw heavily upon her State Department experience \u2014 filtering the lessons she learned in Libya, Syria and Iraq into the sinewy worldview she has held since childhood. Last fall, in a series of policy speeches, Clinton began limning distinctions with the president on national security. She said the United States should consider sending more special-operations troops to Iraq than Obama had committed, to help the Iraqis and Kurds fight the Islamic State. She came out in favor of a partial no-fly zone over Syria. And she described the threat posed by ISIS to Americans in starker terms than he did. As is often the case with Clinton and Obama, the differences were less about direction than degree. She wasn\u2019t calling for ground troops in the Middle East, any more than he was. Clinton insisted her plan was not a break with his, merely an \u201cintensification and acceleration\u201d of it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an open question how well Clinton\u2019s hawkish instincts match the country\u2019s mood. Americans are weary of war and remain suspicious of foreign entanglements. And yet, after the retrenchment of the Obama years, there is polling evidence that they are equally dissatisfied with a portrait of their country as a spent force, managing its decline amid a world of rising powers like China, resurgent empires like Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and lethal new forces like the Islamic State. If Obama\u2019s minimalist approach was a necessary reaction to the maximalist style of his predecessor, then perhaps what Americans yearn for is something in between \u2014 the kind of steel-belted pragmatism that Clinton has spent a lifetime honing.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has made some tough decisions,\u201d says Leon Panetta, who served as Obama\u2019s defense secretary after Bob Gates, and as director of the C.I.A. before David Petraeus. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a mixed record, and the concern is, the president defining what America\u2019s role in the world is in the 21st century hasn\u2019t happened.\u000a\u000a\u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll do it,\u201d he added, acknowledging the time Obama has left. \u201cCertainly, she would.\u201d

aVClose, but no cigar.\u000a\u000aEvidently on a historical roll, Trump fast-forwards to Hitler\u2019s invasion of Russia 129 years later. \u201cSame thing happened to Hitler,\u201d President Trump declares. \u201cNot for that reason, though.\u201d With a 1,000-year Reich to build, there\u2019s apparently limited time for the extracurricular.\u000a\u000aHistory, for Trump, is principally a vast murky backdrop against which to declare his every act and utterance the greatest since time began. That is what history\u2019s for. He had a meal with Macron at the Eiffel Tower and \u201cthe bottom of the Eiffel Tower looked like they could have never had a bigger celebration ever in the history of the Eiffel Tower.\u201d\u000a\u000aWell, some people showed up in the streets for the liberation of Paris in 1944, but, as we know from his inauguration, Trump is an authority on comparative crowd sizes.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Well, there was President John F. Kennedy\u2019s speech in Berlin in 1963 when he declared in the then-divided city: \u201cAll free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words, Ich bin ein Berliner.\u201d\u000a\u000aKennedy also said: \u201cFreedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free. When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch ideas in the mouth of a president, like Trump, who delights in the company of autocrats, would be little short of grotesque. There is a difference between knowledge of history \u2014 the sense of the sweep of time and the power of the American idea that enabled Kennedy to make that prediction about a unified Berlin and a unified European continent \u2014 and mouthing about history.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aTrump, of course, has also addressed American history, suggesting that Andrew Jackson was alive at the time of the Civil War (he\u2019d been dead for 16 years). Turning to Asia, he declared that \u201cKorea actually used to be a part of China,\u201d a wild distortion that infuriated an ally, South Korea.\u000a\u000aFar from a student of history, Trump is an ahistorical president at a time of historical geostrategic shifts. This is a problem. He cannot gauge our times because his only gauge is his own self-exaltation.\u000a\u000aAs William Burns, the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former deputy secretary of state, said in a speech in May: \u201ca nasty brew of mercantilism, unilateralism and unreconstructed nationalism\u201d has bubbled to the surface under Trump. \u201cAt a moment when international order is under severe strain, power is fragmenting and great-power rivalry has returned, the values and purpose at the core of the American idea matter more than ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aNapoleon and Hitler stumbled into disastrous campaigns in Russia. Before the United States stumbles into a disastrous war with Iran, the president might read some history: About the C.I.A.-assisted coup of 1953 that deposed Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, about the brutal Savak secret police of the American-backed shah, about Western support for Saddam Hussein and his use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, about the American shooting-down of an Iran Air civilian flight with the loss of 290 lives.\u000a\u000aHistory is no joke. It\u2019s on the curriculum because it is only through it that the psyches of other nations can be understood and wars averted.

aVTEL AVIV \u2014 Meetings between the Palestinian Authority and American delegates led by President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner are \u201ca waste of time,\u201d Dr. Wasel Abu Yousef, director of the Palestinian Liberation Front and member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization\u2019s (PLO) Executive Committee, told Breitbart Jerusalem.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe meeting planned for Thursday with government delegates who are coming to advance the political process is just another meeting in an effort to buy time,\u201d claimed Yousef. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time and we aren\u2019t seeing any declaration or clear statements from the American delegation regarding Palestinian demands.\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aKushner is currently leading a delegation to the Middle East that includes Jason Greenblatt, envoy for international negotiations, and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell. The three are in Cairo on Wednesday and are due in Israel on Thursday for meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.\u000a\u000aAccording to Yousef, the Palestinians intend to present the Americans once again with their position demanding the creation of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders \u201cand the cessation of the settlements, which are an ongoing war crime against the Palestinians.\u201d\u000a\u000aYousef glossed over the fact that the Palestinians turned down previous statehood offers by Israel and that PA President Mahmoud Abbas failed to respond to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s settlement freezes, which were enacted as gestures to jumpstart Israeli-Palestinian talks.\u000a\u000aThe Palestinian official, meanwhile, criticized the American government, saying, \u201cMore than six months since the beginning of the new administration, they haven\u2019t presented any new ideas. And despite the 19 meetings that have taken place between administration representatives and the Palestinians, nothing has happened besides the waste of time that\u2019s characterized these six months.\u201d\u000a\u000aYousef added, \u201cUntil now, American administration representatives have not clarified what Trump\u2019s vision is regarding this historic deal and what solution they see to the Palestinian issue. The Palestinians told the Americans that the basis of negotiations isn\u2019t clear and that it\u2019s a UN resolution that decided that the territories captured in \u201967 are occupied territories upon which a Palestinian country will be created with Jerusalem as its capital.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe 1967 borders refer to the entire West Bank, Gaza Strip and eastern Jerusalem, including Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, which includes the Western Wall and Temple Mount.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil now, there has been no serious discussion of this with the Americans, or of the need to stop the settlements at a time when the Israelis continue to establish facts on the ground.\u201d\u000a\u000aYousef called on the Palestinians \u201cto stop gambling on the American position, which is biased in favor of the occupation. It would be an illusion to trust the Americans in the shadow of their strategic alliance with the occupation, an alliance in which they give the occupation support politically, militarily and economically.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Palestinians are aspiring to reach a situation in which American will not be the sole patron and mediator in the Middle East peace process, Yousef revealed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because our understanding is that the Americans are wasting time, as they\u2019ve done constantly in recent years,\u201d he claimed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Americans have adopted the Israeli outlook that the conflict must be managed rather than acting to solve it. In this mindset, and as they waste time, they talk about the big deal between Israel and the Arab world and the trust-building economic steps they\u2019ll give the Palestinians. All this is a waste of time.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe enraged Palestinian official continued by spewing unfounded anti-Israel conspiracies: \u201cWe don\u2019t want economic and humanitarian mitigation. We want to see an end to the occupation so that its crimes, manifested in the killing of innocents, the destruction of homes and the Judaization of Palestinian cities through the expansion of settlements come to an end.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite his critical comments, however, Yousef said he believes that Trump wants to reach a political solution, \u201cbut he undermines this by adopting all the positions of the occupation and by defending its interests, especially when the Israeli position dodges the idea of two states the entire way and tries to give the Palestinians an existence divided into cantons and to run an apartheid regime within this existence.\u201d No such apartheid regime exists.\u000a\u000aYousef went on to call for unity with the Hamas terrorist group and called for \u201cpopular resistance\u201d against Israel, a euphemism for terrorism. \u201cThe Palestinians need to adopt a clear strategy that tries to handle the challenges,\u201d he told Breitbart Jerusalem. \u201cIn this context, we must reach an internal Palestinian reconciliation with Hamas and reorganize the Palestinian front because this is the way, together with the popular resistance, to deal with the occupation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen that unity and the popular struggle succeeded in overwhelming the occupation and preventing it from forcing hegemony on the Al Aqsa Mosque,\u201d he continued. \u201cReconciliation and internal organization of the Palestinian front in the name of dealing with the occupation must be the top priority of the Palestinian leadership. This will also strengthen the Palestinian position in any future political negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aYousef said he believes that reconciliation with Hamas does not contradict the Palestinians\u2019 commitment to the political process. \u201cThe national reconciliation document signed by Hamas in 2006 already gives the PLO the authority to conduct political negotiations,\u201d he concluded. He conveniently ignored that Hamas\u2019s charter calls for the destruction of Israel.

aVLess than a month after UN Security Council adopted new sanctions against North Korea and just eight days after the New York Times featured an analysis claiming that Pyongyang had sourced the engines for its new liquid-fueled intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBM) in the former Soviet Union (it likely did not), North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited a chemical materials institute.\u000a\u000aOfficially described as the Chemical Material Institute of the Academy of Defense Science, Kim\u2019s visit earlier this week was likely intended to demonstrate that North Korea is no longer the kind of perpetually underestimated \u201cfourth-rate pipsqueak power,\u201d as former U.S. President Richard Nixon once put it. (The two ICBM flight-tests in July, apparently, were insufficient in driving home this point.)\u000a\u000aInstead of importing its inventory of advanced ICBM engines from abroad and instead of being unable to perfect critical technologies like reentry vehicle nosecones, Kim\u2019s visit sought to demonstrate that North Korea was doing just fine manufacturing advanced composite materials for use in its ballistic missiles right at home \u2014 all this despite ever-extensive sanctions against the country.\u000a\u000aA release in North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) detailed Kim\u2019s inspection of the facility. Additionally, KCNA released ten images of Kim\u2019s activities at the institute.\u000a\u000aAccording to KCNA, while at the facility, Kim \u201clearned about the processes for manufacturing ICBM warhead tip and solid-fuel rocket engine (sic).\u201d One accompanying image showed Kim holding and examining what appeared to be a nosecone for a ballistic missile reentry vehicle.\u000a\u000aKim additionally examined various processes associated with carbon fiber and wound filament rocket casing manufacturing \u2014 comparatively advanced technologies to what North Korea has been using to date that will one day facilitate the development of better-performing liquid fuel missiles and larger solid fuel missiles. Pyongyang currently has two strategic missile systems that use solid propellants \u2014 the Pukkuksong-1 (KN11) submarine-launched ballistic missile and the Pukkuksong-2 (KN15) medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), a land-based version of the SLBM, effectively. (Solid propellants are also, as expected, used in many of North Korea\u2019s close-range ballistic missiles and surface-to-air systems.)\u000a\u000aKCNA\u2019s associated images showed Kim examining various displays and machines related to this kind of indigenous manufacturing. If there was a message for the outside world from this visit, it was likely that North Korea not only can manufacture its liquid propellant engines at home, as the United States intelligence community already suspects, but it can also manufacture advanced materials that will ensure that the Hwasong-12 (KN17) intermediate-range ballistic missile Hwasong-14 (KN20) ICBM first test in July are merely the start of what could be a diverse and deadly suite of long-range missiles.\u000a\u000aOne image from KCNA\u2019s release of ten (pictured above) from this visit stood out to long-time North Korea watchers, who immediately took notice on Twitter. In this image, Kim Jong-un is seen standing in a room at the Chemical Material Institute, flanked by two graphical displays.\u000a\u000aPukkuksong-3\u000a\u000aOne display contains the first known evidence of the existence of a missile known as the Pukkuksong-3 \u2014 the third in North Korea\u2019s Pukkuksong (or \u2018Polaris\u2019) series of two-stage, solid-fueled missiles. From the display in the image, the Pukkuksong-3 appears to also be a two-stage, solid-fuel missile, likely destined for use on board the Gorae-class submarine at the Sinpo shipyard.\u000a\u000aThe existence of a new North Korean submarine-launched ballistic missile is not surprising. U.S. government sources with knowledge of the latest intelligence on North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile programs told The Diplomat earlier this summer that North Korea had carried out repeated land-based ejection tests at the Sinpo shipyard. Four known tests took place on May 30, July 18, July 25, and July 30, for example.\u000a\u000aThe ejection tests may not have involved the Pukkuksong-3 itself, which may remain a developmental concept. However, one source told The Diplomat that U.S. military intelligence identified a new launch tube at the Sinpo shipyard, near the Gorae-class submarine.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea likely has changes planned for the launch tubes on its lone ballistic missile submarine and may intend to test this new system soon. Earlier in August, prior to North Korea\u2019s threats against Guam, U.S. government sources had told The Diplomat that a new SLBM flight test was assessed to be likely. Activity at Sinpo, however, has comparatively cooled down in recent weeks compared to earlier this summer.\u000a\u000aThe Pukkuksong-3, if it uses advanced materials including wound filament casing like that seen on a Pukkuksong-1 mock-up at North Korea\u2019s April 15 parade, could demonstrate significantly greater performance. It remains unclear if North Korea has modified the casing for its existing inventory of Pukkuksong-1 and Pukkuksong-2 solid fuel missiles, both of which could see range extensions with more efficient airframe materials.\u000a\u000aThe potential existence of a Pukkuksong-3, assuming North Korea\u2019s poster wasn\u2019t intended as disinformation, is bad news. If Pyongyang keeps to the trend so far with its Pukkuksong series, we may see a Pukkuksong-4 one day \u2014 a solid fuel, canisterized, two-stage sibling with potentially intermediate-range capabilities. Indeed, the survivability advantages of solid fuel missiles on land, combined with North Korea\u2019s newfound ability to manufacture integrated transporter-erector-launcher chassis indigenously, make this logic compelling for Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aHwasong-13\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s potentially worse news than the existence of a Pukkuksong-3 SLBM, however, is found on the other wall in that same image. Under Kim Jong-un\u2019s literal shadow on the opposite wall, we can see a diagram outlining the Hwasong-13 \u2014 a three-stage ICBM. If that designation sounds familiar, it\u2019s because the missile may not be new at all.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-13 was first paraded in 2012 and came to be known by the United States intelligence community as the KN08. Its parade configuration was a three-stage design, assumed at the time to be based on a liquid propellant design. North Korea introduced a second missile known as the Hwasong-13 (the Hwasong-13 mod 2; erroneously called the Hwasong-14 by some sources prior to the July 2017 ICBM\u2019s introduction) at a parade in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe diagram seen next to Kim in the image released this week could be the older three-stage liquid fuel KN08 ICBM or it could be a newer mod, based on a solid fuel design for the three stages. North Korea has used the name Hwasong-13 for different ICBMs already and the institute where Kim examined this diagram did specialize in solid propellants.\u000a\u000aMoreover, at this year\u2019s parade on April 15 in Pyongyang, North Korea showed off four of its China-sourced WS51200-based transporter-erector-launchers featuring ICBM-sized canisters and a separate mobile-erector-launcher (MEL) also featuring an ICBM-sized canister resembling China\u2019s DF-31.\u000a\u000aAnalysts were divided over whether these systems were simply empty mock-ups, designed to suggest a level of sophistication that North Korea\u2019s program was still far from reaching; but now, it appears that the programmatic aspirations represented in those massive ICBM canisters are very much a part of North Korea\u2019s near-term ballistic missile development plans. (One of the MELs was seen again, with Kim Jong-un, in a slideshow on North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program shown at a concert to celebrate the first Hwasong-14 ICBM launch this year.)\u000a\u000aEven if the missile on that diagram is just the older liquid-fueled KN08, this week\u2019s image serves as some evidence that North Korea remains interested in that missile, which has yet to see flight testing. In other words, despite the successful flight testing of the Hwasong-14, North Korea has not given up on or deprecated its older ICBM design. Instead, it may look to field a diverse arsenal, comprising multiple ICBMs. Before this image, the last serious evidence that the KN08 was still an active program came in April 2016, when North Korea tested a large liquid propellant engine that has yet to be seen in any ballistic missile, but appeared compatible with the KN08.\u000a\u000aAll this does raise one question: why would North Korea, a resource-constrained new nuclear state, continue to pursue two different liquid-fueled ICBM designs when just one done well and deployed widely would do for deterrent purposes? The answers are left open to speculation for now.\u000a\u000aThere could be a mundane bureaucratic explanation, such as the existence of competing teams of scientists and engineers vying for Kim Jong-un\u2019s approval. Alternatively, there could be a technical explanation. Perhaps North Korean engineers working with the RD-250-variant engine found in the Hwasong-14 experienced breakthroughs while Hwasong-13 development stalled. Either way, the Hwasong-14 emerged seemingly out of the blue this year, catching analysts off guard while the Hwasong-13 is a familiar face.\u000a\u000aSolids Are Hard\u000a\u000aThe sliver of good news here is that large solid propellant ballistic missiles are remarkably difficult to do well and reliably, even if North Korea is showing signs of having overcome some of the more difficult obstacles already. Unlike liquid propellant missiles, solid fuel is cast directly into the rocket casing, requiring the casing itself to withstand far greater stresses than would be necessary with a liquid propellant design, where the fuel and oxidizer burn in a contained combustion chamber.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, while solid fuel confers important survivability advantages and enables exceptional mobility, poorly manufactured solid fuel rockets can fail at unacceptably high rates for the user. Errors during the casting process can introduce small \u201cbubbles\u201d or cracks into the propellant grain ensuring catastrophic failure during flight.\u000a\u000aMoreover, changes in temperature during storage of even well-cast solid propellant can introduce warping. Finally, environmental shocks in handling and moving these missiles can also introduce problems.\u000a\u000aThese problems were well-known to the Soviet Union, which mastered the kinds of advanced composite materials that North Korea is now exploring for its arsenal of road-mobile ICBMs. More experienced programs than North Korea\u2019s continue to face challenges with solid propellant missiles too. Consider that just earlier this year, even India saw one of its Agni-II solid-fuel medium-range ballistic missiles fail early in flight, likely due to problems with the propellant grain in the specific unit chosen for flight trials.\u000a\u000aWhat the Future Holds\u000a\u000aNone of this is to underestimate North Korea, however. If the past 30 months of developmental activity in their ballistic missile program have taught us anything, it\u2019s that North Korea can and will cross important milestones sooner than the outside world might think they would. That\u2019s perhaps the \u201csurprise\u201d in all of the above: not that North Korea is looking into long-range solid propellant systems, but that it may be considerably further along than many thought.\u000a\u000aWhile the above analysis may seem in-the-weeds on the technical details of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program, this kind of programmatic signaling has value for Pyongyang. North Korea is seeking an opening with the United States for comprehensive talks and has laid the groundwork for an opening most recently with an attempt at coercive bargaining by threatening a strike at the waters near Guam.\u000a\u000aBy any measure, these images of Kim inspecting an institute specializing in solid propellants and wound filament missile casings serve a similar purpose: North Korea demonstrates a credible interest in high-performance, long-range, solid fuel rockets.\u000a\u000aIf Kim Jong-un is allowed to proceed uninhibited, he will soon, no doubt, begin testing both more advanced solid-fuel SLBMs and, eventually, ICBMs, rendering the already unacceptably risky task of preemption by South Korea and the United States entirely unrealistic.\u000a\u000aAnd so, there\u2019s a simple bottom line to all this from Pyongyang\u2019s perspective: the United States should talk to us soon, before we figure out how to operationalize a more capable solid fuel missile-based nuclear force capable of striking U.S. forces in the region and, eventually, the U.S. homeland.\u000a\u000aAnkit Panda is a senior editor at The Diplomat, where he writes on international security, politics, and economics.

aVHow partisan Twitter users saw and shared different narratives of Charlottesville and the aftermath.\u000a\u000aAfter violence erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, media coverage differed on what aspect of the event to cover.\u000a\u000aUsing analyses from Cortico and the Laboratory for Social Machines at the MIT Media Lab, we looked at what partisan Twitter users shared during and after the events of Charlottesville. We found a clear split in the story as told through partisan sources.\u000a\u000aTake, for example, the shared headlines following President Donald Trump\u2019s news conference on Aug. 15 in Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aOn each side, one publication dominated the conversation. The New York Times and Breitbart, represented 32 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of the top links shared by each camp.\u000a\u000aOther stories broke through both sides, such as Vice\u2019s viral documentary on the events in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aThe data targets Twitter users with clear political allegiances \u2014 specifically, politically active users that exclusively followed either a Republican or Democratic 2016 presidential candidate. The top stories shared by both camps each day from Saturday, Aug. 12, through Wednesday, Aug. 16, show the political lines drawn between core supporters of Trump and the administration\u2019s staunchest detractors.\u000a\u000aOutside major media headlines, core Republicans were more likely to share videos, while Democrats were more likely to share petitions.\u000a\u000aFor example, Republicans widely shared a video conversation between Faith Goldy, reporting for Canadian hard-line conservative outlet, Rebel Media, and nationalist podcaster, Stefan Molyneux. In the video, Goldy describes violence by counter-protesters, \u201cI saw some [Black Lives Matter] folks and just young black men throwing rocks at former veterans.\u201d To date, the video has more than 330,000 views.\u000a\u000aDemocrats shared petitions targeting Steve Bannon and asking the Justice Department to file terrorism charges against the driver of the vehicle that killed Heather Heyer.\u000a\u000aDespite the split narratives between Trump\u2019s core supporters and Democrats, the effect on the voting base has been less conflicted. The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows the administration bungled the response in the eyes of many Republican voters, where support for the president fell 8 points last week.

aVGetty Images 1600 Penn What Becomes of the Broken-Hearted Trump Fans? It\u2019s the biggest question in American politics: When the president inevitably fails to keep his promises, where do his voters go?\u000a\u000aPolitics, as the late Bart Giamatti once said of baseball, \u201cis designed to break your heart.\u201d Sooner or later, everyone elected to the highest office in the land will act in a way that crushes the truest of believers, who were convinced that this time they had found a leader impervious to the powerful currents of compromise, strong enough not to abandon core principles.\u000a\u000aThis is why it\u2019s hard not to feel a pang of sympathy for those who believed that Donald Trump\u2019s years of opposition to foreign entanglements would actually lead to the reversal of decades of often disastrous interventions in every corner of the world. On Monday night, they heard him wrap the betrayal of their fondest hopes in the very rhetoric that had convinced them he would take their side.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOnce Trump had finished his effort to clean up the wreckage of his Charlottesville comments (\u201cWhen we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry and no tolerance for hate\u201d), he presented his all-new, completely improved, more-or-less-indistinguishable-from-the-previous-administration\u2019s-policy wrapped up in words that implied a sharp break from his predecessors.\u000a\u000a"We are not nation-building; we are killing terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars, at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting \u2026 India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development.\u201d In these and other words, Trump was offering a watered-down version of the much more blunt \u201cAmerica First\u201d language of his inaugural address, when he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we\u2019ve defended other nation\u2019s borders while refusing to defend our own.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe policy, however, brought to mind a line from The Who\u2019s \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again\u201d: \u201cMeet the new boss; same as the old boss.\u201d A few thousand more Americans put in harm\u2019s way; a stern warning to Pakistan to curb its support for Al Qaeda; the same stern warning to Afghanistan to root out government corruption in a land where corruption is and has been the driving force for generations, the repeated promise that \u201cwe will win\u201d with no real definition of what winning would mean.\u000a\u000aAnd Trump\u2019s one-time true believers weren\u2019t buying what the president was selling.\u000a\u000aBreitbart News, now commanded once again by the banished White House strategist Steve Bannon, was filled with harsh responses.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Trump] Defends Flip-Flop,\u201d one headline said. \u201cHis McMaster\u2019s Voice,\u201d read another, referring to Trump\u2019s national security adviser, a Bannon foe. \u201cPresident H.R. McMaster\u2019s Yuge Foreign Policy Blunder,\u201d read another. And, in the unkindest cut of all, \u201cTrump Echoes Obama\u2019s Blank Check Rhetoric,\u201d complete with a photo of Trump and Obama together.\u000a\u000aBreitbart was not alone. Mike Cernovich, an "alt-right" blogger and conspiracy theorist whose tweets and posts have been unstintingly supportive of Trump, asked simply, \u201cWhy did we even have an election?\u201d The pro-Trump radio host Laura Ingraham asked: \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for it? What is our measure of success? We didn\u2019t win with 100K troops. How will we win with 4,000 more?\u201d Ann Coulter, who may be regretting the title of her recently published book (\u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d) tweeted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you vote for. The military-industrial complex wins. Only difference: GOP presidents pronounce \u2018Pakistan\u2019 correctly.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe unanswered question is: What becomes of the broken-hearted? Will they forgive Trump\u2019s reversal on Afghanistan\u2014a change of mind he actually acknowledged, for what may be the first time ever\u2014if he doubles down on his \u201cnationalist\u201d views of trade and immigration? Will they see him as yet another president captured by the conventional Washington wisdom, which can never seem to figure out a way of disentangling the nation from a foreign conflict? Will they subject his future decisions to a more skeptical inquiry? Will his decision further erode his standing among those who tell pollsters they \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of his presidency?\u000a\u000aThose who saw in Trump a figure who might actually break with the bipartisan consensus of the last half-century-plus had every reason for their optimism. His background, his ego, his very disconnection from any taint of insiderism gave them reason to think that he would actually do what he had said he would do. We don\u2019t know how large this group is, but it contains some of the most fervent and committed Trump supporters. What they now do with their shattered hopes is going to make a very big difference in the coming political wars.\u000a\u000aJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.

"He should have had a jury."\u000a\u000aArpaio was convicted after a bench trial, which means he cannot be sentenced to more than six months in prison. However, the courts have ruled that no jury is required when the punishment imposed is six months or less.\u000a\u000aArpaio's sentencing is set for Oct. 5. He served as Maricopa County sheriff from 1993 through last year, after being defeated in the November election.\u000a\u000aArpaio, who watched the rally on TV at home with his wife, said he hadn\u2019t gotten an indication from the administration that Trump would bring up the topic of a pardon.\u000a\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was going to say anything, but I had a gut feeling, knowing him, that with his courage and guts that he would say something,\u201d Arpaio told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aThe ex-sheriff, known for keeping prisoners in outdoor tents and forcing them to don pink boxer shorts, said he had heard earlier in the day that officials were saying no pardon would be forthcoming Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut the president still brought it up, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Arpaio said \u201cAnd he was very honest. I guess they were concerned about the demonstrators, which is important because you want to make sure the first priority is to the safety of the people that were outside and inside. And also I\u2019m always concerned about the president\u2019s safety.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresidents' clemency powers under the Constitution are virtually unlimited. However, a pardon for Arpaio could further fuel the president\u2019s running feud with the federal judiciary, legal experts said. Not only would Trump be effectively overturning a judge\u2019s verdict, but would be doing so for an offense that involves the judicial branch\u2019s ability to command compliance with judges\u2019 orders.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018in-your-face, court,\u2019\u201d said Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge who now teaches at Harvard Law School. \u201cThis is the kind of charge that goes to the integrity of the process\u2026. Part of the symbol here is of basically not paying respect to an order of a federal judge.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not unlawful, but it says something about his own contempt for the system,\u201d she added.\u000a\u000aUniversity of Pittsburgh law professor Arthur Hellman said some judges could view the pardon as a further provocation.\u000a\u000a\u201cShortcutting the process this way with someone who\u2019s been found to be in contempt of court, I think it would simply reinforce the present low standing of the president with many federal judges \u2014 views which I think are hurting him,\u201d Hellman said.\u000a\u000aDuring the presidential campaign, Trump drew sharp, bipartisan criticism for arguing that a federal judge who is Latino and was handling Trump University fraud litigation was biased because of his ethnic background. Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly blasted judges for rulings against his travel-ban executive order.\u000a\u000aIn one case, the president publicly referred to a jurist who ruled against the administration as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d\u000a\u000aHellman said it\u2019s hard to predict what impact a pardon would have, in part because Trump\u2019s standing with judges is already so poor.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump has already burned many of those bridges with the federal judiciary\u2026..I\u2019m not sure whether this could make things worse, but what is different is this is action, not words,\u201d the professor said.\u000a\u000aHellman said the result of the standoff could be a long-term setback to the authority of federal government lawyers and agencies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tendency on the part of many federal judges to defer to the government has been to some extent wiped out by Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d the professor added. \u201cIt\u2019s not good from a systemic, institutional perspective that federal judges are viewing the president as someone who does not trust them and who, in fact, holds them in contempt.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite Trump\u2019s assurances at the rally, Arpaio declined to say whether he thought the pardon was guaranteed at this point.\u000a\u000a\u201cWell, that\u2019s up to him, so I\u2019m not going to really comment until the situation is finalized,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was very nice what he said about me. Forget the pardon. \u2026 He\u2019s been making those comments for quite a while and I appreciate that he hasn\u2019t forgotten.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump's plans to visit Phoenix stoked speculation that he might pardon Arpaio during the visit. Last week, Trump fueled expectations of a pardon by retweeting a Fox News web story saying that the president was "seriously considering" such a pardon.\u000a\u000aA Justice Department official said Monday that no official application for a pardon for Arpaio had been filed with the department's pardon office. However, Trump is free to ignore that procedure and issue a pardon even without such an application.\u000a\u000aCritics have warned that a pardon for Arpaio would also trigger an angry reaction from many minority communities still incensed about Trump's reaction to the recent violence in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aSome Democrats have also predicted that a pardon for Arpaio would be a prelude to pardons from Trump for figures caught up in the criminal probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u000a\u000aRep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), previewing Trump's visit to Phoenix, said on Monday:L "I would not be surprised if the president does this that it actually has nothing to do with Arpaio, but actually has to with him setting the standard of pardons, so he can eventually start pardoning his family and all of the people within his campaign that helped collaborate with the Russians.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVActress Louise Linton, who married Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in June, posted and then deleted a photo of herself and her husband as they walked off an Air Force jet Monday that was akin to a fashion shoot tagging the designers she was wearing.\u000a\u000aAfter facing criticism from an Instagram user, Linton, who is married to the man who is fifth in the presidential line of succession, responded to the user with a long comment filled with classist attacks. Linton has now taken her Instagram account private, not allowing Instagram users who don\u2019t already follow her to see her account.\u000a\u000aIn the now-deleted post, Linton and Mnuchin are photographed deplaning the military jet (according to Linton\u2019s Instagram post, they were landing in Kentucky), which Mnuchin is required to use for official government travel. The caption on her Instagram post read: \u201cGreat #daytrip to #Kentucky! #nicest #people #beautiful #countryside #rolandmouret pants #tomford sunnies, #hermesscarf #valentinorockstudheels #valentino #usa\u201d\u000a\u000aLouise Linton/Instagram\u000a\u000aLinton has tagged designers she appears to be wearing in previous Instagram posts, but it\u2019s unusual, if not unprecedented, for the spouse of a Cabinet secretary to promote the designers she is wearing in any social media post, much less one that includes a photograph of herself with her husband while on government travel.\u000a\u000aAn Instagram user, called \u201cJenni M,\u201d responded to Linton\u2019s post and said, \u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable\u201d\u000a\u000aLinton\u2019s response to Jenni M came after she appeared to examine Jenni M\u2019s Instagram feed, making note of Jenni M\u2019s family and children.\u000a\u000a\u201c@Jennimiller29 cute!....Aw!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u201ctrip\u201d than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You\u2019re adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute. I know you\u2019re mad but deep down you\u2019re really nice and so am I. Sending me passive aggressive Instagram comments isn\u2019t going to make life feel better. Maybe a nice message, one filled with wisdom and hunanity [SIC] would get more traction. Have a pleasant evening. Go chill out and watch the new game of thrones. It\u2019s fab!\u201d\u000a\u000aLinton on Tuesday released a statement apologizing for her \u201cinappropriate and highly insensitive\u201d Instagram post and her response to Jenni M, according to CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond.\u000a\u000aJust in: Louise Linton apologizes for Instagram post & response to commenter in statement --> pic.twitter.com/Ww22HFQuni \u2014 Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aLinton\u2019s Instagram post comes at a time when her husband is under attack by some of President Donald Trump\u2019s loyalists for his lack of populist credentials. Linton\u2019s out-of-touch post isn\u2019t likely to help Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs executive who served as the finance chair of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aPretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.

In 2016, Linton came under fire for her self-published memoir, In Congo\u2019s Shadow, which detailed her time as a student in Zambia. In July of 2016, Zambians, and their advocates, criticized Linton\u2019s portrayal of Zambia as a war-torn, poverty-stricken nation with wild animals running through the streets. Linton was also criticized for portraying herself as a white savior. Under pressure, Linton withdrew the book from sale and pledged to give any proceeds to charity.

aVWall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker took to internal email this week to carve his initials into his paper\u2019s coverage. | Andrew Burton/Getty Images fourth estate Why I\u2019m not mad at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Gerard Baker The embattled WSJ editor doesn\u2019t fear his newsroom\u2019s wrath. As long as the paper\u2019s Trump coverage keeps his boss happy, he\u2019s invincible.\u000a\u000aEven at the happiest newspapers, the job of top editor demands the skills of a lion tamer. All those clashing newsroom egos to referee, endless publisher temper-tantrums to douse, fickle readers to pamper. If an editor has an editorial vision\u2014and even the sightless ones do\u2014she must sell and resell that vision daily because (and there is no other way to put it) reporters are wild animals who have their own fixed ideas on where and how to hunt. And they bite.\u000a\u000aWhen face-to-face persuasion, demotions and invitations to leave don\u2019t tame the staff, editors rely on more subtle methods. Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker, who has resorted to all of the above, took to internal email this week to carve his initials into his paper\u2019s coverage.\u000a\u000a\u201cSorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting,\u201d Baker emailed a group of staffers just after midnight Wednesday about the first draft of a Journal story on President Donald Trump\u2019s Phoenix rally. \u201cCould we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?\u201d\u000a\u000aBaker\u2019s emails and the Phoenix draft were promptly leaked to the New York Times, which annotated the changes made to the final, published copy. This wasn\u2019t the first time Baker\u2019s flexing made news. In June 2016, Baker caught fire when POLITICO\u2019s Joe Pompeo reported he had urged editors to be \u201cfair\u201d to Trump. Pompeo wrote, \u201cThe [Wall Street Journal] source described Baker\u2019s Trump talk as a \u2018surreal tangent\u2019 in a meeting normally reserved for ironing out the logistics of covering the day\u2019s top stories. The source also said the comments were widely discussed among Journal editors and bureau chiefs, some of whom took them as an insult or admonition.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot calling Trump a liar and snipping news analysis from pieces does not automatically equal shilling.\u000a\u000aIn January of this year before the inauguration, in a Journal op-ed, Baker defended his reluctance to use the words \u201clie\u201d and \u201cliar\u201d in assessing Trump\u2019s statements. Conceding Trump\u2019s habit of telling \u201cwhoppers of the first order,\u201d Baker wrote that he was reluctant to accuse anyone of lying because that requires a high level of confidence \u201cabout the subject\u2019s state of knowledge and his moral intent.\u201d Not my standard, not the New York Times\u2019, and maybe not yours either, but Baker\u2019s stand is defensible. While not banning the use of the word \u201clie,\u201d he stated a preference for setting out the facts for readers and allowing them to determine whether a politician was lying or not.\u000a\u000aLater that January week, Pompeo reported that \u201cgrowing newsroom discontent\u201d over Baker\u2019s Trump directives had necessitated a Journal town hall, in which the editor in chief told staffers they could shove off if they thought the paper had been soft on the president. Related to Baker\u2019s views or not, a talent exodus has ensued, with Journal lions like Rebecca Blumenstein, Adam Entous, Devlin Barrett, Tamer El-Ghobashy and others moving to other circuses.\u000a\u000aHas the Journal protected Trump? That was David Leonhardt\u2019s interpretation in a February New York Times op-ed. \u201cThe headlines often tend toward stenography,\u201d he wrote. \u201cReporters and editors have become accustomed to the \u2018shaving off the edges\u2019 of Trump-related stories, one said, especially in headlines and initial paragraphs.\u201d Baker did the Journal no favor on this score when he ran only parts of his paper\u2019s interview with Trump in July, and a leaker released the warts-and-all full transcript to Politico, which published it.\u000a\u000aComplicating any assessment of Baker\u2019s editorial philosophy is, of course, the fact that Rupert Murdoch owns the Journal, supports Trump and, as Times reporter Maggie Haberman tells us, talks to the president nearly every day. Given Murdoch\u2019s history with phoning his editors almost daily, he must ring Baker daily, too. You don\u2019t have to connect the dots, Baker critics say, the dots connect themselves, and they glow.\u000a\u000aAs a practiced Murdoch critic, I\u2019m fully aware that the mogul routinely uses his outlets\u2014Fox News Channel, the Times of London, the New York Post, the Australian, The Sun and others\u2014to steer politics in his direction. So I\u2019ve got no quarrel with anyone who wants to build an argument, based on Baker\u2019s editorial stands, that his Journal shills for Trump at Murdoch\u2019s behest. But to fully convince me, you\u2019ll have to show me what is there, as opposed to what is not there in the paper that ends up plumping for Trump. Not calling Trump a liar and snipping news analysis from pieces does not automatically equal shilling. You can call it conservative coverage. You can call it soft. But you can\u2019t call it shilling.\u000a\u000aIn many ways, Baker\u2019s newsroom fights parallel the one fought by A.M. Rosenthal of the New York Times during his tenure (1969-1986) as the paper\u2019s top editor. Rosenthal treated his newsroom like the enemy, thinking that the only way to keep the news pages \u201cstraight\u201d was to discipline it. He fulminated every time reporters imposed their political views on stories. For example, when a 1979 piece about Woodstock\u2019s 10th anniversary called the event a symbol of \u201cnational, cultural, and political awakening,\u201d he went bonkers. As Edwin Diamond writes in his 1993 book Behind the Times, Rosenthal called the copy desk to excise what he called the \u201cvacuous politicalization\u201d from the piece. The imposition of such austere standards made Rosenthal unpopular in the newsroom and led to his expulsion.\u000a\u000aIf the journalism gods extract a price from newspapers that pursue antiseptic political coverage, perhaps the Journal\u2019s paucity of Trump scoops constitutes payback.\u000a\u000aBaker, on the other hand, need not worry about expulsion. Staff rebellions mean nothing at a Murdoch property as long as the top editor maintains Murdoch\u2019s confidence. I suspect if you held a newsroom vote today, the Journal staff would send Baker packing. But how do you imagine Murdoch responded when he read that Baker admonished his team to be \u201cfair\u201d to Trump, banned the use of the word \u201clie\u201d and trimmed news analysis out from the Phoenix rally story? He probably issued Baker a bonus each time. If I were a bigger cynic, I\u2019d accuse Baker of self-leaking all of the stories above to shore up his cred with Murdoch.\u000a\u000aIf our real subject is what\u2019s not in the Journal, there\u2019s no escaping the fact that the Washington Post and the New York Times have fanny-whacked the Murdoch paper on the Trump-Russia story. No matter what your politics or your editorial philosophy, this investigation of Russia and the president must be the biggest story of the year. The Journal has spent more time following the news and less breaking it. If the journalism gods extract a price from newspapers that pursue antiseptic political coverage, perhaps the Journal\u2019s paucity of Trump scoops constitutes payback.\u000a\u000aIn the newspaper life, you can assuage the journalism gods or Rupert Murdoch. You can pick only one.\u000a\u000aJack Shafer is POLITICO\u2019s senior media writer.

aVAs CIA director, Mike Pompeo has taken a special interest in an agency unit that is closely tied to the investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, requiring the Counterintelligence Mission Center to report directly to him.\u000a\u000aOfficials at the center have, in turn, kept a watchful eye on Pompeo, who has repeatedly played down Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and demonstrated a willingness to engage in political skirmishes for President Trump.\u000a\u000aCurrent and former officials said that the arrangement has been a source of apprehension among the CIA\u2019s upper ranks and that they could not recall a time in the agency\u2019s history when a director faced a comparable conflict.\u000a\u000a\u201cPompeo is in a delicate situation unlike any other director has faced, certainly in my memory,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a CIA official for 23 years who served in Russia and held high-level positions at headquarters, \u201cbecause of his duty to protect and provide the truth to an independent investigation while maintaining his role with the president.\u201d\u000a\u000a[Obama\u2019s secret struggle to punish Russia for Putin\u2019s election assault]\u000a\u000aWhat is Fusion GPS and did it receive Russian government funds as it investigated Donald Trump? (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aThe Russia issue has complicated Pompeo\u2019s effort to manage a badly strained relationship between the agency and a president who has disparaged its work and compared U.S. intelligence officials to Nazis. Amid that tension, Pompeo\u2019s interactions with the counterintelligence center have come under particular scrutiny.\u000a\u000aThe unit helped trigger the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia by serving as a conduit to the FBI last year for information the CIA developed on contacts between Russian individuals and Trump campaign associates, officials said.\u000a\u000aThe center works more closely with the FBI than almost any other CIA department does, officials said, and continues to pursue leads on Moscow\u2019s election interference operation that could factor in the probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director.\u000a\u000aPompeo has not impeded that work, officials said. But several officials said there is concern about what he might do if the CIA uncovered new information potentially damaging to Trump and Pompeo were forced to choose between protecting the agency or the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople have to watch him,\u201d said a U.S. official who, like others, requested anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if he can\u2019t resist the impulse to be political.\u201d\u000a\u000aA second former CIA official cited a \u201creal concern for interference and politicization,\u201d saying that the worry among some at the agency is \u201cthat if you were passing on something too dicey [to Pompeo] he would go to the White House with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo has attributed his direct supervision of the counterintelligence center to a desire to place a greater emphasis on preventing leaks and protecting classified secrets \u2014 core missions of the center that are also top priorities for Trump.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump dismissed allegations of collusion between his campaign and Russia at a rally in Huntington, W. Va., on Aug. 3. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aHaving the center report to him was designed \u201cto send a signal to the workforce that this was important and we weren\u2019t going to tolerate misbehavior,\u201d he said at a security conference in Aspen, Colo., last month.\u000a\u000aCIA spokesman Ryan Trapani described the suggestion that Pompeo might abuse his position as \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u000a\u000aExecutive-order guidelines prohibit the CIA from passing information to the White House \u201cfor the purpose of affecting the political process in the United States,\u201d Trapani said. \u201cThe FBI and special counsel\u2019s office are leading the law enforcement investigation into this matter \u2014 not CIA. CIA is providing relevant information in support of that investigation, and neither the director nor CIA will interfere with it.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo, 53, arrived as director at the CIA just days after Trump delivered a self-aggrandizing post-inaugural speech at agency headquarters. Appearing before a wall of carved granite stars that commemorate CIA officers killed in the line of duty, Trump used the occasion to browbeat the media and make false claims about the size of his inauguration crowds.\u000a\u000aPompeo has worked to overcome that inauspicious start, winning over many in the CIA workforce with his vocal support for aggressive intelligence gathering, his command of complex global issues and his influence at the White House. Pompeo spends several hours there almost every day, according to officials who said he has developed a strong rapport with the president.\u000a\u000aBut Pompeo is also known for berating subordinates, aggressively challenging agency analysts and displaying the fierce partisanship that became his signature while serving as a GOP member of Congress.\u000a\u000aWhen asked about Russian election interference, Pompeo often becomes testy and recites talking points that seem designed to appease a president who rejects the allegations as \u201cfake news\u201d conjured by Democrats to delegitimize his election win.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is true\u201d that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, Pompeo said at Aspen, \u201cand the one before that, and the one before that . . . \u201d\u000a\u000aThe phrasing, which Pompeo has repeated in other settings, casts last year\u2019s events as an unremarkable continuation of a long-standing pattern, rather than the unprecedented Kremlin operation described in a consensus report that the CIA and other agencies released in January.\u000a\u000aRussia\u2019s intervention in 2016 represented \u201ca significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort,\u201d the report concluded. Its goal went beyond seeking to discredit U.S. democratic processes, the report said, and in the end was aimed at trying \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo has taken more hawkish positions on other areas of tension with Russia, saying that Moscow intervened in Syria, for example, in part because \u201cthey love to stick it to America.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlmost all CIA directors have had to find ways to manage a supposedly apolitical spy agency while meeting the demands of a president. But Trump, who has fired his FBI chief and lashed out at his attorney general over the Russia probe, appears to expect a particularly personal brand of loyalty.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is always a balancing act between a director\u2019s access to the president and the need to protect CIA\u2019s sensitive equities,\u201d said John Sipher, a former senior CIA official who also served in Russia. \u201cPompeo clearly has a more difficult challenge in maintaining that balance than his predecessors given the obvious concerns with this president\u2019s unique personality, obsession with charges against him, lack of knowledge and tendency to take impulsive action.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo has shown a willingness to handle political assignments for the White House. Earlier this year, he and other officials were enlisted to make calls to news organizations \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity \u2014 to dispute a New York Times article about contacts between Russians and individuals tied to the Trump campaign. Pompeo has never publicly acknowledged his involvement in that effort.\u000a\u000aHe has also declined to address whether he was approached by Trump earlier this year \u2014 as other top intelligence officials were \u2014 to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion with Russia or to intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to urge the FBI to back off its investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\u000a\u000aPompeo has, by all accounts, a closer relationship with Trump than others who did field such requests, including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers.\u000a\u000aPompeo was exposed to Trump\u2019s wrath over the Russia investigation on at least one occasion, officials said. He was among those present for a meeting at the White House earlier this year when Trump began complaining about the probe and, in front of Pompeo and others, asked what could be done about it.\u000a\u000aTrapani, the CIA spokesman, declined to address the matter or say whether Pompeo has been questioned about it by Mueller. Pompeo\u2019s conversations with Trump \u201care entitled to confidentiality,\u201d Trapani said, adding that \u201cthe director has never been asked by the president to do anything inappropriate.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo spends more time at the White House than his recent CIA predecessors and is seen as more willing to engage in policy battles. In interviews and public appearances, Pompeo has advocated ousting the totalitarian regime in North Korea, accused the Obama administration of \u201cinviting\u201d Russia into Syria and criticized the nuclear accord with Iran.\u000a\u000aPompeo has also come under scrutiny on social issues. As part of an effort to expand chaplain services to CIA employees \u2014 which Trapani said was in response to requests from the agency workforce \u2014 Pompeo has consulted with Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled an anti-gay hate group. Perkins has described that characterization as \u201creckless.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Trump came under criticism for failing to specifically condemn Nazi sympathizers taking part in protests in Charlottesville \u2014 instead lamenting violence by \u201cmany sides\u201d \u2014 Pompeo defended the president in a CBS interview, saying that Trump\u2019s condemnation of bigotry was \u201cfrankly pretty unambiguous.\u201d\u000a\u000aPompeo inherited an agency that had undergone a major reorganization under his predecessor, combing analysts and operators in a constellation of \u201ccenters\u201d responsible for geographic regions, as well as transnational issues such as terrorism.\u000a\u000aPompeo\u2019s alterations have been minimal. He added two centers \u2014 one devoted to North Korea and the other to Iran. All but the counterintelligence unit fall under Pompeo\u2019s deputy on the CIA organizational chart.\u000a\u000aPompeo, who met with Russian intelligence officials in Moscow in May, would have been entitled to full briefings from the counterintelligence center even without making that bureaucratic tweak. But asserting more control of the unit responsible for preventing leaks probably pleased Trump, who has accused U.S. spy agencies of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his presidency.\u000a\u000aU.S. intelligence officials have disputed that spy agencies are behind such leaks but acknowledge broader concerns about security issues, pointing to episodes including the CIA\u2019s loss of a vast portion of its hacking arsenal, which was obtained this year by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.\u000a\u000aA descendant of the unit led by legendary CIA mole-hunter James Jesus Angleton, the counterintelligence center is run by a veteran female CIA officer who has served extensively overseas in Europe, East Asia and Russia. She was also one of the main authors of the CIA\u2019s internal review of a deadly suicide bombing that killed seven agency employees in Khost, Afghanistan, in 2009.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think she\u2019s wary about the administration,\u201d said a former colleague who also described her as \u201csomeone who would not fall in line\u201d if she suspected interference in the center\u2019s role. Preventing the center from sharing information with the bureau would be difficult \u2014 an FBI official serves as head of the center\u2019s counterespionage unit.\u000a\u000aLast year, the center played an important part in detecting Russian efforts to cultivate associates of the Trump campaign. Former CIA director John Brennan testified in May that he became \u201cworried by a number of the contacts that the Russians had with U.S. persons\u201d and alerted the FBI.\u000a\u000aThe center has since been enlisted to help answer questions about key moments in the timeline of Trump-Russia contacts, officials said, possibly including the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. held in June with a Russian lawyer.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho sent her on the mission \u2014 was it Russian intelligence or on her own initiative?\u201d a former official said, referring to the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. \u201cMueller can\u2019t do anything on that without the agency.\u201d\u000a\u000aJulie Tate, Adam Entous and Carol D.

aVWARSAW \u2014 Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has stepped up its anti-German rhetoric by declaring Warsaw has a right to billions of dollars in reparations for destruction inflicted by the Nazis in World War II.\u000a\u000aDespite doubts about the claim expressed by parts of the government \u2014 including the foreign ministry and President Andrzej Duda \u2014 PiS is waging an anti-German campaign via friendly media. Right-wing TV channel Republika\u2019s website published an image of the slogan \u201cReparationen machen frei\u201d photoshopped to look like the gate to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where the original inscription read \u201cArbeit macht frei.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe campaign\u2019s inspiration comes from the top: Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the leader of Law and Justice and the most powerful politician in the country, told a party conference in July: \u201cPoland never renounced reparations for World War II. Those who think so are wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000aTop government officials followed through in early August, with Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz supporting the claim. Campaigners\u2019 estimates of how much Germany \u201cowes\u201d Poland vary wildly, with the right-wing weekly Sieci Prawdy demanding $6 trillion in reparations on its cover.\u000a\u000aBerlin noticed the revival of the reparations debate and curtly rejected the claim. In a brief statement, a German government spokeswoman said the issue was \u201cdealt with conclusively in the past.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Polish government has made a practice of looking for foes since coming to power in late 2015 \u2014 and those efforts have helped consolidate the one-third of the electorate that strongly backs the ruling party. Top government officials have demonized asylum seekers, attacked Brussels over its accusations that Poland is backsliding on democratic principles and accused opposition parties of betraying the country to foreigners.\u000a\u000aThe shift to hostility against Germany is the latest gambit for Kaczy\u0144ski, who has long been suspicious of Poland\u2019s powerful neighbor. PiS accuses Berlin of abusing its influence in Brussels to sway the ongoing debate about Poland\u2019s infringement of EU rule of law standards, and Kaczy\u0144ski is gearing up for an attack on German-owned media operations in Poland.\u000a\u000aThe last time the reparations debate flared up was in 2015, when former German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier \u2014 now the country\u2019s head of state \u2014 said the issue had already been \u201clegally and politically resolved.\u201d\u000a\u000aReparations, however, are an emotional issue in Poland and talk of the country\u2019s right to claim money from Germany is unlikely to disappear any time soon. A recent opinion poll found 63 percent of Poles backed the idea.\u000a\u000a\u2018Good neighbors\u2019\u000a\u000aDuring the German wartime occupation, Poland lost a fifth of its population; many towns and cities, including Warsaw, were reduced to rubble. At the postwar Potsdam conference in 1945, the victorious Allies agreed that the Soviet Union would get reparations, and that part of that should be paid to Poland; it\u2019s unlikely Moscow ever did that. In 1953, the Soviet Union decided to forsake any reparations that might impoverish its East German satellite, and communist-ruled Poland followed suit.\u000a\u000aUpon German reunification in 1990, which resulted in a German-Polish \u201cgood neighborhood\u201d treaty one year later, there was a nod to wartime compensation in the form of a 500 million Deutsche mark payment to a foundation in Warsaw and about 2 billion marks paid to Polish victims of Nazi forced labor programs.\u000a\u000aThe reparation camp\u2019s argument is that Poland never really relinquished its claim to German compensation. The communist regime that agreed to forsake reparations in 1953 \u201cwas a Soviet colony,\u201d Macierewicz told Polish state television.\u000a\u000aBut Poland\u2019s former ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Byrt, says it was a sovereign Polish decision not to raise the reparations issue further in the 1990 Polish-German treaty negotiations, when Warsaw\u2019s priority was to guarantee the country\u2019s post-war borders with Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cPoland was a sovereign country then and it decided not to raise the matter,\u201d Byrt told the Onet portal. \u201cAny attempt to open the issue today will harm not only our good relations with Germany but also political interests of the four powers which won the war and which gave up, in a sovereign manner, on German reparations in 1953.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2004, just after joining the EU, the Polish government confirmed it wouldn\u2019t seek reparations.\u000a\u000a\u2018Binding, unilateral act\u2019\u000a\u000aGermany is now a crucial economic partner for Poland, buying a quarter of all Polish exports, and was a key advocate of Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union. Poland\u2019s influence in the EU grew with Germany\u2019s support and Chancellor Angela Merkel was a crucial supporter of former Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk\u2019s candidacy for the presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2014.\u000a\u000aThe compensation issue is opening fissures within the government and within Law and Justice.\u000a\u000aAlthough the bulk of the party strongly supports Kaczy\u0144ski, Duda \u2014 already at odds with PiS for his recent veto of two bills giving the government more power over the judiciary \u2014 has been more circumspect.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt cannot be decided in a public debate and we must find strong legal grounds for it,\u201d said Krzysztof Szczerski, the president\u2019s cabinet chief.\u000a\u000aThe president deferred to the foreign ministry, which gave its position last week. Deputy Minister Marek Magierowski said Poland stood by the decision taken by the communist government in 1953.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo matter how we consider the matter today, the Polish legal doctrine is inclined to a position that the statement of 1953 is a binding, unilateral act of the state of Poland,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWithin a day, the ministry backtracked, saying Magierowski was simply describing the current state of affairs. \u201cThe possibility of seeking reparations claims needs further analysis,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that the ministry, \u201calong with other Polish government institutions, is studying the problem in question.\u201d

aVIn his Afghanistan speech this week, President Donald Trump announced that while his \u201coriginal instinct was to pull out,\u201d he will nonetheless be sending more American troops\u2014it wasn\u2019t clear how many\u2014into the country. \u201cSince the founding of our republic,\u201d Trump said, \u201cAmerican patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, for all his lofty rhetoric, Trump might come to regret this decision. In a recently released research paper, we examined the relationship between states\u2019 and counties\u2019 casualty rates in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their electoral support for Trump. What we found was a significant correlation between war casualty rates and Trump votes. In fact, we think three states key to Trump\u2019s victory\u2014Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014might have swung the other way if they\u2019d had even modestly lower casualty rates.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aOur findings suggest that Trump drew support from American communities that have seen firsthand the human costs of war\u2014and could pay those costs again with coming escalation in Afghanistan. Trump\u2019s Afghan gambit, in other words, risks retribution at the ballot box in 2020.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s iconoclastic campaign for the presidency was often short on clear policy proposals. But one area in which he distinguished himself from his opponents, in both the primaries and the general election, was foreign policy. While he sounded traditional Republican notes demanding increased military spending, he also starkly denounced America\u2019s military misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan: He routinely called both conflicts \u201ctotal disasters\u201d and \u201cwastes of money,\u201d and pledged that his administration would put \u201cAmerica first\u201d and avoid the \u201cstupid wars\u201d of its predecessors.\u000a\u000aTrump didn\u2019t directly address the class and cultural gaps in military sacrifice in America, but his rhetoric likely resonated with the small slice of the country hardest hit by recent wars. Today, less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s population has served in theater in Iraq or Afghanistan, while those who have died or were wounded in battle in those wars comprise less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation\u2019s population. And these people are disproportionately drawn from communities that are more rural, less wealthy and less educated\u2014communities that are often labeled a key part of the Trump base.\u000a\u000aMight these Americans\u2019 anger, frustration and sadness over these wars have propelled Trump to victory? We set out to answer this question by looking at the relationship between state-level U.S. casualty rates (per million residents) in Iraq and Afghanistan, as tracked by the Defense Department, and Trump\u2019s vote share in each state, relative to GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s in 2012. (This allowed us to control for the fact that Republicans generally might do better in high-casualty constituencies.)\u000a\u000aWe found that Trump significantly outperformed Romney in places that shouldered a disproportionate share of the war burden in Iraq and Afghanistan. True, Trump surpassed Romney\u2019s share of the two-party vote in 40 of 50 states. But, as the figure below shows, Trump was particularly successful in states that had suffered higher casualty rates in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aWe then examined data from each of the nation\u2019s more than 3,000 counties, where the disparities in wartime sacrifice are even more extreme. At the county level, we were able to control for a range of other variables\u2014including each county\u2019s median income, educational level, racial demographics, urban-rural balance and military veteran population. Again, we found strong evidence that Trump was particularly successful in high-casualty constituencies.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s inroads in these communities, where many voters had abandoned Republican candidates in the 2000s, may have been pivotal. Our state-level regressions suggest that if three states key to Trump\u2019s victory\u2014Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014had suffered even a modestly lower casualty rate, all three could have flipped from red to blue and sent Hillary Clinton to the White House.\u000a\u000aAmericans who lost friends, family members and neighbors in the war in Afghanistan may have seen Clinton, who backed President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to send more troops there, as supportive of those efforts; Trump\u2019s isolationist rhetoric, on the other hand, likely seemed refreshing. But what now? Trump, convinced by the foreign policy establishment and brushing off the advice of his now-ousted strategist Steve Bannon, is expanding the very war he once so strongly criticized. In doing so, he joins George W. Bush, Obama, Clinton and virtually every other mainstream politician in overlooking the inequality of military sacrifice today in America.\u000a\u000aCan Trump get away with it? We don\u2019t think so. Already, important elements of the Trump base\u2014led by Bannon and the Breitbart News machine\u2014are pushing back against the president\u2019s reversal. And our research suggests that if Trump wants to win again in 2020, he should be wary of amassing more casualties from overseas wars. As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich recently observed, casualties always pose risks to political leaders. But these risks are particularly acute for Trump, as they would fall heavily on his political base.\u000a\u000aThe foreign policy establishment might be cheering Trump\u2019s decision. But his strongest supporters aren\u2019t rooting for the establishment. And they won\u2019t be rooting for Trump if their family members and neighbors return\u000a\u000afrom Afghanistan\u2019s war zone dead or wounded. Trump finally listened to the experts in the room. But, unfortunately for the nation and for his electoral fortunes, this is one time he should have stuck with his instincts.\u000a\u000aDouglas L.

aVWASHINGTON -- The U.S. intelligence agencies' assessments of the size of North Korea's nuclear arsenal have a wide gap between high and low estimates. Size matters and not knowing makes it harder for the United States to develop a policy for deterrence and defend itself and allies in the region.\u000a\u000aThe secrecy of North Korea's nuclear program, the underground nature of its test explosions and the location of its uranium-enrichment activity has made it historically difficult to assess its capabilities.\u000a\u000aSome U.S. assessments conclude North Korea has produced or can make around 30 to 60 nuclear weapons, said two U.S. officials who weren't authorized to discuss sensitive intelligence matters and demanded anonymity. Such a wide range affects how the U.S. considers addressing the threat. More North Korean bombs could indicate second-strike capacity and then there are questions about how much nuclear firepower the country could mobilize on a moment's notice.\u000a\u000aEstimates by civilian experts cloud the picture even further. Most put the arsenal anywhere from a dozen to about 30 weapons.\u000a\u000a"The bottom line is that we really don't know how many nuclear weapons they have," said Bruce Bennett, a senior international and defense researcher at RAND specializing in northeast Asian military issues. "Does it make a difference? Absolutely."\u000a\u000a"If North Korea only has a small number -- one or two or three -- they will not brandish them early in a conflict. If they have 30-plus, they are almost certainly going to consider early use of nuclear weapons in a conflict."\u000a\u000aAlthough remote, the danger of a U.S.-North Korean nuclear confrontation has escalated in recent weeks after Pyongyang's first successful tests last month of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump has traded bombastic threats with the isolated, communist government. Last week, Mr. Trump pledged to answer North Korean aggression with "fire and fury." He later tweeted that a military solution was "locked and loaded" after leader Kim Jong Un was said to be considering a provocative launch of missiles into waters near the U.S. Pacific island of Guam.\u000a\u000aIf a war were to break out now, North Korea could very well be destroyed. But if North Korea succeeds in building nuclear missiles that can reach the continental U.S., the equation changes. And having more than a few reliable missiles -- long-range ones, plus short-range ones that could, for instance, hit South Korea where 28,000 U.S. troops are deployed -- enhance North Korea's leverage.\u000a\u000aThe risk of mass casualties makes any pre-emptive U.S. strikes problematic, as Mr. Trump's own chief strategist recognized in an interview this week.\u000a\u000a"There's no military solution, forget it," Steve Bannon says. "Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here. They got us." Seoul is South Korea's capital.\u000a\u000aOlli Heinonen, a former deputy director-general at the U.N. nuclear agency, said an arsenal of dozens of weapons might suggest North Korea seeks the capacity to retaliate in a nuclear war. A half-dozen weapons would suggest pure deterrence, said Heinonen, who estimates that North Korea now has enough fissile material for up to 40 weapons -- about 10 using plutonium and 30 using uranium.\u000a\u000a"When you increase the number, it means normally you're going a little bit more offensive, you plan to have a second-strike capability," Heinonen said. "Very often it's from submarines and we see North Korea also working with those."\u000a\u000aWhile size is important, Kelsey Davenport at the Arms Control Association thinks the more pressing problem is stopping Pyongyang from further advancing its nuclear program.\u000a\u000a"North Korea wants to threaten the United States with a nuclear strike, not actually conduct one, so determining the exact size of North Korea's stockpile of nuclear warheads is far less urgent than de-escalating tensions," she said.\u000a\u000aSen. Deb Fischer, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee's panel on strategic forces, said not knowing the size of North Korea's nuclear program can complicate planning and limit options available to the president. But general principles of deterrence can still be applied, she said.\u000a\u000a"Kim Jong Un is probably less likely to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile armed with a nuclear weapon at the United States, and suffer our overwhelming retaliation, if he knows our missile defense will prevent his attack from succeeding," said Fischer, who has called for more funding for homeland missile defense.\u000a\u000aA 2015 study by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies said North Korea could have up to 100 weapons by the end of the decade. That is, if it had 9,000 centrifuges in operation for uranium enrichment and if a light-water reactor, long under construction, finally came online. Under that projection, North Korea would have 58 weapons by 2017, which is comparable to the high end of the intelligence estimates.\u000a\u000aStill, most experts think the number is far less.\u000a\u000a"It's possible that they have discovered an additional uranium enrichment facility that we haven't known about," said John Schilling, a consultant with the 38 North website on North Korea at Johns Hopkins. If 60 is the high end, he said, then there "has to be an additional uranium enrichment facility to have produced that level."\u000a\u000aAssuming the existence of one or more covert centrifuge facilities, North Korea's inventory of plutonium and highly enriched uranium might have provided enough fuel for 20 to 25 nuclear devices by the end of last year, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist and former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory who visited North Korea's declared centrifuge facility at Nyongbyon in 2010.\u000a\u000a"Almost all in government believe there are two centrifuge plants," added David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security, who views an arsenal of 60 as "unlikely."

aVPresident Trump unveiled a new strategy for the U.S. war in Afghanistan on Aug. 21. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aPresident Trump unveiled a new strategy for the U.S. war in Afghanistan on Aug. 21. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aPresident Trump was frustrated and fuming. Again and again, in the windowless Situation Room at the White House, he lashed out at his national security team over the Afghanistan war, and the paucity of appealing options gnawed at him.\u000a\u000aLast month, as Trump mulled over a new strategy in a 16-year conflict that bedeviled his predecessors, he groused that sending additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan could have a negligible impact. He threatened to fire the current commander there. He flirted with privatizing the military effort. He even considered pulling out. Declaring victory seemed all but impossible.\u000a\u000aFive weeks later, at a Camp David summit, the commander in chief arrived at his decision. A president obsessed with winning has now settled on simply trying not to lose.\u000a\u000aTrump decided to escalate troop levels, but only after protracted deliberations that deeply divided the administration. Lobbied by rival advisers, the president pinballed between his militaristic and anti-interventionist impulses. Impatient during classified briefings, Trump longed to reimagine U.S. policy in South Asia under his \u201cAmerica first\u201d banner.\u000a\u000aUltimately, however, Trump took a more conventional route. He tilted toward the generals who now dominate his inner circle and had urged a large-scale troop expansion, although he did not opt for the tens of thousands of troops they advocated initially.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump addressed U.S. troops and the nation from Fort Myer in Arlington, Va., on Aug. 21 to announce his plan going forward in Afghanistan. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s private deliberations \u2014 detailed in interviews with more than a dozen senior administration officials and outside allies \u2014 revealed a president un­attached to any particular foreign-policy doctrine, but willing to be persuaded as long as he could be seen as a strong and decisive leader.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis has been many months in the making,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. \u201cThe hallmark of leadership is a deliberative process, not an impulsive reaction, and that is precisely the protocol he followed here.\u201d\u000a\u000aPart of that listening included hearing out the military about sharing the burden in the region and getting Pakistan more involved in managing the war.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen Secretary [Jim] Mattis said this would be a South Asia strategy, that tells you a lot,\u201d said John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, referring to recent remarks by the defense secretary. \u201cThe big issue wasn\u2019t land-war tactics. The big issue is Pakistan.\u201d He called Trump\u2019s Monday speech the \u201cdefining moment of the Trump policy seven months into the administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aYears before running for president, Trump had a clear message on Afghanistan: It was time to get out. In 2012, he said the war was \u201cwasting our money.\u201d In 2012, he called it \u201ca total disaster.\u201d In 2013, he said, \u201cWe should leave Afghanistan immediately.\u201d Trump continued his criticism of the war during the year and a half he campaigned for the White House.\u000a\u000aBut since becoming president, he has faced a different set of opinions. Defense Secretary Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, both generals with extensive battlefield experience in Afghanistan, warned Trump about the consequences of withdrawal and cautioned that any move in Afghanistan would have ripple effects throughout the region.\u000a\u000aOne of the ways McMaster tried to persuade Trump to recommit to the effort was by convincing him that Afghanistan was not a hopeless place. He presented Trump with a black-and-white snapshot from 1972 of Afghan women in miniskirts walking through Kabul, to show him that Western norms had existed there before and could return.\u000a\u000a[National security adviser attempts to reconcile Trump\u2019s competing impulses on Afghanistan]\u000a\u000aAnother key voice in Trump\u2019s deliberations \u2014 especially in guiding the president to make a decision in recent weeks \u2014 was John F. Kelly, the newly installed White House chief of staff. A retired four-star Marine general, Kelly had a deeply personal understanding of the stakes: His son, 2nd Lt. Robert M. Kelly, 29, was killed there in 2010 when he stepped on a land mine while leading a platoon of Marines.\u000a\u000a\u201cTalking to generals, he realized, you pull out completely and this is what happens: You endanger lives, you endanger American interests, allies, troops, Afghanis who are our friends, and it\u2019s not a stable government,\u201d said a senior administration official.\u000a\u000aTrump has nurtured a lifelong infatuation with military culture, going back to his youth at a military academy. One of his favorite movies is \u201cPatton,\u201d the 1970 Hollywood biopic of Gen. George S. Patton\u2019s exploits during World War II.\u000a\u000aThomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime Trump friend and chairman of his presidential inauguration, said Trump \u201cviews generals with a special respect and admiration that allows him to defer to and consider their judgment and expertise in a different light than with his business or political peers who may be Cabinet members or other trusted advisers.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy summer, the policy review process Trump initiated soon after taking office had grown sclerotic. Hovering over everything was the legacy of former president Barack Obama and his management of the war \u2014 a series of decisions that Trump found objectionable. Trump voiced frustration to his advisers about having to clean up somebody else\u2019s mess.\u000a\u000aFormer House speaker Newt Gingrich described the administration\u2019s view of Afghanistan as one of \u201cpatience\u201d about the time it will take to stabilize the region.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we can keep American casualties down, we can have patience. The fact is, if you slow down the casualty rate and you\u2019re not losing young Americans, the American people will support gradually growing allies for a long time,\u201d he said, referring to decades of U.S. troop presences in Korea, Germany and Japan.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s decisions were put off in part because of infighting in his ranks, chiefly between McMaster and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who departed the White House last week. Tensions between the two erupted in July as they talked through Afghanistan options with colleagues and the president.\u000a\u000aWhen McMaster floated possibly sending tens of thousands of additional troops, Bannon shot back that such a commitment would be a folly in a country where intervention had crippled foreign powers through the centuries, officials said.\u000a\u000aMcMaster expressed alarm and irritation to confidants that Bannon was tempting the president to drift away from the military leadership with ideas that were not feasible. He was especially bothered by a proposal to hand over much of the military responsibility to private contractor Erik Prince, the founder of the controversial security company formerly known as Blackwater USA.\u000a\u000aMattis heard out Bannon\u2019s pitch during a weekend meeting at the Pentagon in early July but quickly sided with McMaster. He and other military leaders were deeply suspicious of handing over any responsibility to private companies due to the controversies that dogged Blackwater and others in Iraq.\u000a\u000aBannon was undaunted, hoping that even if Trump did not adopt his ideas, he would back away from McMaster\u2019s expansive plan. Meanwhile, Bannon\u2019s allies at Breitbart News and elsewhere in conservative media attacked McMaster as a \u201cglobalist\u201d who did not have Trump\u2019s interests in mind.\u000a\u000a[Trump to announce modest increase in troops to Afghanistan]\u000a\u000aThe anti-McMaster campaign, which Bannon denied orchestrating, infuriated some West Wing colleagues, including Kelly. Instead of marginalizing McMaster, the campaign made him a sympathetic figure to military and administration officials who cringed at the wave of negative stories. Trump signaled which side he was on Aug. 10 when he was asked by a reporter whether he had confidence in McMaster.\u000a\u000a\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s our friend. He\u2019s my friend. And he\u2019s a very talented man. I like him and I respect him.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon\u2019s vocal opposition had a cost. He was attending fewer meetings. One of his few allies, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, was pushed out just as Bannon was working to wrangle the Afghanistan decision in his direction. And by mid-August, Kelly, McMaster, Mattis and others planned the Camp David retreat without him.\u000a\u000aAs Trump began to align with the military establishment, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other advisers reminded the president of the expectations of his die-hard supporters, who thought they had elected a president who would get the United States out of endless wars.\u000a\u000aBreitbart \u2014 which Bannon returned to last week as executive chairman \u2014 ran several skeptical headlines in recent days and played up an interview with Prince in which the Blackwater founder said that putting \u201cmore troops and more money\u201d in Afghanistan would be a mistake.\u000a\u000aBut some Trump allies predicted the base would respond favorably.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey trust him on this stuff,\u201d said Ed Brookover, a former Trump campaign adviser. \u201cThey know he\u2019s gathered information and talked to a series of experts and reached a conclusion. On security issues, they\u2019re with him and know that he\u2019s certainly not jumping to fight wars everywhere.\u201d\u000a\u000aPollster Patrick H. Caddell, who has done surveys for Breitbart, said, \u201cThe whole country is tired of the war that\u2019s been going on 16 years and in general believes we\u2019ve wasted a lot of time and money. But if he sells it as part of the war on terror, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Priebus was considered a passive voice on Afghanistan, Kelly all but forced a decision from the president with newfound urgency. One adviser called him \u201cthe accelerator.\u201d\u000a\u000aKelly summoned the national security team to the Camp David meeting Friday with Trump and Vice President Pence, where the president was presented with his options.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s decision was foreshadowed by a grimacing pose he and his team struck in a portrait that the president put on his Twitter page. In a wood-paneled room, Trump sat at a table scowling as 13 advisers stood behind him, each of them stone-faced and staring into the camera. The flags of the five military branches filled the background. To Trump, this was the image of strength.\u000a\u000aSome of Trump\u2019s critics were relieved that the military prevailed in shaping Trump\u2019s strategy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t know anything about war or anything about Afghanistan,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, a foreign policy adviser in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cHe has a lot of angry instincts, but nothing more than that.

aVAn Ohio electric utility and one of the country's top coal companies had some well-placed help when pressing President Donald Trump for emergency federal assistance for the coal industry \u2014 his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\u000a\u000aThe companies wanted Trump to prevent utilities from closing economically ailing coal-fired power plants, using authorities normally designed to protect the U.S. electricity supply during emergencies. And as they made their case, they got support from the former Trump aide, who has remained in the president's orbit despite being fired from his campaign more than a year ago.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aLewandowski denied in a message Friday that he is working for the companies, utility FirstEnergy and mining corporation Murray Energy. But his involvement in the issue alarmed some senior administration officials and others close to Trump, who saw his role as that of a lobbyist and believed he was being paid for the work.\u000a\u000aLewandowski spoke in support of the utility's agenda at the White House and met with other senior administration officials on the issue this spring and summer, according to senior White House officials and records reviewed by POLITICO. Lewandowski was also integral in setting up meetings between Chuck Jones, the CEO of utility FirstEnergy, with Trump and other White House officials, according to the documents and officials. Lewandowski traveled aboard Air Force One during that period, sources said.\u000a\u000aThe Energy Department eventually decided that the action the companies sought would be inappropriate. But the companies had nearly succeeded: According to letters from Republican donor and coal magnate Robert Murray, CEO of the mining company Murray Energy, Trump twice said he supported requiring coal power plants run by a subsidiary of FirstEnergy to keep running, even if the subsidiary fell into bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aThe records do not indicate whether FirstEnergy or Murray Energy were paying Lewandowski to represent them. Lewandowski, who's now a consultant, has not registered to work for the companies as a lobbyist.\u000a\u000aLewandowski's involvement, and the fact that he wasn't registered as a lobbyist, were among the factors that alarmed some senior officials. They also worried that the administration would be taking controversial, potentially inappropriate steps on behalf of a company that was aligned with a consultant close to Trump.\u000a\u000aMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"This was entirely a Lewandowski production," one senior White House official said.\u000a\u000aWhen contacted by POLITICO, Lewandowski denied that he is employed by FirstEnergy, saying the assertions were "not accurate." FirstEnergy executives and a spokeswoman did not answer multiple requests for comment. A Murray Energy spokesman also denied that Lewandowski worked for the coal company.\u000a\u000a"I do not work for First Energy," Lewandowski said Friday. "If you report that, it will be more fake news. Both the company and I have confirmed for the record I do not work for them. Same is true with Murray Energy. Much to your dismay, I am not compensated by them. I know you don't want to report the truth but ... the truth is the truth \u2014 even when it doesn't fit your liberal agenda."\u000a\u000aHe didn't answer a series of follow-up questions about his role or whether he was previously employed by FirstEnergy or any company or group affiliated with it.\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred questions to Lewandowski, including those about whether he should have registered as a lobbyist.\u000a\u000a"The burden is on the individual to register, not the White House which is why all of your questions should be directed to Corey on this matter," she said by email.\u000a\u000aSanders didn't answer questions about why the administration engaged with Lewandowski on this issue.\u000a\u000aMany White House officials have chafed at Trump's relationship with Lewandowski, who worked as a lobbyist for Americans For Prosperity, a libertarian advocacy group backed by billionaires Charles and David Koch, before joining Trump's campaign team. Trump fired Lewandowski in June 2016 amid tensions between the campaign manager and then-adviser Paul Manafort.\u000a\u000aLewandowski later co-founded the lobbying firm Avenue Strategies with another former Trump veteran, Barry Bennett, touting their close ties to the White House. He left the firm after questions arose about his work for foreign governments, particularly Citgo in Venezuela.\u000a\u000aDespite his ouster from Trump's campaign, Lewandowski frequently visits the White House and has stopped by the Oval Office unannounced. He is a divisive figure, particularly disliked by some aides, but he remains close to Trump.\u000a\u000a"You'll see Corey in pretty often," one administration official said. "Seeing him here isn't like a shock or anything."\u000a\u000aLobbying laws require people or firms to disclose when they are advocating for clients with the federal government. At the very least, Lewandowski's support for Murray and FirstEnergy's position would appear to fly in the face of Trump's "drain the swamp" pledge to limit the power of lobbyists.\u000a\u000aIn Murray\u2019s letter, first published by the Associated Press on Tuesday, the coal CEO said he and Jones had pushed their case to Trump in an early July visit to the Oval Office. When they met him again on an Aug. 3 trip to Huntington, W.Va., Trump told an aide in the presence of both CEOs to "tell Cohn to do whatever these two want him to do." That was an apparent reference to Gary Cohn, director of the White House's National Economic Council.\u000a\u000aMurray's letter added that during another conversation in July with Trump in Youngstown, Ohio, about a federal power emergency declaration to keep the plants open, the president turned to Energy Secretary Rick Perry and told him three times, "I want this done."\u000a\u000aDespite Trump's orders, the Energy Department and officials in the White House rejected the move, because the emergency powers are designed to be used to ensure the power grid is not compromised rather than to prop up ailing businesses. The officials said the Ohio power plants that FirstEnergy and Murray wanted to keep open were not necessary to maintain the power network, which was amply supplied by other plants.\u000a\u000aTrump ultimately agreed.\u000a\u000aBut the closure of those plants would have a dramatic effect on Murray's coal mining operations. The CEO, who was one of the most vocal critics of former President Barack Obama's coal regulations, said shutting those plants would push Murray Energy into immediate bankruptcy and force it to eliminate 6,500 jobs. That would mean the "destruction and devastation of the very population that voted President Donald J. Trump into the Oval Office," Murray wrote to Perry in an Aug. 18 letter following a meeting with the Energy secretary's chief of staff.\u000a\u000aTrump has frequently hammered Obama for promoting climate and energy policies that hurt the coal industry, which has also seen market share decline amid competition from inexpensive natural gas and tax-subsidized wind and solar power. As president, Trump has ordered his agencies to roll back those policies and has vowed that the U.S. will withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, much to the cheers of miners and coal executives.\u000a\u000aOne company with a stake in Trump's decisions is FirstEnergy subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions, which runs \u201cmerchant\u201d coal power plants that compete with gas and wind in the wholesale market to sell power to utilities. The company hoped Trump would invoke a part of the Federal Power Act to order that those plants be kept in operation, despite FirstEnergy Solutions' likely bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aJones' allies in the fight included Murray, whose coal mines supply several of FirstEnergy's plants. After the August meetings with Trump in Huntington and Youngstown, Murray met on Aug. 17 with Energy Department chief of staff Brian McCormack to make his case again.\u000a\u000aBut the department, with Trump's blessing, said Monday that it would not keep the plants open by government order.\u000a\u000a"We look at the facts of each issue and consider the authorities we have to address them but with respect to this particular case at this particular time, the White House and the Department of Energy are in agreement that the evidence does not warrant the use of this emergency authority," White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said in a statement this week.\u000a\u000aAubree Eliza Weaver and Matt Daily contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPRIPYAT, Ukraine \u2014 In a post-Cold War world, the fear of nuclear holocaust has receded from the global consciousness. Donald Trump\u2019s threat of unleashing \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d against North Korea was an untimely and unwelcome reminder of a past, perilous era. Even by Trump\u2019s standards these statements were a new low. And they are dangerous. History teaches us that the journey from political logorrhea to global disaster can be terrifyingly short.\u000a\u000aAs demagogues toss around nuclear threats like confetti at a wedding, it is easy to forget the devastation nuclear power can cause. But in one country, on Europe\u2019s edge, they have not forgotten. And where once life thrived, there now stands a vast mausoleum.\u000a\u000aThe city of Chernobyl lies about 90 kilometers from Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kiev. It\u2019s an ancient site \u2014 originally part of the land of Kievan Rus, the federation of Slavic tribes from whom modern Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians all claim descent. In modern times the city was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power plant in Ukraine (then part of the USSR).\u000a\u000aThe plant had four nuclear reactors and on April 26, 1986, reactor number 4 blew up during a test. The Soviets were initially reluctant to make the disaster public, but had no choice when nuclear reactors a thousand miles away in eastern Sweden began recording radiation levels 10 times higher than normal. Fire from the explosion had sent plumes of highly radioactive fallout across the USSR and Europe.\u000a\u000aEventually, almost half a million people would come to be involved in the clean-up operation, which would last for months and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles (back when a ruble was equal to a U.S. dollar), playing its part in the eventual bankruptcy of the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aChernobyl was the most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history. It wiped out two cities and even now the full extent of the casualties isn\u2019t known. Most of the first responders died: two that night, with many more over the subsequent weeks and months. Their efforts, however, were arguably the most invaluable in modern history: they succeeded in preventing a second explosion that could have destroyed half of Europe. They died so that we might live.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aNear Chernobyl is the city of Pripyat. Founded in 1970, it was the ninth Soviet nuclear city \u2014 built to accommodate the workers at the Chernobyl plant and their families. At the time of the disaster, Pripyat had a population of just under 50,000. Now both towns are surrounded by an exclusion zone that spans 2,600 square kilometers, put in place to prevent anyone from wandering into the contaminated area. Official permits are required to enter the zone.\u000a\u000aAt the edge of the zone is a checkpoint manned by five armed guards. Two orange and white barriers, of the type used in car parks, block the road. Anyone wishing to enter must have their bags searched and identification checked, to be ticked off against a list of those granted permission to proceed.\u000a\u000aInside, the area is divided into two buffer zones, the first of which covers 30 square kilometers. The second, inner sector is 10 square kilometers and stretches around reactor number 4.\u000a\u000aChernobyl once had a population of 14,000; now it\u2019s just 688 mostly older people who returned after the clean-up. The remaining reactors continued to operate for years after the disaster, the last closing in 2000. Workers are still allowed inside reactor 4 but their time inside is limited to protect them from radiation.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t drink water from the river,\u201d our guide, Yevgeny, instructs us \u2014 somewhat needlessly. My Geiger counter (a device that measures radiation) reads 0.12 microsieverts. On average, a person safely absorbs about 3.65 millisieverts (there are 1,000 microsieverts to a millisievert) merely by living in a brick or concrete building.\u000a\u000aWe get into a van to drive to Chernobyl. After passing through the village of Zalisya (now almost entirely covered in thick shrubbery) we arrive \u2014 and go immediately back in time. The sign at the city\u2019s outskirts reads simply: \u201cChernobyl.\u201d Written vertically, it is accompanied by the USSR\u2019s hammer and sickle. The Geiger counter now reads 0.22 microsieverts. Reactor 4 is a mere 18 kilometers away.\u000a\u000aWe drive down the city\u2019s main road \u2014 Soviet Street \u2014 and pull up at a square. Yevgeny says we need to park carefully. The traffic police here are so bored they hand out tickets just for something to do.\u000a\u000aThe square is immaculate. There is not a single piece of litter on the ground. The silence is near total; the streets seemingly scrubbed clean of all humanity. The odd vehicle drives past. At one corner of the square is a statue of Vladimir Lenin, his left hand clutching his lapel, his right thrust into his pocket.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Ukraine introduced a series of laws designed to de-communize the country. Soviet street names were changed to Ukrainian ones. Statues of Lenin were torn down. But here nothing has changed. \u201cWhy has no one torn this Lenin down?\u201d an Australian visitor asked. \u201cWhy would you bother?\u201d replied Yevgeny.\u000a\u000aFurther down the road is a memorial park. Rows of signs, each a simple white rectangle bearing a name bolted to a pole, stand like headstones in memory of the 97 villages that ceased to exist after the disaster. For many in those early days, the evacuation brought back traumatic memories. Buses arrived to take them away; no one told them what was happening or where they were going. For some, it was the Nazi occupation all over again.\u000a\u000aWe head to the forests that cover 70 percent of the exclusion zone. With no one there to look after them, foliage slowly burst through buildings and roads to almost completely smother what was once a teeming urban center. As human life has declined in Chernobyl, however, animal life has increased. Bears, deer, lynx, wild boars all roam here. But they are not for hunting \u2014 each is little more than a vessel of irradiated meat.\u000a\u000aIn the forest is what was once a kindergarten. On the approach, a doll with three limbs missing lies a few feet from a sign warning of radiation. The scene is Chernobyl in miniature: human existence almost instantly snuffed out by the most potent force humanity has ever unleashed.\u000a\u000aInside is a vista of decay \u2014 seemingly ancient but alarmingly timeless, like some latter day Pompeii. Only the rotting floorboards, thick layers of dust and rusting metal have changed. In the kindergarten\u2019s dormitory, there are rows of bunk beds. Some still have toys on them. Children\u2019s drawings are taped to the walls. On the floor lie several tiny shoes.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aThe giant stainless steel sarcophagus that covers reactor 4 gleams in the dappled sunlight. We are now in the inner buffer sector, just 100 meters from where it all began. The sarcophagus was built to cover an older one, built from concrete, and was installed late last year. It weighs 37,000 tonnes and the Statue of Liberty could comfortably fit inside. It\u2019s the largest movable building in the world.\u000a\u000aNext to the reactor stands an old building. Its external fire escapes seem connected to it by rust alone and the steps are surrounded by splashes of reddish brown that have splayed out like a blood spatter. Nearby is an artificial lake that was used as a cooling system for the reactors. Now it is filled with fish grown far beyond their normal size. Normally, they would have been caught and eaten but that is simply not possible. \u201cThey are not fish,\u201d says Yevgeny, \u201cthey are swimming pieces of radioactive waste.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs we depart, I take a final look at the forests that cover most of the area, and I finally understand that this is what nuclear holocaust looks like: it\u2019s not the flat, arid wastelands of Mad Max, it\u2019s the earth (eventually) bursting back into life, wresting back control from mankind\u2019s stupidity.\u000a\u000aDavid Patrikarakos is a contributing writer at POLITICO.

aVThe headlines from President Donald Trump\u2019s new immigration-enforcement memos are clear: in a sharp reversal of Obama-era policy, he wants to expand the number of undocumented immigrants targeted for deportation, hire thousands more immigration agents and restart a controversial program that automatically checked the immigration status of people in local jails.\u000a\u000aThough draconian, the two memos released by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday were also expected: the executive orders Trump released five days after his inauguration had already outlined his broad crackdown on illegal immigration. The new guidance is just the "how-to" plan to make it happen.\u000a\u000aBut in the days since it was issued, immigration experts have been combing the documents to figure out the full impact \u2014 and buried in their 19 pages have found a number of small but important policy shifts that hadn't been seen before. \u201cThere are real and meaningful changes ahead,\u201d Michael Neifach, a lawyer who held senior positions at DHS during the Bush administration, wrote in an email.\u000a\u000aThe new policies could affect everyone from undocumented immigrants to local police to U.S. soldiers. What will they look like? POLITICO spoke with nearly a dozen immigration experts on the right and left, many of whom previously have held senior roles at the department. They highlighted four under-the-radar but important new shifts buried in the DHS memos:\u000a\u000a1. Limiting \u201cparole\u201d\u000a\u000aImmigration officials have long been able to use an immigration policy called "parole" to create some flex in the system, cracking open the door for noncitizens who technically aren't supposed to enter the U.S., but who have some personal or political claim to leniency. The \u201cwet-foot, dry-foot policy\u201d that Obama ended in January used parole as the mechanism to allow Cuban immigrants to stay in the country if they made it onto U.S. soil. Another program, known as \u201cparole in place,\u201d allows close undocumented relatives of U.S. service members and veterans to apply for a green card without leaving the U.S., keeping military families together. Perhaps the most common use of parole, called \u201cadvance parole,\u201d allows immigrants who are in the U.S. and applying to adjust their status \u2014 mainly applying for a green card \u2014 to travel abroad and return while their applications are pending.\u000a\u000aTo immigration critics, these broad policies amount to a systematic abuse of the parole system, which is supposed to be judged strictly on a case-by-case basis, rather than handed out to broad categories of immigrants. In what sounds like a slap at the Obama administration, one subsection of a memo says expanded use of parole \u201chas contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe new memo calls for parole to be used \u201csparingly\u201d and directs the heads of the three main immigration agencies to issue regulations clarifying when parole can be used. How the immigration agencies will reform parole programs won\u2019t be clear until they release final regulations; a DHS spokesperson did not respond to questions about the memos. But experts on both sides of the immigration debate believe the intent is to turn parole from an exemption that certain people can count on to an infrequent privilege \u2014 curtailing or eliminating many of these programs, including the \u201cparole in place\u201d program for U.S. soldiers' families.\u000a\u000a2. Targeting people who help unaccompanied children\u000a\u000aThe new DHS memo tries to discourage unaccompanied children from making the dangerous trek to the United States by cracking down on the people who finance the journey \u2014 which often means their own families. The memo calls for the prosecution and/or deportation of any individual who \u201cfacilitates the illegal smuggling or trafficking of an alien child into the United States.\u201d In other words, an undocumented mother who pays a smuggler to bring her children to the U.S. could now face prosecution. To many, this seems particularly heartless. \u201cIn many cases, people are fleeing for their lives, and it would be wrong to subject those helping to prosecution,\u201d said Kerri Talbot, a former top immigration staffer for Sen. Robert Menendez.\u000a\u000aWhile the Trump administration\u2019s policy appears harsh, its goals aren\u2019t especially unusual. In the fight against human trafficking, countries often look to attack the problem at the incentive level, discouraging would-be migrants from making illegal journeys in the first place. For instance, the European Union signed an agreement with Turkey last year to allow Greece to return migrants to Turkey, a policy designed to make the journey into the European Union far less appealing for the thousands of people using the migration route across the Aegean Sea.\u000a\u000aWhen tens of thousands of unaccompanied children flooded across the U.S.-Mexico border in 2014, stressing the U.S. immigration system, the Obama administration used softer tactics to discourage such migration; Joe Biden, then vice president, even visited Central American countries to plead with parents to stop sending their children to the United States. By introducing the threat of prosecution for family members in the U.S. who help facilitate illegal border crossings, the Trump policy takes a much tougher line, but at heart, the goal is much the same.\u000a\u000a3. Deputizing local law enforcement as immigration agents\u000a\u000aOne of the most controversial elements of Trump\u2019s immigration policies has come with the bland bureaucratic name of 287(g), named for its corresponding section of immigration law, that allows local law enforcement agencies to sign agreements with immigration agencies to allow local police to act as immigration agents. The Obama administration ended the 287(g) program in 2012, after harsh criticism from activists and little engagement from law enforcement agencies.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s original executive order called for the DHS to revive the program. But the new memo goes a step further and actually expands it: Previously, local law enforcement agencies could only sign 287(g) agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which largely operates in the interior of the country. Now, they can also sign such agreements with Customs and Border Protection, which largely operates at ports of entry and along the border.\u000a\u000aJohn Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under Obama, called the move \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Neifach, the Bush-era DHS official, also said the \u201cchange caught my eye.\u201d What does this mean? It\u2019s tough to know until ICE and CBP actually issue additional guidance. Experts said that local police would gain few additional authorities from partnering with CBP than they wouldn\u2019t already have from partnering with ICE. But they could gain additional powers near the border, including boarding any vessel in search of undocumented immigrants and searching private lands within 25 miles of the border, said Neifach.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would envision that there will be some local sheriffs along the border who will dispatch deputies to do some patrol-like activities,\u201d Sandweg said.\u000a\u000aLocal law enforcement agencies have been hesitant to sign 287(g) agreements in the past, worried that such deals could reduce trust with the local community. But those agencies that have signed agreements have gained far-reaching immigration powers, including apprehension, arrest, detention, and even the decision over whether to initiate removal proceedings. Experts said that careful oversight of the 287(g) program is critical to ensure that local police do not abuse it, and some are concerned that the expansion of the program to include CBP could lead to worse oversight and training. \u201cTraditionally, ICE has been more sensitive to civil rights concerns and provided a higher degree of training about how to do operations and enforcement,\u201d Sandweg said. \u201cThe oversight will change of how these agencies conduct enforcement under the agreement. That\u2019ll be the biggest change.\u201d\u000a\u000a4. Expanding the use of expedited removal\u000a\u000aUnder U.S. law, undocumented immigrants are entitled to a hearing before being removed from the country \u2014 with an exception called \u201cexpedited removals\u201d for immigrants who haven't been here long. The rationale for the policy is that such removals are acceptable on humanitarian grounds because the immigrant hasn\u2019t established roots in the country. Such deportations avoid additional stress on the immigration court system, which already faces a backlog of more than 500,000 cases.\u000a\u000aThough the law allows immigration agents to use expedited removal for any undocumented adult captured within two years of entering the U.S., the official DHS policy limited its use to those captured within 14 days of entering the country and within 100 miles of the border. The new memo says that DHS will expand the policy, although it does not say how.\u000a\u000aFormer officials under the Obama administration and immigration activists both pinpointed the change as meaningful, saying it could be used to deport immigrants who have been here long enough to become established community members. \u201cThat is significant,\u201d said Noah Kroloff, a former senior DHS official under Obama. \u201c[It] essentially means anyone who can\u2019t demonstrate that they have been in the country for two years is potentially subject to expedited removal.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to data from Pew, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants have been in the U.S. more than two years. In 2014, just 14 percent had been here less than five years. Therefore, the expansion of expedited removal won\u2019t suddenly put millions of immigrants at risk of deportation without a hearing. But it still is a significant broadening of a program that many activists already oppose \u2014 one that could stretch its reach from the border regions through every state in the U.S.

aVDanielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for The New York Times, said "Fox & Friends" did not attempt to "confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment." New York Times requests apology from Fox on ISIS story\u000a\u000aThe New York Times on Sunday took the unusual step of requesting an apology from a competitor, asking "Fox & Friends" to retract a report that the Times was to blame for the 2015 escape of an ISIS leader. Fox subsequently updated the story on its website with the NYT letter.\u000a\u000a"I am writing on behalf of The New York Times to request an on-air apology and tweet from Fox & Friends in regards to a malicious and inaccurate segment 'NY Times leak allowed ISIS leader to slip away,'\u201d wrote Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for the Times.\u000a\u000aThe "Fox & Friends" report, which aired Saturday, apparently spurred a tweet by President Donald Trump: \u201cThe Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, al-Baghdadi,\u201d the president wrote later Saturday. \u201cTheir sick agenda over National Security.\u201d The "Fox & Friends" hosts had said the Times was "failing in its credibility. It\u2019s failing our country."\u000a\u000aIn her request, Rhoades Ha added: "Neither the staff at Fox & Friends, nor the writers of a related story on Foxnews.com, appeared to make any attempt to confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment."\u000a\u000aLater Sunday, Fox attached the New York Times letter to its original story and issued this statement: "The FoxNews.com story was already updated online and Fox & Friends will also provide an updated story to viewers tomorrow morning based on the FoxNews.com report. For all of their concern about accuracy, the New York Times didn't reach out to anyone at Fox News until Sunday afternoon for a story that ran Friday night."\u000a\u000aMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Tony Thomas, who told Fox that the published report caused a lead to the ISIS leader's whereabouts to go dry. "That was a very good lead. Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,\u201d said Thomas, who leads the U.S. Special Operations Command.\u000a\u000aA Fox News spokesperson said "There is absolutely no comparison between Herridge's brief report on Fox News Sunday" and the Times "reported much more compromising details than Herridge did, in revealing revealing specific details about how Baghdadi communicated and who played a role delivering those communications. Also, [the Times] reported the terrorist's wife was cooperating and how an informant led to the target."\u000a\u000aThe Times claims the pertinent material was actually disclosed by Carter in his public statement and stated that the Pentagon did not object to its more detailed June article.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on background, a Fox News executive slammed Rhoades Ha for seeking the apology only on Sunday afternoon and for alerting reporters at the same time.\u000a\u000a"NYT PR VP Danielle Rhoades Ha did not contact Fox News until Sunday afternoon \u2014 a day and a half AFTER the FoxNews.com story was published. She sent a letter to the reporter on the story \u2014 Catherine Herridge \u2014 at 3:30 pm on Sunday while being too cute by half and sending it to the press simultaneously \u2014 likely bcc\u2019ing reporters," the executive said. (The Times directly emailed POLITICO a copy of the letter that was sent to the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer on Sunday at 3:33 p.m.) "Herridge interviewed General Thomas at the Aspen Security Forum on Friday and did a wrap-up story on the panel for FoxNews.com, which was published on Friday night. Seems like an awfully long time to wait to correct something if they were so concerned about accuracy. And Ha did not reach out to Fox & Friends until 2 p.m. on Sunday for a story that aired Saturday morning. ... Why did it take them so long to reach out?"\u000a\u000aThe executive added: "If we notified the press every time the N.Y. Times had to update an online story or correct something, your inbox would crash."\u000a\u000aIn response, Rhoades Ha said she initially emailed the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer at 12:53 on Sunday, asking for a response by 3 p.m. Rhoades Ha also said she "sent a separate request to Catherine Herridge and her co-author to update their story, which I would have done with or without the Fox & Friends segment. I did not ask Catherine for an apology. She responded and updated her story."\u000a\u000aRhoades Ha said she has yet to receive a response from the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer.\u000a\u000a"We asked them for an apology because the entire premise of their segment is false," Rhoades Ha said. "I find it curious they are focusing on the timing of my emails instead of whether or not their reporting if false."\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, the Times sought clarification from the White House after Trump's tweet:\u000a\u000a"We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet. If the President is referring to this 2015 story, the Pentagon raised no objections with the Times before publishing the story in 2015 and no senior American official ever complained publicly about it until now, as noted in Peter Baker's story this morning."\u000a\u000aUPDATE July 24, 2017:\u000a\u000a\u201cFox & Friends\u201d addressed the Times\u2019 concerns in a segment Monday morning but did not apologize, saying, \u201cThe Times described its 2015 reporting to the Pentagon before publication and they had no objections, and no senior American officials have ever complained publicly \u2013 until now.\u201d The show then directed viewers to read the full statement online.\u000a\u000aIn response, The Times said the updated segment "wasn't an apology, nor did it begin to address the larger issues with the Fox & Friends Weekend segment, one of which was sheer hypocrisy. The host railed against The New York Times for covering a raid stating that the U.S. government 'would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked' to The New York Times when Fox News had covered the same raid three weeks earlier in a segment in which their correspondent said, 'The newly recovered intelligence may bring U.S. closer to Baghdadi's kill or capture,'" a Times spokesperson said. "According to the curious logic of the Fox & Friends host, Fox News itself was unpatriotic."\u000a\u000aIn an updated statement on Monday afternoon, Fox said that "Neither Fox News\u2019 report nor the subsequent on-air coverage was inaccurate." The network then links to a recent piece the Times wrote, explaining why it decided to name a CIA operative in one of its recent stories as something the Times is trying to distract people from by seeking an apology from Fox. "We find it beyond disappointing that the New York Times, in an attempt to distract from their recent debacle, decided to blame Fox News for comments made publicly by General Thomas during a widely viewed panel at the Aspen Security Forum. It might behoove the Times to actually check in with their reporter Eric Schmitt to see whether Gen. Thomas\u2019 comments have merit and whether Schmitt\u2019s reporting in 2015 revealed intelligence that allowed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to slip away.\u201d

aVThere was something that separated Fred C. Trump from the average greedy developer. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t the endless scandals that followed his every Coney Island project, and it wasn\u2019t the misappropriation and theft of public funds that seemed to be his business model. Trump\u2019s policy of discrimination in rentals and his political cronyism were just business as usual.\u000a\u000aTwo incidents stand out that as defining Trump\u2019s personality. The first is well known and occurred when Trump was denied a zoning change to build his \u201cMiami Beach- style\u201d high-rises on the Steeplechase Park site. The frustrated developer threw a party and invited guests to vandalize the building by tossing objects through the stained glass façade of the Pavilion, knocking out the teeth of the enormous Steeplechase funny face, the smiling symbol that had brought joy to millions. This sad event was a vindictive and shameful act by a grown man behaving like a juvenile delinquent. It wasn\u2019t business, \u2014 it was personal. The desecration of an icon and the breaking of glass as public spectacle revealed a twisted personality that was unusual for even the most hard-bitten developers.\u000a\u000aThe Steeplechase Face: Vandalized by Fred Trump, September 1966\u000a\u000aIn 1992 he was at it again. The city was about to begin a complete restoration of the defunct Parachute Jump, which had fallen into disrepair. Trump stepped in, uninvited, and offered to demolish the landmark for free. The man had no financial interest in the tower and nothing to gain by having it torn down. It was just another publicity stunt by a mean-spirited man. Trump reveled in gleeful malice.\u000a\u000aFew people realize the influence that Fred Trump had over the transformation of Coney Island\u2019s West End from a middle-class neighborhood to a burning slum during the late 1960s. His demolition of the Steeplechase Pavilion is now legendary, but his other scandalous Coney Island projects have largely gone unnoticed until now. Our new exhibit, which we planned long before the Trump name came up in national politics, illustrates the long-term effect that he had on Coney Island. Those of us who lived in Coney Island during the 1950s to 1970s were adversely impacted by the collaboration of Fred Trump and Robert Moses, the duo who ran roughshod over poor neighborhoods with a \u201cslum clearance\u201d program that was a gift to rich developers and a nightmare for the poor.\u000a\u000aEvery single Coney Island project that Fred Trump was involved in, from the 1940s throughout the 1960s, was touched by scandal, misappropriation of public funds, and political cronyism. The Beach Haven, Shore Haven, and Trump Village projects all led to allegations of impropriety and discrimination. There were federal hearings and investigations into Trump\u2019s business practices, allegations of defrauding veterans in rental agreements, and charges of racism. Trump\u2019s display of greed and avarice was unusual for a major developer. Unlike Robert Moses, who was known as the master builder, Trump was more of a master manipulator. Federal laws had to be changed to prevent the kind of nefarious schemes that Trump excelled in.\u000a\u000aIn 1948 Trump formed an organization of builders that partnered with Moses to gain massive building sites that were to be taken by eminent domain. The Trump Village site was one of those, as was the old Luna Park site. Trump lost the Luna site after he was blacklisted by the federal government because of his Federal Housing Authority scandal, a scheme where he overestimated his building costs and pocketed millions of dollars in public funds meant for veterans housing.\u000a\u000aNine hundred poor families were cleared from the Trump Village site and moved to the old bungalow colonies in Coney\u2019s West End. The housing was substandard, and many people, mostly children, died in the fires caused by inadequate space heaters in buildings that were never meant for year-round use. The racial balance of what had been a diverse community was upended, and slumlords gained control of what had been a working-class neighborhood. Trump and his friends profited handsomely from this relocation scheme.\u000a\u000aThere are too many instances of Trumps perfidy to list in this account, but his pilfering is documented in great detail in our exhibit based on newspaper accounts and oral history interviews with people who knew Trump, confronted Trump, or were affected by him.\u000a\u000aOne of the strangest accounts in the exhibit is drawn from an oral history in my 2002 book, Coney Island: Lost and Found. It tells the story of how Trump met his match while dealing with an old-time Coney Islander who outsmarted him at every turn after he had leased the Steeplechase site. Trump knew what to do: he didn\u2019t get mad at him; instead he tried to hire him.\u000a\u000aIn my many years of recording Coney Island oral histories, it\u2019s surprising how many times Fred Trump\u2019s name comes up, nearly always in a negative light. In 1999 I was recording an interview with Jerry Bianco, the former Brooklyn Navy Yard welder who built the Yellow Submarine on Coney Island Creek, when the Trump name popped up in an unexpected way. We were discussing the Parachute Jump, and Bianco stopped me and said, \u201c I had the contract on that.\u201d I was surprised and asked him if he had been hired to restore it. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cto tear it down.\u201d He then revealed for the first time that in 1966 he had been approached by Fred Trump to demolish the venerated structure.\u000a\u000aThis revelation was a shock. I\u2019d documented Bianco\u2019s construction of the sub in 1969 and 1970 and knew that he had the skills to take down a big tower. I never realized how close we came to losing Coney\u2019s greatest surviving landmark. This was one of the few times that Trump would not get his way, and I asked why the tower was still standing. Bianco told me that his bid of $10,000 was too high, and Trump had backed out of the deal. Bianco then described in detail how he would have done the job. Today, no thanks to Trump, the Parachute Jump is still standing. It\u2019s been 50 years since Trump\u2019s demolition of the Steeplechase Pavilion, and it\u2019s taken the Coney Island community a half century to recover.\u000a\u000aCONEY ISLAND, 1964: Fred Trump used his political connections to steal the Trump Village site from the United Housing Foundation (UHF). Trump Village, foreground, was completed in 1964. The former residents of the site were relocated to the bungalows of Coney Island's West End. Behind Trump Village is the Luna Park housing complex. Trump lost the Luna site after he was blacklisted by the federal government. The entire West End of Coney Island (top left) was later razed for NYCHA housing projects.\u000a\u000aAfter selling the Steeplechase property to the city for a $1.4 million profit, Trump lost his political connections and his ability to acquire the large building sites that enabled him to gain windfall profits at public expense. Gwendolyn Blair, author of \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations Who Built An Empire,\u201d described Trump\u2019s state of mind after losing the Steeplechase battle: \u201cHe was exhausted. It was time for someone else to take over \u2013 someone with the energy he had once had. His second son, Donald, would not solve the problems at Coney Island. Neither would he devote himself to finding a less problematic building site elsewhere in Brooklyn. . . . \u201cHe would go where only the sky was the limit. He would go to Manhattan.\u201d The Trump organization sold its last Coney Island property during the rezoning of the neighborhood in 2009.\u000a\u000aSpecial Exhibit: "50th Anniversary of Fred Trump's Demolition of Steeplechase Pavilion" open 1:00 - 7:00 PM. weekends and holidays through Labor Day, at the Coney Island History Project, 3059 West 12th Street at the entrance to the Wonder Wheel.

Do you agree?\u000a\u000aPENCE: Well, first off, I agree with the president that seeing people destroy public property in the name of any cause is just simply unacceptable. Communities can have conversations about what displays happen.\u000a\u000aBut I hold the view that it\u2019s important that we remember our past and build on the progress that we have made. The United States Capitol, every state is able to donate two statues to commemorate citizens that they want remembered. And in the heart of our government. And states can make those decisions. What we have to walk away from is a desire by some to erase parts of our history just in the name of some contemporary political cause.\u000a\u000aEARHARDT: You\u2019re in favor of keeping those monuments?\u000a\u000aPENCE: I think that \u2014 obviously, I think that should always be a local decision and, with regard to the U.S. Capitol, should be state decisions. But I\u2019m someone who believes in more monuments, not less monuments. What we ought to do is we ought to remember our history. But we also ought to celebrate the progress that we\u2019ve made since that history.\u000a\u000aYou know, when I walked back in 2010 across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis, arm and arm, and we remembered Bloody Sunday and the extraordinary progress of the civil rights movement, I can\u2019t help but think that, rather than pulling down monuments, as some are wont to do, rather than tearing down monuments that have graced our cities all across this country for years, we ought to have been building more monuments. We ought to be celebrating the men and women who\u2019ve helped our nation move toward a more perfect union and tell the whole story of America.

aVBillions of dollars\u2019 worth of shovel-ready infrastructure projects have been held up by a bureaucratic morass that President Donald Trump helped to create.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s slowness to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is one reason for a growing backlog of natural gas pipelines and a gas export terminal awaiting approval from the agency, which has been unable to conduct major business since February. The waiting list has grown to at least $13 billion worth of projects expected to generate more than 23,000 construction jobs, according to a POLITICO analysis \u2014 largely in states Trump won in November.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aFinally, the agency is ready to get back to work after the Senate confirmed two FERC nominees late Thursday. The commission was crippled by leadership vacancies just two weeks after Trump\u2019s inauguration when he demoted its former chairman, who promptly quit. Since July 1, four of the agency\u2019s five seats have been vacant.\u000a\u000aFERC oversees interstate pipelines, liquefied natural gas exports and wholesale electricity markets. For the projects\u2019 supporters and people who follow the agency, Thursday\u2019s confirmation of Pennsylvania regulator Rob Powelson and Republican Senate aide Neil Chatterjee could not have come too soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not begin to minimize even the passage of another month,\u201d said former FERC Commissioner Colette Honorable, \u201cbecause there are high stakes in the matters that come before FERC each and every day \u2014 vast amounts of capital at issue, vast amounts of consumer cost or savings at stake.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of the largest pipeline projects waiting for approval run right through Trump country, carrying gas out of shale plays in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio \u2014 all states Trump won last year and hopes to win again. One project alone, called Atlantic Coast, would bring 10,000 jobs to West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina, and the $2 billion NEXUS line would put 3,300 people to work in Michigan and Pennsylvania, states Trump flipped to red for the first time in decades.\u000a\u000aEncouraging domestic energy production and rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure were major campaign themes for Trump, whose promises of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan have yet to yield concrete progress on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000aFERC\u2019s holdup came as the agency, which has a $350 million annual budget and 1,500 employees, has found its once-quiet regulatory responsibilities increasingly politicized as its work draws closer to the center of some of the nation\u2019s most significant energy and climate policy debates.\u000a\u000aThe small independent agency does not formally take direction from the White House, but it has ample power to shape Trump\u2019s agenda of U.S. \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d FERC is in charge of authorizing facilities to export natural gas; balancing the environmental risks and benefits of the fracking boom; setting rates for increasingly complicated energy markets; and deciding how far states can go in propping up nuclear power plants by paying more for their carbon-free energy.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists, who besieged the agency\u2019s meetings with protests last year, say FERC takes too narrow a view of its mandate to ensure affordable, reliable energy supplies and has ignored larger questions of climate change and environmental protection. Their protests have intensified in the wake of the fracking boom that led to higher demand for new pipelines and export terminals.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The agency\u2019s long state of paralysis is complex enough that Trump is not solely at fault.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a number of things that had to go wrong to put FERC in this current position, and every single one of them went wrong,\u201d said Marc Spitzer, a former Republican FERC commissioner. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put all the blame on any one person.\u201d\u000a\u000aFERC was set at the precipice of dysfunction by former President Barack Obama, when GOP Commissioner Phil Moeller resigned in October 2015 and fellow Republican Tony Clark followed him out the door 11 months later. Obama never nominated anyone to fill the two GOP-designated seats, in part because of Democrats\u2019 larger political feud with Senate Republicans after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court without any hearings or votes.\u000a\u000aBut it was Trump who pushed FERC off that cliff, when he stripped the chairmanship from Norman Bay and gave it to Cheryl LaFleur, another Democrat. Bay followed the lead of most chairs who lose the gavel and resigned, taking the agency\u2019s quorum with him. As of July 1, when Honorable resigned, LaFleur became the agency\u2019s sole member.\u000a\u000aDemocrats fault the White House for the pace of confirming new commissioners. The Senate has traditionally confirmed nominees to bipartisan commissions such as FERC by packaging picks from both parties together before bringing them to the floor for votes. But the White House only formally nominated Democratic aide Rich Glick on Wednesday, five weeks after announcing plans to do so.\u000a\u000aOthers blame the lack of trust in a polarized Washington.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Senate functions based on trust and unanimous consent. If everything in the Senate has to go the whole nine yards, then virtually nothing gets done,\u201d said one longtime industry official close to pending projects who asked not to be named in order to speak freely. The Senate can move swiftly, the source added, \u201cbut in order for that to happen, there needs to be some measure of trust.\u201d\u000a\u000aTwo of Trump\u2019s FERC picks, Republicans Chatterjee and Powelson, cleared the Senate energy committee in June, but without Glick\u2019s nomination, Senate Democrats were unlikely to allow a delay-free confirmation. Once Glick\u2019s papers came in, Democrats let them through on the last day before a monthlong recess.\u000a\u000aBut industry members spent the intervening months watching the clock tick while projects stayed frozen.\u000a\u000a\u201cFERC\u2019s lack of a quorum since early February represents an unnecessary drag on the economy, sidelining billions of dollars in private capital otherwise poised to put thousands of Americans to work expanding and improving our nation\u2019s energy delivery system,\u201d said Adam Parker, a spokesman for the NEXUS pipeline project being built by Enbridge.\u000a\u000aEnbridge will miss a year-end deadline to begin operating the $2 billion, 256-mile natural gas link between a Marcellus shale natural gas field in eastern Ohio and markets in Michigan and Canada. The project, which would put 3,360 people to work, finished its environmental review in November \u2014 the penultimate regulatory step before construction can begin \u2014 and has been waiting since for the commission to get staffed up.\u000a\u000aNEXUS is one of 18 pipelines and gas projects that have completed environmental reviews since last fall but could not receive FERC\u2019s final OK while it lacked a quorum. Others include TransCanada\u2019s WB Xpress; the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which has six companies behind it; the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, being built by a partnership of Duke, Dominion, Piedmont Gas and Southern Co.; and PennEast, whose backers include Southern Co. and Spectra Energy. Each of these projects will carry natural gas out of the Marcellus shale to population centers in the East or Midwest.\u000a\u000aAn unusual deep-water LNG export terminal that Delfin LNG wants to build at Port Delfin in Louisiana has its Department of Energy approval, but it needs FERC to sign off onshore parts of the project before construction can begin.\u000a\u000aMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aTogether, the projects stand to employ more than 23,000 people in mostly temporary construction jobs and would inject more than $13 billion in investments into the economy, according to the companies behind them.\u000a\u000aFor many of these pipelines, the lack of a quorum may have cost them a year of work: Summer and fall are ideal times to build in much of the country. Foul weather stops construction in winter, and environmental considerations often make spring work untenable.\u000a\u000aThe delays provided a temporary win to the growing ranks of anti-pipeline protesters, who have been arrested at FERC meetings and sometimes even camped outside of commissioners\u2019 homes to protest approvals of the infrastructure necessary to move all the new natural gas unlocked by the fracking boom.\u000a\u000aSome of those same activists were hoping Senate Democrats would do everything possible to keep the open seats from ever being filled. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom activists cite as an ally, opposed the two nominated commissioners in committee, and he opposes a bipartisan energy bill that would speed up pipeline approvals.\u000a\u000aKeeping FERC without a quorum slowed that process.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs long as there\u2019s no quorum established, no pipelines are being approved. That helps us,\u201d said Karen Feridun, founder of Berks Gas Truth, an anti-fracking group out of Berks County, Pennsylvania, that is part of the umbrella FERC Vacancies Coalition.\u000a\u000aPipeline approvals are not the only backlog awaiting Trump\u2019s new FERC commissioners. They will also be thrust into the center of testy regional and state-level battles over programs designed to address climate change by subsidizing nuclear power plants, and potentially price carbon emissions.\u000a\u000a\u201cFERC, and what\u2019s subject to its jurisdiction, kind of got dragged into the climate debate,\u201d the industry official said, noting that the agency has found itself the target of ever-increasing interest on Capitol Hill from \u201cthose in Congress who wanted to stop the [Obama administration\u2019s] Clean Power Plan and were unable to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVLouise Linton, wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, caused controversy on Aug. 21 when she boasted of traveling on a government plane and tagged high-end fashion designers. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aLouise Linton has proved herself to be an exceptionally obnoxious human being.\u000a\u000aShe has done this by posting on Instagram a boastful photo of herself stepping off a government plane ahead of her husband, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201cUnited States of America\u201d is emblazoned on the fuselage. He\u2019s in a dark suit and red tie. Her long hair is blowing back in a gentle breeze. It\u2019s all looking rather presidential, truth be told. The picture is also reminiscent of fashion advertisements. And Linton captioned it with a litany of designer credits.\u000a\u000aThe couple was returning from Kentucky, where Mnuchin made the case for tax reform. Linton, in case anyone was wondering, is not a tax expert; she is a Scottish-born actress and producer. Her post was, of course, criticized. And in response, she unleashed a condescending tirade that essentially amounted to: I\u2019m rich. You\u2019re not. Shut up and go watch \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u000a\u000aLinton\u2019s Instagram account is now private. After a thorough lashing in the media, after her name trended on Twitter, and not in a good way, Linton apologized for her post. But the hell storm has already been unleashed. Oh, Louise.\u000a\u000aIn the picture, Linton is a study in white and beige, from her platinum locks to her studded sandals. She has helpfully tagged the various designer brands she\u2019s wearing. Thus, everyone knows she\u2019s dressed in Roland Mouret trousers, Valentino sandals and Tom Ford sunglasses. She is carrying an Hermès scarf. She doesn\u2019t mention it, but she\u2019s also toting a white Hermès Birkin. But you knew that, right?\u000a\u000aA lot of bragging occurs on Instagram, with users regularly sharing pictures of glorious vacations, mouthwatering meals, adorable babies and pets, and many, many fashion highlights. This is the nature of social media, and folks are generally pretty forgiving about an excessive amount of look-at-me obsessiveness. But Linton isn\u2019t just anyone. She is married to the treasury secretary. This doesn\u2019t mean she is a celebrity or even in the public eye \u2014 despite her acting credits. It means she is spotlight-adjacent. It means people will only pay attention to her if, for better or worse, she consciously scooches over into the limelight.\u000a\u000aLinton has been doing a lot of scooching.\u000a\u000a[Treasury secretary\u2019s wife stirred controversy before, with memoir of her \u2018living nightmare\u2019 in Africa]\u000a\u000aBefore her June wedding, she gave Town and Country magazine a peek inside her jewelry box along with lengthy descriptions of how she acquired each diamond bracelet, necklace and pair of earrings. The message was not that Linton has several pieces of deeply meaningful jewelry; it was that Linton has lots of diamonds and pearls and aren\u2019t they gorgeous? She then married Mnuchin in a black-tie wedding at the District\u2019s Mellon Auditorium to which she wore a custom white-lace princess gown with a plunging V-neck by Toronto-based designer Ines Di Santo. We know all about the gown and its provenance because Linton purchased the dress through the Georgetown bridal shop Carine\u2019s Bridal Atelier, which posted a quote thoughtfully provided by Linton on its Instagram account: \u201cI was thrilled that there was a bridal salon right here in DC that could call on designers to fly in gowns for inspiration to create my custom looks.\u201d Most brides typically just say, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u000a\u000aLinton is a regular presence at Mnuchin\u2019s side, and not just at major events such as the inauguration, when she was still his fiancee, but also at hearings and commissioning ceremonies. She is always camera-ready. And she appears to have multiple Birkins and an affection for the work of designer Roland Mouret.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMnuchin and Linton, wearing a rose-colored Roland Mouret Atkinson dress, land on the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford for its commissioning in July. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMnuchin arrives with Linton and her Birkin bag at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee in May. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\u000a\u000aTo be clear, Linton\u2019s Instagram post was not obnoxious because of the designer shout-outs. Those were ill-considered, but fashion folks do that all the time as they delight in some splendid new bauble. Everyone should be free to chirp with glee. And it\u2019s not as though anything she was wearing was startling or exceptional in the great scheme of fashion. (Sorry, Louise.) Indeed, those Valentino rock-stud strappy sandals have been around so long and had such commercial success that they are practically the iPhone of designer footwear.\u000a\u000aInstead, it was Linton\u2019s impulse to lash out at JenniMiller29, who had all of 379 followers, with an extensive commentary about Linton and Mnuchin\u2019s financial contribution to the economy that set people\u2019s teeth on edge. \u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self-sacrifice to your country? \u2026 Pretty sure that the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours,\u201d Linton wrote.\u000a\u000aShe made the sneering suggestion that a person\u2019s income is the best measure of their value and stature, which is to suggest that the millions of dollars Mnuchin made in banking and hedge-funding reflect his actual cultural and societal value rather than the nature of a capitalist economy \u2014 an economy that typically undervalues teachers, mothers, home health-care aides, day-care providers, etc. Linton implied that becoming treasury secretary for the world\u2019s largest economy was a breathtaking sacrifice in service to his country. (And I guess she took a blow for the nation by marrying one.) Surely it has its challenges, but part of sacrificing in the name of patriotism is not talking about how much you\u2019re sacrificing in the name of patriotism.\u000a\u000aIn a single Instagram post, Linton managed to tap into elitism, narcissism, self-righteousness, incivility, apathy and blonde privilege \u2014 all wrapped up in a designer package. Linton was so pleased with how chic she looked deplaning that she wanted to share that image on social media. The whole running-the-country thing was straight out of central casting. The couple looked the part. But even the best actors will tell you that beautiful costumes can\u2019t compensate for a lousy narrative.\u000a\u000aUpdated at 4:45 p.m. to note Linton\u2019s apology.

aVFormer Irish Prime Minister John Bruton testifies at a hearing on U.S.-EU relations in Washington, D.C. | Matthew Cavanaugh/EPA EU CONFIDENTIAL UK may decide Brexit vision isn\u2019t achievable: Irish ex-PM Britain\u2019s decision among biggest \u2018seismic shifts\u2019 in region in past century, John Bruton tells POLITICO\u2019s EU Confidential podcast.\u000a\u000aBritain has yet to answer fundamental questions raised by its departure from the EU and may yet conclude its current vision of Brexit is unachievable, former Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with POLITICO\u2019s EU Confidential podcast, Bruton said Brexit was \u201cone of the greatest seismic shifts in relationships in Northern Europe that has occurred in the last 100 years. It represents, in a very real sense, a profound divorce.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said any upside for Ireland, in terms of jobs and firms that relocate from the U.K., would be far outweighed by disadvantages such as additional customs controls, bureaucratic burdens on business and disruption to pan-Irish agricultural markets.\u000a\u000aBruton, also a former EU ambassador to the United States, said there was at least a moral argument that Britain should compensate Ireland and other EU members for costs imposed on them by Brexit. He said there was \u201cconsiderable annoyance in Ireland that a decision that Britain is taking is going to impose these costs on us.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Britain may come to the realization that Brexit, as they sold it to themselves, isn\u2019t feasible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Britain itself would have to come to that conclusion. Britain is not going to be told, Britain has to learn, by doing \u2014 or attempting to do \u2014 what they propose, that what they\u2019ve been proposing isn\u2019t workable.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf that happened, he said, it would be up to Britain to conclude whether it should change tack to pursue a softer Brexit or abandon Brexit altogether.\u000a\u000aAsked about the recent flurry of position papers from the U.K. government, Bruton said: \u201cThey\u2019re not about substance, they\u2019re about procedure. The substance is what level of tariff you\u2019re going to charge, will Britain pursue a cheap food policy? Will Britain automatically accept standards laid down by the EU and rulings laid down by the European Court of Justice? Those are the substantial questions and those have not been addressed yet.\u201d\u000a\u000aBruton said the onus was on London to explain how it could reconcile its vision of tariff-free trade between the EU and Britain with World Trade Organization rules, which state that any trade concessions offered to one trading partner have to be offered to all.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil Britain comes up with a way of explaining how their ideas on having access to the EU market can be reconciled with the most favored nation principles of the WTO, it\u2019s very hard for us on the European side to do much work on this,\u201d said Bruton, who was Irish prime minister from 1994 to 1997 and the EU\u2019s envoy in Washington from 2004 to 2009.\u000a\u000a\u2018Moral responsibility\u2019\u000a\u000aBruton said that even if the U.K. envisaged no controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, there would still have to be checks somewhere on goods coming into the European Union.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether the hard border occurs at the border, or 10 or 15 or 50 miles either side of the border, you are still going to have to have a system to check whether goods entering the European Union in Ireland from the U.K. meet EU standards of safety, meet EU standards of rules of origin, and have paid \u2026 all the relevant EU tariffs, which in some cases are very high indeed,\u201d he said, speaking from Ireland earlier this week.\u000a\u000aHe said Ireland\u2019s financial sector would likely gain from companies moving from the U.K. as a result of Brexit but those gains would not be enough to offset large disruption to trade and agriculture.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the benefits, if there are benefits from Brexit, will possibly be concentrated in a small number of urban areas whereas the losses, which will be much, much greater, will be spread throughout the whole country,\u201d Bruton said.\u000a\u000aOn whether Britain should compensate Ireland and other EU members for the additional costs caused by Brexit, he said: \u201cIf you look at what happens if somebody in business pulls out of a contract and thereby imposes costs \u2026 there could at least be a moral responsibility on Britain.\u201d\u000a\u000aBruton said Britain\u2019s attitude to Brexit was intimately linked to deeper questions of identity, particularly for England.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis issue of Brexit is all wrapped up with the English sense of who they are and their place in the world. And, in a way, Brexit is being used as a means of discovering a new identity. And that\u2019s a psychological process rather than an economic one,\u201d he said. \u201cBritain has got to work out for itself who it wants to be.\u201d\u000a\u000aSubscribe to POLITICO\u2018s EU Confidential podcast on iTunes or find it on Soundcloud.

aVODESSA, Ukraine \u2014 In the Ukrainian tourist destination of Odessa, a port on the Black Sea, holidaymakers mingle with internally displaced people from the country\u2019s war-torn east, local Roma, students, and economic migrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus, Africa and Asia.\u000a\u000aYet the air carries something less healthy than sea breezes: tuberculosis.\u000a\u000aOdessa has the highest rate of TB in Ukraine, with 110 cases per 100,000 people in 2016, and rising fast. Closely linked with migration, instability and poverty, controlling this airborne disease takes on additional urgency this year as Ukraine seeks to integrate into Europe thanks to a new visa-free regime. Part of a migration corridor from Central Asia and the Caucasus to Russia and Western Europe, Ukraine has at least 5 million citizens working abroad, according to its foreign ministry: in Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Russia and Germany. Another 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the war in the east of the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine should pay special attention to TB because it\u2019s a very sensitive topic for Europe\u201d \u2014 Alexey Bobrik, World Health Organization\u2019s technical officer\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine should pay special attention to TB because it\u2019s a very sensitive topic for Europe,\u201d said Alexey Bobrik, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) technical officer for HIV, TB and viral hepatitis in Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m talking about global security and transmission of TB through borders.\u201d\u000a\u000aTuberculosis was largely wiped out in Western Europe in the early 20th century through treatment, improved health monitoring and awareness, and higher living standards. Since the Soviet Union collapsed the disease has returned with a vengeance in former Soviet states. Ukraine declared a TB epidemic in 1995.\u000a\u000aSince then, the country has received huge amounts of international aid to tackle TB and its twin epidemic, HIV. But weak political will and chronic distrust of the country\u2019s corrupt health system has held back progress. While overall TB rates are gradually falling, in places like Odessa they continue to rise. More worryingly, Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the world for multi-drug resistant (MDR) forms of TB, which do not respond to traditional treatment.\u000a\u000aA quarter of newly diagnosed cases of TB in Ukraine in 2016 were MDR-TB, according to WHO. Cure rates for resistant forms are the lowest among all MDR-TB burden countries: 38 percent. In Odessa, where TB-HIV co-infection is rife, the overall TB cure rate last year was just 43 percent. \u201cThat basically shows you how effective the health system is here, which is a shame for a European country,\u201d Bobrik said.\u000a\u000aUnchanged system\u000a\u000aUkraine\u2019s TB system has changed little since Soviet times. It\u2019s based on in-patient treatment lasting months or even years in TB clinics and sanatoriums, often located in once-beautiful historical buildings that are in disrepair and unsuited to modern infectious disease control and patient needs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t provide proper treatment conditions,\u201d said Dr. Oksana Leonenko-Brodetskaya, who heads Odessa city\u2019s TB clinic. It\u2019s housed in a peeling pink classical building in the city center. \u201cWe\u2019ve no individual isolated wards, and no phasing system of existing wards, and so cross-infection occurs.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to modern international standards, isolated in-patient treatment is not the answer to TB anyway \u2014 early and accurate diagnosis, early treatment and retention of patients on an ambulatory basis is. Most patients stop being infectious within days or weeks of starting treatment. In a country with no job or social security, and in a city like Odessa with a large migrant population, expecting patients to stay for months in poorly equipped hospitals is unrealistic, unnecessary and hugely expensive.\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Bobrik said. \u201cYou can spend your funding on TB dispensaries and a lot of health workers who sit in these dispensaries and don\u2019t go to patients. Or instead of that, you can create an out-patient model.\u201d\u000a\u000aRetaining out-patients requires a change of approach. More than 20 percent of newly diagnosed patients in Odessa in 2016 were migrants and non-residents of the city. Many \u2014 although far from all \u2014 are among the most disadvantaged members of society: the homeless, drug users, former prisoners. The stigma around TB is another reason patients try not to be associated with TB treatment centers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey all try to disappear,\u201d Leonenko-Brodetskaya said of her patients, claiming many register with false addresses and fall off the grid as soon as they start to feel better.\u000a\u000aEveryone concerned with TB in Odessa speaks about a taxi driver or a market trader still working with active TB and a fake health certificate, because they can\u2019t afford to stop. The stories may be apocryphal but Maria Kochetova, who spent three months in a TB ward earlier this year, recalled patients there who stopped taking medication, checked out early or simply disappeared. Even among patients, there\u2019s an instinct to blame other patients for spread of the disease.\u000a\u000aKochetova also recalled several patients dying of a disease which, if caught early enough, should be treatable. Kochetova\u2019s doctors didn\u2019t expect her to survive either. The 34-year-old called an ambulance only after weeks of what she told herself was flu. She\u2019d never considered herself at risk from TB: She wasn\u2019t homeless; she didn\u2019t use drugs; she had a regular job as a cleaner.\u000a\u000aDoctors told her it started with an earlier bout of pneumonia she\u2019d left untreated because she couldn\u2019t afford it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019d cost money if I ended up in hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who does this; everyone keeps going until they fall down because they know hospital is so expensive.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Free\u2019 treatment\u000a\u000aUkrainian health care is theoretically free. In practice, patients pay for services and medication through an entrenched system of kickbacks to medical staff trying to supplement painfully low salaries. Kochetova was fortunate that once she did end up in hospital, her active TB was diagnosed within three days instead of three weeks, and TB treatment is genuinely free. But during those three days, she says she had to pay more than 1,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (\u20ac33) for various services \u2014 that\u2019s two weeks\u2019 wages for a junior medical worker.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey fleece you for everything,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aNon-hospitalized patients have to make daily trips to clinics to get medicines, which are supposed to be taken under observation to ensure patients complete treatment courses of up to two years for MDR-TB. Failure to complete courses leads not just to further illness but to more development of drug-resistant forms. The daily travel is onerous, especially for those with no income or fixed living place, or from rural areas.\u000a\u000aPrograms run by state clinics and nongovernment organizations in Odessa provide a solution: psycho-social support and incentives for patients to adhere to treatment by bringing medicines to their homes and providing other aid such as food parcels, bus tickets or mobile phone credit. Odessa city has also tried to incentivize medical staff. Under a pioneer bonus system to boost primary care diagnosis rates, family GPs receive 2,000 hryvnia (\u20ac66) for every fast, accurate TB diagnosis and referral. Last year, city authorities paid 200 bonuses from the 1,113 newly diagnosed cases.\u000a\u000aIn future, the city wants to keep TB treatment and monitoring within the ambulatory primary health care system, with bonuses for medical staff based on successful treatment outcomes.\u000a\u000aThese innovations are in line with overall Ukraine health reforms now in legislative limbo. These would change the old Soviet centralized model of funding institutions based on number of staff and hospital beds irrespective of numbers of patients and their needs, to patient-centered, results-based funding. Regions would have more autonomy to allocate funds to primary medicine, and to NGOs to provide services. The reforms should make most key health services genuinely free for patients.\u000a\u000aAlthough backed by the EU and by international agencies that have largely underwritten Ukraine\u2019s TB and HIV programming, parliament shelved the draft financing laws until the fall, and there is widespread opposition. In Odessa\u2019s medical community, the reforms are surrounded by doubt and rumor, from fears they will cut jobs, to accusations that their real purpose is to sell off valuable real estate now used as clinics.\u000a\u000aExamples from other post-Soviet and eastern bloc countries show that the transition to a new model is indeed painful, but can be achieved. With the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s main health donor funding the majority of HIV and TB response \u2014 due to pull out of the region in 2020, Ukraine has little time left to find a domestic answer to its epidemics and its failing health system.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor Eastern Europe it\u2019s a particularly acute issue,\u201d said Michel Kazatchkine, former director of the Global Fund. \u201cIncreasing epidemics, low coverage with treatment and prevention, no readiness and in some cases no willingness to pay for services for vulnerable people \u2026 nothing is ready.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his current role as U.N. special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Kazatchkine is lobbying for health reform in Ukraine to ease the transition once external funding stops.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would be less pessimistic than I was a year-and-a-half ago because I see changes. I\u2019m seeing more political commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cAIDS and TB are on the agenda.\u201d

aVDr. Kelli Ward and \u201cTeam Ward\u201d will be on site at a rally held by President Donald Trump on Tuesday in Phoenix, Arizona, just days after Trump blasted out a tweet lauding Ward in her primary challenge to Sen. Jeff Flake.\u000a\u000aIt remains unclear whether Trump will cross the bridge to endorsing Ward after a tweet last week calling \u201cFlake Jeff Flake\u201d weak on borders, crime, a non-factor in the Senate and \u201ctoxic\u201d:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aGreat to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000aFlake attempted to steer clear of commenting on the president during a East Valley Chambers of Commerce breakfast on Monday. CNN reported that his response to reporters\u2019 questions about Trump\u2019s tweet was, \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it at all.\u201d\u000a\u000aWard responded to Trump\u2019s tweet with her own gratitude for the president:\u000a\u000aThank you @realDonaldTrump Working hard so you have a conservative from AZ to help #MAGA. Arizonans excited to see you again next week! https://t.co/DZzduT31FN \u2014 Dr. Kelli Ward (@kelliwardaz) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000aFrom January 2013 to December 2015, Ward, a practicing physician, served as an Arizona state senator from the state\u2019s 5th district. She stepped down from her seat during her 2016 primary challenge against Sen. John McCain. Ward earned the highest percentage of votes against McCain of his primary challengers in recent years, but ultimately, McCain prevailed.\u000a\u000aWard is already facing vicious attacks similar to those she faced from McCain supporters as she has set out in her primary challenge to virulent Trump critic Flake for his seat in the U.S. Senate. Mere hours before Trump\u2019s Tuesday rally in Phoenix, Sen. Mitch McConnell-linked Senate Leadership Fund released an ad attacking Ward including on a forum she held to address constituent concerns during her tenure as a state senator. The super-PAC is working with Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads, the New York Times reported.\u000a\u000aWard told Fox & Friends on Monday that she and Team Ward would be on location at President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday. She accused Flake of favoring open borders and amnesty in contrast to her position supporting building the wall along the southern border and stopping illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aWard spoke as a physician as she called the failure to repeal Obamacare \u201cappalling.\u201d She also referenced her track record in the Arizona State Senate as evidence that she will stick to her campaign promises should she be elected to the U.S. Senate:\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, the Ward campaign released a new ad targeting Flake, entitled \u201cArizona Deserves Better.\u201d The ad calls out Flake for the anti-Trump remarks that the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign used in an anti-Trump campaign ad. It also featured Flake\u2019s calling for Trump to withdraw from the 2016 presidential election, saying he would never win Arizona and vowing not to vote for the Republican nominee. The ad asks Flake why he is not working with the Trump administration on reforms that would create U.S. jobs, build the wall along the southern border, and repeal Obamacare.\u000a\u000aIn an early August op-ed for USA Today ,Ward wrote that Flake has thrown in with a few other Republicans and the radical left in an attempt to delegitimize President Trump. She slammed Flake for \u201ctrying to have it both ways\u201d by bashing Trump in his newly released book while lobbying donors with claims of being with the president.\u000a\u000aWard\u2019s chief strategist, Dustin Stockton, told Breitbart News, \u201cWhat our team has been able to accomplish more than a year before the primary election is unprecedented.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve built all the best volunteer, communication, and fundraising infrastructure a modern campaign needs to win, but this race really boils down to one glaring contrast. Dr. Kelli truly wants to represent the people of Arizona. Flake, on the other hand, thinks that the people of Arizona are ignorant and just need to be educated by him and his fellow D.C. elitists.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the national media\u2019s crosshairs nonstop for more than a month,\u201d said Ward\u2019s press secretary, Jennifer Lawrence. \u201cThe attacks from fake news have only served to rally people to our campaign. With every smear from places like CNN, our campaign only gets stronger. Dr. Kelli has enough respect for people to tell them the truth especially when it runs counter to the narratives the media hacks are pushing.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJeff Flake thinks that if CNN and MSNBC are singing his praises, that he must be doing something right,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cHe\u2019s in for a bad time when he says anything that doesn\u2019t parrot their current narrative. His new friends are going to turn on him so fast, it\u2019ll make his head spin.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump will tour U.S. Customs and Border Protection Border equipment in Yuma, Arizona, on Tuesday afternoon. He will then hold a meet and greet with Marines before going on to Phoenix for a campaign-style Make America Great Again rally.\u000a\u000aPolitico reported just last month that while backstage at a fall 2016 presidential campaign rally in Phoenix, Trump suggested he may be willing to spend $10 million of his own money to back a Flake primary challenger.\u000a\u000aFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.

aVLONDON \u2014 Instagram's fashion stars can be a source of style inspo, ideas and useful tips.\u000a\u000aWhile fashion bloggers' feeds are replete with effortless-yet-flawless photography, reality couldn't be further from the glamorous lives portrayed via social media.\u000a\u000aWhether bloggers are publishing posts sponsored by brands, or parading outfits paid for by brands during fashion week, shrewd bloggers and brands have turned social media into a big-buck business.\u000a\u000aThis monetisation of fashion blogging \u2014 a.k.a. "influencer marketing" \u2014 has caused something of a rift in the fashion industry, with Vogue's creative digital director lashing out at fashion bloggers who are killing the fashion industry.\u000a\u000a"Note to bloggers who change head-to-toe, paid-to-wear outfits every hour: Please stop. Find another business."\u000a\u000a"Note to bloggers who change head-to-toe, paid-to-wear outfits every hour: Please stop. Find another business. You are heralding the death of style," Sally Singer \u2014 Vogue's creative digital director \u2014 wrote in an editors' piece about Milan Fashion Week.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn an even more scathing rebuke, Alessandra Codinha \u2014 Vogue.com fashion news editor \u2014 hailed fashion bloggers' behaviour during fashion week "embarrassing" and "funny."\u000a\u000a"Rather than a celebration of any actual style, it seems to be all about turning up, looking ridiculous, posing, twitching in your seat as you check your social media feeds, fleeing, changing, repeating," wrote Codinha.\u000a\u000aBut this incessant checking of social media has nothing to do with vanity \u2014 it's pure business.\u000a\u000aSEE ALSO: This French Instagram profile is not what you think it is\u000a\u000aMashable talked to a spokesperson for Influencer Marketing Agency \u2014 an agency that matches brands with bloggers, vloggers and influencers \u2014 to find out just how much money is behind the posts filling our Insta feeds.\u000a\u000aAccording to a spokesperson for the agency, the fee per post is "highly dependent" on the audience the brand wishes to reach and the platform on which the influencer is publishing.\u000a\u000a"This of course includes reach, strength of relationship with their followers and credibility," the spokesperson told Mashable.\u000a\u000a#ad In love with my #karllagerfeld bag! @karllagerfeld #karlrobot now on Karl.com A photo posted by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Feb 1, 2016 at 8:51am PST\u000a\u000a"Influencers can earn anywhere from below \u20ac100 ($110) to 100 times this amount (\u20ac10,000, $11,006) for content they create in collaboration with a brand," the spokesperson confirmed.\u000a\u000aJenny Woods, founder of the social media startup for marketing teams Zaapt, told Mashable that a fashion and lifestyle Instagram star with 1.3m followers was recently paid £5,000 ($6,104) for an Instagram post.\u000a\u000a"Another brand paid £17,000 ($20,749) for a reality TV star to tweet and Instagram about their brand in a series of posts. The influencer has 1.2m followers on Instagram," Woods continued.\u000a\u000aWoods says that an influencer with more than 1 million followers can expect to earn between £5,000 ($6,104) and £20,000 (£24,406) per post.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to adding a price tag to an Instagram post, the more followers the better. And, the massive reach commanded by social media savvy celebrities like Kim Kardashian West can carry a six-figure sum.\u000a\u000aChris Kyriacou \u2014 founder of iSocial social media agency \u2014 told Mashable that the fee depends entirely on how engaged the influencer's audience is, and on the "value" of certain influencers.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, a marketing expert told Page Six that the Kardashians earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per Instagram post.\u000a\u000a"Now, for $400,000, you get the Kardashians to post on Instagram," the source told Page Six, referencing makeup, clothing and music as items she frequently posts about.\u000a\u000aTime to start building your social media following, perhaps.\u000a\u000a

aVJared Kushner (left) has led much of the Trump administration's Middle East peace efforts, but national security adviser H.R. McMaster is seeking to increase input on the matter from the National Security Council. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images McMaster adds muscle to Kushner\u2019s Middle East peace effort NSC staffer Victoria Coates\u2019 move to Kushner\u2019s office has tied Trump\u2019s Middle East strategy more closely to the traditional White House foreign policy apparatus.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 Jared Kushner has spent eight months as his father-in-law\u2019s point person in the Middle East, relying primarily on one envoy, former Trump Organization lawyer Jason Greenblatt, to do the diplomatic heavy lifting in the region.\u000a\u000aBut just over a month ago, national security adviser H.R. McMaster held a meeting in his West Wing office with Greenblatt to discuss some changes to how the administration would conduct its Israel strategy going forward \u2014 including more input from the National Security Council.\u000a\u000aIn the meeting \u2014 also attended by National Security Council officials Ricky Waddell, Michael Anton and Victoria Coates \u2014 the group discussed moving Coates, a former policy adviser to Sen. Ted Cruz, to work full-time under Greenblatt.\u000a\u000aGreenblatt and David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, had already pitched the idea privately to Coates. By bringing on Coates, Greenblatt would get a senior point of contact on the NSC who would be fully devoted to his project. McMaster, too, was pleased with the arrangement: It helped integrate what Greenblatt and Kushner had been doing with his NSC desk.\u000a\u000aThe group saw it as a win-win-win, and the move was quickly finalized. Coates, an art historian and a longtime Republican foreign policy adviser, was promoted to senior director of international negotiations and moved offices to sit with Greenblatt\u2019s team in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, across the street from the White House.\u000a\u000aThe move, White House officials and outside advisers said, underscored the administration\u2019s commitment to brokering a Middle East peace deal, even amid recent setbacks in the region. And it showed the unorthodox administration giving a bigger partnership role in the region to the NSC \u2014 the traditional forum where foreign policy decisions are brokered.\u000a\u000a\u201cRenewed U.S. engagement with our Middle East allies is welcome and badly needed,\u201d said Josh Block, president and CEO of The Israel Project, a nonpartisan educational organization. \u201cThe task requires someone in the White House who can manage the many diverse levels of the bilateral relationship, and the decision to move Victoria Coates to the center of the portfolio is a signal that these issues will get the attention and seriousness they need.\u201d\u000a\u000aKushner, along with Greenblatt and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, left Washington on Sunday night for a trip to the region, including meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia before their expected arrival in Israel on Wednesday night. Coates remained home, offering support to the traveling team and managing the information flow.\u000a\u000aBut even with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration devoting more foreign policy firepower to the region, Middle East experts said they harbored low expectations for what deliverable the latest trip might yield \u2014 or what the Trump administration will be able to accomplish in the long run.\u000a\u000aLast month\u2019s crisis at the Temple Mount, where two Israeli police officers were shot by Arab Israeli citizens at the holy site in Jerusalem, was seen as a major setback to any peace deal, especially to U.S. efforts to get the Israelis working more closely with the Palestinians. In reaction to the Israeli government\u2019s decision to install metal detectors at the holy site following the shooting, Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, froze contacts with Israel.\u000a\u000aIsrael finally agreed to remove the metal detectors after a series of high-level discussions and a trip by Greenblatt to the region, just as violent protests erupted and the situation was escalating. Coates joined the American team just as the crisis was erupting, and helped to provide grounding, perspective and some history with the players involved, people involved in the process said.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Coates gave most of the credit to Greenblatt for the successful de-escalation. \u201cHe gets criticized all the time for not being a career diplomat,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if a career diplomat could have handled that situation as ably as he did. We are no longer in a crisis mode.\u201d\u000a\u000aCoates is a spirited choice to work with Kushner and Greenblatt, two Trump loyalists who are new to politics and foreign policy. Former colleagues described her as whip-smart but high-intensity and sometimes territorial, noting that she threatened to resign from Cruz\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign if she was excluded from an early debate prep session.\u000a\u000aDuring the campaign, a former Cruz operative said, she was also livid when the Texas Republican endorsed Trump and cited national security as one of his reasons for supporting the Republican nominee. She was furious, people familiar with the incident said, that her boss made a statement on national security without consulting her first.\u000a\u000aIn her new role, she is just as eager to be a main player in the room. \u201cThese issues have always been a passion of mine, something I worked on very closely\u201d with both former Gov. Rick Perry and Cruz, she said. \u201cLow expectations do not make me unhappy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere are, however, new holdups on both sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is embroiled in a burgeoning corruption investigation at home, which includes charges of bribery and fraud.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis rallying the base shows he feels the need to shore up his support,\u201d said Dennis Ross, who served as the Middle East envoy under President Bill Clinton. \u201cThat does make him more dependent on the right wing at this point. And that will make any possible concessions to the Palestinians very difficult, unless the administration can produce meaningful public Arab outreach toward Israel.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe key to that, Ross said, is moving Gulf Arab leaders to play a role on the issue, essentially giving Abbas cover from the Arab world to make concessions to Israel. The latest American trip to the region reflected that agenda, with stops first in the Gulf states before Kushner\u2019s arrival in Israel.\u000a\u000aKushner will also be arriving in the region amid high tensions with the Palestinians, who have expressed frustrations with Greenblatt and seem to be losing hope in the ongoing meetings.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have met with Trump envoys about 20 times since the beginning of his term as president of the United States,\u201d Abbas said in a meeting with the left-wing Meretz Party in Israel, according to a report in Haaretz. \u201cEvery time they repeatedly stressed to me how much they believe and are committed to a two-state solution and a halt to construction in the settlements. I have pleaded with them to say the same thing to Netanyahu, but they refrained.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbbas added: \u201cI can\u2019t understand how they are conducting themselves with us,\u201d according to Haaretz. \u201cInside [Trump\u2019s] country, there is chaos in the administration.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe purpose of Kushner\u2019s trip, according to a White House official, is to \u201cfocus on the path to substantive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, combating extremism, the situation in Gaza, including how to ease the humanitarian crisis there,\u201d as well as to explore economic steps that could be taken leading up to any potential peace deal.\u000a\u000aThe trip marks Kushner\u2019s third trip to the region. He accompanied Trump to Jerusalem during the president\u2019s first foreign trip in May, and then he traveled to Israel for a 24-hour visit with Greenblatt in June.\u000a\u000aEven if there appears to be no obvious partner for peace in the region at the moment, Trump does not seem ready to table his peace plans. And until then, the growing American team will continue its diplomatic treks to the Middle East.\u000a\u000aThe president \u201cbelieves that the restoration of calm and the stabilized situation in Jerusalem after the recent crisis on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif has created an opportunity to continue discussions and the pursuit of peace,\u201d a White House official added.

aVCaps on troop levels in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria mandated by the Obama administration have led to an elaborate Pentagon accounting system that conceals thousands of troops from the public \u2014 one that is quickly unraveling as the Trump administration prepares to send more troops to the region.\u000a\u000aWith new plans to ramp up the war in Afghanistan, the military is finding it exceedingly difficult to maintain a practice that purposely doesn't count certain troops in the battle zone that military officials insist was not designed to be misleading but many critics now assert is at best an officially sanctioned charade.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe U.S. already has as many as 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, significantly higher than its 8,400-person cap. If President Donald Trump sends nearly 4,000 additional troops, as officials predict, the total will be nearly double the current public number. In Iraq, where the Baghdad government faces political resistance to a large American troop presence, the 5,200 troop figure the Pentagon uses in public serves as a useful fiction. In fact, more than 7,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq, according to recent reports.\u000a\u000aAnd in Syria the official 503 U.S. troops mostly covers special operations units. But hundreds of other troops who support them and their local allies remain classified \u2014 including the Marine artillerymen and Army Rangers whose vehicles are frequently photographed by local journalists.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can deal with operational security, while still maintaining democratic accountability about how we fight wars," said Jason Dempsey, an Afghanistan veteran who is now a researcher at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cAccurate troop level numbers are something the public absolutely deserves to know."\u000a\u000aThe discrepancy, which has come under new scrutiny amid leaks about actual troop levels, has led Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to review the policy and promise to offer more accurate official numbers. But after Trump announced this week that his administration will not talk about troop numbers, Mattis\u2019 initiative is in doubt.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

That includes troops like construction engineers who are building a bridge or repairing an airfield, as well as the combat units like Marine artillery batteries that have deployed to Syria \u2014 even though those very Marines have been featured in glitzy official videos.\u000a\u000aU.S. military leaders insist there was good reason for the policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cSometimes journalists would say to me, \u2018Aha, the military is trying to hide the numbers of troops deployed,\u2019 but that wasn\u2019t the reason for it,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, who was U.S. the commander in Iraq and Syria from 2015-16 and is now deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt just didn\u2019t make sense to increase the Force Management Level when you were just bringing in some engineers for a little while to build a facility and then take them out," he said.\u000a\u000aThe policy has also had practical effect on commanders in the field.\u000a\u000aAs U.S.-led forces closed in on strongholds of the Islamic State last year, the American commander of the war effort requested permission to insert a small number of attack helicopters \u2014 three or four, according to a source involved in the discussion \u2014 into northern Syria.\u000a\u000aUnder other circumstances, a request for such a small movement of forces from a top commander would have been a no-brainer. But it took an extended debate at the highest levels of the Pentagon and the White House\u2019s National Security Council to approve it.\u000a\u000aOne crucial reason for the delay: The Obama administration had placed a cap on the number of U.S. forces that would operate in Syria. And the pilots and ground crews accompanying the Apache gunships would bust the limits.\u000a\u000aThe delay didn\u2019t get any Americans killed or unduly affect the course of the campaign against the Islamic State, but the episode, described by the top Pentagon Middle east official at the time, Andrew Exum, highlighted the contortions the military has engaged in to comply with troop caps that the Obama administration first instituted in 2011 in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aCommanders\u2019 frustrations with the policy have extended beyond glitches like the holdup with the Apaches.\u000a\u000aInfantry brigades deploying to both Iraq and Afghanistan have long left as many as half of their personnel stateside or, more recently, in Kuwait. They then occasionally rotate small groups of extra personnel into the combat zones on a short-term basis when they are needed, which keeps them under the cap.\u000a\u000aDuring Senate testimony last year, Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander in Afghanistan, described another problem. When he took command in Kabul in 2016, he said, the one U.S. aviation brigade in the country didn\u2019t have its own mechanics. Forced to leave them behind because of the troop cap, it was instead relying on more expensive contractor mechanics \u2014 with about two contractors filling in for every missing soldier.\u000a\u000aNicholson brought that problem and others to Mattis\u2019 attention soon after he became secretary of Defense, the general testified. Mattis took heed and in the months since, according to defense officials, has been pressing his subordinates to provide him with more accurate counts of American troops deployed to Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aTwice in the past two weeks he has suggested that he will release those numbers publicly.\u000a\u000a\u201cI had to change the accounting process because we couldn\u2019t figure out how many troops we had there,\u201d Mattis told reporters last week, referring to \u201cdifferent pockets\u201d of troops who were counted under different tallies.\u000a\u000aInformed that only the incomplete numbers were still being released, Mattis seemed surprised and said he would provide the more accurate numbers.\u000a\u000aBut revealing the true numbers as Mattis has promised could create complications \u2014 especially in Iraq, where Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\u2019s government faces an election next year and widespread suspicion about the role of U.S. troops in the country now that Mosul has been freed from the Islamic State.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhenever I made a request for more forces, the first thing I would be asked by my chain of command rightly was, \u2018Well, what does the prime minister think?\u2019\u201d recalled MacFarland, the former top commander in Baghdad. \u201cWe\u2019d talk to other Iraqi leaders as well. And if the prime minister was amenable and we could build some consensus, generally the U.S. government would be amenable to raising the Force Management Level as well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAbadi is walking several fine lines and more U.S. troops coming back to Iraq does not poll well among Iraqis,\u201d said Ramzy Mardini, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council who follows Iraqi politics.\u000a\u000aBut there may be little reason to worry for now.\u000a\u000aIn Trump's primetime speech on Monday laying out his long-awaited plan for the war in Afghanistan, he busked expectations by not discussing how many reinforcements he has authorized \u2014 up to 3,900 \u2014 and seemed to suggest that the lack of overall transparency on troop levels will continue.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities,\u201d Trump said in his address.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s suggestion that his administration may stop releasing troop numbers is consistent with rhetoric he used on the campaign, when he lambasted the Obama administration for talking about the impending advance into the ISIS-held city of Mosul and told opponent Hillary Clinton during a debate that she was \u201ctelling the enemy everything you want to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s remarks on Monday put the brakes on the plan to start disclosing more accurate numbers, at least as far as Pentagon spokesmen are concerned.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s comments speak for themselves,\u201d spokesman Adam Stump said Thursday. \u201cWe are still awaiting guidance on the numbers.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut earlier in the week \u2014 the day after Trump\u2019s speech \u2014 Mattis himself told reporters that he still planned on disclosing \u201cthe total number\u201d of troops currently in Afghanistan, if not the number of reinforcements being sent.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, estimates of the real troop numbers keep leaking out \u2014 including from members of Trump\u2019s own National Security Council, suggesting that not everyone in the administration is taking the president\u2019s \u201cwe will not talk about numbers\u201d remark as seriously as the Pentagon press team.\u000a\u000aIn a background call with media the morning after Trump\u2019s speech, one of his own White House subordinates acknowledged that the actual number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan exceeds 10,000.\u000a\u000aExum, the former Obama Pentagon official, warned that becoming less transparent, as Trump suggested in his speech, would be a step in the wrong direction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to talk about numbers with the government of Afghanistan, like we talked about numbers with the government of Iraq, and with the NATO partners, and with both the authorizing and appropriating committees on the Hill,\u201d Exum said. \u201cSo if they\u2019re going to do that, I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t be a little more transparent with the American people.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPrior to January 20, 2017, there was a lamentable lack of social-media scandals involving our public servants in the federal government. Then Donald Trump moved into the White House and, of course, everything changed. Now, we\u2019ve come to expect that the president of the United States will go on late-night rants when he is feeling piqued, attacking everything from North Korea to media outlets to retailers who stopped selling his adult daughter\u2019s handbags, occasionally deploying ALL CAPS to signal his seriousness or scare quotes to underscore his contempt. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the tone set by the president seems to have trickled down to his Cabinet members and their spouses, too. For instance, whereas in times past, the wife of the Treasury secretary might have felt an obligation to not lash out at an Instagram commenter in a diatribe boasting about her vast wealth, now we have this:\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, attacking a woman who wrote \u201cglad we could pay for your little getaway\u201d after Linton posted a photo Monday night about wearing #hermes, #valentino, #roulandmouret, and #tomfordsunnies on an official government-chartered #daytrip to Kentucky. For those of you keeping score at home, Linton manages to both complain about how much she sacrifices in taxes while shaming the woman for not earning as much; suggest that she and her husband, who made a significant amount of money at Goldman Sachs before running a \u201cforeclosure machine,\u201d have given more to their country than their haters ever could; employ the strategic use of the curled bicep emoji, the blowing kisses face, and \u201cLololol\u201d; and, of course, the coup de grâce\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re adorably out of touch.\u201d The woman Linton responded to was later identified by The New York Times as Jenni Miller, a mother of three from Portland, Oregon.\u000a\u000aIncidentally, this is not the first time that Linton, whose husband is currently attempting to orchestrate a massive tax cut that would shift trillions to the rich, has accidentally made a case for more progressive taxation. In June, ahead of her nuptials to Mnuchin, the 36-year-old actress sat down with Town & Country to talk about all of the many diamonds she would be wearing for the big day, including but not limited to her very large engagement ring, her diamond wedding band, a diamond bracelet, two pairs of diamond earrings, a couple of diamond necklaces, a pair of diamond earrings she had turned into a cocktail ring, and a diamond brooch of two parrots kissing a pearl. (Nor is it the first time she\u2019s found herself at the center of controversy, having self-published a memoir about her gap year in Africa that was widely mocked as a stereotype-laden white savior fantasy, and which resulted in calls for Zambia to demand an apology from Scotland, where Linton was born and raised.)\u000a\u000aAfter Linton\u2019s Monday night tirade went viral, she deleted the post and made her account private. Presumably, at some point this week, she\u2019ll vent to the president about all the jealous \u201chaters and losers\u201d who just don\u2019t get why the rich are better than them. \u201cI think my post was just five or six words, and she had to go on basically a rant about it to make herself look more important and look smarter, better, richer\u2014all those things,\u201d Miller, a Democrat, told the Times. \u201cIt just seemed wholly inappropriate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Treasury department said Tuesday that Mnuchin and Linton are paying back the government for transportation costs when she travels with him on official business, an expense that hopefully won\u2019t hit her #hermes budget too hard.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday evening, Linton issued a statement saying \u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive.\u201d

When the mayor\u2019s office pointed out that Trump had misquoted the London mayor, Trump accused Khan of making a \u201cpathetic excuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aKhan has said a state visit to the U.K. \u2014 offered by Prime Minister Theresa May and accepted by Trump \u2014 should not go ahead.\u000a\u000aBut a spokeswoman for the mayor told POLITICO they were looking forward to a \u201cconstructive relationship\u201d with the new ambassador, as they had done with the former envoy and the charge d\u2019affaires (the acting ambassador).\u000a\u000aIt is standard practice for an ambassador to meet national and senior local leaders when they arrive in a capital, but the encounter between Johnson and Khan will be closely watched given Trump\u2019s outspoken tweets.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s man\u000a\u000aJohnson, who owns the New York Jets American football team and is worth $4.2 billion, according to Bloomberg, is due to arrive in London this week, with Tuesday his first official day on the job.

aVPresident Donald Trump's aggressive drive to roll back environmental regulations is moving too fast even for some in the oil and gas industry.\u000a\u000aPublicly, petroleum companies and their trade groups are cheering Trump\u2019s efforts to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental regulations, including restrictions on fracking-related pollution, pipeline permits and offshore drilling. But quietly, people in the industry are growing worried that deregulation could backfire on them, according to interviews with a dozen executives, lobbyists, lawyers and analysts.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAmong their fears: Laxer rules could set the stage for an environmental disaster like 2010\u2019s BP oil spill in the Gulf, which blackened the industry\u2019s reputation and spurred a regulatory clampdown.\u000a\u000a"Every industry wants regulations that make sense, but you don't need to roll things back so far that it opens an opportunity for outsiders to criticize, or something bad happens," said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst at the investment firm Edward Jones.\u000a\u000aA person at one oil and gas company expressed similar worries. "It's not helpful if regulations are streamlined so as to allow something to happen \u2014 say, a methane explosion or a spill \u2014 and we'd be painted with it as an entire industry," said the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely.\u000a\u000aIn addition, some large companies that have already spent money to comply with Obama-era regulations fear being undercut by unscrupulous competitors if the Trump administration reverses those rules. And an industry that prizes regulatory certainty is uneasy with Trump's efforts to renegotiate lucrative trade deals like NAFTA and reorganize the agencies responsible for overseeing offshore drilling.\u000a\u000aAnother source of industry unease is Trump\u2019s slowness to fill key positions across the government, which has delayed decisions on regulatory matters such as pipeline safety standards.\u000a\u000aMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aOne example where oil and gas lobbyists and industry sources said the administration may be expending too much effort is its quest to dismantle an Obama-era Interior Department rule tightening methane emission standards for oil and gas wells and pipelines on public lands.\u000a\u000aCongress failed to repeal the rule earlier this year after three GOP senators joined Democrats in voting to keep it in place. Now Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke says he will try to rewrite it, a process that would take years \u2014 leaving the industry unsure of what will requirements it will someday have to meet.\u000a\u000aTwo of the industry\u2019s biggest trade associations, the American Petroleum Institute and the Western Energy Alliance, publicly cheered Zinke's decision to change the regulation. \u201cIt is definitely our focus to rewrite or rescind those rules," said WEA President Kathleen Sgamma, whose group has met with Interior officials and is involved in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the methane rule.\u000a\u000aBut behind the scenes, people at ExxonMobil, BP and other large oil and gas companies consider the rule a relatively minor issue, lobbying and industry sources said.\u000a\u000aThose companies have the technology and engineering in place to meet the standards, which would require them to capture planet-warming methane pollution before it escapes to the atmosphere, and they have expected to pay down their compliance costs by selling the methane, people in the industry said. Companies operating in Colorado have already had to comply with a state rule that closely matched the federal standards.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration estimated that the industry would spend up to $279 million per year to comply with the rule, while the overall net benefit would reach up to $1.2 billion over a decade.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, the industry has unequivocally supported some of Trump's rollbacks. Oil and gas developers have universally praised the administration's plans to open up more federal waters in Alaska for drilling, along with its support for allowing more exports of liquefied natural gas.\u000a\u000aBut Trump's sluggish pace in staffing up his administration has some worried whether he will be able to follow through.\u000a\u000a"There's definitely people concerned about it," said Tyler Nelson, a former aide to Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) who is now a vice president at lobbying firm Cornerstone Government Affairs. "If you don't have enough people in place across the executive branch, it's hard to implement and get things done right."\u000a\u000aA White House spokesperson did not reply to questions.\u000a\u000aThe administration just this month was able to restore a quorum at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency in charge of approving natural gas pipelines, whose inability to conduct any major business since February had delayed $13 billion worth of projects.\u000a\u000aThe White House still hasn't nominated a permanent administrator for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the agency responsible for inspecting and setting safety standards for pipelines, nor has it tapped anyone to lead key agencies at Interior that oversee energy production on federal lands or offshore.\u000a\u000aThe 12 largest oil and gas companies and trade associations cut their lobbying by an average of 30 percent in the second quarter compared with the first three months of the year, according to an analysis of their lobbying disclosure forms. A large part of the reduction was because there was no work to do on pipeline projects, according to Nelson and other lobbyists.\u000a\u000aOi and gas allies fear that laxer rules could set the stage for an environmental disaster like 2010\u2019s BP oil spill in the Gulf, which blackened the industry\u2019s reputation and spurred a regulatory clampdown. | Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the administration is pursuing several regulatory revisions that were never on the industry's wish list. Those could result in severe setbacks for the industry, several lobbyists and congressional aides said.\u000a\u000aThe most potentially damaging policy push is the administration's attempt to rip open the North American Free Trade Agreement for a redo. The U.S., Mexican and Canadian energy markets have become strongly enmeshed over the past decade, and the talks that just began to reopen NAFTA could unleash a Pandora's box of issues that could threaten business relations, industry sources said.\u000a\u000aValero and other refiners are shipping ever-increasing volumes of U.S.-made gasoline and natural gas to Mexico. Valero itself just signed a deal to bring tankers of gasoline into the Mexican port of Veracruz. Fellow U.S. refining company Andeavor \u2014 formerly Tesoro \u2014 is now building gas stations in Mexico as well, reversing years of that country's dependence on the state-owned oil company Pemex.\u000a\u000aThe last thing Andeavor, Valero and other refiners want to see happen is Trump ratcheting up trade tensions with tough talk that could sour the relationship, people in the industry said.\u000a\u000a"In most respects, companies that engage in cross-border trade are most concerned with ensuring that this [NAFTA renegotiation] process does no harm," said Josh Zive, senior principal at lobbying firm Bracewell.\u000a\u000aAnother action that has some in the industry scratching their heads is Interior's review of whether to combine its Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which leases space on the federal Outer Continental Shelf to energy companies, with its Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, which regulates the companies' activities.\u000a\u000aBOEM and BSEE were created during the Obama era under then-Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Interior spent millions of dollars and countless staff hours to carve the two agencies out of the notorious Minerals Management Service after a series of scandals in the Bush administration and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion created the impression that regulators were too close to the oil industry.\u000a\u000aEfforts to reunite the two bureaus would probably be as costly as it was to split them, all the while distracting agency staff from processing lease sales, lobbyists said. And no one seems to know why Interior called for the review in the first place.\u000a\u000a"We did not ask for it," said National Ocean Industries Association spokeswoman Nicolette Nye, echoing others in the industry. "We were surprised when it was first mentioned by DOI. That was the first we heard of it."\u000a\u000aZinke told POLITICO in June he was considering the merger as part of a larger reorganization of Interior agencies. He is also taking another look at regulations the Obama administration put in place after Deepwater Horizon, including a BSEE well control rule that required oil companies to have up-to-date spill-prevention technology in place.\u000a\u000aZinke had planned to release details of any reorganization by the end of summer, but a BOEM spokesman said last week that he had no further information on when those details may be made public. BSEE plans to convene a forum Sept. 7 in Houston to gather input on whether to rewrite its offshore drilling rules.\u000a\u000aIf the two agencies merge, the Trump administration and companies operating offshore oil rigs will most likely be on the political hook after the next offshore drilling accident, industry officials said.\u000a\u000a"When there's \u2014 God forbid \u2014 the inevitable accident in the Gulf of Mexico, why would you want to be known as the administration that made that move?" said one lawyer representing oil and gas companies.\u000a\u000aIn the end, these sorts of rollbacks could backfire, said Jason Bordoff, former senior director for energy and climate change in Obama\u2019s National Security Council and now the founding director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.\u000a\u000a"An approach that is, basically, 'What are the regulations put in place by the previous administration, here's the list, let's go down the list and repeal them,' doesn't build public confidence in the industry," Bordoff said.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aV\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil the election, we\u2019re bringing you \u201cThe Trump Files,\u201d a daily dose of telling episodes, strange but true stories, or curious scenes from the life of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aThe construction of Trump Tower may have been Donald Trump\u2019s greatest achievement, but it was a disaster for the city\u2019s artistic legacy.\u000a\u000aTo build his skyscraper, Trump first had to knock down the Bonwit Teller building, a luxurious limestone building erected in 1929. The face of the building featured two huge Art Deco friezes that the Metropolitan Museum of Art wanted to preserve. The museum asked Trump to save the sculptures and donate them, and the mogul agreed\u2014as long as the cost of doing so wasn\u2019t too high.\u000a\u000aBut then, according to journalist Harry Hurt III in his book Lost Tycoon, Trump discovered that taking out the sculptures would delay demolition by two weeks. He wasn\u2019t willing to wait. \u201cOn his orders, the demolition workers cut up the grillwork with acetylene torches,\u201d Hurt wrote. \u201cThen they jackhammered the friezes, dislodged them with crowbars, and pushed the remains inside the building, where they fell to the floor and shattered in a million pieces.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe art world was shocked. \u201cArchitectural sculpture of this quality is rare and would have made definite sense in our collections,\u201d Ashton Hawkins, the vice president and secretary of the Met\u2019s board of trustees, told the New York Times.

Others who have not been as vocal publicly about their stance but are thought to agree include Vice President Mike Pence, who as a congressman worked on a failed immigration deal that called for citizenship, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn, a Democrat who serves as director of the National Economic Council.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are holding this out as a bargaining chip for other things,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman with the Federation for American Reform, a group that opposes protecting Dreamers and is in talks with the administration.\u000a\u000aOn the other side, a smaller group \u2014 including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his former aides, Stephen Miller, who serves as Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, and Rick Dearborn, White House deputy chief of staff \u2014 opposes citizenship, according to sources familiar with the discussions.\u000a\u000aRead the rest of the story here.

aVTudorel Toader, the Justice Minister of Romania | Ghement Robert/EPA Romania\u2019s judicial reform plans prompt anti-corruption backlash Romanian president called proposed reforms an \u2018attack on the rule of law.\u2019\u000a\u000aBUCHAREST \u2014 Romanian Justice Minister Tudorel Toader proposed changes to three laws Wednesday, prompting accusations from the Romanian president and opposition parties that the government was attempting an \u201cattack on the rule of law\u201d and was following in the footsteps of the Polish government.\u000a\u000aThe proposals come just seven months after the biggest protests since the fall of communism in the country forced Romania\u2019s Social Democrat (PSD) government to scrap an emergency decree about the definition of abuse of office, which was widely seen as a way to decriminalize some acts of corruption.\u000a\u000aThis time, there\u2019s controversy over one of Toader\u2019s main proposals, which is to scrap the president\u2019s authority to appoint the top anti-corruption prosecutor.\u000a\u000aThe job is currently held by Laura Codru\u0163a Kövesi, who leads the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA). Kövesi has overseen the prosecution of numerous high-level politicians, including former Prime Minister Victor Ponta. Last year, 30 high-ranking officials were indicted on corruption-related charges, including former energy and transport ministers as well as the deputy governor of Romania\u2019s central bank.\u000a\u000aKövesi has, however, come under heavy criticism from politicians, who accuse her of pursuing a politically-motivated agenda and of relying on intelligence agencies to gather evidence.\u000a\u000aToader\u2019s proposed change, which still has to be approved by the Romanian government and the parliament, would see the justice minister nominate a candidate to lead the DNA, who would then be appointed by the Superior Magistrates Council. The president currently has the authority to appoint the prosecutor, based on a proposal from the justice minister and the opinion of the council.\u000a\u000aToader said his reform proposals are for laws from 2004 that need updating, especially since Romania became an EU member country in the meantime.\u000a\u000aHe also said his proposal to take the president out of the procedure for picking the anti-corruption leader is in line with the demands of a European Commission program monitoring Romania\u2019s progress in tackling corruption since it joined the EU in 2007. The program, known as the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, \u201crequires a transparent way to name prosecutors to their jobs\u201d and recommends that there be no political involvement in it, Toader said.\u000a\u000aRomanian President Klaus Iohannis condemned the proposals in a statement, saying that it is not the president who provides the political element in the appointment procedure, but rather the justice minister, who is appointed based on a vote in parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe proposals presented today by the minister of justice constitute an attack on the rule of law, the independence and proper functioning of the judiciary, as well as the anti-corruption fight,\u201d Iohannis said. If these measures pass, \u201cRomania\u2019s efforts for more than 10 years would be cancelled and the justice [system] will go back in time,\u201d to an era when it was under political control, he said.\u000a\u000aThe Romanian president is involved in the appointment of chief prosecutors because he is in charge of mediating between the powers of the state, Iohannis added.\u000a\u000aElek Levente, the interim president of the Union Save Romania, the second largest opposition party in the parliament, said it was \u201crevolting\u201d that Toader was using the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, which is meant to eliminate political involvement in the justice system, to do exactly the opposite. \u201cThe return of justice under political control brings Romania closer to the Polish model, where the ruling party attempted a total seizure of the judiciary through a legislative coup,\u201d Levente said.\u000a\u000aHis party will start a no-confidence vote against the justice minister, which is unlikely to topple Toader, since the governing PSD and its junior coalition partner, the liberal democrat ALDE, enjoy majority support in the parliament.\u000a\u000aEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said that he wants to end Romania\u2019s anti-corruption monitoring mechanism by the end of his mandate in 2019 if the country can prove that its progress in fighting corruption will stick.

aVA confidential assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency says that North Korea has already developed a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can fit on top of an ICBM. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aA confidential assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency says that North Korea has already developed a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can fit on top of an ICBM. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles, crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, U.S. intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessment.\u000a\u000aThe analysis, completed last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency, comes on the heels of another intelligence assessment that sharply raises the official estimate for the total number of bombs in the communist country\u2019s atomic arsenal. The United States calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Some independent experts think the number is much smaller.\u000a\u000aThe findings are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving North Korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predicted. U.S. officials concluded last month that Pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the American mainland.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump, speaking Tuesday at an event at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., said North Korea will face a devastating response if its threats continue. \u201cThey will be met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier Tuesday, North Korea described a new round of U.N. sanctions as an attempt \u201cto strangle a nation\u201d and warned that in response, \u201cphysical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[North Korea says it won\u2019t give up nuclear weapons]\u000a\u000aAlthough more than a decade has passed since North Korea\u2019s first nuclear detonation, many analysts thought it would be years before the country\u2019s weapons scientists could design a compact warhead that could be delivered by missile to distant targets. But the new assessment, a summary document dated July 28, concludes that this critical milestone has been reached.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,\u201d the assessment states, in an excerpt read to The Washington Post. Two U.S. officials familiar with the assessment verified its broad conclusions. It is not known whether the reclusive regime has successfully tested the smaller design, although North Korea officially claimed last year that it had done so.\u000a\u000aThe DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.\u000a\u000aAn assessment this week by the Japanese Ministry of Defense also concludes that there is evidence to suggest that North Korea has achieved miniaturization.\u000a\u000aKim is becoming increasingly confident in the reliability of his nuclear arsenal, analysts have concluded, explaining perhaps the dictator\u2019s willingness to engage in defiant behavior, including missile tests that have drawn criticism even from North Korea\u2019s closest ally, China. On Saturday, China and Russia joined other members of the U.N. Security Council in approving punishing new economic sanctions, including a ban on exports that supply up to a third of North Korea\u2019s annual $3 billion in earnings.\u000a\u000a[What the new U.N. sanctions on North Korea mean]\u000a\u000aThe nuclear progress further raises the stakes for Trump, who has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with nuclear weapons. In an interview broadcast Saturday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHugh Hewitt Show,\u201d national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the prospect of a North Korea armed with ­nuclear-tipped ICBMs would be \u201cintolerable, from the president\u2019s perspective.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to provide all options . . . and that includes a military option,\u201d he said. But McMaster said the administration would do everything short of war to \u201cpressure Kim Jong Un and those around him, such that they conclude it is in their interest, to denuclearize.\u201d The options said to be under discussion range from new multilateral negotiations to reintroducing U.S. battlefield nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, officials familiar with internal discussions said.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, the administration has been attempting to push North Korea toward talks, but Pyongyang has shown no interest in dialogue.\u000a\u000a[North Korea could cross ICBM threshold next year, U.S. officials warn]\u000a\u000aDetermining the precise makeup of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal has long been a difficult challenge for intelligence officials because of the regime\u2019s culture of extreme secrecy and insularity. The country\u2019s weapons scientists have conducted five nuclear tests since 2006, the latest being a 20- to 30-kiloton detonation on Sept. 9, 2016, that produced a blast estimated to be up to twice that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.\u000a\u000aBut producing a compact nuclear warhead that can fit inside a missile is a technically demanding feat, one that many analysts thought was still beyond North Korea\u2019s grasp. Last year, state-run media in Pyongyang displayed a spherical device that government spokesmen described as a miniaturized nuclear warhead, but whether it was a real bomb remained unclear. North Korean officials described the September detonation as a successful test of a small warhead designed to fit on a missile, although many experts were skeptical of the claim.\u000a\u000aKim has repeatedly proclaimed his intention to field a fleet of nuclear-tipped ICBMs as a guarantor of his regime\u2019s survival. His regime took a major step toward that goal last month with the first successful tests of a missile with intercontinental range. Video analysis of the latest test led some analysts to conclude that the missile caught fire and disintegrated as it plunged back toward Earth\u2019s surface, suggesting that North Korea\u2019s engineers might not be capable yet of building a reentry vehicle that can carry the warhead safely through the upper atmosphere. But U.S. analysts and many independent experts think this hurdle will be overcome by late next year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat initially looked like a slow-motion Cuban missile crisis is now looking more like the Manhattan Project, just barreling along,\u201d said Robert Litwak, a nonproliferation expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the author of \u201cPreventing North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Breakout,\u201d published by the center this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of urgency behind the program that is new to the Kim Jong Un era.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough few discount North Korea\u2019s progress, some prominent U.S. experts warned against the danger of overestimating the threat. Siegfried Hecker, director emeritus of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the last known U.S. official to inspect North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities, has calculated the size of North Korea\u2019s arsenal at no more than 20 to 25 bombs. He warned of potential risks that can come from making Kim into a bigger menace than he actually is.\u000a\u000a[Some experts see Russian echoes in North Korea\u2019s missile advances]\u000a\u000a\u201cOverselling is particularly dangerous,\u201d said Hecker, who visited North Korea seven times between 2004 and 2010, and met with key leaders of the country\u2019s weapons programs. \u201cSome like to depict Kim as being crazy \u2014 a madman \u2014 and that makes the public believe that the guy is undeterrable. He\u2019s not crazy and he\u2019s not suicidal. And he\u2019s not even unpredictable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real threat,\u201d Hecker said, \u201cis we\u2019re going to stumble into a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the past, U.S. intelligence agencies have occasionally overestimated the North Korean threat. In the early 2000s, the George W. Bush administration assessed that Pyongyang was close to developing an ICBM that could strike the U.S. mainland \u2014 a prediction that missed the mark by more than a decade. More recently, however, analysts and policymakers have been surprised repeatedly as North Korea achieved key milestones months or years ahead of schedule, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There was similar skepticism about China\u2019s capabilities in the early 1960s, said Lewis, who has studied that country\u2019s pathway to a successful nuclear test in 1964.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no reason to think that the North Koreans aren\u2019t making the same progress after so many successful nuclear explosions,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe big question is: Why do we hold the North Koreans to a different standard than we held [Joseph] Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union or Mao Zedong\u2019s China? North Korea is testing underground, so we\u2019re always going to lack a lot of details. But it seems to me a lot of people are insisting on impossible levels of proof because they simply don\u2019t want to accept what should be pretty obvious.\u201d\u000a\u000aYuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aRead more:\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is fast approaching Trump\u2019s red line\u000a\u000aTwenty-five million reasons the U.S. hasn\u2019t struck North Korea\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s rockets are getting an important boost \u2014 from China

aVNow that the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula has been at least temporarily defused thanks to Kim Jong Un\u2019s announcement that he would wait and see before launching missiles toward Guam\u2014despite ominous North Korean propaganda as the U.S. and South Korea launch their latest joint military exercises\u2014it\u2019s time to step back and ask ourselves the big questions about just how useful our approach to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program has been so far.\u000a\u000aMy answer: Not very useful at all. During the past 15 years, North Korea first built the bomb and then expanded it to a nuclear arsenal that threatens the region, while Washington has continued to deny reality with its call for complete denuclearization. Which is why it\u2019s time to take a long and serious look at the next option: talking with North Korea.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAlthough a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Secretaries Jim Mattis and Rex Tillerson earlier this month served to lower tensions by stating that the United States was still pursuing peaceful denuclearization, it does not introduce any new elements that could bring the two sides closer to ending the nuclear crisis. The op-ed, which reassured Kim that \u201cthe U.S. has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea,\u201d is a welcome relief from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cfire and fury\u201d warning to Kim. But this approach is likely to fare no better in compelling Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons than the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo\u2014how can we make real progress?\u000a\u000aWashington should drop its preoccupation with North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threat. It is misplaced and dangerous. Instead, Trump administration officials should talk with Pyongyang, face to face, without any preconditions, to avert what I consider the greatest North Korean nuclear threat\u2014that of stumbling into an inadvertent nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, which may lead to hundreds of thousands deaths including thousands of American citizens.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s important to understand why Kim is so obsessed with these weapons: to deter the United States from attacking North Korea and what Pyongyang calls \u201chostile policies.\u201d Striking the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile would be suicide, and there\u2019s no evidence that Kim is suicidal.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s a lot to indicate that North Korea isn\u2019t close enough to developing ICBM-capable missiles to strike the United States even if it wanted to. The panic over North Korea\u2019s missiles was elevated recently when leaked classified U.S. intelligence estimates were reported to indicate that Pyongyang has already achieved such capabilities, in addition to possessing as many as 60 nuclear weapons in its arsenal. But I don\u2019t concur with those estimates.\u000a\u000aBased on my 50 years of experience with nuclear technologies and nuclear weapons, combined with what I saw and learned during my seven visits to North Korea beginning in 2004, I don\u2019t believe Pyongyang has yet mastered the key elements of delivering a nuclear-tipped ICBM to the continental United States. Although North Korea demonstrated significant progress in the missile field with two launches in July, experts have raised serious questions about whether it has demonstrated all the missile and re-entry vehicle technologies that will protect the nuclear warheads during the fiery plunge into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u000a\u000aMoreover, the nuclear warhead that must be mounted on the missile is the least developed and least tested part of North Korea\u2019s nuclear ICBM ambitions. It must survive the extreme temperatures and mechanical stresses involved during launch, flight and re-entry into the atmosphere. It must detonate above the target by design, not accidentally explode on launch or burn up during reentry. More missile tests are needed that mirror real ICBM conditions to permit measurements that more accurately define the extreme conditions that the delicate materials such as plutonium, highly enriched uranium and chemical high explosives experience inside the warheads. It is much simpler to detonate a nuclear device in an underground tunnel under controlled conditions than to simulate all of the conditions a warhead experiences on the way to its target.\u000a\u000aWhat makes matters even more challenging for Pyongyang is that it has very little plutonium and highly enriched uranium. I have estimated that North Korea has 20 to 40 kilograms plutonium and 200 to 450 kilograms highly enriched uranium. My analysis is based on what I saw during my visits to the Yongbyon nuclear complex and on extensive discussions with their nuclear experts. These stocks have to serve multiple uses: They must be shared between experiments required to understand the world\u2019s most complex elements, nuclear tests to certify the design of the weapons and stock for the arsenal. My best estimate, albeit with considerable uncertainty, is that the North\u2019s combined inventories of plutonium and highly enriched uranium suffice for perhaps 20 to 25 nuclear weapons, not the 60 reported in the leaked intelligence estimate.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea will need a few more nuclear tests because its experience with either material, plutonium or highly enriched uranium, for warheads is too limited for ICBM use. Nuclear test site preparations appear complete, but Pyongyang is most likely weighing the technical benefits against the political risks of conducting such tests. Whereas I believe North Korea has insufficient test data for ICBM warheads, we must assume it has already learned enough to mount a warhead on its shorter-range missiles that can reach all of South Korea and Japan because these missiles are able to accommodate bigger nuclear warheads and these would experience less stringent operational conditions.\u000a\u000aIn other words, the North still has a ways to go to pose a serious ICBM threat, but it is clearly working in that direction. The danger is that in his drive to achieve a greater balance with the United States by perfecting a missile capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental U.S., Kim could miscalculate where Trump\u2019s red line actually is, triggering a retaliatory action by Trump that could escalate to a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. Our problem is that we know nothing about Kim and the military leaders who control his nuclear arsenal and drive the missile and nuclear development programs. It\u2019s time to talk and find out.\u000a\u000aAnd we have to talk now, without demanding that North Korea agree to any preconditions, such as those suggested by Mattis and Tillerson \u2013 namely, an immediate cessation of its provocative threats, nuclear tests, missile launches and other weapons tests. Pyongyang is not about to make unilateral concessions before talks. One should read Kim\u2019s announcement that he will wait with the missile launches as a positive signal, although he added that the U.S. must stop its \u201carrogant provocations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe diplomatic opening created last week on both sides makes such talks possible. President Trump should send a small team of senior military and diplomatic leaders to talk to Pyongyang. These talks would not be negotiations\u2014not yet. Importantly, these talks would not be a reward or a concession to Pyongyang and should not be construed as signaling acceptance of a nuclear-armed North Korea. Talking would, however, be a necessary step toward re-establishing critical links of communication to avoid a nuclear catastrophe. The dialogue should stress the need for mechanisms to avoid misunderstanding, miscalculation or misinterpretation of actions that could quickly bring us over the cliff into a nuclear war.\u000a\u000aThe talks would provide an opportunity to convey Secretary Tillerson\u2019s message that Washington does not seek regime change face to face in Pyongyang. In simplest terms, the team could underline the message that Washington is deterred from attacking the North, but not from defending the United States and its allies. It should reiterate that any attack on South Korea or Japan, be it with conventional, chemical or nuclear weapons, would bring a devastating retaliatory response upon North Korea.\u000a\u000aThe team can also impress upon Pyongyang that ensuring the safety and security of nuclear weapons is an awesome responsibility. These two issues are becoming more challenging as North Korea strives to make its nuclear arsenal more combat-ready. A nuclear-weapon accident in the North would be disastrous, as would a struggle to control the North\u2019s nuclear weapons in the case of attempted regime change from within or without. All indications are that such talks would be strongly supported by the North\u2019s two most important neighbors, South Korea and China, particularly if Washington consults them before.\u000a\u000aFor too long, America\u2019s policy toward North Korea has been based on impractical goals. Complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization was a hallmark of the George W. Bush administration\u2019s approach to North Korea and was also pursued by the Obama administration. Whereas complete and verifiable denuclearization might be realistic long-term goals, irreversible is impossible short of the total loss of human memory. The U.S. Manhattan Project produced the bomb in 27 months more than 70 years ago, and that was without knowing with certainty at the outset that it was even possible.\u000a\u000aIt was under Bush that North Korea first built the bomb and under Obama that it expanded to a threatening nuclear arsenal. Both presidents failed to address the root cause of Pyongyang\u2019s determined effort to build a nuclear weapons arsenal\u2014assuring the Kim regime\u2019s security. Now, Trump faces a North Korea with the ability to inflict unacceptable damage to U.S. allies and U.S. assets in the region, while it also continues its drive to threaten the continental U.S. Perhaps, much as Dwight Eisenhower talked to Nikita Khrushchev, Richard Nixon to China\u2019s Mao Zedong, and Ronald Reagan to Mikhail Gorbachev, Trump can take the next step with North Korea, and talk now to avert a nuclear catastrophe.\u000a\u000aSiegfried Hecker is Senior Fellow Emeritus of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University. He was director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997.\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Nuclear Weapons\u000a\u000aNorth Korea

aVDonald Trump speaks at a 'Make America Great Again' rally in Phoenix | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Shutdown threat grows as Trump digs in on wall Fight over border wall likely to explode in September.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s vow Tuesday to close down the government if he doesn\u2019t get money for the border wall mirrors private comments he has made to advisers in recent days \u2014 and could cause significant rifts within his own party if he follows through.\u000a\u000aThe fight over the wall is likely to explode in September as the administration wrangles over a new budget, an increase in the debt ceiling, the beginning of a tax reform package and a possible resuscitation of health care legislation.\u000a\u000aTrump has told his advisers he will not accept a deal on other issues without money for the wall \u201cand it has to be real money,\u201d said one senior White House official.\u000a\u000aTrump has told senior White House officials and advisers he would be willing to go to whatever lengths are necessary to get money for the wall, a contentious claim even among his advisers.\u000a\u000aHe hasn\u2019t identified specific amounts of money that he wants, but he seeks \u201cenough to really start building it,\u201d said one person who spoke to him last weekend.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is animated about the wall,\u201d the person said. \u201cHe cares about that more than many other things. He knows his base cares and chants about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, the president reiterated to his loyalists that he is committed to his vision for securing the border. \u201cIf we have to close down our government,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019re building that wall.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome said Trump\u2019s preoccupation is in keeping with what he has said since before the election last year. \u201cIt should surprise exactly no one,\u201d presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway said. \u201cWhy are people surprised when they try to change his mind on something significant and fail?\u201d\u000a\u000aFew staff members in the West Wing are as concerned about it, senior administration officials said.\u000a\u000aSome in the White House have urged Trump not to focus as much on the wall, try to pass a clean debt-ceiling bill and move to tax reform. \u201cYou have barely anyone here saying, \u2018Wall, wall, we have to get the wall at all costs,\u2019\u201d one White House official said.\u000a\u000aIt would be impossible to get Democrats on board for such a plan, Capitol Hill aides say, and Republicans will probably need Democratic support to enact a budget or raise the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000aRepresentative Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who leads the conservative Freedom Caucus, praised the idea Tuesday \u2014 and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has promised to try to get money for the wall. The House passed a bill in July that delivers some wall funding, but it has little chance of becoming law.\u000a\u000aTrump, on the campaign trail, said that Mexico would pay for the wall \u2014 a promise that has been widely mocked for its improbability.\u000a\u000aTwo people who have spoken to Trump said he sees not building the wall as a personal embarrassment \u2014 and that he has shown more interest in building the wall than in other issues, like the upcoming budget negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t want a government shutdown,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cHe is told that. He says, \u2018I want money for the wall.\u2019\u201d

aVDespite the global spread of nuclear hardware and knowledge, at least half of the nuclear weapons projects launched since 1970 have definitively failed, and even the successful projects have generally needed far more time than expected. To explain this puzzling slowdown in proliferation, Jacques E. C. Hymans focuses on the relations between politicians and scientific and technical workers in developing countries. By undermining the workers' spirit of professionalism, developing country rulers unintentionally thwart their own nuclear ambitions. Combining rich theoretical analysis, in-depth historical case studies of Iraq, China, Yugoslavia and Argentina and insightful analyses of current-day proliferant states, Achieving Nuclear Ambitions develops a powerful new perspective that effectively counters the widespread fears of a coming cascade of new nuclear powers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHighlights the puzzling decline over time in the efficiency of nuclear weapons projects\u000a\u000aDemonstrates the insufficiency of narrow technical analyses of proliferation capacity, focus on management promises to revolutionize nuclear proliferation intelligence\u000a\u000aOffers detailed case studies of Iraq, China, Yugoslavia and Argentina, and additional shadow case studies of Libya, Pakistan, North Korea and Iran\u000a\u000aAwards\u000a\u000aWinner of the 2013 Don K.

aVWhen Vlora Çitaku was just 18 years old, she became a refugee in Macedonia following the outbreak of the Kosovo war.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe magnitude of terror was just unseen,\u201d Çitaku, now Kosovo\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., recalled of the genocide of ethnic Albanians by Serbian forces. \u201cThousands were killed. Thousands of women were raped.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAnd early in her life, Mathilde Mukantabana, Rwanda\u2019s ambassador to the United States, faced a similar expulsion from her homeland.\u000a\u000aMukantabana, a member of the Tutsi ethnic group, was forced to leave school in Rwanda as a child and live as a refugee in Burundi. Reflecting back on that time, Mukantabana remembered: \u201cPeople really didn\u2019t trust any of the institutions that were in place. They didn\u2019t trust the church. They didn\u2019t trust the state. They didn\u2019t trust even sometimes the family.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 1994, as she began a new life in the United States, several members of Mukantabana\u2019s family were massacred in the Tutsi genocide, committed by Rwanda\u2019s Hutu majority.\u000a\u000aIn the latest episode of the Women Rule podcast, the two ambassadors tell their deeply personal stories about life after genocide. Çitaku and Mukantabana explain what got them through those trying times and how they continued to live \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in the face of those devastating circumstances. Along the way, they point out how women were integral in rebuilding their societies after war.\u000a\u000aHighlights below:\u000a\u000a2:34 Mukantabana recounts how she first found out about the deaths of her extended family members during the Rwandan genocide.\u000a\u000aThe ambassador, who was then a professor in California, detailed the ethnic cleansing of Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi population and how she herself grew up as a refugee in neighboring Burundi.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe stayed in [Rwanda] until 1973 and that was the year that I was kicked out as a kid; so we left the country, and I never went back,\u201d Mukantabana said. \u201cWe went to Burundi. We lived in refugee camps. Our parents, they didn\u2019t know whether we were dead or alive until later on.\u201d\u000a\u000a8:01 The Rwandan ambassador discussed the difficulties for girls in refugee camps and how the women often banded together.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of my friends who went through the same experiences; as a matter of fact, they have done pretty well even after that,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000a10:20 Mukantabana discusses how she focused on taking action to move forward after the Rwandan genocide.\u000a\u000a12:45 Ambassador Çitaku discusses \u201cthe most painful period\u201d in her childhood \u2013 just before the outbreak of the war in Kosovo \u2013 and how it played out as violence in the schoolyard.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was the most difficult part \u2013 seeing your teacher being beaten up by police in front of you, feeling powerless,\u201d she says. \u201cYour teacher is your hero and you see him being beaten up right there and you want to do something, but then you\u2019re scared.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe went on to describe how native Albanians in Kosovo, despite being targeted by the government, banded together during trying times and developed a \u201cparallel system\u201d of education when they were forced out of the formal education system.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur diaspora organized itself,\u201d Çitaku said. \u201cWe have a very strong and powerful diaspora and then they would give a form of tax and they built up a fund and that\u2019s how my parents, but for all other teachers, started to get some income.\u201d\u000a\u000a20:01 Çitaku recalls her own refugee experience at age 18.\u000a\u000a\u201cI remember the day when Serbian forces came to kick us out, and it was chaos. Thousands of people, and we didn\u2019t have a choice whether we want to go here or there. We were just driven out,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to Macedonia. I remember we were separated also from our parents so it was me and my three sisters. I remember carrying the little one in my arms. We walked almost all day and I remember being exhausted. I remember being scared.\u201d\u000a\u000a24:34 The Kosovo ambassador weighs in on the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d Syrian refugee crisis.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe always say, \u2018Never again. Enough is enough. We will not let this happen,\u2019\u201d Çitaku said.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut history keeps repeating itself on its worst forms.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe called for a political response but also urged regular citizens to open their arms to refugees.\u000a\u000a\u201cPoliticians will need their time to address problems. No one wants to be a refugee. No one chooses to be a refugee. And while we can have an argument on whether this political settlement is better than the rest, there should be no argument whether we should help.\u201d\u000a\u000a26:48 Mukantabana details the role women played after the Rwandan genocide. Women, after a quota system in their parliament was introduced, now make up 64 percent of the country\u2019s governing body and have been instrumental in rebuilding efforts.\u000a\u000a\u201cWomen picked up the pieces,\u201d the Rwandan ambassador said.\u000a\u000a30:15 Does having a majority-women parliament affect the government\u2019s priorities?\u000a\u000aMukantabana says \u201cit changed many things,\u201d including a focus on expanding maternity leave and modifying the laws regarding inheritance and land acquisition.\u000a\u000a32:20 Çitaku explains how Kosovo, after its war, also included a gender quota \u2013 at least 30% of women -- in their new government.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe made sure that women are represented in our state-building process and initiatives,\u201d the ambassador said, but she cautions that sometimes \u201crepresentation doesn\u2019t mean empowerment.\u201d\u000a\u000a39:27 The two ambassadors discuss the change in the White House and weigh whether or not it affects their diplomatic work.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVJulian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Jackson and the Civil War the \u201cheight of inaccurate historical revisionism.\u201d\u000a\u000aWe fact-checked Mr. Trump\u2019s claims with the help of Jon Meacham, the historian whose 2008 biography, \u201cAmerican Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,\u201d won a Pulitzer Prize.\u000a\u000aTrump: \u2018He had a very, very mean and nasty campaign. Because they said this was the meanest and the nastiest.\u2019\u000a\u000aPresident Trump is correct that the 1828 race between Andrew Jackson and the incumbent, John Quincy Adams, was hard-fought and often descended into ad hominem attacks on both sides. The insults leveled at Jackson\u2019s wife, Rachel, were particularly vicious \u2014 she was accused of marrying Jackson before her divorce from her first husband, Lewis Robards, was final.\u000a\u000aTrump: \u2018His wife died. They destroyed his wife, and she died.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe campaign took a notable toll on Rachel Donelson Robards Jackson. She died suddenly, shortly before Christmas in 1828.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Jackson believed that the campaign had killed his wife,\u201d Mr. Meacham said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically right.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump: \u2018I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for this.\u201d \u2019\u000a\u000aJackson died in 1845. The Civil War broke out in 1861.\u000a\u000aMr. Meacham said he thought that Mr. Trump may have been referring to the nullification crisis, which did occur during Jackson\u2019s lifetime.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

People don\u2019t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\u2019\u000a\u000aMr. Trump has questioned the necessity of the Civil War before, in an interview with Mr. Meacham before the election. At the time, President Trump said that he had \u201calways felt that the South overplayed their hand,\u201d he told Mr. Meacham.\u000a\u000aHad Jackson been alive at the start of the Civil War, Mr. Meacham said, it would be difficult to predict his reaction. It would have brought his commitment to the Union into conflict with his identity as an unapologetic slave owner. Mr. Jackson was from Tennessee, which fought for the Confederacy.\u000a\u000aBut any president would have had to contend with the South\u2019s attempt to expand the institution of slavery into territory newly acquired by the United States. It\u2019s what Mr. Meacham called the unavoidable historical question.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe expansion of slavery caused the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. So what does Trump mean? Would he have let slavery exist but not expand? That\u2019s the counterfactual question you have to ask.\u201d

aVI voted for Donald J. Trump because he promoted a foreign policy of restraint. I did not vote for National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster to hijack the Trump agenda to continue failed policies of the past. I voted for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against \u201cnation-building\u201d and am concerned that this administration has lost its way on foreign policy.\u000a\u000aI thought it a big mistake for the United States to promote nation-building policies in North Africa, East Asia, and the Middle East when President George W. Bush pushed them and started the never-ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I worried that the destabilizing policies of President Barack Obama caused chaos, not stability, in Egypt and Libya.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aI voted for Donald J. Trump because he promised change.\u000a\u000aI may have made a mistake.\u000a\u000aShould we retitle National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster as President H.R. McMaster? For all those progressives who rejoiced at the ousting of Stephen K. Bannon from the White House \u2014 How do you feel now knowing that Bannon was a strong opponent of a troop surge in Afghanistan? Not so good?\u000a\u000aThe nation-building hawks have won and now expect the Weekly Standard\u2019s Bill Kristol to cheer the president\u2019s foreign policy conversion from a rhetoric of restraint view to one embraced by the interventionist wing of the Republican party including Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ). So sad.\u000a\u000aDespite the fact that President Trump announced that \u201cwe are not nation-building again,\u201d he is in denial about the fact that he is maintaining the nation-building policies that he campaigned against as a candidate. President Trump\u2019s policy is similar to that of Presidents Obama and Bush.\u000a\u000aI was worried after the missile strike earlier this year against the Syrian government that this administration was slouching toward an interventionist agenda that ignored the folly of investing trillions of dollars in a country half a world away and putting Americans in harm\u2019s way for a goal that is impossible to explain to average Americans.\u000a\u000aThere is no goal in the endless war in Afghanistan. The president is asking Americans to risk their lives, and their children\u2019s lives, for what? What are we fighting for in Afganistan? This is the same failed policy that Trump campaigned against.\u000a\u000aI agree with my former boss Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) who announced today \u201cthe mission in Afghanistan has lost its purpose and I think it is a terrible idea to send any more troops into that war.\u201d And Sen. Paul is parroting the same talking points that Donald Trump spoke on the campaign trail. The same words that won my support for Trump. I may have made a mistake to believe candidate Trump.\u000a\u000aSen. Paul wants to force Congress to reauthorize a war that not many in Congress were around 16 years ago to vote for. He has a resolution that states the following:\u000a\u000aSense of Congress: The President cannot conduct ongoing US military operations against ISIS without an AUMF from Congress authorizing such conduct. Congress should debate and pass a new authorization.\u000a\u000aCongress should reauthorize our nation\u2019s longest war, yet this Congress has proved themselves cowards. They have proven worthless this past year, so don\u2019t expect a vote giving the president some authority to continue the endless war in Afghanistan anytime soon. The leadership can barely debate tax reform, so don\u2019t expect Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to commence a debate on the endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress can\u2019t be relied upon to do their constitutional duty to authorize, or not authorize, a continuing war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aI agreed with candidate Donald J. Trump when he was opposed to continuing the Afghanistan war. That is one reason why I voted for the guy. CNBC reported the many statements candidate Trump made opposed to the war including the following: \u201cAfghanistan is a complete waste. Time to come home!\u201d; \u201cWe should leave Afghanistan immediately. No more wasted lives. If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick. Rebuild the US first\u201d; and \u201cLet\u2019s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA\u201d. That was the guy I voted for \u2013 not the one I saw tonight.\u000a\u000aPolling indicates that many Americans lost confidence in President Trump\u2019s response to the Charlottesville conflict. I am pretty sure that not many Americans will base their vote in 2020 on the events in Charlottesville, VA \u2013 they are more likely to be concerned about the long-term consequences of continuing the policies of endless wars with no end and with no goal.\u000a\u000aPrivate sector candidate Trump would likely tweet at the current President:\u000a\u000aThis President Trump is wrong, wrong, wrong on Afghanistan. Rebuild the U.S. and stop wasting resources a world away. Make AMERICA Great Again!\u000a\u000aPresident Trump made a very bad decision in Afghanistan. I am pretty sure that candidate Donald J. Trump would be very angry with President Donald J. Trump tossing aside one of the pillars of his campaign to please the nation-building lobbyists who want endless war in Afghanistan.

aVUpdated, 11:44 a.m.: Egypt\u2019s president and foreign minister have met with White House envoy Jared Kushner hours after the Trump administration cut or delayed hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Cairo over human rights concerns.\u000a\u000aA modified version of Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry\u2019s schedule Wednesday had earlier showed the meeting with Kushner canceled, which was widely seen as a snub in protest at the aid cuts. But Shoukry later sat in on Kushner\u2019s meeting with President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and met with the American delegation separately at the Foreign Ministry.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aKushner, who is also President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was in Cairo as part of a Middle East tour aimed at exploring ways to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which last collapsed in 2014.\u000a\u000a(AP) CAIRO \u2013 Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday snubbed White House adviser Jared Kushner and U.S. officials who arrived with him in Cairo, apparently in protest over the Trump administration\u2019s move to cut and delay aid to Egypt.\u000a\u000aEgypt\u2019s top diplomat, Sameh Shoukry, was to meet with Kushner and the U.S. delegation, but a modified version of the minister\u2019s schedule showed the meeting had been called off, shortly after the Americans landed in Cairo.\u000a\u000aThe protest came after the Trump administration on Tuesday cut nearly $100 million in military and economic aid to Egypt and delayed almost $200 million more in military financing, pending human rights improvements and action to ease harsh restrictions on civic and other non-governmental groups.\u000a\u000aEgypt\u2019s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi was still due to meet with the American delegation, which also includes Jason Greenblatt, U.S. envoy for international negotiations, and Dina Powell, deputy national security adviser, according to the presidency. That meeting was expected later on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aThe separate statement from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that Egypt regrets the U.S. decision to reduce the aid funds and considers it \u201ca misjudgment of the nature of the strategic relations that binds the two countries over decades, and reflects the lack of understanding of the importance of supporting the stability and success of Egypt.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe American delegation, headed by Kushner, who is also the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, stopped in Cairo as part of a Mideast tour to press Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.\u000a\u000aEgypt is among the top recipients of U.S. military and economic assistance. It receives about $1.5 billion annually, with Washington linking the $1.3 billion in military aid and $250 million in economic aid to Egypt sustaining its security relationship with the U.S. and abiding by the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.\u000a\u000aEgyptian authorities have clamped down on civil society, particularly human rights groups and other organizations that receive foreign funding. Such groups played a central role in the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, and pro-government media often present them as part of a conspiracy to undermine the state.\u000a\u000aThe authorities also arrested thousands of people in the months following the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Most of those in detention are Islamist supporters of Morsi but also include a number of secular and liberal activists.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump met with el-Sissi in the White House in April he made no mention of Egypt\u2019s human rights record in the post-meeting statement, an omission that many took as a sign that the issue was not a priority for the administration. Yet, two months later, two senators from Trump\u2019s Republican Party slammed as \u201cdraconian\u201d a new Egyptian law that effectively bans the work of non-governmental organizations and urged that it be repealed.\u000a\u000aThe law has triggered wide international backlash and raised concerns over human rights conditions in Egypt. But Egypt has defended the law, saying it was drafted and passed in accordance with constitutional provisions.\u000a\u000aEl-Sissi is grappling with an insurgency by Islamic militants in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula, an ailing economy and a rapidly growing population of 93 million. The militants, led by a local affiliate of the extremist Islamic State group, have in recent months targeted Egypt\u2019s large Christian minority, killing scores in a spate of attacks.

aVThe Department of Education then created regulations to aid students who had been left holding large loan balances and worthless diplomas. In addition to granting those students debt relief, the department issued new college performance standards, devised to prevent future fraud from occurring.\u000a\u000aSome fraudulent colleges made enormous sums of money by enrolling tens of thousands of students online \u2014 an approach that can provide many benefits when done well, but also creates potential for abuse.\u000a\u000aIt makes sense that President Trump would turn to Mr. Falwell for advice in this area. Liberty University provided a prominent platform for Mr. Trump to reach evangelical Christians early in the G.O.P. primary campaign.\u000a\u000aAnd Liberty, at first glance, isn\u2019t in the same category as for-profit colleges. It enrolls about 14,000 students, most of whom are evangelical Christians, at its residential campus in Lynchburg, Va. But it also enrolls an additional 65,000 students online. Most colleges now have a mix of residential and online students, but it\u2019s almost unheard-of to have four times as many online students as residential students.\u000a\u000aBecause internet courses are cheap to deliver at scale, the online division is a big revenue driver for Liberty, which brought in $591 million in tuition in 2013, against $470 million in expenses. Liberty is essentially a medium-size nonprofit college that owns a huge for-profit college.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The second-largest online enrollment is at Liberty. Financially, the main difference between the two is that Liberty doesn\u2019t pay taxes. Liberty\u2019s marketing and recruitment are driven by an 800-person telemarketing call center in a former Sears department store near the main campus.\u000a\u000aMost of the tuition for Liberty\u2019s online students comes from financial aid provided by the federal Department of Education, the same body that Mr. Falwell says is engaged in \u201coverreaching regulation.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Liberty received $347 million from federal undergraduate grant and loan programs. Few other private nonprofit colleges receive anything like that sum. To put the amount in perspective, the highly regarded University of Virginia, a nearby state university, received $37 million from the same sources that year. Arizona State, the nation\u2019s largest public university, received $169 million. Liberty\u2019s considerable financial success \u2014 it has built a $1 billion cash reserve, and Mr. Falwell is paid more than $900,000 a year \u2014 was underwritten largely by the federal taxpayer.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, many Liberty students are struggling to repay their federal loans. Around 9 percent default within three years of graduating, ruining their credit ratings and creating financial burdens nearly impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Among all private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average default rate is 6.5 percent.\u000a\u000aMost Liberty students avoid default, but many are making no progress in reducing their loan balances. Only 38 percent of Liberty borrowers manage to pay down as little as one dollar on their student loan principal within three years of leaving school. This is probably because many struggle to land well-paying jobs. Forty-one percent of former Liberty students earn less than $25,000 per year \u2014 the typical salary for people with only a high school diploma at age 25 \u2014 six years after entering college.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration\u2019s borrower protections require for-profit colleges with loan repayment rates below 50 percent to prominently note this fact, like lung cancer warnings on the side of a cigarette package, in promotional materials. The label must read, verbatim, \u201cU.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans.\u201d\u000a\u000aBecause it is technically a nonprofit (albeit a very profitable one), Liberty is exempt from these rules. But the fact remains that Mr. Falwell seems bent on repealing regulations that, in the standards they set for minimally acceptable results, paint his own university in a bad light. And because it is exempt from for-profit regulations, Liberty is ultimately accountable only to state regulators and the college\u2019s accrediting organization.\u000a\u000aIf Mr. Falwell\u2019s task force does indeed recommend rolling back the tougher accrediting standards pushed by the Department of Education, it will heighten a continuing debate in higher education about the optimal balance between government oversight and individual choice among consumers and colleges. Some Republican lawmakers have called for scaling back what Senator Lamar Alexander, the Senate\u2019s education committee chairman, has called \u201ca jungle of red tape.\u201d Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren, by contrast, criticized the Obama administration for not going far enough to protect students.\u000a\u000aBut the Trump task force that Mr. Falwell is planning to spearhead does not appear to be focused on any kind of middle ground.

aVU.K. Brexit Secretary David David listens to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier | Thierry Charlier/AFP via Getty Images EU \u2018increasingly doubtful\u2019 Brexit talks will move to phase 2 in October The UK wants to discuss post-Brexit trade but the EU insists that negotiations make sufficient progress on the divorce first.\u000a\u000aTop EU officials are \u201cincreasingly doubtful\u201d that Brexit talks will move on to their second phase of discussing trade in October, according to three senior diplomats briefed ahead of next week\u2019s round of negotiations.\u000a\u000aThe skepticism from the EU side emerged at a key all-day meeting in Brussels Thursday. At the meeting, diplomats from the 27 remaining EU member countries were briefed on the bloc\u2019s position by a senior member of chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s team.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is clearly worrying that we have major differences on core issues such as direct effect [the application of EU law in the U.K.], the ECJ [the role of the European Court of Justice] and financial obligations [the so-called Brexit bill],\u201d said a senior diplomat who attended the meeting.\u000a\u000aAsked about the content of the briefing, they said: \u201cWith very little time to land all this, even if U.K. moves [on key EU demands] \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 in October appears to be increasingly doubtful.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe British need to be shaken a bit and the only way to force reality in London is for the Commission and the Council to be strict\u201d \u2014 Andrew Duff, former British MEP\u000a\u000aOctober is key because that\u2019s when EU leaders will decide at a European Council summit whether \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the talks on three separation issues \u2014 the Brexit bill, the rights of EU citizens in Britain post-Brexit (and vice versa) and the Northern Irish border.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Barnier underlined the importance of moving forward on the three issues next week. \u201cEssential to make progress on citizens rights, settling accounts and Ireland,\u201d he tweeted.\u000a\u000aAndrew Duff, a former British MEP who has been following the talks closely, agreed that it \u201clooks unlikely\u201d there will be a breakthrough by October. \u201cThere could be a surprise from the British Treasury \u2014 that they will explain their methodology to calculate the [Brexit] bill \u2014 but I don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe British need to be shaken a bit and the only way to force reality in London is for the Commission and the Council to be strict and to apply the criteria that have been agreed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is clear that so far the British have failed to be sufficiently precise and sufficiently constructive on the three separation issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the meeting on Thursday, Stéphanie Riso, a senior member of the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating team, also discussed with EU diplomats the bloc\u2019s reaction to U.K. position papers released last week on post-Brexit customs arrangements and the Northern Irish border.\u000a\u000aThe papers are seen as a gesture of positive engagement by the Brits but they are \u201conly somewhat appreciated,\u201d said a second diplomat who attend the meeting. \u201cThey are not clear, they have not enough details and are often far from reality,\u201d the diplomat said, adding that Barnier\u2019s team expressed \u201cno big hopes for the next round on the big first phase issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe EU regards the flurry of documents from the U.K. as a distraction tactic, designed to pressure its negotiators into talking about future trade.\u000a\u000aAnother EU diplomat described the papers as a \u201cmix of good and bad.\u201d But they objected to what they see as the U.K.\u2019s attempt to blur the strict sequencing of the talks. \u201c[The] U.K. tries to import phase two stuff into papers for phase one, or at least blur the lines between them.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the two weeks running up to the talks, the U.K. government has been bombarding its EU counterparts with a series of position papers on everything from future customs arrangements to the handling of confidential documents.\u000a\u000aBut the majority of the proposals refer to the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the bloc, rather than the separation issues that the EU wants to tackle first. It regards the flurry of documents from the U.K. as a distraction tactic, designed to pressure its negotiators into talking about future trade.

aVIn 1994, with trade fights raging over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization, the White House faced an urgent problem: It was about to lose most of its power to block exports for national security reasons. The decades-old law governing so-called export controls was about to expire, and Congress was making no move to renew it. So the Clinton administration took matters into its own hands: It declared a national emergency, extending its export-control powers without any new legislation.\u000a\u000aTwenty-three years and three administrations later, that national emergency still stands. Last week, entirely unremarked in the aftermath of Charlottesville, President Donald Trump extended the emergency yet again, signing a 134-word presidential notice that allows the federal government to control the export of almost every U.S. product.\u000a\u000aThough not as high-profile as trade deals, export controls are critical to U.S. national security: They prevent potentially risky technology or products from ending up in the hands of U.S. adversaries. So Trump\u2019s notice, which has been issued by presidents every year for almost a quarter century, is entirely uncontroversial. But the need for such a notice\u2014to control exports via emergency powers rather than regular legislation\u2014is also a glaring example of congressional dysfunction, and the seemingly unchecked expansion of the president\u2019s emergency powers.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is sort of ridiculous,\u201d said Bill Reinsch, a fellow at the Stimson Center who has been involved in the issue for decades, as a congressional staffer and senior official at the Commerce Department.\u000a\u000aThe authority over what can be exported from the U.S., to where and by whom, is a huge power of the government, fueling an entire legal industry and creating huge political fights between pro-business lawmakers seeking to open up new markets and defense hawks worried about permitting the sale of sensitive technologies. Once, this power was a straightforward matter of law: The Export Administration Act formally granted this power to the federal government. However, except for a 10-month period, the act has been expired since 1994, and Congress has not permanently reauthorized it.\u000a\u000aUnwilling to engage in the political fights necessary to forge a new system, Congress basically has abdicated its power here, leaving the federal government potentially unable to control exports. The shortcut has been to declare an essentially permanent state of national trade emergency, which effectively reinstates the law without any legislative action.\u000a\u000aYear-to-year, the U.S. export control system functions pretty well under the emergency system, experts say, and it has even undergone some updates. The Obama administration downgraded the security level for thousands of products during his presidency, allowing the government to focus its resources on a smaller set of goods and technologies that could most damage the U.S. if they fell into our enemies\u2019 hands.\u000a\u000aBut larger reforms require Congress to get involved, and so they simply haven\u2019t happened. One plank of the Obama plan called for simplifying the export control process, which has two separate lists governed by different agencies. The plan would have created a single system with a single licensing agency overseeing it; it had wide appeal, especially among exporters who find the current system unnecessarily confusing to navigate, but Congress never took it up. In fact, since the EAA was first passed in 1979, Congress has never undertaken a broad reform of the law. \u201cIt\u2019s badly out of date. It refers to the Soviet Union,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to deal with current realities.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongress first granted the federal government peacetime authority to control exports after World War II when lawmakers passed the Export Control Act of 1949, which was intended to prevent certain strategic items from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. Those powers eventually would fall to the Commerce Department, which has, over time, developed a complicated list of requirements for what can be exported, to what countries and under what conditions. Notably, the Commerce list does not include defense products like guns, ammunition and bombs, which fall under a separate, more tightly controlled list run by the State Department. Instead, it includes so-called dual use products\u2014ones that have both civilian and military applications like night vision goggles or machine tools.\u000a\u000aOver the next 30 years, Congress repeatedly reauthorized the law, culminating in a major rewrite in the 1979 Export Administration Act. But in 1994, Congress failed to reauthorize the EAA, caught between lawmakers who wanted to liberalize export control rules to help businesses and military hawks who wanted to tighten them, leaving the Clinton administration with the unnerving possibility of losing its export-control authority. To prevent that, Bill Clinton issued an executive order on Aug. 19, 1994, declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The IEEPA gives the president nearly unlimited authority to control exports during an emergency.\u000a\u000aExcept for a 10-month reauthorization in late 2001 when Congress hoped to pass a broader, long-term reauthorization, presidents have relied on this emergency authority for the past 24 years. After so many years of failure, Congress has all but given up trying to reauthorize the underlying statute. \u201cBasically, everybody has accepted that this is the way it happens,\u201d said Douglas Jacobson, an export controls attorney in Washington.\u000a\u000aThe truth is, experts said, the IEEPA is broad enough that a reauthorization of the EAA that allows the president to control exports without declaring a national emergency really hasn\u2019t been necessary. \u201cLike anything else in law and regulation, the law is the broader framework and, ultimately, it\u2019s the regulations that control,\u201d said Jacobson. Congressional leaders deemed that it wasn\u2019t worth the messy political fight, especially among Republicans, that was certain to unfold from any reauthorization.\u000a\u000aBut the Commerce Department is quickly confronting questions that could never have been envisioned under the 1979 law, which still guides the government's framework for export control, when the internet barely existed and Steve Jobs was just 24 years old. The law was written during a time when controlling exports meant regulating the sale of physical goods, with U.S. Customs agents inspecting products at ports. \u201cNow, a lot of what is controlled is software or blueprints that have been digitized,\u201d said Reinsch. \u201cIt\u2019s downloaded. It doesn\u2019t have any physical manifestation at the dock.\u201d Over the past few years, Commerce officials have been figuring out how to handle cloud storage, raising difficult and somewhat impossible questions, Reinsch said. \u201cHas data in the cloud been exported? Does it depend on where the cloud lives?\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat if the cloud moves?\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch questions could undoubtedly use some attention\u2014and direction\u2014from members of Congress. But given the congressional gridlock, that\u2019s unlikely to be forthcoming. Which means next August, Trump is all but certain to issue another presidential notice, extending a national emergency over export control into its 25th year.

aVSen. John McCain listens as Sen. Joni Ernst speaks in favor of arming Ukrainians in their conflict with Russia during a 2015 press conference. | Win McNamee/Getty Images John McCain\u2019s fan club The veteran senator has mentored many senators \u2014 from both parties \u2014 to carry on his foreign policy worldview.\u000a\u000aJohn McCain likes to joke that any senator not under investigation or detoxification sees himself as a candidate for president \u2014 in other words, not the type who would normally seek out professional mentorship.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, for many senators \u2014 past and present \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the word they use to describe their relationship with the 80-year-old McCain, who for years has been working to impart his vision of a more muscular foreign policy on a younger generation of his colleagues.\u000a\u000aThe Arizona Republican, now undergoing radiation and chemotherapy after being diagnosed last month with brain cancer, remains the GOP\u2019s leading champion of the kind of interventionist foreign policy that supporters of President Donald Trump often dismiss as \u201cglobalism.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd McCain\u2019s mentees say his efforts to groom a younger cadre of defense hawks have ensured that his ideas will live on in the Senate for decades to come, even as Trump seeks to rebrand the Republican Party under his banner of America-first nationalism.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a fight in the Republican Party for its heart and soul when it comes to foreign policy,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has long been McCain\u2019s chief acolyte. \u201cI will certainly carry on the tradition of leading from the front, not from behind.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t be in the same room with John McCain very long and not be influenced by his thinking\u201d \u2014 Angus King, independent who caucuses with Democrats\u000a\u000aOther acolytes, according to a half-dozen people who spoke to POLITICO about their relationships with McCain, include Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee such as Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. There are also some Democrats who\u2019ve formed strong bonds with McCain, like Armed Services members Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, along with Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u201cI consider him a mentor,\u201d said King, who developed a friendship with McCain after the Armed Services chairman noticed King was one of the few senators who stuck around for the entirety of the committee\u2019s hearings. \u201cYou can\u2019t be in the same room with John McCain very long and not be influenced by his thinking.\u201d\u000a\u000aKing, Graham and others said McCain has a talent for drawing people into his worldview. One tool he uses is congressional delegation trips, when fellow lawmakers are a captive audience during long flights overseas.\u000a\u000aEvery year, he leads trips to defense conferences all over the world, from the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada to the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Senators jump at the chance to travel with McCain, several of them said, since, as the best-known U.S. lawmaker on the international stage, he has no trouble lining up meetings with prominent foreign leaders. (It\u2019s like \u201ca forced march with Paul McCartney,\u201d King recently quipped in an Instagram post.)\u000a\u000aMcCain likes to engage his fellow senators in in-flight debates.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of people get on a long airplane ride and they\u2019ll put the earphones in and listen to John Grisham or something,\u201d King said. McCain, on the other hand, \u201cwas constantly engaged, talking about issues. What are we going to do in the Middle East? What are we going to do with the Palestinians and the Israelis? What should be our role in Syria?\u201d\u000a\u000aGraham said these flights with McCain were \u201ckind of like a tutorial.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn will gather everybody up and say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe makes sure that you\u2019re involved.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany current and former senators have vivid memories of the origins of their relationships with McCain.\u000a\u000aSullivan said that when he joined the Armed Services panel as a first-year senator in 2015, McCain asked him to take the lead for the committee on Asia-Pacific and Arctic issues. \u201cHe came to me and said, \u2018Hey, Dan, there aren\u2019t a lot of senators focused on this part of the world,\u2019\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cOf course, I took that up.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen.

Kelly Ayotte said that when she was running for Senate in 2010, McCain agreed to attend a town hall with her in New Hampshire. McCain had a legendary status as a campaigner in New Hampshire because of the hundreds of town halls he held there during his runs for president in 2000 and 2008, when he took questions from all comers and occasionally invited some of the more colorful personalities up on stage to debate him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere I was, a candidate for U.S. Senate, with someone who had done so many town halls across my state,\u201d Ayotte said. After the event, she explained with a laugh, McCain told her she needed to give shorter answers.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s always given me the advice to answer the question and be plain about it and be straight about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I got elected to the Senate he really, really was a mentor to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aAyotte also forged a close relationship with Graham, often issuing joint statements on defense issues with him and McCain. This led to her being branded as the successor to former Sen. Joe Lieberman in a group of defense hawks dubbed the \u201cthree amigos.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount from [McCain] in working with him on the Armed Services Committee,\u201d added Ayotte, who lost reelection last year and is now back in New Hampshire serving on several corporate and nonprofit boards. \u201cTo me, that is really such an important part of his legacy, his mentorship of leaders in the United States and around the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain\u2019s hawkish views were once dominant in the Republican Party but have lost some of their hold with the rise of Trump. Campaigning last year under the mantra of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Trump blasted U.S. leaders in both parties for wasting so much blood and treasure in Iraq. He questioned U.S. alliances such as NATO and said he wanted to repair relations with Russia.\u000a\u000aTrump also took aim at McCain himself, saying he was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d despite the 5½ years McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000aBut even as McCain\u2019s wing of the party has seen its power wane, it has remained dominant in the Senate. McCain and his acolytes have taken a number of steps seen as a rebuke of Trump\u2019s worldview. The Senate voted unanimously for a resolution by Graham reaffirming the U.S. commitment to NATO. It voted 98-2 to strengthen sanctions on Russia.\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn is genetically predisposed to kinetic behavior. He\u2019s never not in motion. He\u2019s always moving\u201d \u2014 William Cohen, Republican senator\u000a\u000aSen.

The president came around to their position, announcing an increase in the U.S. footprint there earlier this week.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of senators in my class who believe\u201d in a strong foreign policy role for the United States, Sullivan said. \u201cHaving [McCain] reinforce that certainly makes a difference.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain has always had an outsized role in influencing his fellow senators, even before he got to the Senate \u2014 because of his status as a nationally known war hero and the son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals.\u000a\u000aBefore launching his political career, McCain did a stint as a Navy liaison officer to the Senate, a job that required him to organize and travel on congressional delegation trips. On one such trip to China in 1978, McCain struck up a conversation with a just-elected Republican senator from Maine, William Cohen, who told McCain he planned to join the Government Affairs and Judiciary committees.\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn said, \u2018No, no,\u2019\u201d Cohen recalled in an interview. \u201c\u2018You have got to go on the Armed Services Committee.\u2019 I said, \u2018But I\u2019m already committed to the others.\u2019 He said, \u2018You owe it to your country.\u2019 \u2026 His joy of life was infectious, and his commitment to the country was so persistent, so palpable, that I said, \u2018OK.\u2019 I finally yielded.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohen would go on to be a key member of the Armed Services panel and serve as secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe mentoring is by example,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cJohn is genetically predisposed to kinetic behavior. He\u2019s never not in motion. He\u2019s always moving.\u201d

He did not say whether the government will officially apologize.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have not yet spoken to the minister,\u201d he said, while adding that he wants to talk with his Hungarian colleague in the next few days.

aVHouse Speaker Paul Ryan passed the buck during a Monday night town hall, blaming the Senate for the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u000a\u000aKevin Matthewson, a Republican out of Kenosha, Wisconsin, asked, \u201cI had high hopes since you\u2019re the speaker and my congressional representative. How have you not been successful up until this point as a leader to get this done like you promised?\u201d\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aSpeaker Ryan blamed the Senate, telling audience members that \u201cwe did pass\u201d an Obamacare replace but the Senate failed.\u000a\u000aRyan contended, \u201cWe crafted a plan, we ran on the plan, and then we passed that plan in May. Who wasn\u2019t disappointed that the Senate failed to pass that bill by one vote the other day? We all are.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan previously blamed the Senate for Congress\u2019s inability to pass a Senate Obamacare repeal and replace bill. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted against repealing Obamacare.\u000a\u000aRyan said right after the Senate Obamacare bill failed, \u201cWe\u2019ve done this in the House \u2014 we passed our simultaneous repeal-and-replace bill. We think that\u2019s the solution, we think that\u2019s the best way to go, and so we\u2019re just going to have to wait and hope that our friends in the Senate can figure out how they can get a bill passed, get it into conference, or whatever, and get something passed.\u201d\u000a\u000aIronically, Speaker Ryan\u2019s American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed after the Freedom Caucus and conservatives overwhelmingly opposed the original AHCA. Conservatives chided the bill for not repealing enough of Obamacare, labeling the legislation, \u201cRyancare\u201d and \u201cObamacare-Lite.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan also blamed the Freedom Caucus for failing to support the House leadership\u2019s bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a bloc of No-votes that we had; that is why this didn\u2019t pass,\u201d Ryan admitted after he pulled the AHCA\u2019s vote in March. \u201cWe were close. Some of the members of that caucus were voting with us, but not enough.\u201d\u000a\u000aHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) stepped up and brokered a revised version of the bill, known as the MacArthur amendment, along with Tuesday Group co-chairman Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ). The addition of the amendment garnered enough Republican support to pass the bill.\u000a\u000aMeadows\u2019 efforts in no small part seem to have succeeded where Ryan failed, rallying his House Republican colleagues behind a years-long campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare\u2013despite the fact that this bill does not constitute a full repeal of the previous president\u2019s signature law. House Republicans were able to pass the AHCA because of Meadows and MacArthur, not because of Speaker Paul Ryan.\u000a\u000aMathewson, while waiting in line for the Ryan town hall, said that he does not want Ryan to pass the buck. He charged, \u201cDon\u2019t pass the buck onto the Senate and say, \u2018We did our job.\u201d

aVA confidential assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency says that North Korea has already developed a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can fit on top of an ICBM. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aA confidential assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency says that North Korea has already developed a miniaturized nuclear weapon that can fit on top of an ICBM. (The Washington Post)\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles, crossing a key threshold on the path to becoming a full-fledged nuclear power, U.S. intelligence officials have concluded in a confidential assessment.\u000a\u000aThe analysis, completed last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency, comes on the heels of another intelligence assessment that sharply raises the official estimate for the total number of bombs in the communist country\u2019s atomic arsenal. The United States calculated last month that up to 60 nuclear weapons are now controlled by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Some independent experts think the number is much smaller.\u000a\u000aThe findings are likely to deepen concerns about an evolving North Korean military threat that appears to be advancing far more rapidly than many experts had predicted. U.S. officials concluded last month that Pyongyang is also outpacing expectations in its effort to build an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the American mainland.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump, speaking Tuesday at an event at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., said North Korea will face a devastating response if its threats continue. \u201cThey will be met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aEarlier Tuesday, North Korea described a new round of U.N. sanctions as an attempt \u201cto strangle a nation\u201d and warned that in response, \u201cphysical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a[North Korea says it won\u2019t give up nuclear weapons]\u000a\u000aAlthough more than a decade has passed since North Korea\u2019s first nuclear detonation, many analysts thought it would be years before the country\u2019s weapons scientists could design a compact warhead that could be delivered by missile to distant targets. But the new assessment, a summary document dated July 28, concludes that this critical milestone has been reached.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe IC [intelligence community] assesses North Korea has produced nuclear weapons for ballistic missile delivery, to include delivery by ICBM-class missiles,\u201d the assessment states, in an excerpt read to The Washington Post. Two U.S. officials familiar with the assessment verified its broad conclusions. It is not known whether the reclusive regime has successfully tested the smaller design, although North Korea officially claimed last year that it had done so.\u000a\u000aThe DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.\u000a\u000aAn assessment this week by the Japanese Ministry of Defense also concludes that there is evidence to suggest that North Korea has achieved miniaturization.\u000a\u000aKim is becoming increasingly confident in the reliability of his nuclear arsenal, analysts have concluded, explaining perhaps the dictator\u2019s willingness to engage in defiant behavior, including missile tests that have drawn criticism even from North Korea\u2019s closest ally, China. On Saturday, China and Russia joined other members of the U.N. Security Council in approving punishing new economic sanctions, including a ban on exports that supply up to a third of North Korea\u2019s annual $3 billion in earnings.\u000a\u000a[What the new U.N. sanctions on North Korea mean]\u000a\u000aThe nuclear progress further raises the stakes for Trump, who has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with nuclear weapons. In an interview broadcast Saturday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHugh Hewitt Show,\u201d national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the prospect of a North Korea armed with ­nuclear-tipped ICBMs would be \u201cintolerable, from the president\u2019s perspective.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to provide all options . . . and that includes a military option,\u201d he said. But McMaster said the administration would do everything short of war to \u201cpressure Kim Jong Un and those around him, such that they conclude it is in their interest, to denuclearize.\u201d The options said to be under discussion range from new multilateral negotiations to reintroducing U.S. battlefield nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, officials familiar with internal discussions said.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, the administration has been attempting to push North Korea toward talks, but Pyongyang has shown no interest in dialogue.\u000a\u000a[North Korea could cross ICBM threshold next year, U.S. officials warn]\u000a\u000aDetermining the precise makeup of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal has long been a difficult challenge for intelligence officials because of the regime\u2019s culture of extreme secrecy and insularity. The country\u2019s weapons scientists have conducted five nuclear tests since 2006, the latest being a 20- to 30-kiloton detonation on Sept. 9, 2016, that produced a blast estimated to be up to twice that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.\u000a\u000aBut producing a compact nuclear warhead that can fit inside a missile is a technically demanding feat, one that many analysts thought was still beyond North Korea\u2019s grasp. Last year, state-run media in Pyongyang displayed a spherical device that government spokesmen described as a miniaturized nuclear warhead, but whether it was a real bomb remained unclear. North Korean officials described the September detonation as a successful test of a small warhead designed to fit on a missile, although many experts were skeptical of the claim.\u000a\u000aKim has repeatedly proclaimed his intention to field a fleet of nuclear-tipped ICBMs as a guarantor of his regime\u2019s survival. His regime took a major step toward that goal last month with the first successful tests of a missile with intercontinental range. Video analysis of the latest test led some analysts to conclude that the missile caught fire and disintegrated as it plunged back toward Earth\u2019s surface, suggesting that North Korea\u2019s engineers might not be capable yet of building a reentry vehicle that can carry the warhead safely through the upper atmosphere. But U.S. analysts and many independent experts think this hurdle will be overcome by late next year.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat initially looked like a slow-motion Cuban missile crisis is now looking more like the Manhattan Project, just barreling along,\u201d said Robert Litwak, a nonproliferation expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the author of \u201cPreventing North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Breakout,\u201d published by the center this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of urgency behind the program that is new to the Kim Jong Un era.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough few discount North Korea\u2019s progress, some prominent U.S. experts warned against the danger of overestimating the threat. Siegfried Hecker, director emeritus of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the last known U.S. official to inspect North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities, has calculated the size of North Korea\u2019s arsenal at no more than 20 to 25 bombs. He warned of potential risks that can come from making Kim into a bigger menace than he actually is.\u000a\u000a[Some experts see Russian echoes in North Korea\u2019s missile advances]\u000a\u000a\u201cOverselling is particularly dangerous,\u201d said Hecker, who visited North Korea seven times between 2004 and 2010, and met with key leaders of the country\u2019s weapons programs. \u201cSome like to depict Kim as being crazy \u2014 a madman \u2014 and that makes the public believe that the guy is undeterrable. He\u2019s not crazy and he\u2019s not suicidal. And he\u2019s not even unpredictable.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real threat,\u201d Hecker said, \u201cis we\u2019re going to stumble into a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the past, U.S. intelligence agencies have occasionally overestimated the North Korean threat. In the early 2000s, the George W. Bush administration assessed that Pyongyang was close to developing an ICBM that could strike the U.S. mainland \u2014 a prediction that missed the mark by more than a decade. More recently, however, analysts and policymakers have been surprised repeatedly as North Korea achieved key milestones months or years ahead of schedule, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There was similar skepticism about China\u2019s capabilities in the early 1960s, said Lewis, who has studied that country\u2019s pathway to a successful nuclear test in 1964.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is no reason to think that the North Koreans aren\u2019t making the same progress after so many successful nuclear explosions,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe big question is: Why do we hold the North Koreans to a different standard than we held [Joseph] Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union or Mao Zedong\u2019s China? North Korea is testing underground, so we\u2019re always going to lack a lot of details. But it seems to me a lot of people are insisting on impossible levels of proof because they simply don\u2019t want to accept what should be pretty obvious.\u201d\u000a\u000aYuki Oda in Tokyo contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aRead more:\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is fast approaching Trump\u2019s red line\u000a\u000aTwenty-five million reasons the U.S. hasn\u2019t struck North Korea\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un\u2019s rockets are getting an important boost \u2014 from China

aVThe High Court at the Royal Courts of Justice in London | Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Brexit threat to London\u2019s legal eagles Without a deal on mutual recognition of court judgments by the UK and EU27, there will be massive legal uncertainty across Europe.\u000a\u000aBrexit threatens to deal a hefty blow to the U.K.\u2019s lucrative legal profession \u2014 and create huge uncertainty for courts across the rest of Europe.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s if Brexit negotiators don\u2019t secure a deal that ensures Britain remains in a decades-old system that allows civil and commercial court rulings in one EU country to be recognized and enforced in another.\u000a\u000aCurrently, a law known as the Recast Brussels I Regulation ensures that rulings in one European country are automatically recognized by the courts of another. Without this provision, a judgment made by a U.K. court, no matter how legally coherent, would be unenforceable in another country.\u000a\u000aThe law means that plaintiffs can expect legal consistency across the EU; its absence would have massive implications for the U.K. legal sector. London is currently the go-to destination for large international corporations looking to sue rivals in England\u2019s well-respected courts.\u000a\u000aAs a result, the legal profession has become one of the country\u2019s most successful economic sectors, generating £30.9 billion in fees in 2015 and employing 314,000 people, according to a report published by the lobby group CityUK.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is the price you pay for being so knuckle-headed about the ECJ\u201d \u2014 Claude Moraes, Labour MEP\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat has happened since the Big Bang in the City [when regulations were relaxed in 1986] is that non-U.K. parties have often been increasingly happy to choose U.K. law and settlement and dispute in the U.K. in contracts, which don\u2019t otherwise particularly touch the U.K,\u201d said Anthony Parry, a senior consultant at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.\u000a\u000aBut despite its importance to the U.K. legal profession, it has so far barely featured in the public Brexit debate. \u201cToo much time has been spent focusing on the European Court of Justice and too little on what sort of cooperation will take place between national courts after Brexit,\u201d said Kenneth Armstrong, a professor of European law and director of the Center for European Legal Studies at the University of Cambridge.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe advantages of [European judicial cooperation] are so neat and helpful that it\u2019s quite extraordinary that no one thought to mention it at any given level during the referendum campaign,\u201d said Claude Moraes, a U.K. Labour MEP who chairs the European Parliament\u2019s justice committee. \u201cAt the moment, a judgment given by an English court is enforced anywhere in the EU. There\u2019s uncertainty now whether that will happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aLegal cliff edge\u000a\u000aThe concern on the EU side is clear. One of the first position papers published by the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, focused entirely on ensuring \u201congoing judicial cooperation\u201d between the U.K. and the EU27.\u000a\u000aIn a bid to prevent massive uncertainty over whether a ruling made by a U.K. court will be enforceable elsewhere in Europe and vice versa, Barnier argues that \u201cthe relevant provisions of Union law \u2026 should continue to govern all judicial decisions given before the withdrawal date.\u201d That would, however, involve the Brexiteers\u2019 most hated institution, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) \u2014 the EU\u2019s highest court, based in Luxembourg \u2014 having a role in the U.K. post-Brexit.\u000a\u000aEnsuring that any case brought to a court or ruling handed down by a U.K. court before Brexit remains covered by existing EU law is the easy bit to agree.\u000a\u000aWhat happens after is anyone\u2019s guess \u2014 despite pleas from the U.K.\u2019s legal profession for clarity.\u000a\u000a\u201cMany months have elapsed since these points were made clear by the judiciary and the legal profession to Her Majesty\u2019s government,\u201d said John Thomas, the lord chief justice of England and Wales, in a speech last month. \u201cThere is no reason for further delay.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K. government will grandfather existing EU laws, including those on mutual recognition of court rulings and other relevant provisions allowing parties to choose which court and the form of law they use through the Repeal Bill \u2014 which will transfer EU laws across to the U.K. statute book and has already begun its passage through parliament.\u000a\u000aThis would, however, only ensure the recognition of rulings made elsewhere in Europe in U.K. law, and not the other way around. \u201cA system which has relied on mutual recognition cannot be replicated by such an asymmetric approach,\u201d said Cambridge University\u2019s Armstrong.\u000a\u000aECJ troubles\u000a\u000aThere are some quick fixes, one of which would entail negotiating continued participation in the Recast Brussels I Regulation, in the same form agreed in 2005 with Denmark, which has opted out of EU justice and home affairs policies since 1992.\u000a\u000aAnother option would involve signing up to the so-called 2007 Lugano Convention, which is based on an earlier form of the EU regulation, that ensures the mutual recognition of judgments in EU countries and states within the European Free Trade Association (other than Liechtenstein).\u000a\u000aThere are snags to both, however.\u000a\u000aBoth options would involve the ECJ: directly in the case of the regulation, or to a lesser extent in the case of the convention, which requires \u201cany court [to] pay due account to the principles laid down by any relevant decision [from the ECJ].\u201d The U.K. government has made clear that the Luxembourg court can have no say over U.K. affairs post Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything humanly possible to diminish [the U.K. legal profession\u2019s] advantages\u201d \u2014 Claude Moraes\u000a\u000aBut Moraes said that makes it nigh on impossible to reach a deal that doesn\u2019t cause massive disruption to U.K. courts. \u201cThis is the price you pay for being so knuckle-headed about the ECJ,\u201d he said, describing the court\u2019s involvement as \u201ca precondition for a good deal.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven if a deal is reached, the current question mark over whether rulings made in English courts will continue to be enforced elsewhere in Europe may dent London\u2019s attractiveness as a legal center.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople may be saying to themselves \u2018how do I feel about using a legal system outside the EU if the enforcement system doesn\u2019t work automatically?'\u201d said Freshfield\u2019s Parry.\u000a\u000aFor Moraes, the threat is even more severe. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything humanly possible to diminish [the U.K. legal profession\u2019s] advantages,\u201d he said.

aVAfter nearly a year of disappointment, triumphalism, hand-wringing, head-scratching and confusion, Brexit talks are finally underway. The two teams met on schedule Monday with an exchange of gifts and an agreement on how the talks would proceed. The U.K. made a significant concession by agreeing to talk about what the EU wants to talk about (the terms of the divorce) before moving on to what it wants to talk about (trade and the future relationship between the two sides).\u000a\u000aOne key issue that must be tackled early on is settling the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the rest of the bloc \u2014 the so-called Brexit bill. That impacts on everything else because unless the EU27 deems \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the money negotiations, they say they aren\u2019t willing to move on to other things. Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to what is at stake in 16 different policy areas once that\u2019s out of the way.\u000a\u000aTRADE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K. and EU27 economies are interlinked to the closest possible degree, and any disruption in trade in goods or services will hit companies, banks and consumers on both sides hard \u2014 particularly the British. Hammering out a good trade deal will be difficult though \u2014 politically and in terms of time and negotiations constraints \u2014 and there\u2019s also trouble ahead at the World Trade Organization.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? EU trade deals with third countries will be affected but will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British business and consumers; German and Japanese carmakers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU businesses that snap up British counterparts (e.g. airlines, banks); EU hubs like Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris (as British businesses relocate).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a softer Brexit preserves single market access (like Norway) or an interim deal is struck, buying time for more talks on a full trade deal.\u000a\u000aKey people on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft, second permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), Catherine Webb, director of market access and budget at DExEU and Simon Case, director general for the U.K.-EU partnership at the U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep).\u000a\u000aKey people on EU side: Deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand, Antonio Fernandez-Martos (head of international agreements, trade and customs in the EU\u2019s Brexit team).\u000a\u000aCUSTOMS/SURFACE TRANSPORT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K.\u2019s biggest freight port and carmakers like Nissan, Toyota and BMW have issued stark warnings that leaving the EU customs union will put their businesses at risk. For the port of Dover, any border checks for truck transit would clog up roads almost immediately. Carmakers say they need access to EU markets for the output from plants in Brexit-voting areas of England like Sunderland and Derby, and they have called for interim single market and customs union access beyond 2019.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s rail and road systems will likely operate as normal, although London will have to figure out whether or not to follow EU policy on things like road tolling and social rules for road transporters in the medium-term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Car manufacturers worried about their supply chains and factory workers in their plants. Spare a thought for Ireland too \u2014 without easy access for road freight to and from the Continent via the U.K., the Emerald Isle\u2019s trade will suffer.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Everyone loses if traffic through Dover is disrupted as alternatives are slower and more expensive. But BMW has hinted it might shift production of the iconic Mini from a site near Oxford to one in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. strikes a deal for tariff-free, and crucially check-free, access to the EU customs union \u2014 commonly described in London as \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft and Catherine Webb. Oliver Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser who has been assigned to the thorny issue of an Irish border, assisted by Simon Case.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Antonio Fernandez-Martos. Sabine Weyand will be Robbins\u2019 counterpart on the Irish border.\u000a\u000aCITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTS\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Roughly 4.2 million EU citizens on either side of the Channel will be affected by Brexit \u2014 from British pensioners living in southern Spain to health professionals in the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. The EU has made a priority of settling rights for citizens like pensions and the protection of \u201clife choices\u201d after March 2019. Life choices implies the rights to residence, to work and to enjoy equal treatment with nationals when it comes to employment access, working conditions, benefits and taxes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? If the U.K. is genuine about its \u201cgenerous offer\u201d on citizens\u2019 rights, Brussels won\u2019t try to prevent the U.K. from cutting immigration after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, British universities and London\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU citizens on both sides of the Channel worried about their future status.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How will rights be enforced and protected? A role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is Brussels\u2019 preference and is enshrined in EU law, but that would be contrary to the \u201ctake back control\u201d desired by the U.K.\u2019s Hard Brexiteers.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Glyn Williams, director general at the Home Office.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Marie Simonsen, who is in charge of free movement of citizens and employment on Barnier\u2019s Brexit task force. Her boss is François Arbault, who is responsible for internal market and sectoral policies, but Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, will also follow this strand of the negotiations very closely.\u000a\u000aDEFENSE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake: The EU will lose a country with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear deterrent and an army that can be deployed around the world. On the plus side, the bloc will be free to pursue defense integration \u2014 something London has always opposed. The U.K. will want to ensure it can maintain leverage in areas like the Balkans and coordinate with EU partners outside of NATO operations.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not: The EU is unlikely to create a unified army with a Pentagon-style headquarters. At least not in the short term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. defense companies like BAE Systems if they cannot maintain access to the new EU fund for defense research; EU defense if it loses British military and technical expertise.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: The French, who currently steer EU foreign policy and will now dominate defense policy too; those in the EU who want defense integration.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether \u201cthird countries\u201d \u2014 as the U.K. will be post Brexit \u2014 will have access to EU funds and military operations.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill, national security adviser to the prime minister.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier, responsible for external relations and foreign and security policy on the Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCRIME/TERRORISM/SECURITY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Information sharing will be the key issue in negotiations on security. The U.K. is among the top four contributors to Europol\u2019s main database on crime and the fifth largest user of the agency\u2019s platform to exchange information. Britain will almost certainly lose access to both databases, which would leave EU and U.K. citizens less safe as a result.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Intelligence cooperation mainly occurs at a bilateral level, meaning that the U.K.\u2019s intelligence services will continue to partner with EU allies.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Europol; U.K. police and citizens.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Organized criminals and terrorists operating out of the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. can obtain access to Europol\u2019s databases and the Schengen Information System \u2014 something that would require ECJ oversight.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill and Chris Jones, director general at DExEU.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier.\u000a\u000aDIGITAL ECONOMY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? If London wants to keep its top reputation for startups and data innovation, it will have to negotiate ways to transfer data smoothly to and from the EU. The country\u2019s invasive surveillance practices could stand in the way of that. Migration is also high on the agenda for techies, who fear a brain drain of coders and entrepreneurs. The EU, on the other hand, stands to lose a tech-savvy member with the skills and pro-business agenda the Commission likes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The digital economy \u2014 everyone loves the digital economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Startups in London; research departments across Europe.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Privacy advocates; EU countries that take up Britain\u2019s lead role on tech.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a data transfer deal is struck.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Gila Sacks, director for digital and tech policy at the U.K.\u2019s department of culture, media and sports, will support the DExEU team with expertise.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: François Arbault, key person in charge of internal market and sectoral policies.\u000a\u000aAVIATION\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Some 50 percent of U.K. passenger travel is to or from the EU, and Brexit will also impact trips between the U.K. and trading partners with an open skies agreement with the EU, like the U.S. In total, 42 of the U.K.\u2019s air services agreements are through its membership of the EU and will have to be renegotiated.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Heathrow airport believes it will benefit from Brexit, provided the U.K. puts a system in place allowing for swift entry of passengers and goods.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. airlines \u2014 such as Thomas Cook, EasyJet and jet2.com \u2014 which run a lot of flights to or within EU countries; Passengers, who are likely to pay more due to reduced competition; Ireland, because it has more air traffic to the U.K. than any other EU country.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Some national airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia are looking forward to less competition from U.K. budget airlines.\u000a\u000aKey decision: If a new air services agreement is in place by the time the U.K. leaves the EU and the single aviation market.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Peter Sorensen, who is responsible for aviation, and François Arbault, head of internal market in goods and non-financial services in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCLIMATE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The EU has benefited from the U.K.\u2019s participation in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost renewables and energy efficiency. Britain is one of the EU\u2019s biggest emissions-cutters and a heavyweight country in favor of toughening climate policies such as the Emissions Trading System.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s national Climate Change Act, which aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, is unlikely to be affected. Nor are its policies pricing emissions from power plants and phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2025.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The EU27, which will have to divvy up the U.K.\u2019s national emissions reduction responsibilities, and the U.K., which will lose its influence as a larger member of a big bloc in international climate negotiations.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU27 countries that resist tougher future emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. pulls out of the Emissions Trading System, and whether it will continue to participate in the bloc\u2019s emission reduction efforts.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain, responsible for energy and climate and environment in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force and Nicola Pesaresi, who is in charge of regulatory issues on subjects like climate change and financial stability that could be impacted by the U.K.\u2019s departure.\u000a\u000aENVIRONMENT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? After Brexit, London will be free to decide whether to keep in place environmental rules and standards set by the EU over the years. If the U.K. lowers air quality standards, the EU could be directly impacted, as dirty air doesn\u2019t respect national borders. MEPs have also warned that products imported from the U.K. could, in the future, be made to lower environmental standards, undercutting EU goods.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K., home to a strong tradition of environmental activism, is unlikely to overturn environmental rules en masse, even if it does eliminate regulations it deems unuseful and uncompetitive.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Animal and plant species protected under the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, deemed \u201cEU red tape\u201d by British Brexiteers; the U.K. environment.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British housing developers \u2014 who may no longer have to worry about great crested newts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How environmental standards will be embedded in a future trade deal between the U.K. and EU countries.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aENERGY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? New tariffs or other trade barriers could push up the price of gas and power supplies, putting the U.K., Ireland and others at risk of shortages. In another blow to Britain, they could get in the way of new investment, equipment and expertise for energy infrastructure (particularly nuclear plants).\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The continued flow of electricity and gas between the two sides. Costs and volumes may change, planned new links might run into complications, but existing interconnectors will not disappear after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The Irish-Northern Irish single electricity market; U.K. energy companies in the EU; EU energy companies in Britain; the British nuclear safeguarding regime; new nuclear energy developers in the U.K.; British energy bill payers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Not many. Maybe a few small local energy companies, like those developing shale gas, that would benefit from less international competition.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. leaves the EU\u2019s internal energy market, and whether it continues to follow a complex set of power and gas network rules that make it easier to trade between EU markets.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aFISHING\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Access is the key word in fisheries negotiations. Thousands of EU fishermen rely on U.K. waters for their daily catch. However, the EU is the largest buyer of British fish. This co-dependency means Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s promise to wrangle back control of British seas will be difficult to keep.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? British waters are unlikely to become the Wild West of fishing because the U.K. ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British fish processors and exporters; EU fishermen.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: U.K. fishermen; EU fish processors.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether there will be a deal brokered to swap fishing rights in British waters for access to the world\u2019s largest fish market: the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth, responsible for agriculture, fisheries and maritime policy on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aHEALTH\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brits and Europeans could lose their health insurance for emergency care when policyholders travel abroad. The way medicines will be approved in the U.K. could also be affected once it leaves the bloc. Britain also risks shortages of doctors and nurses, as those from the EU will either leave the U.K. or no longer work in its National Health Service.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Big British pharmaceutical companies will continue to do business in the EU, even if they will probably have to rely more on their continental subsidiaries inside the bloc.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Holidaymakers, patients and the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Insurance companies providing travel insurance; the EU country that gets the European Medicines Agency once it\u2019s relocated from the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps the British medicines approval process aligned with that of the EU; and whether it remains in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which provides the right to free emergency medical care in the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Stefan Fuehring, who\u2019s responsible for health and food safety, as well as justice and home affairs on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aUNIVERSITIES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brexit could lead to a decline in the number of EU students coming to study in the U.K. because they would be recruited as international students, meaning their fees would rise significantly. British universities also risk losing the roughly 15 percent of their budget they get from the EU in research funding. Academics are likely to find it harder to collaborate on research projects with colleagues on the Continent. A change in visa arrangements for other European countries might also prevent them from joining British universities.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Demand for higher education is so high that even if fewer EU students came to study in Britain, universities would be no worse off financially as they compensate by taking more domestic students.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: EU students, and foreign staff and academics; the European Commission\u2019s Erasmus student-exchange program.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British students (who will have better chances of getting a place at university); U.K. universities (that can raise tuition fees for EU nationals and so increase budgets).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a deal is struck giving EU students and academics access to U.K. universities and vice versa.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aFINANCIAL SERVICES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Hundreds of international firms do business across the EU from their London headquarters thanks to so-called passports. The industry is most worried about losing its ability to operate across the bloc from British headquarters. Another issue topping the agenda is the possibility that London will lose euro-clearing activities, a nearly \u20ac1 trillion-a-day business that supports 83,000 jobs in the City of London.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? London\u2019s role as a world-class financial center. Some firms will move some of their operations, but the bulk is likely to stay, allowing the City of London and Canary Wharf to remain major international financial hubs.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British clearing houses; the European Banking Authority; young EU talent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Frankfurt, lawyers and banks (because they always win).\u000a\u000aKey decision: The shape and form of mutual market access, assuming the U.K. loses full single market access and passporting rights.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Bowman, director general, international finance at the Treasury and Philip Rycroft.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aAGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Market access will dominate discussions, with British farmers currently hooked into sophisticated supply chains that deliver produce across Europe. Many EU farmers depend on the U.K. market, but Britain has more to lose. Restricted trade either way will deal EU farmers a heavier blow than Russia\u2019s food import ban, which devastated the industry.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Farms run razor-thin profit margins \u2014 everything is at stake.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British farmers; Dutch and Spanish food exporters; Ireland\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: There are few, but French farmers might benefit if their government \u2014 which the U.K. has traditionally hindered in agricultural affairs \u2014 pushes for a better-funded Common Agricultural Policy.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether negotiators will agree to tariff-free mutual market access.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one on the negotiating team has been specifically assigned this brief but Catherine Webb will deal with market access issues.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth.\u000a\u000aSPACE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake?

Trent Franks before his Phoenix rally on Tuesday. | Photo courtesy of faithywaithy707/Instagram Elections Trump met with potential Flake challengers before Phoenix rally Trump ripped the Arizona senator during the brief meeting, calling him 'the flake.'\u000a\u000aPHOENIX \u2014 President Donald Trump continues to amp up the pressure on Sen. Jeff Flake, savaging the Arizona Republican on Twitter and holding a private meeting with several of his prospective primary opponents.\u000a\u000aBefore taking the stage in Phoenix on Tuesday evening for a campaign-style rally, the president huddled backstage with state Treasurer Jeff DeWit and former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham. Both are considering running against Flake, an outspoken critic of the president who recently published an anti-Trump book, \u201cConscience of a Conservative.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump ripped the Arizona senator during the brief meeting, calling him \u201cthe flake," according to three people who provided an account of the discussion. Trump also discussed the potential for a primary challenge to Flake and told DeWit and Graham, both of whom have aligned with the president, to get back to him about their interest in running.\u000a\u000aAlso participating in the huddle was Rep. Trent Franks, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who appeared at the rally. At one point, Franks told the president that either DeWit or Graham would make strong challengers to Flake.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday afternoon, Graham\u2019s daughter posted a picture of the backstage meeting on her Instagram account.\u000a\u000aWhite House aides did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for Franks.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The president described the first-term senator as \u201cweak on [the] border, weak on crime.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody knows who the hell he is!\u201d Trump added.\u000a\u000aThen, on Wednesday morning, the president launched a more explicit attack. \u201cPhoenix crowd last night was amazing \u2014 a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cNot a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the second time in recent days that Trump had used his Twitter account to pummel the senator. Last week, the president tweeted that Flake was \u201ctoxic.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s offensive represents a massive break from precedent. It is highly unusual for the president to attack and explore a primary challenge to a member of his own party, let alone one as politically vulnerable as Flake. Prior to Trump\u2019s visit to the state, the White House had met privately with DeWit and Graham and former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who has formally launched a bid against the Arizona senator.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, as the president made his way to Phoenix, he traveled with DeWit on Air Force One.\u000a\u000aThe White House barrage \u2014 and attention to potential primary challengers \u2014 has infuriated senior Republicans and further opened a widening rift between congressional GOP leaders and the president. In the days leading up to the Phoenix rally, in anticipation of a Trump-led assault on the senator, a number of Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, released statements promising Flake their full support.\u000a\u000aWard, who attended the Tuesday rally, said the president\u2019s visit had stoked widespread interest in the primary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought it was great,\u201d she said after Trump concluded his remarks. \u201cI thought what he said about Flake was exactly right.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe trip is also sure to intensify the search for a Flake opponent. With some Trump supporters unsatisfied with Ward, a controversial figure who lost handily to GOP Sen. John McCain in a 2016 primary challenge, the quest is on for an alternative.\u000a\u000aAs he made his way to the rally, Don Tapia, a major Republican Party donor and one of Trump\u2019s biggest financial backers in the state, said he didn\u2019t know who he would back in the primary. But he said it wouldn\u2019t be Ward.\u000a\u000a\u201cI will not support Kelli Ward,\u201d Tapia said. \u201cYou can quote me on that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVPresident Donald Trump has enjoyed breaking the conventional rules of politics. But his sustained criticisms of fellow Republicans are chafing members of his party, who say the strategy makes little sense and is further endangering his rocky legislative path while alienating his few allies.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the goal is to accomplish absolutely nothing and fundamentally destroy the Republican Party from a national perspective, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff and adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s attacks continued Friday morning on Twitter, where he took on Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee for making critical comments more than a week ago. He seemed to twist the knife by claiming that Corker had repeatedly asked Trump whether he should run for re-election, an assertion others said was dubious. \u201cTennessee not happy!\u201d Trump said, even though Corker won 65 percent of the vote in his last election.\u000a\u000aA Corker spokeswoman declined to comment.\u000a\u000aThe strategy of attacking senior GOP figures \u2014 along with Corker, he has taken on McConnell, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 is one born out of frustration and political calculation, senior White House aides and advisers say.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aTrump doesn\u2019t understand why it takes so long for things to happen and why Republicans would vote against him or the party\u2019s legislation. Several people who have spoken to him say he makes demands with little understanding of how long things take. \u201cHe just says get it done, get it done,\u201d one adviser said.\u000a\u000aTrump has also told advisers that he was promised by former chief of staff Reince Priebus and others that McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan could get him bills to sign \u2014 and complained that his failures on Capitol Hill had been blown out of proportion by the media.\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders channeled that sentiment at Friday\u2019s press briefing when asked about Trump\u2019s latest tweets. \u201cThe end game is for Congress to do its job,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aTrump frequently tells aides that he wants distance from Congress, which he notes has lower approval ratings than he does. He doesn\u2019t want to be associated with any failure and is increasingly convinced the American public sees Congress as failing. And he feels little party loyalty to Republicans.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s an independent,\u201d said former campaign aide Sam Nunberg. \u201cHe still wants to keep his independent, outsider-minded profile. He threatened to run as a third-party candidate. He\u2019s an operator, you know.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome allies say they share the president\u2019s criticisms and hope his attacks fuel quicker movement on Capitol Hill, and outside groups like the Club for Growth have often heaped blame on Congress while praising the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cI accept the president\u2019s criticisms. I\u2019m frustrated like you would not believe that we cannot advance the agenda in the House and Senate,\u201d said Rep. Tom Reed, a New York Republican. \u201cI kind of shrug it off and attribute it to the fact he\u2019s just frustrated that things aren\u2019t getting done even though we have control of the House and Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut many senators and their aides are flabbergasted by the public criticisms from the leader of their own party. They say Trump hasn\u2019t shown a willingness to understand policy, often has more concern for his own news media coverage than anything else, and has run a White House riven by scandal and turmoil. In one recent meeting with legislators, he interrupted on several occasions to veer off topic, two senior GOP aides said, even as the health care legislation was simultaneously falling apart on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000aThere is widespread disappointment in Trump\u2019s presidency among the party conference, said three people familiar with their feelings. Many of the senators have long distrusted Trump. The only one to endorse Trump was Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator whom Trump made attorney general \u2014 and has since publicly trashed.\u000a\u000aAnd they note that Democratic senators and their staff love the attacks, a growing concern as members begin to focus on the 2018 midterms. \u201cIf he wants to know true misery, it\u2019s an emboldened Democratic Party in charge of the House of Representatives,\u201d said Holmes, McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff.\u000a\u000aNo one is immune from Trump\u2019s criticism. Corker has one of the closer relationships with Trump, and the pair have discussed personnel and policy issues at length, senior administration officials and advisers say. Trump will sometimes call Corker from the Oval Office and conference him into discussions. Aides have asked Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to intervene on certain decisions, a senior administration official said, and he often talks to top military officials.\u000a\u000aHill staffers sense no discipline from Trump or willingness to stick to any semblance of a plan. Aides for Trump and McConnell huddled for hours earlier this week to put out matching statements expressing a willingness to work together in the future and downplaying tensions. Both sides agreed to language and said the storyline of their feud was damaging the White House and Congress, according to a senior administration aide and an adviser.\u000a\u000aThen Trump continued to take on McConnell and Corker on Twitter, even as his staff tried to bring it down a notch. \u201cHe saw something on \u2018Fox and Friends,\u2019\u201d one senior administration official said, describing some of the tweets. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s more complicated than that?\u201d\u000a\u000aTrent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, said: \u201cHe just seems inclined to respond if anyone has said something. My most important motto in leadership was: The most important wasn\u2019t the last vote, but the next vote. He would be wise to stop the criticism of Congress. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe open feuds haven\u2019t halted work at the staff level, so far, and McConnell advisers say he wants to get things done regardless. Senior White House aides gathered Thursday with the president to plot a legislative strategy for the fall, and a meeting with McConnell is on the books for later in September. \u201cIt can all be changed on a dime if they get things done,\u201d Lott said.\u000a\u000aThe question, some say, is whether Trump can overcome his hair-trigger tendencies and focus on larger goals.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re not carving people into Mount Rushmore because they won Twitter arguments,\u201d Holmes said.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVStanislaw Lem\u2019s 1968 book, His Master\u2019s Voice, portrayed first contact between an extra-terrestrial species and the efforts needed to translate the language they used, for human understanding.\u000a\u000aToday\u2019s Afghanistan speech by President Trump may be equally alien to his electoral base, though it was not difficult to figure out whose influence led to the speech\u2019s neoconservative bent.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aHR McMaster\u2019s voice was clear to hear. It\u2019s a voice that appears to have been carried over from the George W. Bush administration, and even the Obama White House.\u000a\u000aToday, President Trump tried to explain himself, and even excuse himself, to the base who voted for his non-interventionist streak.\u000a\u000aMy original instinct was to pull out, and historically I like following my instincts. But all my life, I have heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the oval office. In other words, when you are president of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle. After many meetings over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David with my cabinet and generals to complete our strategy. I arrived at three fundamental conclusion about America\u2019s core interests in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t about changing his perspective on the war. POTUS is a remarkably astute and stubborn individual. This was about the swamp getting to him.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s get out of Afghanistan. Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2013\u000a\u000aCompare it to President Obama in 2015:\u000a\u000aFollowing consultations with my entire national security team, as well as our international partners and members of Congress, President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah, I\u2019m therefore announcing the following steps, which I am convinced offer the best possibility for lasting progress in Afghanistan. First, I\u2019ve decided to maintain our current posture of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year, 2016.\u000a\u000aNow President Trump says he won\u2019t put numbers on his involvement, nor would he put specifics regarding victory on the table.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, Obama gave very little detail about what victory looked like for the United States. Tonight, President Trump attempted to allay the concerns of the war-weary American people, but was equally vague in his rhetoric:\u000a\u000a\u201cOur troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition. \u2014 attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge. We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troop[s] and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will.\u000a\u000aNone of these are real measurables. Indeed, the insistence upon a \u201cconditions\u201d based strategy leaves the door even further open than Obama did. This was the only substantive difference between the pair. Obama gave numbers \u2014 probably an error \u2014 where President Trump would not. But Trump\u2019s Afghanistan war \u2014 which I warned back in May was actually \u2018McMaster\u2019s War\u2019 \u2014 is actually more open-ended. Even an ex-Obama advisor has admitted so:\u000a\u000aIt was Obama's policy with criticism of Obama and a pledge to stay in Afghanistan longer in pursuit of objectives that won't be achieved https://t.co/NYHegCSbpT \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aNone of this is to deny the importance of tackling radical Islamic terrorism and its harboring nations, but when President Trump \u201cour commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check\u201d, this flies in complete contravention to the earlier statement. It can only either be a measurable victory, not based on \u201cconditions\u201d on the ground, or it is a not a blank check. It cannot be both.\u000a\u000aAnd guess who used the same rhetoric in 2009? You got it\u2026 Obama:\u000a\u000a\u201cThis effort must be based on performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe days of providing a blank check are over.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor can it be a success with what we know the White House is discussing \u2014 an extra 4,000 troops. As Erik Prince told Breitbart News Daily:\u000a\u000aThe presidency by its nature lives in a bubble. When you fill it with former general officers, you\u2019re going to get that stream of advice. And so tonight, I would predict, sadly, that we will hear more of the same of the last 16 years and, sadly, exactly what the president campaigned against last year in the presidential election,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHow, by the way, can a \u201cconditions\u201d based policy be antithetical to nation building, as we are being asked to believe? Conditions on the ground in Afghanistan will not change without the nation being built? Without their police and military being trained? Without their institutions growing up and becoming secure? Too many comments in this speech make no sense in the real world.\u000a\u000aAnd consider who the talking heads are congratulating President Trump for his speech tonight. Sen. Lindsay Graham \u2014 Obama\u2019s favorite Republican to dine with \u2014 burst out of the blocks praising President Trump. So did the RNC, and watch the media response \u2014 for once not hysterical about President Trump\u2019s policies. What does that say, that the establishment has consensus amongst itself on this issue? Nothing good, if you ask me.\u000a\u000aThe dwindling crowd of Wilsonians and Scoop Jacksonites will no doubt laud President Trump\u2019s decision to have an open-ended, vague commitment to this foreign quagmire, but his base will unlikely be as rewarding.\u000a\u000aWhat was evident during the wending and sometimes contradictory speech, was the alien language and policy as far was POTUS\u2019s supporters are concerned: it was McMaster\u2019s Voice, and does not require a team of scientists in Nevada \u2014 per Lem\u2019s novel \u2014 to figure that out.\u000a\u000aRaheem Kassam is the editor in chief of Breitbart London and author of the new book: \u2018No Go Zones: How Sharia is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You\u2019

aVLike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, the inscription was evidently not fact-checked.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,\u201d said Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, a historical preservation and education group devoted to an 1,800-square-mile section of the Northern Virginia Piedmont, including the Lowes Island site.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only thing that was remotely close to that,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said, was 11 miles up the river at the Battle of Ball\u2019s Bluff in 1861, a rout of Union forces in which several hundred were killed. \u201cThe River of Blood?\u201d he added. \u201cNope, not there.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Gillespie\u2019s contradiction of the plaque\u2019s account was seconded by Alana Blumenthal, the curator of the Loudoun Museum in nearby Leesburg.

aV\u201cIt\u2019s actually that one,\u201d our Uber driver said, pointing with one hand and shifting into reverse with the other. \u201cRight here?\u201d I asked, thinking he must have gotten the address wrong. All I saw was a liquor store.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, crawling to a stop. Miami Hostel, 810 Alton Road, a dilapidated boarding house quietly hidden behind non-descript storefronts.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe trunk opened, and as my partner, Andy, pulled out our luggage, I took a deep breath and surveyed my temporary home away from home. This building in front of me, nestled quietly in a relatively rundown stretch of South Beach, contained three different businesses: an Italian restaurant, a liquor store and a hostel.\u000a\u000aAs the Uber pulled away, Andy stood, slowly shaking his head. What had I gotten him into? \u201cIt\u2019s probably not as terrible as it looks,\u201d I told him. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe first thing I noticed was the almost eye-level gray gate with an odd, oval sign declaring that the hostel was\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014a safe space.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNO\u000a\u000aSOLICITING\u000a\u000aFUNDRAISING\u000a\u000aPOLITICS\u000a\u000aSALESMEN\u000a\u000aRELIGION\u000a\u000aThe \u201cno religion\u201d sign on the hostel\u2019s front gate. | Brandon Ambrosino\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s weird, right?\u201d Andy chuckled and opened the door. By then, he and I already knew, thanks to a tipster that the owner of the Miami Hostel was none other than Jerry Falwell III, better known as Trey, who purchased the property with financial help from his father, Jerry Falwell Jr., a man who pretty much embodies everything on that sign: the fusion of religion with politics, aggressive fundraising and a slick, salesman-like approach to public faith. It was Falwell Jr. whose early endorsement of Donald Trump in the 2016 primaries\u2014he hailed him for living \u201ca life of loving and helping others as Jesus taught in the great commandment\u201d\u2014was seen as pivotal in helping Trump secure the evangelical vote.\u000a\u000aAt Liberty University, the Christian private school at which Falwell Jr. is the president and Trey is the vice president for university operations\u2014and from which I graduated in 2011\u2014all manner of vice is prohibited. Students, whether on campus or off, and whether school is in session or not\u2014cannot consume alcohol or tobacco. Co-ed sleeping arrangements are verboten. And, in the words of \u201cThe Liberty Way,\u201d the school\u2019s student handbook, \u201chomosexual conduct or the encouragement or advocacy of any form of sexual behavior that would undermine the Christian identity or faith mission of the University\u201d are strictly prohibited. Any one of these transgressions could get you saddled with reprimands, financial repercussions, and even expulsion. And yet, here we were, in perhaps the gayest 6 square miles in the United States\u2014South Beach, Miami\u2014staying in Falwell\u2019s gay-friendly flophouse with an on-site liquor store.\u000a\u000aAt least that\u2019s the story I thought I was there to report. The more I dug into it, the larger and more byzantine the story became\u2014and the more questions it raised. Though Liberty University officials declined to comment on the record for this story, senior-level sources at the university agreed to answer many of my questions. But rather than settling the matter, the answers they provided begat new and more serious inquiries that go beyond mere charges of hypocrisy over owning a hostel, and point to dubious behavior by Liberty University\u2014actions which, according to several tax-law experts I consulted, could violate IRS rules.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aLast fall, I set out to write a story for POLITICO Magazine about the internal disagreements at Liberty University over Falwell Jr.\u2019s enthusiastic public support for Trump. When I interviewed the university chancellor for the piece, Trey tagged along. It seemed clear that he was being groomed to carry the torch after his father hands it off to him\u2014just as Falwell Jr., inherited his post from Falwell Sr.\u000a\u000aAs I reported the piece, it became apparent that at the core of what initially appeared to be a simple political divide over Trump was instead a more consequential dynamic: frustration over real or perceived double standards.\u000a\u000aAt Liberty, any faculty member who wishes to speak to a journalist must involve President Falwell\u2019s office either before any contact takes place or within three hours of it ending. The reason for this policy, Liberty\u2019s lead counsel, David Corry, told me, has to do with the school\u2019s closely guarded nonprofit status: To keep its tax exemption, Liberty is prohibited from taking a political position or endorsing a particular candidate.\u000a\u000aThe only person who can speak on record without having to ask for approval is Falwell himself, who in 2016 endorsed Trump during the Republican primary, just ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Falwell has maintained that his endorsement was as a private citizen and is no reflection of his relationship with the school. But it\u2019s tough to square that with the fact that Falwell was introduced at the 2016 Republican National Convention as the president of Liberty University, or that he touted his experiences running Liberty in explaining his support for Trump. As one Liberty faculty member put it to me, Falwell \u201cwould not have the public platform to speak as he does without the university.\u201d\u000a\u000aFalwell voices his political opinions freely, while faculty members\u2014all of whom work without the protections of tenure\u2014are unable to do so. Far from protecting Liberty\u2019s reputation as a nonpartisan institution, the lack of public dissenting voices from faculty members means that when Falwell makes a political comment, he is seen to be speaking on behalf of the university, as if the two are one and the same.\u000a\u000aA few months after my first POLITICO story published, an anonymous reader emailed me with a tip about the hostel, angry over what they viewed as Falwell\u2019s hypocrisy. \u201cWhy does Falwell need to own an LGBT-friendly hostel?\u201d this person wrote.\u000a\u000aFor the university\u2019s students, staff and faculty, \u201cThe Liberty Way\u201d is the law of the land\u2014outlining in granular detail how they are expected to behave, act, speak and dress. (Faculty have their own handbook, but it says in boldface type that they are to conduct themselves in a manner \u201ccompatible with the Mission of the University and \u2018The Liberty Way.\u2019\u201d) Its premise is that every person associated with the university \u201cshould avoid any activity, on or off campus, which would contradict the university\u2019s mission or purpose, compromise the testimony or reputation of the university.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf caught in violation of the Liberty Way, you face dire consequences, including expulsion for students or termination for faculty and staff. Unless, it seems, your last name is Falwell.\u000a\u000aThe Falwell-owned hostel encourages behavior that would get Liberty students expelled\u2014the drinking, the smoking, the advertising for strip clubs, the free shuttles to local bars, the possibility of co-ed sleeping arrangements, and so on. And they certainly wouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy anything from the adjoining liquor store on Falwell\u2019s property\u2014an amenity the hostel touts in the self-description it provides to travel sites like TripAdvisor: \u201cThere is a liquor store connected to the hostel with almost anything you need for partying!\u201d\u000a\u000aFor most people, this probably seems like no big deal. But there\u2019s a more substantive concern here than simple hypocrisy: For two years, the Falwell-controlled LLC that owned the hostel (as well as the land containing the liquor store and neighboring Italian restaurant) was based on property in Virginia owned by Liberty University.\u000a\u000aAt left, a gate to Miami Hostel, located behind M.B. Liquors and Macchialina, an Italian restaurant. | Brandon Ambrosino\u000a\u000aThe hostel is at 810 Alton Road in Miami Beach, on the same parcel of land housing Miami Beach Liquors and Macchialina, a better-than-average Italian restaurant. Documents with the Miami-Dade County Recorder show that on February 21, 2013, that parcel was purchased by Alton Hostel LLC for $4.65 million. At the time, the LLC\u2014which had formed just two weeks earlier, on February 7, 2013\u2014listed Trey Falwell, then 23, as the sole manager of the company. A high-ranking Liberty University source with extensive knowledge of the deal confirmed to POLITICO Magazine that Jerry Falwell gave his son money for the $4.65 million purchase. The same source maintains that the elder Falwell has no business dealings with the property\u2014which may be true, but a May 21 Facebook post shows that Jerry Falwell and his wife, Becki, dined at Macchialina with Giancarlo Granda, Trey\u2019s business partner in the hostel\u2019s LLC.\u000a\u000aIn its February 2013 articles of organization in Florida, Alton Hostel LLC listed 3200 Sunnymeade Road in Rustburg, Virginia, as its mailing address. According to records filed with the county of Campbell, Virginia, the Sunnymeade property, which is 21 acres in size and includes a three-bedroom house, is currently owned by Trey Falwell and his wife. But at the time of the LLC\u2019s formation in 2013, the property was owned by Liberty University\u2014Trey Falwell and his wife were renting the house from Liberty for $600 a month, according to a high-ranking source who works for the school. The university continued to own the property until it was sold to Trey Falwell in May 2015 for $225,000. Speaking on background, sources at Liberty University told POLITICO Magazine that this price was fair-market value, and was assessed as such by a neutral third party.\u000a\u000aWhile it is possible for a nonprofit such as Liberty University to engage in financial transactions with a senior officer or close family member of a senior officer, a number of legal limitations and restrictions apply, according to Lloyd Mayer, a professor at University of Notre Dame Law School who specializes in taxation and nonprofit law. The most obvious regulation involves the nonprofit disclosing that the sale took place\u2014which, in this case, did not happen.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on background with POLITICO Magazine, a senior Liberty University official claimed that the disclosure was unnecessary because it did not result in an \u201cexcess benefit transaction.\u201d But instructions from IRS Form 990 say otherwise: Any \u201cbusiness transactions\u201d that exceeded $100,000 during the tax year had to be reported if they were with an \u201cinterested person.\u201d According to legal experts consulted by POLITICO Magazine, Trey Falwell\u2014who is Liberty University\u2019s vice president of university operations in addition to being the son of the school\u2019s president and grandson of its founder\u2014would surely count as an interested person.\u000a\u000aMembers of Liberty University\u2019s legal team declined to speak on the record with POLITICO Magazine. In an email exchange made on the condition of anonymity, one senior university official familiar with the matter stated that the university does not find that the single sale of a home under these circumstances amounts to a business transaction. Instead, the university sees it as a \u201cone-time personal transaction.\u201d When asked to explain the difference, this official said that was \u201ca fact-specific question dependent on many things.\u201d Responding to repeated requests for clarification, Liberty University officials refused to answer this question on the record.\u000a\u000aSeveral tax experts say the distinction Liberty has offered is not supported by IRS instructions.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d says Eve Borenstein, an attorney and recognized expert on nonprofit tax law who is sometimes known as the \u201cQueen of the 990,\u201d as she was introduced before giving testimony at a congressional hearing in 2012. Borenstein says Liberty does not get to decide whether the sale of land to Trey Falwell constitutes a business transaction that needs to be disclosed: \u201cThat would moot the whole point of the schedule.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to the 2014 instructions for Schedule L, \u201cbusiness transactions,\u201d which include \u201ccontracts for sale,\u201d that exceeded $100,000 during the tax year have to be reported if they are with an \u201cinterested person.\u201d Further, Mayer clarifies, \u201ca transaction does not have to be part of operating a business or obtaining services for it to be reportable.\u201d\u000a\u000aBorenstein says that Liberty officials\u2019 use of the word \u201cpersonal\u201d offends her, because the school is \u201csuggesting that they could be doing something personally with their money that I don\u2019t have a right to inquire about.\u201d The point of these tax filings, she says, are to expose these kinds of insider transactions to the court of public opinion. \u201cThe whole reason for the disclosure is so that people have the opportunity to say, \u2018Falwell sold something to his kid\u2014did he do it right?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe university says it followed protocol by having its board of trustees vote to approve the sale\u2014a vote ahead of which Jerry Falwell excused himself from the room, university officials tell POLITICO Magazine. But a brief look into the board\u2019s history suggests that the board, not unlike the faculty, serves largely at the whims of Jerry Falwell. For example, last year, Mark DeMoss, a Liberty alum, longtime board member and chair of its executive committee\u2014a man whose dedication to Evangelical Christianity is beyond reproach, as evinced by his years of service to the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, whom he likened to a \u201csecond father\u201d and for whom he served as chief of staff\u2014was pushed off Liberty\u2019s board after he voiced his disagreement with Falwell\u2019s endorsement of Trump to the Washington Post. Trump, said DeMoss, does not represent the \u201cChrist-like behavior that Liberty has spent 40 years promoting with its students.\u201d Falwell quickly accused DeMoss\u2014the son of the Liberty benefactor whose name graces DeMoss hall, the main building on campus\u2014of being, in DeMoss\u2019 words, the disloyal \u201cpolitical pawn of a rival campaign.\u201d He was gone about a month later.\u000a\u000aPerhaps DeMoss is an exception, but his ordeal does suggest that board members, like faculty members who wish to give media interviews, don\u2019t enjoy complete freedom to disagree with Falwell. And in such an environment, the interests of the Falwells and those of Liberty University cannot help but to blur.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis scenario just feels wrong,\u201d says Kimberly Reeve, an associate professor of business at King\u2019s College and an expert in nonprofit management. She notes that Liberty is in a unique situation: It\u2019s a huge nonprofit organization with significant real estate holdings. For Reeve, the primary question \u201cshould be whether or not the sale of this property was in the best interest of the university and helped it fulfill its mission. If questioned, the university should be able to indicate exactly how this sale did that.\u201d Otherwise, such a land sale would suggest that the university was not acting primarily in its own best interests, but instead, acting to the benefit of other parties.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s smoke,\u201d says Borenstein. \u201cThe logical next question is, what else has the school left out of its tax filings?\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked by POLITICO Magazine how specifically this sale of land to Trey Falwell was in the best interests of Liberty University, senior university officials again refused to speak on the record. In a statement given to POLITICO Magazine with the condition that it not be attributed, one top Liberty official explained that \u201cthe small house that Trey bought is located on the outer fringes of about 7,500 acres owned by the university\u201d and is located \u201cseveral miles from campus.\u201d According to the university official, \u201cthe board decided that [the property] had no use to the university in the fulfillment of its mission.\u201d (As a matter of public record, the Campbell County Assessor\u2019s office shows that the university still owns the land abutting three of the four sides of Trey Falwell\u2019s Sunnymeade property, part of a sprawling Liberty-owned lot that stretches further away from campus for nearly another half-mile.)\u000a\u000aSomeone could argue that a $225,000 sale is a drop in the bucket for an institution with assets valued in the billions. But that justification misses the point, says Borenstein. \u201cLiberty says they did this transaction correctly, but [POLITICO Magazine] had to uncover it\u2014so there\u2019s smoke. And you don\u2019t know if there are other transactions to ask about. The logical next question is, 'What else has the school left out of its tax filings?'\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aInside the Falwells\u2019 hostel, the stench of general decay and cigarette smoke is overpowering. Walking to the lobby, Andy and I passed down narrow hallways as spatterings of people milled about, smoking, talking to each other, playing billiards, staring into their phones. There\u2019s an ashtray on every table\u2014two at the red bar, above which shone a Miller Lite sign.\u000a\u000aAs we approached the reception desk, the older of the two men behind the counter cocked his eyebrow, as if to ask us what the hell we wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re checking in,\u201d Andy explained. \u201cOh,\u201d said the younger one, his burly biceps bulging out from his tank top. \u201cGive us five minutes. You can go into the kitchen.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe kitchen was also what you might call the business center: Two computers lined a wall, next to which stood a bookcase with a Bible hidden on the second-to-bottom shelf, buried amid the kind of fiction your fourth-grade teacher might read at the beach. Across from the books was a wall display of Minicards advertising local entertainment and other venues for tourists and offering coupons for their business. One of them caught my eye: a closeup of a redhead with entirely too much eyeshadow, sporting a wide choker around her neck. Tootsie\u2019s Cabaret: 74,000 square feet of adult entertainment and FULL NUDITY.\u000a\u000aI took a seat at a hightop, and tried to figure out the situation at the only other occupied table in the kitchen. A guy and girl were seated across from each other. The girl stared blankly at the guy, who was very angry at whomever he was on the phone with. I couldn\u2019t understand anything he said except a few shouted fucks.\u000a\u000aAndy grimaced at the stench of the room. \u201cI have to breathe through my mouth,\u201d he said quietly, before heading back to the lobby to check in. Minutes later, he returned holding two frayed towels and a folded pile of formerly white bedding. The employees had advised him that we should go to CVS and buy locks to keep our belongings secure while we slept. There\u2019d been thefts, and management took pains to remind us that they weren\u2019t responsible for what happened to our stuff. \u201cSeriously, Brandon, there\u2019s a Hyatt just up the street,\u201d Andy said.\u000a\u000aWe made the way to our room, climbing up a narrow green staircase and passing through a hallway straight out of a slasher film\u2014long and narrow, with a dim light flickering at the end of it.\u000a\u000aAs soon as we unlocked the door, I smelled incense, which masked the unmistakable scent of marijuana. Two guys were conversing in Spanish, while another sat on a lower bunk fidgeting with his fishing rod. Everyone quickly, almost imperceptibly acknowledged us, and we returned the greeting. There were six bunks, two of which were reserved for us. Andy took one top bunk and I threw my stuff on the only other open top bunk, in the opposite corner of the room.\u000a\u000aI introduced myself to the stranger who\u2019d be sleeping 3 feet below me. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Brandon.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAlejandro.\u201d He extended a hand. He said he\u2019d been here for a few days and usually stays here when he\u2019s in the area\u2014he travels a lot, picking up one-off construction jobs. \u201cMy home is everywhere and nowhere.\u201d Last week he was in Cuba, which he guaranteed I\u2019d love.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust go now,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore your \u2026 Trump.\u201d He rolled his eyes as he said the name, with more derision than scorn. Alejandro took a quick peek around and then pulled his suitcase out from underneath his bunk. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe pulled out a T-shirt featuring a caricature of the president, surrounded by the words Fuck El Payaso.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know what it means?\u201d he asked, wearing a huge grin. \u201cMeans clown! Your president! I got it in Mexico\u2014it\u2019s how they call him there.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo much for the NO POLITICS rule.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn January 2016, when Falwell hosted a speech in Iowa by then-candidate Trump, he engaged in a bit of Trumpian self-aggrandizement, crediting his own wizardry with saving the once troubled Liberty University. \u201cWe spent the \u201980s and \u201990s struggling to survive,\u201d Falwell told the audience in Davenport, referring to the school\u2019s past near bankruptcy and $100 million debt. \u201cOne of the things that attracted me to Donald Trump is that I see our country at a stage now where we\u2019re approaching $20 trillion in debt, and it reminds me of where Liberty University was in the 1990s,\u201d he said before endorsing the candidate for president.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump came onstage, he returned the favor. \u201cThe job Jerry\u2019s done at Liberty University is amazing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne of the things I noticed the other day looking over numbers \u2026 looking at different colleges, and you\u2019re one of the most financially solid, financially sound universities in the entire United States, with a tremendous endowment and tremendous amounts of money,\u201d Trump proclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have debt.\u201d (Falwell responded to Trump\u2019s flattery with a caveat: \u201cThat\u2019s why I have to make it clear that it\u2019s not Liberty\u2019s endorsement, it\u2019s my personal endorsement\u2014because the IRS would love to get their hands on that, too.\u201d)\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump and Jerry Falwell on stage during Liberty University\u2019s commencement ceremony on May 13, 2017. | Getty Images\u000a\u000aLiberty University may not have debt, but its students and graduates do. A lot of it. And that\u2019s how the school\u2014and the Falwells\u2014made their money.\u000a\u000aLiberty bills itself as the world\u2019s largest Christian university\u2014and that\u2019s true. But once you start breaking down its numbers, as Kevin Carey recently did for the New York Times, a much more complicated picture emerges of a place that sells itself as an educational Eden.\u000a\u000a\u201cLiberty is essentially a medium-size nonprofit college that owns a huge for-profit college,\u201d Carey wrote. Although Falwell boasts that his school has tens of thousands of students, his residential program has only 14,000, a small fraction of the overall figure. Liberty\u2019s online program has about 64,000, nearly four times as many, making it second only to the University of Phoenix in terms of the size of its online student body. On paper, the only difference between the two online schools is that Liberty\u2019s is tax-exempt. In 2015, it received $345 million from federal undergraduate grant and loan programs\u2014more than twice the amount received by the largest public university in the country. \u201cLiberty\u2019s considerable financial success\u2014it has built a $1 billion cash reserve, and Mr. Falwell is paid more than $900,000 a year,\u201d Carey wrote, \u201cwas underwritten largely by the federal taxpayer.\u201d That money has blessed the Falwells with a life of considerable plenty, giving them the financial means to, among other things, purchase a $4.65 million property in Miami Beach. (A university spokesperson disputes that characterization but repeatedly refused to speak on the record about the matter.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLiberty University may not have debt, but its students and graduates do. A lot of it. And that\u2019s how the school\u2014and the Falwells\u2014made their money.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSome of the federal funds Liberty students receive pay for an education that is not only explicitly religious, but which requires proselytizing. At Liberty, perhaps the two most controversial examples of this are the school\u2019s Creation Studies 290 and Evangelism 101 courses.\u000a\u000aAccording to Liberty\u2019s website, the purpose of the university\u2019s Center for Creation Studies is to \u201cresearch, promote, and communicate a robust young-Earth creationist view of Earth history. Beginning with sound biblical interpretation, we seek to understand how science can inform us about God's magnificent creation.\u201d The Center operates Creation Hall, which boasts fossilized bones from an Allosaurus, which according to young-Earth science, are 6,000 to 10,000 years old\u2014as old as literally everything else in the universe.\u000a\u000aAt the 2010 dedication of Creation Hall, Rev. Jonathan Falwell, Jerry, Jr.\u2019s brother and the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church, hailed the exhibit as an opportunity for Christians to \u201cstand up for the truth.\u201d Liberty University, he promised, \u201cwill always hold to the truth accounted in Genesis.\u201d That probably explains why the course was a graduation requirement from at least 2004, when I began as a student there, until the 2016-2017 school year, when it was no longer required for certain degree programs.\u000a\u000aEvangelism 101, on the other hand, continues to be a graduation requirement for residential Liberty students. The very first line of the course syllabus describes it as \u201can in-depth study of how to lead people to Christ.\u201d The course rationale is even more clear: \u201cThis course was designed in obedience to the biblical mandate supported by Liberty University to evangelize the lost. Its purpose is to train the student to evangelize and to equip others for evangelism in today\u2019s culture.\u201d To pass the course, students are required to write a \u201cwitness report,\u201d a two-page paper that documents a \u201cface-to-face encounter\u201d they have with one \u201cunbeliever\u201d to whom they evangelize. (I imagine the Miami Hostel would provide ample opportunity for this kind of proselytization, if only its owners allowed it on property.) If you\u2019re a non-believer, you\u2019re still required to take the course, but can opt for a slightly different path: \u201cIf not a Christian, the student will instead write a paper of the same length for equal grading consideration explaining why he or she is not a Christian and elaborating on the teachings presented in the course.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s little doubt that Liberty\u2019s intent in requiring these courses is idealistic, as I well know from attending the university for my undergraduate degree. The school is, after all, premised on the fervent shared beliefs of all those in its orbit. But some employers seem to not think much of it\u2014which may be why so many students have a hard time landing decent salaried jobs and paying back their loans. Within three years of graduating from Liberty University, almost 10 percent of students default on their loans, well above the national average of 6.5 percent among recent graduates of private nonprofit four-year colleges (its default rate is nonetheless slightly lower than the national average graduates of all colleges, profit and nonprofit). While most don\u2019t default, many make almost no effort to reduce their balances, says Carey, who notes that \u201conly 38 percent of Liberty borrowers manage to pay down as little as one dollar on their student loan principal within three years of leaving school.\u201d\u000a\u000aWere Liberty a for-profit school, it would have to note its lousy loan repayment rates on its promotional material, thanks to borrower protections put into place during the Obama administration. It\u2019s not unlike a lung cancer warning on cigarette packaging, says Carey: \u201cU.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe rationale was that the requirement would protect students from taking on a lifetime of debt from fraudulent schools. In a March 2016 news release announcing debt relief for students defrauded by 91 campuses of Corinthian College, the Department of Education said it was committed to \u201caggressive and comprehensive action to address fraudulent, illegal and abusive practices in higher education.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast January, Falwell told the Chronicle of Higher Education that Trump assigned him to a task force to identify changes that should be made in the Department of Education. Among those items on his list, said Falwell, were \u201coverreaching regulation\u201d and \u201cborrower defense\u201d rules. \u201cI\u2019ve got notebooks full of issues,\u201d Falwell told the Chronicle.\u000a\u000aStudents and guests sing songs of praise ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s appearance any Liberty\u2019s January 18, 2016 convocation. | Getty Images\u000a\u000aUndoubtedly some of these issues are ones whose repeal could help Liberty continue raking in dough. According to its tax documents, Liberty\u2019s \u201cprimary mission\u201d is to provide \u201cquality collegiate education\u201d (language that no doubt satisfies federal requirements). While plenty of its residential programs fulfill this mission, some might question if the school\u2019s insanely profitable online programs provide the same educational quality. One online graduate-level religion course, for example, Strategic Prayer and Spiritual Warfare (Evangelism 670), requires students to write a 7- to 10-page final paper outlining \u201ca plan for growth in various aspects of his/her prayer life.\u201d For full-time non-divinity students pursuing a master\u2019s degree online, the cost of this three-credit course is $1,695. (Divinity students, however, can take advantage of special block rate pricing of $2,750 per semester.) The core of most of Liberty\u2019s online classes is the group discussion board, in which students are expected to discuss class content. Each discussion board assignment consists of an initial 200 to 400 word thread and two 150-300 word replies to two other threads; many do not require students to use sources. These discussions constitute a large portion of a student\u2019s final grade. (In Torts Law (JURI 560), for example, students of Liberty\u2019s online law school can earn three times as many points for their discussion board participation than their semester-capping \u201cBiblical Torts Research Paper.\u201d)\u000a\u000aWith this in mind, it\u2019s not a stretch to view Liberty\u2019s online business model\u2014which saved the school from ruin and brings in most of its profit\u2014as something of a slumlord scenario: Keep costs low, bring in struggling customers looking for a bargain, and give them a low-quality product. Not unlike the Falwells\u2019 Miami hostel.\u000a\u000aWhen questioned about the quality of Liberty\u2019s online education offerings, university officials declined to speak on the record with POLITICO Magazine. In an email sent on the condition of anonymity, a Liberty spokesperson said that the school had just received a 10-year accreditation renewal \u201cafter an exhaustive review by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools[,] \u2026 a tough regional accreditor that requires Liberty to meet the same academic standards regardless of the method of course delivery.\u201d The official also said that educational outcomes are best measured by Liberty\u2019s students, and as evidence, referred POLITICO Magazine to a page on the school\u2019s website titled \u201cWhat Alumni Say,\u201d featuring positive testimonials by select alumni.\u000a\u000aOther graduates have a decidedly different view of not only the quality of a Liberty education, but the moral character of the school\u2019s leadership.\u000a\u000aFor some alumni, displeasure with Liberty University has been growing for a while, but Chancellor Falwell\u2019s recent defense of President Trump\u2019s remarks about the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia\u2014there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d Trump said; \u201che\u2019s not politically correct \u2026 and that\u2019s one of the reasons I supported him,\u201d Falwell told Martha Raddatz on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d\u2014led them to organize a more public expression of their disapproval of Falwell.\u000a\u000aOn September 5, dozens of Liberty graduates are planning to return their diplomas to Falwell \u201cto protest the university\u2019s departure from its core mission and values and to communicate our strong disgust with both the chancellor, and the university that continues to employ him,\u201d according to a letter penned by the group. The signatories allege that by failing to disavow Trump\u2019s \u201copen disrespect for ostensible Christian ideals,\u201d Falwell has \u201cdegraded [Liberty\u2019s] core mission and defiled its core beliefs, substituting the worship of power and influence for the worship of God. Ten years after [Rev.] Jerry Falwell\u2019s death, the decades-long criticisms of the concept of a Religious Right have been proven true.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalling the mail-back a \u201cjoke\u201d and \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d Falwell told the Independent Journal Review, a conservative news website, that the graduates are merely \u201cgrandstanding to gain five minutes of fame.\u201d \u201cShame on the media for even reporting,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBut for many alumni\u2014and, based on my previous reporting, quite a few current faculty and students\u2014Liberty University has come to represent what happens when religion commingles with soliciting, fundraising, politics and salesmen.\u000a\u000aMaybe that\u2019s why those activities aren\u2019t welcome at the Miami Hostel. From experience, the Falwells know what strange bedfellows those pursuits often prove to be.\u000a\u000aBrandon Ambrosino is a writer living in Delaware.

aV0 SHARES Share Tweet\u000a\u000aFor reasons involving real research, I need to see whether and how much the Iraq war affected the Bush administration\u2019s electoral record. I\u2019m reviewing some of the literature here, partly as a public accountability mechanism, partly as a personal note, and partly to see if anyone else has anything to add.\u000a\u000aThe theoretical stakes for me here are not, quite, in the realm of voter behavior. Rather, I\u2019m interested in adjudicating whether claims that voters punish incumbents for mishandling foreign policy are well-founded. In particular, what are we to make of the fact that the internationally popular, swift, and decisive 1991 Iraq War was followed by George H.W. Bush\u2019s defeat, while the internationally unpopular, grinding, and essentially doomed 2003 Iraq War was followed by George W. Bush\u2019s victory? Does this mean that Iraq \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d for 2004/2006/2008? Such a finding would contrast with the claim that the Iraq war was at the core of Republicans\u2019 electoral reversals in 2006 and 2008.\u000a\u000aAlthough this lit review meandered a bit from a tight focus on the elections, the general findings seem defensible:\u000a\u000ait\u2019s really hard to establish direct causality between the war and election outcomes\u2013if only we could run experiments!\u000a\u000athere seem to be clear evidence that war casualties affected evaluations of the president and legislators\u000a\u000athese effects were mostly driven by local news coverage and local elections (whether that \u2018local\u2019 is \u2018state\u2019 or \u2018county\u2019 remains to be seen)\u000a\u000athe absolute biggest magnitudes of these effects are distressingly small\u2013enough to shift a presidential election but not to wildly reject a challenger or incumbent on the basis of competence\u000a\u000aapproval for the war and vote returns for presidents seem to track perceptions of success and support for the decision to begin the war as well as costs\u000a\u000ainference in the first term is compounded by rally effects from 9/11 and the start of the Iraq war\u000a\u000ato the extent that Republicans suffered because of the war (a finding that seems reasonable), such electoral retribution was largely a result of local casualties and relatively modest in scope.\u000a\u000aKriner and Shen (2007)\u000a\u000aDouglas Kriner and Francis X. Shen, \u201cIraq Casualties and the 2006 Senate Elections,\u201d Legislative Studies Quarterly\u000a\u000aIn examining Senate races in 2006, Kriner and Shen find that local casualties in the Iraq war mattered, but not national ones: \u201cThese results provide compelling evidence for the existence of a democratic brake on military adventurism, even in small-scale wars, but one that is strongest in communities that have disproportionately shouldered a war\u2019s costs\u201d (Abstract, 507). They present this finding in contrast with the commonplace idea that the 2006 midterms were \u201ca resounding referendum on the Bush administration\u2019s conduct of military operations in Iraq\u201d (507). They look at Senate races, in particular those of Republican incumbents, to see how the \u201cIraq war\u2019s influence on voting returns was critically mediated by local casualty rates at both the state and county levels\u201d (508).\u000a\u000aThey highlight that the Iraq war involved very few combat fatalities (510), nearly twenty-fold less than that of Vietnam (as of 2006). They model change in Republican vote share between 2000 to 2006 in senate races at the state and county level. They test two contending explanations:\u000a\u000aIraq casualties might have affected the calculus of American voters [in] at least two ways. First, the total number of combat fatalities suffered in Iraq might have encouraged voters to abandon the Republicans, who \u2026 remained the most steadfast supporters of the president\u2019s course in the Middle East. If this were the only mechanism by which the war affected the election outcomes, then Iraq\u2019s adverse efect on Republican vote shares should have been felt nationwide, with little or no geographic variance. In such a world, we would find no evidence that Republican candidates did any better or worse on average in high-casualty states/counties than in low-casualty states/counties. Alternatively, \u2026 the public\u2019s perspectives on the war might also have been moderated by the experience of their local communities. If so, then residents of states and counties that suffered disproportionately high casualty totals or rates might also have felt the war\u2019s costs more acutely and punished the ruling Republicans disproportionately.\u000a\u000aThey caution that their method would produce a conservative estimate for the war\u2019s effect on voting behavior; finding local variation correlated with casualties may understate the \u201cadditional, uniform effect on voters as a whole.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey analyze all Senate elections at the state level; casualties at the county level; and county-level casualties\u2019 effect on Republican incumbents (14 races), excluding weirdos CT and VT. \u201cCasualties\u201d is KIA (515). Their DV is delta GOP vote share measured as function of casualties, opponent quality, campaign expenditures, 2004 Bush vote share, unemployment rate, percentage of population in the armed forces, and percentage of veterans.\u000a\u000aThey find a substantial effect of casualty rate at the state and county level on GOP vote share, one even stronger for incumbents. Kriner and Shen conclude (518) that this is a reason to reject the casualty threshold argument: \u201ceven a war with comparatively modest levels of casualties can have a substantial effect on congressional elections\u201d. However, this is complicated at the county-level; notably, \u201cthe majority of counties as of November 2006 had not suffered a single battle death in Iraq.\u201d (520) The strongest evidence for blowback comes from county-level tests of GOP incumbents: \u201cA two-standard deviation increase in a county\u2019s casualty count cost the Republican incumbent more than two percentage points at the polls. Similarly, a two standard deviation increase in the county\u2019s casualty rate decreased the Republican incumbent\u2019s expected vote share by almost one percentage point from his or her 2000 performance\u201d (522).\u000a\u000aKarol and Miguel (2007)\u000a\u000aDavid Karol and Edward Miguel, \u201cThe Electoral Cost of War: Iraq Casualties and the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election,\u201d The Journal of Politics\u000a\u000aKarol and Miguel proceed similarly to Kriner and Shen, with much the same model (delta Bush vote share 2000 to 2004), similar geographical precincts (state and county, with the addition of media-market), similar measures of casualties (KIAs), and the same caution: \u201cAlthough our methodology allows us to gauge the impact of additional Iraq War deaths and wounded on voting outcomes across states, it cannot capture nation-wide trends in support for Bush related to the Iraq war\u201d (635), although they puckishly note that \u201cwe cannot categorically exclude the possibility that the cumulative effect of the War was beneficial to President Bush\u2019s campaign\u201d: \u201cYet to the extent that we find a negative localized effect of casualties, those holding that the war aided Bush on balance would have to posit an even larger positive nationwide effect canceling out the negative local one we estimate.\u201d Karol and Miguel note that their aggregation of casualty rates into media markets should allow them to better explore the impacts of mechanisms working through those other than personal contact (e.g., seeing reports on the news).\u000a\u000aKarol and Miguel find a statistically and substantially negative correlation between state-level casualty (deaths and wounded) rate per 100,000 and Bush vote share change (639, 643) and county-level Bush vote share (644). They estimate that, in the absence of the Iraq war, \u201cPresident Bush\u2019s overall national vote share would have been 52.3% and that he would have won seven more states for a total of 39\u2026[and] 366 Electoral College votes\u201d (643). They note that \u201cSeven scholars\u2019 forecasting models\u2013which largely focused on economic variables and ignored the war\u2013predicted a larger victory for the Preisden than he actually achieved, with a median difference of 2.5 percentage points between their prediction and his actual national vote share\u201d. As they argue, \u201cour findings support the view that substance matters. Real-world events like casualties help account for the year-to-year shifts that relatively stable factors like party identification do not explain\u201d (646).\u000a\u000aGrose and Oppenheimer (2007)\u000a\u000aChristian R. Grose and Bruce I. Oppenheimer, \u201cThe Iraq War, Partisanship, and Candidate Attributes: Variation in Partisan Swing in the 2006 U.S. House Elections\u201d, Legislative Studies Quarterly\u000a\u000aThis is not quite the House version of Kriner and Shen (2007) but it is close. Grose and Oppenheimer claim that \u201cVoters held individual Republican members of Congress accountable for the local impact of Iraq war deaths in their congressional districts and also held GOP members accountable for their roll-call votes on the Iraq war\u201d (532). Notably, \u201cVoters did not reward or punish Democrats for their votes on the Iraq war or the number of war deaths in their districts (532).\u000a\u000aGrose and Oppenheimer seek to explain why different House races saw markedly different swings to the Democrats. They pay attention to the strategic factors that affect House races, including the way that favorable prospects for challengers may influence candidate recruitment (537). They go a little beyond Karol & Miguel and Kriner & Shen, however, by taking seriously the difference between incumbency, national party brands, and individual legislators. They identify different potential mechanisms and think a little more on the theory side here (I think) than those (otherwise very good!) papers. Part of this (539) is the fact that House districts are more homogenous in population but more heterogeneous in other ways, like media districts, than Senate districts.\u000a\u000aThey estimate delta Democratic vote share (2004 to 2006), excluding districts with idiosyncratic reasons not to be in (e.g. redistricted at midterm). I wish they had looked at 2002 to 2006, since midterm-midterm is a better comparison group. They control for Bush vote share percentage, incumebncy, quality challengers, scandal (oh, right, that was a big thing in 2006!), veteran and armed forces in district, and key treatment variables:\u000a\u000aIraq War Deaths in District (January 2006-December 2006)\u000a\u000aIraq War Vote (if the member voted for the Iraq war, HJR114)\u000a\u000aThey run separate models for each party\u2019s candidates, implicitly interacting party with each term.\u000a\u000aThey find that Iraq war deaths in a district are associated with increasing Dem vote share\u2013but only in Republican seats(545). In a rather stunning chart (547), they also found that there were huge effects for Democratic swing for fatalities in Republican districts: at the maximum (9 deaths), there was a predicted eight-point swing to Democrats (when there was an incumbent), which is the same as the open-seat swing (547). They estimate \u201cchanges in the predicted vote swing for Republican incumbents\u2026[of] an approximately 1 percentage [point] increase in the Democratic swing for every two deaths per district.\u201d There is no corresponding effect for Democratic-held seats.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, Republicans who voted for the Iraq war sufferend a 1.6 point Democratic swing; there was no corresponding swing for Democrats (549): \u201cFifty-four voters running in 2006 voted for the war in Iraq, yet the Democratic vote-share swing for these Democrats was no different than the swing for those Democrats who voted against the war or those Democrats who were not present for the war vote \u2026 voters punish the in-party for the Iraq war.\u201d That is, \u201cthere was no local effect of the war in Democratic districts\u2013results suggesting that the importance of anticipatory representation and retrospective voting is greater for the majority party\u201d (552).\u000a\u000aGrose and Oppenheimer conclude that (551) \u201cas the number of district war deaths increased, the Democratic candidate had an easier time making the war issue resonate with the electorate. Compared wto previous U.S. conflicts, the number of war deaths per district is actually quite low. Perhaps surprisingly, these results suggest that American voters are extremely sensitive to a relatively small number of soldier deaths per district.\u201d\u000a\u000aGelpi, Feaver, and Reifler (2005)\u000a\u000aChristopher Gelpi, Peter D. Feaver, and Jason Reifler, \u201cSuccess Matters: Casualty Sensitivity and the War in Iraq\u201d, International Security 2005/2006\u000a\u000aGelpi et al stake a claim that the public will tolerate costs if the war is worth it:\u000a\u000aIn this article, we argue that the public will tolerate significant numbers of U.S. combat casualties under certain circumstances. To be sure, the public is not indifferent to the human costs of American foreign policy, but casualties have not by themselves driven public attitudes toward the Iraq war, and mounting casualties have not always produced a reduction in public support. The Iraq case suggests that under the right conditions, the public will continue to support military operations even when they come with a relatively high human cost. Our core argument is that the U.S. public\u2019s tolerance for the human costs of war is primarily shaped by the intersection of two crucial attitudes: beliefs about the rightness or wrongness of the war, and beliefs about a war\u2019s likely success. \u2026 Ultimately, we find that beliefs about the likelihood of success matter most in determining the public\u2019s willingness to tolerate U.S. military deaths in combat.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis paper employs \u201ca close examination of polling data from the beginning of the Iraq war through the 2004 U.S. election\u2014that is, for the first twenty months of the war.\u201d This is, then, explicitly a national level test and one that unfolds over time, rather than an Election Day snapshot.\u000a\u000aGelpi et al find that the war\u2019s public approval passed through three distinct phases: major combat operations, insurgency, and \u201cpost-sovereignty\u201d (when the CPA ended). Accounting for this delivers the result that different epochs of the war had different relationships between presidential approval and casualties: total combat casualties are positively and significantly related to presidential approval (!) but those during the occupation had a much larger, negative association with presidential approval: \u201cafter the United States transferred sovereignty to an Iraqi authority, the impact of casualties shifts again\u2026the model indicates that, between June and November 2004, casualties had no impact on presidential approval.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey also employ their own surveys to see if belief in future success affects casualty tolerance. They find it does (34-36). They also find (at 37) that party ID was at the same scale of effect on approving of high military deaths as whether a voter perceived an elite consensus on the war or whether voters perceived Iraq to be a \u2018distraction\u2019 or the \u2018central front\u2019 of the war on terror.\u000a\u000aBy the way, I wonder why this is judged to be a measure of prospective, rather than retrospective, support. My favorite findings in political science relate to the strong retrospective bias in current evaluations.\u000a\u000aBerinsky and Druckman (2007)\u000a\u000aAdam J. Berinsky and James N. Druckman, \u201cPublic Opinion Research and Support for the Iraq War,\u201d Public Opinion Quarterly\u000a\u000aBerinsky and Druckman respond directly to Feaver, Gelpi, and Reifler, noting that their study formed the basis for a shift in the Bush administration\u2019s rhetoric (2). They launch methodological criticisms of the work focused on the idea that \u201cmethodological concerns \u2026 [make] it difficult to distinguish between their hypothesized causal hypothesis and that of other leading theories of the determinants of war support\u201d (3). They modestly describe their concerns as relating to \u201cthree integrally related dimensions of the FGR analysis: the dependent variable, the independent variables, and, ultimately, their causal claims\u201d (4), which, I suppose, leaves the punctuation.\u000a\u000aDependent variable. Berinsky and Druckman argue that FGR use too few measures of war support, given that they only use one explicitly measured dependent variable: \u201cindividual casualty tolerance.\u201d As they note, \u201cFGR\u2019s dependent variable inherently assumes that support for war should be measured by the number of American war deaths a respondent is willing to bear \u2026 ironic since FGR in fact argue that casualties are not the primary determinant of support for war\u201d (6).\u000a\u000aIndependent variable. FGR focus on \u201cperceptions of success\u201d as key explanatory variables. As Berinsky and Druckman argue, though, \u201cit is not clear how best to give meaning to the cross-sectional variation in individual perceptions of success\u201d (8). One problem is that partisanship matters (8) by influencing people\u2019s predictions of success: \u201cIn sum, we suspect that FGR\u2019s \u2018success\u2019 variable is an indicator of support for war, not a cause of support for war. Like other measures of war support, it is influenced in part by partisan predispositions\u201d (10). They separately dismiss \u2018initial support\u2019, FGR\u2019s other key independent variable, by pointing out that \u201crespondents\u2019 evaluation of the initial decision [to go to war]\u201d cannot easily be differentiated from \u201ctheir contemporaneous evaluation of the war\u201d (10). They suggest instead that, as with the dependent variable, a better measurement would have used (or been derived from) a multiple-measures approach to yield a latent-variable indicator (11-12). And, cuttingly, they argue that (12) \u201cwe suspect that the two independent variables of interest may actually be better indicators of latent support for the war in Iraq than their dependent variable.\u201d\u000a\u000aCausality. Berinsky and Druckman write that \u201cit is very difficult to establish causal relationships in cross-sectional nonexperimental data with such highly related variables\u201d (13). They further write, \u201cWe therefore find ourselves in agreement with former Gallup Vice President David Moore who concludes, \u2018The causal model cannot be proved, at least by the data obtained by the three authors; in this case, causality is more an act of faith than a provable dynamic\u201d (13).\u000a\u000aGelpi and Reifler (2008)\u000a\u000aChristopher Gelpi and Jason Reifler, \u201cReply to Berinsky and Druckman: Success Still Matters\u201d, Public Opinion Quarterly\u000a\u000aGelpi and Reifler respond to Berinsky and Druckman. They argue that the dependent variable needs to measure costs somehow; how else to do this? They argue \u2014 I think a trifle speciously \u2014 that Berinsky and Druckman advocate throwing up our hands and not measuring this. They similarly mostly dodge on questions related to the measurement of the independent variable, including party ID (although I think their response that success is different than casualties is pretty on point). They also have a pretty pointed response to the question of the dimensionality of Iraq attitudes, including the fact that there\u2019s only enough indicators to find one dimension and consequently it\u2019s unsurprising that they find only one. Mostly, the article seems like a defensive attempt \u2014 holding onto their claims while giving ground and agreeing that \u201cmore work is necessary.\u201d\u000a\u000aFox (2009)\u000a\u000aGerald T. Fox, \u201cPartisan Divide on War and the Economy,\u201d Journal of Conflict Resolution\u000a\u000aAfter seven pages of lit review, this paper gets to the point: \u201cThe present analysis tests three partisan influences on Bush approval, consisting of the partisan macroeconomic cleavage, an in-party/out-party rally effect, and a war-economy partisan effect\u201d (910) by testing \u201cthe in-party/out-party hypothesis for the 9/11 and the Iraq War rallies on Bush approval\u201d (911). Fox notes (912) that \u201cOut-party identifiers have stronger rallies [in presidential approval] but also faster and deeper defections than in-party identifiers\u201d. Using monthly time-series data (March 2001 to December 2008; 916), Fox estimates approval using a three-equation seemingly unrelated regressions. Notably, he find that log(war fatalities) does not effect Republican support but strongly affects Democratic and Independent support.\u000a\u000aFox finds that \u201cDemocrats give fleeting credit to a Republican president for rally events, while Republicans give more sustained credit\u201d (919). He also finds that Democrats and Republicans difered in interpreting economic events: \u201cGasoline prices and unemployment are significant influences on presidential approval across all groups except Democrats, whereas the war fatalities effect is significant across all groups except Republicans\u201d (927).\u000a\u000aVoeten and Brewer 2006)\u000a\u000aErik Voeten and Paul R.

They note that voters in a democracy (should) want to reward competence and punish incompetence, but because competence is not directly observable citizens have to figure out whether a president is competent through observing outcomes. Yet \u201cthe implications of individual [short-run] outcomes for a leader\u2019s competence may be ambiguous and open to competing interpretations\u201d (811). They contrast a managerial model (\u201chow well is this war going\u201d) of inferring accountability (\u201cif the war is going well, the president must be a good manager\u201d) with a decision-making model (\u201chow good was the decisions to go to war\u201d), which implies a different evaluative process (\u201cif the decision to go to war was good, then the president makes good decisions\u201d). This implies voters use retrospective evaluations to shape their current beliefs about a president.\u000a\u000aFrom this, they argue that \u201cevents and casualty reports affect perceptions of the war\u2019s success but have relatively little direct impact on support for the war.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cshifts in aggregate war support have stronger effects on overall presidential approval ratings than do shifts in beliefs about the war\u2019s success or even beliefs about whether President George W. Bush is \u2018doing a good job\u2019 in handling Iraq.\u201d Therefore, \u201ccitizens primarily held President Bush accountable for his perceived decision-making qualities rather than his managerial qualities\u201d (810-811). They note that \u201caggregate opinion about the war\u2019s success is likely to be more volatile than opinion about its merits\u201d (813). Therefore, \u201cshifts in war support predict shifts in overall presidential job approval more strongly than do shifts in a more direct measure of perceived managerial abilities: perceptions of Bush\u2019s handling of Iraq\u201d (814).\u000a\u000aBrewer and Voeten use a multiple-indicators approach (war support, war success, Bush approval on Iraq, overall Bush approval) to measure (weekly!) changes in aggregate beliefs while controlling for perceptions of the economy. The trick is that \u201caggregate war support and perceptions of war success followed roughly the same pattern\u201d (819). They measure casualty sensitivities by using the log of cumulative casualties and also the marginal change in the number of cumulative casualties from the preceeding week. They also (and it\u2019s weird that they are among the first to do this!) look to measurements of large-scale Iraqi deaths. They include FGR\u2019s three periods (major combat, occupation, and sovereignty) as well.\u000a\u000aThey find (822) that lagged casualties affected change in war success but not in war support, Bush approval, or overall Bush approval. Political events had a bigger effect on war support and Bush approval, such as Abu Ghraib (negative), Saddam\u2019s capture (positive), and the stampede of August 2005. (negative). They also find that \u201cweekly shifts in war support had a strong immediate effect on changes in presidential approval\u201d (826): \u201cA 1-percentage point increase in support for the war led to a .71-percentage point immediate increase in overall presidential approval\u2026the corresponding effects for perceptions of war success and Bush approval on Iraq were .28 and .47, respectively.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey explain these shifts with respect to elite signaling\u2013\u201cthe nature of elite discourse about a war is a key determinant of changing patterns in both war support itself and presidential approval during wartime\u201d (828). Therefore, \u201d a plausible interpretation of the trend in support for the war in Iraq is that increasing elite polarization regarding the war produced not only polarization among the public (with Democratic and Republican partisans diverging on its wisdom\u2026) but also declining support for the war in the aggregate\u201d (828).\u000a\u000aHill, Herron, and Lewis (2010)\u000a\u000aSeth J. Hill, Michael C. Herron, and Jeffrey B. Lewis, \u201cEconomic Crisis, Iraq, and Race: A Study of the 2008 Presidential Election,\u201d Election Law Journal\u000a\u000aThis is a fine empirical paper that argues that economic conditions and the Iraq war tended to help Barack Obama in his candidacy for the White House in 2008. The authors employ a county-level study of determinants of vote share; they find significant but rather small effects of unemployment and mortgage delinquency on Obama\u2019s share but huge contextual effects of the Iraq and Afghanistan vote share. From their hierarchical model, they estimate that \u201ca hypothetical 2008 presidential election held in a nation with zero Afghanistan and Iraq war fatalities would have decreased Obama\u2019s national share by 5.2 points\u201d (42).\u000a\u000aI am relatively unpersuaded by this paper, however, because its evidence seems so far beyond that of the others surveyed. Unlike Shen and Kriner or Karol and Miguel, for instance, Hill et al do not find any county-level effect of casualties on presidential vote share. Their argument is unpersuasive:\u000a\u000aWe speculate that this contrast [with earlier findings] is driven by the relative obscurity of county-level war casualties compared to, say, the obviousness of local unemployment, of shuttered storefronts, of a plethora of house for-sale signs, and so forth. Perhaps presidential candidates, with the Electoral College in mind, use state-level Iraq and Afghanistan figures in their advertisements that, due to media market boundaries, cross county lines. (54)\u000a\u000aFirst, I don\u2019t believe that anyone ever says that \u201cthe Iraq war has killed N Californians\u201d; I\u2019d be glad to be proven wrong. Second, this is precisely the opposite reasoning from the other, better-specified papers. Third, I can\u2019t believe the counterfactual because neither can the authors. The authors explicitly rule out modeling a counterfactual election with a 90% drop in the financial markets because \u201ca drop of this magnitude [would be] so large and so outof sample, broadly speaking, that suggesting our model can internalize it would strain credibility\u201d (58). However, they then proceed to model a zero-fatality Iraq and Afghanistan election, even though \u201cour models do not have any leverage on what a 2008 presidential race would have looked like if the contesting candidates were, say, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Mitt Romney\u201d (59).

aVAnxious to find precedents for the frightening and ultimately deadly white nationalist, \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, some media outlets have likened the images of the recent mayhem in Virginia to the chilling ones of the German-American Bundrally that filled Madison Square Garden on February 20, 1939, with 22,000 hate-spewing American Nazis.\u000a\u000aThat rally, the largest such conclave in U.S. history, shocked Americans at the time. They had seen the press accounts and newsreel footage of the Nazis\u2019 massive Nuremburg rallies; they had read about Kristallnacht, the murderous, two-day anti-Semitic pogrom of November 1938, which the Bund \u2014 the fast-growing, American version of the German Nazi party, which trumpeted the Nazi philosophy, but with a stars-and-stripes twist \u2014 had unabashedly endorsed.\u000a\u000aBut that was in Europe. This was America. New York City. For Americans wondering whether it could happen here, the Bund rally provided the awful answer.\u000a\u000a\u201c22,000 Nazis Hold Rally In Garden,\u201d blared a front-page headline in the New York Times. Inside, photos captured the restless throng of counterprotesters outside the arena and the Bund\u2019s smiling uniformed leaders. \u201cWe need be in no doubt as to what the Bund would do to and in this country if it had the opportunity,\u201d the Times opined in an editorial later that week. \u201cIt would set up an American Hitler.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome 78 years after the Bund rally at Madison Square Garden, a new generation of hectoring troglodytes descended on Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1939, Brown Shirts at Madison Square Garden felt emboldened to seize a Jewish protester who had rushed the podium where the Bund\u2019s German-born leader, Fritz Kuhn, was speaking, and beat him near-senseless. In 2017, members of the so-called alt-right held a torchlight rally in Charlottesville, and the next day, one of those white nationalists went even further and allegedly used his car to mow down anti-Nazi protesters, killing a young woman, Heather Heyer.\u000a\u000aThose who have studied the Bund\u2019s rise and fall are alarmed at the historical parallels. \u201cWhen a large group of young men march through the streets of Charlottesville chanting, \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019 it\u2019s only steps removed from chanting \u2018death to the Jews\u2019 in New York or anywhere else in the 1930s,\u201d said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. \u201cWhen those young men chant \u2018blood and soil,\u2019 it conveys the same meaning as those decades before who chanted \u2018blut and boden,\u2019 referring to the Nazi glorification of and link between race and land.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t see much of a difference, quite frankly, between the Bund and these groups, in their public presence,\u201d said Arnie Bernstein, the author of \u201cSwastika Nation,\u201d a history of the German American Bund. \u201cThe Bund had its storefronts in New York, Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles \u2014 today\u2019s groups are also hanging out in the public space, but in this case, they\u2019re on the internet and anyone can access their \u2018storefronts,\u2019 or websites, and their philosophy, if you can call it that, is essentially the same.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the Bund, the unnerving 1939 Madison Square Garden rally was at once the organization\u2019s high point and\u2014as a result of the shock and revulsion it caused\u2014its death knell. It\u2019s too soon to know exactly what effect Charlottesville\u2014which was smaller, but more violent than the Bund\u2019s 1939 demonstration\u2014will have on white nationalists or how the American public, which is still processing the horrific event, will ultimately respond to it. Will Charlottesville be the beginning of the end of this reborn generation of American Nazis? To foretell where we could be headed, you need to know how the Bund\u2019s version of it all played out 78 years ago \u2014 and how this time is different.\u000a\u000aThe rise and fall of the German-American Bund in the late 1930s is essentially the story of the man behind it: Fritz Julius Kuhn.\u000a\u000aA German-born veteran of the Bavarian infantry during World War I, Kuhn was an early devotee of Adolf Hitler who emigrated to the United States for economic reasons in 1928 and got a job as a factory worker for Ford. After a few years in the U.S., Kuhn began his political career by becoming an officer with the Friends of New Germany, a Chicago-based, nationwide pro-Nazi group founded in 1933 with the explicit blessing of German deputy führer Rudolf Hess.\u000a\u000aAt the time, imitation Nazi parties were sprouting up throughout the world, and, at least initially, Hess and Hitler hoped to use them to incorporate new areas, particularly in Europe, into the Greater Reich. But soon, FONG\u2019s low-grade thuggery\u2014coercing American German-language newspapers into running Nazi-sympathetic articles, infiltrating patriotic German-American organizations, and the like\u2014became a nuisance to Berlin, which was still trying to maintain good relations with Washington. In 1935, Hess ordered all German citizens to resign from FONG, and he recalled its leaders to Germany, effectively putting the kibosh to it.\u000a\u000aKuhn, who had just become a U.S. citizen, saw this as his chance to create a more Americanized version of FONG, and he seized it. With his new German-American Bund, Kuhn had a vision of a homegrown Nazi Party that was more than simply a political group, it was a way of life \u2014 a \u201cSwastika Nation,\u201d as Bernstein calls it.\u000a\u000aOne year ahead of the outbreak of World War II, Berlin still hoped for good relations with Washington.\u000a\u000aAlthough Kuhn dressed his vision in American phraseology and icons \u2014 he approvingly called George Washington \u201cthe first American fascist\u201d \u2014 the Bund was, in fact, a clone of its Teutonic forebear, transposed to U.S. soil. In deference to his Berlin Kamerad, Kuhn gave himself the title of Bundesführer, the national leader. Just as Hitler had his own elite guard, the SS, Kuhn had his, the Ordnungsdienst or OD, who were charged with both protecting him and keeping order at Bund events. Although the OD were forbidden to carry firearms, they did carry blackjacks and truncheons, which they had no compunctions about using on non-fascist heads, as they did at an April 1938 Bund meeting in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, when seven protesters were injured by members of the OD.\u000a\u000aLike the German Nazi Party, the Bund was divided into different districts for the eastern, western and midwestern sections of the country. The Bund also had its own propaganda branch, which published a newspaper as well as the copies of \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Hitler\u2019s testament, which all Bund members were required to buy. Kuhn also oversaw the establishment of a score of gated training and summer camps with Teutonic-sounding names like Camp Siegfried and Camp Nordland in rural areas around the northeast, where his card-carrying volk could be indoctrinated in the American Nazi way, while their dutiful fraulein polished their German cooking skills and their brassard-wearing kinder could engage in singalongs while practicing their fraternal Seig Heils. Every so often, Kuhn would pull up in his motorcade, bless the proceedings and deliver himself of a sulfurous Hitler-style harangue \u2014 in English.\u000a\u000aIn effect, the Bund was its own ethnostate, as today\u2019s neo-Nazis would call it. And it worked: By 1938, two years after its \u201crebirth,\u201d the group had become a political force to be reckoned with. Its meetings each drew up to several thousand visitors, and its activities were closely followed by the FBI. With the anti-Semitic radio broadcaster the Rev. Charles Coughlin having faded from the national scene following FDR\u2019s landslide second-term win, Kuhn was now the country\u2019s most vocal and best-known ultra-right leader and anti-Semite.\u000a\u000aIt was just as the Führer would have wished. Except that the Führer didn\u2019t wish.\u000a\u000aOne year ahead of the outbreak of World War II, Berlin still hoped for good relations with Washington. The Reich refused to give Kuhn\u2019s organization either financial or verbal support, lest it further alienate the Roosevelt administration, which had already made clear its extreme distaste for the Nazi ideology. Berlin went so far as to forbid German nationals in the United States from joining the German American Bund.\u000a\u000aThe Führer\u2019s brush-off didn\u2019t deter Kuhn and his volk, who continued to sing the Reich\u2019s praises.\u000a\u000aNor did they mind the Kristallnacht of November 1938, the nationwide German pogrom set off by the assassination of a German diplomat by a Jew in Paris, which led to nearly 100 deaths, scores more injuries and the decimation of what remained of German-Jewish life. Comparing the assassination to the attacks on Bund meetings by anti-Nazis\u2014the spiritual predecessors of today\u2019s so-called antifa \u2014 its propagandists claimed the Kristallnacht massacre was a justifiable act of retribution. The Bund\u2019s endorsement of the horrific event increased the American public\u2019s hostility toward it, while causing the most prestigious German-American organization, the Steuben Society, to repudiate it.\u000a\u000aThat didn\u2019t discourage Kuhn either. Now, he decided, as the sea of opprobrium rose around him, was the moment to step into the spotlight and show just how strong the Bund was.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what the Madison Square Garden rally was about. On the surface, the conclave, billed as a \u201cMass Demonstration for True Americanism,\u201d was supposed to honor George Washington on the occasion of his 207th birthday. But the unprecedented event was really intended to be the German-American Bund\u2019s apotheosis, proof positive to America and the world \u2014 as well as Berlin \u2014 that the American Nazis were here to stay. \u201cThe rally was to be Kuhn\u2019s shining moment, an elaborate pageant and vivid showcase of all he had built in three years,\u201d Bernstein wrote in his 2013 book. \u201cKuhn\u2019s dream of a Swastika Nation would be on display for the whole world, right in the heart of what the Berlin press called the \u2018Semitized metropolis of New York.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough the mass demonstration was intended for Bund members, walk-ins from sympathetic Nazi-minded American citizens were also welcome. Kuhn had big dreams: One of the posters that adorned the hall optimistically declared, \u201cONE MILLION BUND MEMBERS BY 1940.\u201d\u000a\u000aSkeptics wondered whether the Bundesführer would be able to fill the massive arena. Any doubts on that score were quickly allayed, as the 20,000 Nazi faithful who had driven or flown in from every corner of Swastika Nation filed into the great hall. Meanwhile, an even larger crowd of counterdemonstrators, eventually estimated at close to 100,000, filled the surrounding midtown Manhattan streets.\u000a\u000aNew York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and Police Commissioner Lewis Valentine were prepared for both the Nazis and their adversaries, wrapping the Garden with a security cordon of 1,700 policemen \u2014 the largest police presence in the city\u2019s history \u2014 including a large contingent of mounted officers to keep the two sides apart. LaGuardia, an Episcopalian whose mother was a Jew, loathed the Bund, but he was determined to see to it that the Bundists\u2019 right to freedom of speech would be respected. Americans could judge the poisonous result for themselves.\u000a\u000aInside the Garden, things went pretty much according to Kuhn\u2019s faux-Nuremberg script. As drums rolled, an honor guard of young American Nazis marched in bearing the flags of the U.S. and the Bund, as well as the two fascist powers, Nazi Germany and Italy. One by one, the various officers of the Bund stepped forth to extol America (or their version of it) and condemn the \u201cracial amalgamation\u201d that had putatively taken place since the good old unmongrelized days of George Washington. Anti-Semitism, naturally, was a major theme of the venomous rhetoric that issued forth as the newsreel cameras rolled.\u000a\u000aFinally, after being introduced as \u201cthe man we love for the enemies he has made,\u201d the jackbooted Bundesführer himself stepped up to the microphone to deliver one of his trademark jeremiads, scoring the \u201cslimy conspirators who would change this glorious republic into the inferno of a Bolshevik Paradise\u201d and \u201cthe grip of the palsied hand of communism in our schools, our universities, our very homes.\u201d When he paused, he would be greeted with shouts of \u201cFree America!\u201d\u2014the new Bund greeting that had replaced \u201cSeig Heil!\u201d but with the same intonation and raised arm salute.\u000a\u000aIt was all over in a moment\u2014but it was a moment that horrified America: A bunch of Nazis beating up a Jew in the middle of Madison Square Garden.\u000a\u000aAccording to Kuhn, both the federal government and New York City government were Jewish agents. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose antipathy for Nazism was a matter of record \u2014 \u201cNazism is a cancer,\u201d he said \u2014 was actually \u201cFrank D. Rosenfeld.\u201d \u201cFree America!\u201d District Attorney Thomas Dewey was \u201cThomas Jewey.\u201d \u201cFree America!\u201d Mayor LaGuardia was \u201cFiorello Lumpen LaGuardia.\u201d \u201cFree America!\u201d And so on.\u000a\u000aOf course, Kuhn\u2019s followers had heard it all before. Now it was time for the world to listen. The people would rise up, and as Kuhn\u2019s role model, Joseph Goebbels, the Third Reich\u2019s minister of propaganda put it, the storm would break loose.\u000a\u000aThe storm was certainly rising, both inside and outside the Garden.\u000a\u000aThe only alteration to the script took place when, halfway through Kuhn\u2019s speech, a young Jewish counterprotester by the name of Isadore Greenbaum decided that he couldn\u2019t bear Kuhn\u2019s diatribe anymore and spontaneously rushed the podium and attempted to tackle him.\u000a\u000aHe almost made it. On the newsreel footage of the rally shown in movie theaters throughout the country the following weekend, viewers could see Kuhn\u2019s shocked visage as the Jewish kamikaze shakes the podium. Next, they saw the hapless Greenbaum set upon by a gaggle of furious OD men, who covered him with blows before he was finally rescued by a squadron of New York policemen. It was all over in a moment\u2014but it was a moment that horrified America: A bunch of Nazis beating up a Jew in the middle of Madison Square Garden.\u000a\u000aThe Bundesführer took the interruption in stride. Kuhn proceeded with his speech.\u000a\u000aAnd then it was over, and the thousands of Nazi faithful dutifully exited the arena. As far as the Bund was concerned, the rally was a success \u2014 a shining moment for America\u2019s most prominent fascist. But the rally further angered Berlin, which was then preparing to go to war with the Allies \u2014 a war Germany still desperately hoped the U.S. would steer clear of.\u000a\u000aLaGuardia was proud of the way his city and his police force had handled the Bund\u2019s rally. At the same time, the orgy of hatred at the Garden sealed his determination, along with that of Thomas Dewey, to take down Kuhn, and the Bund along with him, by investigating his suspicious finances (the married Kuhn liked to party and kept a number of mistresses, evidently, at the Bund\u2019s expense).\u000a\u000aA subsequent inquiry determined that the free-spending Kuhn had embezzled $14,000 from the organization. The Bund did not wish to have Kuhn prosecuted, because of Führerprinzip, the principle that the leader had absolute power. Nevertheless, with the implicit blessing of the White House, Dewey decided to go ahead and prosecute.\u000a\u000aOn December 5, 1939, Kuhn was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in jail for tax evasion. On December 11, 1941, while he was locked away in Sing Sing prison, Germany declared war on the U.S. Kuhn\u2019s support for a government now actively hostile to America gave the federal government the pretext to revoke his citizenship, which it did on June 1, 1943. Upon Kuhn\u2019s release from prison three weeks later, he was immediately re-arrested as a dangerous enemy agent. While Kuhn was in U.S. custody in Texas, Nazi Germany was destroyed, its quest for global domination permanently halted, and Hitler was dead. Four months after V-E Day, the U.S. deported Kuhn to war-ravaged West Germany. His dreams of a Swastika Nation had been smashed to pieces. He died in Munich in 1951, a broken man, in exile from the country he had sought to \u201cliberate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Bund\u2019s rally was at once the group\u2019s apex and its death rattle.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, historical comparisons are, to an extent, folly. For all the similarities between the Bund\u2019s 1939 rally and the white nationalists\u2019 Charlottesville demonstration, there are substantial differences.\u000a\u000aFortunately, no one with Fritz Kuhn\u2019s particular demagogic skill set has emerged to lead his neo-Nazi descendants, though there are those attempting to play the part. \u201cI am worried that a Kuhn figure could marshal the disparate alt-right groups,\u201d said Arnie Bernstein, \u201cbe it a Richard Spencer, David Duke or someone of that ilk.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother difference is while the Bund\u2019s rally and the violence that spilled from it was denounced forcefully by America\u2019s top political leaders, President Donald Trump\u2019s half-hearted condemnation and shocking defense of the Charlottesville mob as including \u201cvery fine people\u201d has no antecedent, at least in modern American history. \u201cWe have a president blowing dog whistles loud and clear,\u201d said Bernstein. \u201cYou never saw that with FDR.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Bund\u2019s rally was at once the group\u2019s apex and its death rattle. But it\u2019s only in retrospect that one can make such pronouncements; nobody yet knows exactly what Charlottesville \u2014 and Trump\u2019s response to it \u2014 will mean for the alt-right. \u201cThe striking ambivalence coming out of the White House\u201d could help to galvanize Nazi sympathizers, said David Harris of the American Jewish Committee.\u000a\u000aBut much as the Bund\u2013generated images of Nazi barbarism and violence drove everyday Americans from apathy 78 years ago, \u201cCharlottesville will also mobilize anti-Nazis to stand up and be counted,\u201d Harris said. Much as the Madison Square Garden rally did on the eve of World War II, said Harris, \u201cI choose to believe the net effect will be to marginalize the \u2018blut and boden\u2019 fan base.\u201d\u000a\u000aGordon F.

aVAs a child growing up in rural Alaska, Vera Starbard was diagnosed with major depression. She\u2019d been sexually abused by her uncle and was plagued by thoughts of suicide. By the age of 10, she\u2019d already spent time as an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cIt was a really dark time,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t feel like it was ever going to get better.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut when she was 11, things changed. Her family moved to Anchorage, and they joined the Southcentral Foundation, a health care provider for native Alaskans. The foundation was launching a new approach to health care\u2014one that wove mental health into the rest of its primary care.\u000a\u000aFor Vera, that meant every checkup included a mental health evaluation. Her primary care team included a psychologist or social worker who offered care on-site. There were a variety of group counseling programs to choose from. Every person she saw had her health record, there were no outside charges, and there was never a wait to make an appointment.\u000a\u000aPerhaps most important, accessing mental health treatment was as easy as going to her regular doctor, and there was no stigma attached: Her mental health services were provided at the same time and in the same place as other medical care, just like heading down the hall for an X-ray or blood test.\u000a\u000aIn Anchorage, she still had a lot to work through, and difficult times ahead. But today, at age 35, she says that Southcentral\u2019s approach to mental health care saved her life. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher than not probability that I would have committed suicide without the resources at my disposal,\u201d she says.\u000a\u000aVera Starbard at home in Anchorage, Alaska. A victim of sexual abuse as a child, she credits the easy access to behavioral health care at Southcentral Foundation with helping her overcome profound depression. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aIt's a truism that the mind and the body are connected, but the U.S. health care system has long treated them as separate\u2014with separate doctors, separate hospitals, separate payment systems. That\u2019s a major reason people with acute mental illnesses don\u2019t get help. Ditto for chronic conditions like depression and anxiety. People may not seek help because of stigma. They may not find it because there are too few providers and they are too hard to locate. Or people don\u2019t have health insurance, or can\u2019t afford the co-pays, or lose interest when faced with a long wait.\u000a\u000aThe result is that many people who need mental health care aren\u2019t getting it. According to a recent article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, nearly 18 percent of adults surveyed in 2015 reported having a mental, behavioral or emotional disorder. And 20 percent of respondents said either they or a family member had needed mental health care but didn\u2019t get it, either because they couldn\u2019t afford it, their insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it, they were afraid or embarrassed, or they had no idea where to go.\u000a\u000aAt the patient level, this means people with mental health issues suffer when they don\u2019t need to. And at the policy level, there are huge reasons to fix this, primarily the high long-term cost of untreated mental illness. Mental health plays a big role in chronic conditions like hypertension, obesity and diabetes. \u201cYou can go ahead and give all the insulin you want,\u201d says Donald Berwick, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a big proponent of behavioral health integration. \u201cIf you\u2019re not addressing the attendant behavioral health issues, you\u2019re not just missing the chance to reduce suffering, you\u2019re reducing the chance to save a lot of money.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn part because of their Alaska Native heritage, which puts a high value on spiritual health, the leaders of Southcentral recognized decades ago that behavioral health is tightly linked with bodily health. So they became one of the early adopters of integrated care. They embedded treatment for mental and emotional ills in their primary care practices, and found that patient satisfaction rates skyrocketed and usage of medical care went down, saving millions of dollars while improving patient outcomes.\u000a\u000aIn the nearly 30 years since Southcentral hired its first psychologist, pretty much every study has shown that integrating mental health care into medical care results in better patient outcomes and lower costs. A few years ago, analysts at actuarial firm Milliman estimated that integrating medical and behavior heath care could shave $26 billion to $48 billion each year from the nation\u2019s health care costs.\u000a\u000aBut adoption has been slow, in part because of the way much health insurance is structured. Mental health is often a separate benefit, if insurance pays anything at all. Doctors are paid more for procedures on sick people. They get less if they keep their patients healthy and out of the hospital.\u000a\u000aOf all the structural problems in the U.S. health care system, the segregation of mental health care from the rest of medical care is arguably the most costly, both financially and in terms of patient health. With new pressure to find ways to bend the curve of health care costs, and the growing burden of chronic disease and worker disability, perhaps no policy could have as much bang for the buck as finally integrating mental and physical health care.\u000a\u000aIN THE MIDDLE of the 20th century, mental illnesses weren\u2019t considered illnesses per se; fully debilitating illnesses were seen as \u201cinsanities\u201d and their sufferers often confined against their will in special mental hospitals. Illnesses that were less debilitating\u2014milder depressions, say, or anxiety or substance abuse\u2014were viewed as weaknesses of will, often ignored by medical professionals. Payment followed suit; for mental health providers it was low, for primary care providers it was essentially nonexistent.\u000a\u000aPeople had to either figure out a way to live with their conditions, or suffer as their illnesses got more acute. The arrival of more effective medications for mental illnesses opened things up a bit\u2014doctors could write a prescription, and patients could feel better without months or years of talk therapy. Still, several studies in the 1980s showed that many patients didn\u2019t get treatment, with as many as one-half of patients saying no when their doctors suggested they get mental health care.\u000a\u000aThe search was on for something better. In the early 1990s, private foundations and the federal government, through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, began funding clinical studies around the country. Could primary care providers be trained to recognize depression, and get their patients treated? Would that make a difference? The studies showed the answers were yes and yes. In 1996, the Institute of Medicine published a suggestion\u2014integrate primary and behavioral health care so that patients would get diagnosed and treated by their doctors or via direct referral to a behavioral health specialist as part of their routine medical care. Big health care systems like Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Administration began experimenting with integrating behavioral health care in some locations.\u000a\u000aPhysician's assistant Ingrid Carlson examines 6-month-old Milo Rebne. Southcentral Foundation's exam rooms have comfortable chairs and minimal equipment \u2013 the idea is to encourage conversation between health providers and patients, or in this case Milo's mom, Heather Lee Rebne. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aSouthcentral Foundation was ahead of the trend, having started thinking about integrating its care in 1985. CEO Katherine Gottlieb, an Alaska Native who won a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant award for her work at Southcentral, says there was a simple reason: \u201cWe did a survey of our community.\u2019\u2019\u000a\u000aSouthcentral asked community members to rank their health care priorities among choices like cancer care, diabetes, obesity and behavioral health. The top five priorities, says Gottlieb, were all related to behavioral health\u2014child sexual abuse, child neglect, domestic violence, behavioral health counseling and addictions.\u000a\u000aSo Southcentral forged forward with its goal of making patients with behavioral health issues feel welcome. It built an airy new primary care center that looks as much like a mountain lodge as it does a place to get medical care. Huge windows frame the snowcapped peaks of the nearby Chugach Mountains, and the halls are filled with Alaska Native art\u2014beadwork, blankets, dolls, carvings and paintings of totem animals such as ravens, orcas and eagles. There\u2019s an expansive lobby designed to host community gatherings. Foundation planners say the setting sends the message that the health of the community directly relates to the health of each of its members.\u000a\u000aToday, a patient with a history of mental illness, like Vera, gets evaluated by her doctor whenever she comes in for a medical appointment. If Vera seems anxious or depressed, the doctor might talk to her about it, or call in the behavioral health consultant. But the same goes for patients without a history of behavioral problems. A diabetes patient who has stopped taking his pills, for instance, might find himself in a 20- or 30-minute discussion with his primary care doctor about ways to deal with anxiety or depression. The primary care doctor or the behaviorist on the team might suggest more formal counseling, or the request might come from the patient. When hospital care is needed, patients are sent by their care team, and they return to that care team when they get out.\u000a\u000aThe system puts mental illnesses into the realm of routine health care. \u201cWe know that for tons and tons of people, stigma is a really big deal in behavioral health,\u201d says Douglas Eby, vice president of medical services at Southcentral and one of the many staffers who\u2019ve been there since the beginning. \u201cBut getting behavioral health during your visit with your primary care provider, or by the guy down the hall, at the same place and maybe during the same visit\u2014then it\u2019s nothing different, and not likely to be stigmatized.\u201d Your employer won\u2019t find out, and your buddies won\u2019t see your truck parked outside a mental health office. Integrating behavioral health care into a medical setting normalizes it, he says.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral takes things a step further, with several innovative group therapy programs, some of them building on Native American culture\u2014\u201clearning circles\u201d where people talk about how they dealt with internal conflict and about how to resolve their feelings. Vera attended an intensive one-week group therapy session where people shared memories of domestic violence, abuse and neglect. \u201cThat was the week I figured out I could be happy,\u201d she says. Family, faith and friends also helped, but what she learned at Southcentral was instrumental. \u201cThat was the start of not being a victim anymore, of seeing that there was light at the end of the tunnel and I wouldn\u2019t always be depressed.\u201d\u000a\u000aSouthcentral\u2019s administrators credit integration for lowering hospital admissions and visits to the emergency room by more than a third between 2000 and 2015. In a recent survey, 97 percent of patients said they were satisfied with the care. In 2011, the foundation was awarded a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for delivering top-quality care for less cost than the vast majority of U.S. providers.\u000a\u000aTHE BIGGEST CHALLENGE all along, says CEO Gottlieb, has been money.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral gets by on a combination of private insurers and government programs including Medicare, Medicaid and the Indian Health Service. But most of them don\u2019t pay much for mental health care, and they don\u2019t pay anything at all for some of the counseling and group sessions the foundation offers. So Southcentral subsidizes behavioral health care with savings from the medical side, and it gets grants as well.\u000a\u000aTOP: A mask in the lobby of the primary care building at the Alaska Native Medical Center.

BOTTOM: Behavioral health consultant Emily Degroot speaks with patient Elizabeth Pawluk. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aPayment is a challenge across the country.\u000a\u000aA landmark study of 113,452 patients in 102 group practices within the Intermountain Healthcare system in Utah and Idaho showed how much can be saved by integrating mental health care. Some practices included mental health care in a \u201cmedical home.\u201d In other practices, patients were referred to outside therapists. Annual medical costs were $515 higher per year for patients who did not get mental health services through their primary providers.\u000a\u000aWhile the benefit to patients was clear, the study had a second conclusion\u2014that providers lost money by integrating mental health. As physician Thomas Schwenk noted in an accompanying editorial, during the 2010-13 study period the integrated practices received $115 less per patient per year than the traditional practices, because payment was based on procedures and office visits. Since patients in the integrated practices needed less medical care, the doctors made less money.\u000a\u000aSuch payment practices are common, and Schwenk wrote that it\u2019s going to take \u201ca profound change in the fundamental structure of the U.S. health care delivery system\u201d to integrate behavioral health care into the primary care environment. That would take heavier reliance of payments going to groups of doctors caring for groups of patients, not piecemeal payments for individual services.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s broad support for behavioral health integration within the health care community and in Congress; there are few critics on record, and no one is lobbying against it. The trade association for companies that provide health care services to people in insurance plans, the Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, is a big booster. Patient groups love it for the access it gives, and for the destigmatization. Supporting health care reform that favors behavioral health care is a major legislative priority for the National Alliance for Mental Illness, which represents people with mental illnesses and their family members.\u000a\u000aAndrew Sperling, a lobbyist for NAMI, echoes the conclusion that the chief challenge is money. According to a SAMHSA estimate, Medicare spent $29 billion on mental health care in 2016, and the Medicaid bill was $67 billion. Sperling would like to see more for various demonstration programs. And if funds for Medicaid are cut, \u201ca lot of the innovation we\u2019ve seen with primary behavioral health integration would be stifled,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aStill, some doctors and other providers are not totally on board. Many psychiatrists today don\u2019t accept Medicare or other insurance, making access still a problem. And primary care practitioners and behavioral health workers may need training in how to work in an integrated system. \u201cPeople who become cardiologists and rheumatologists and all the other \u2018\u2013ologists\u2019 get minimal instruction in behavioral health,\u201d says Berwick.\u000a\u000aPsychologists and social workers may also have to be retrained, says Berwick\u2019s IHI colleague Mara Laderman. Mental health consultants in integrated care systems work differently. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on action-oriented problem solving over one session or a couple of 20-minute sessions, as opposed to having a more longitudinal therapeutic relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, that 50-minute, hour appointment.\u201d Southcentral\u2019s Eby confirms that\u2014he says they have to look long and hard for people willing to give care outside of those 50-minute boxes.\u000a\u000aLEFT: A garden with Alaska Native traditional healing plants outside Southcentral Foundation\u2019s primary care facility.

RIGHT: Health care providers use a bulletin board to send the message that patients are in charge. | Ash Adams for POLITICO\u000a\u000aSOLVING THESE PROBLEMS will take more than money; it will require changing the culture of medicine. Many groups are moving in that direction; the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and other groups have policies promoting integrated care and offer information to their members on how to adopt it.\u000a\u000aThe federal government supports a multitude of initiatives designed to promote behavioral health care integration. The Affordable Care Act set aside money for model projects. Close to a billion dollars has been granted for programs that will promote behavioral health care, like setting up patient-centered medical homes within Medicaid. And starting last January, Medicare has been paying physicians for behavioral health care management and consultation. There are new billing codes that allow physicians to charge for helping their patients get behavioral health treatment, managing their patients\u2019 care, and working with psychiatrists.\u000a\u000aAuthors of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine say it\u2019s a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d and predict millions of beneficiaries will benefit and that there will be millions of dollars in savings. There could be a ripple effect: Medicare often serves as an example to other insurers.\u000a\u000aSouthcentral Foundation leaders are often invited to speak at conferences or to health care organizations in the Washington, D.C., area, and when they do, they usually stop by Capitol Hill or federal agencies to talk about the benefits of providing mental health care in a primary care setting. Douglas Eby\u2019s trips have led him to believe that there will be more support in the future for fully integrated systems.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are popular with the whole political spectrum,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cut costs like crazy and emphasize self, and family, so Republicans love us. Democrats love us because we\u2019re all about community and social factors and reforming the pillars of society so that everyone has improved access to care. When we walk into different political offices, we emphasize different parts of the system so that they can hear our story in their words and values, but it is all very true and the truth is the same truth.\u201d\u000a\u000aConversations are a key part of the relationship between providers and patients -- called "customer-owners" -- at Southcentral Foundation.

But in the long run, he says, integrating behavioral health into primary health care is inevitable. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got to solve the health care cost problem,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aIn Anchorage, Vera Starbard is watching with interest. Until recently, she figured that all health systems offered mental health care right along with primary care. \u201cThat\u2019s literally what I had grown up knowing as health care.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut recently, she\u2019s seen several friends who are not part of Southcentral struggle to get mental health services. One friend, who, like Starbard, had been sexually abused, struggled for months to get approval from her health insurance company. Then her friend\u2019s intended counselor stopped taking new patients. \u201cI\u2019m only now seeing how good integrated care is,\u201d says Starbard. \u201cWe definitely took it for granted.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoanne Silberner is a freelance health writer based in Seattle.

aVEmmanuel Macron isn\u2019t going to Warsaw or meeting with Polish officials during this week\u2019s trip to Central Europe, but Poland is a key part of why the French president is on the road.\u000a\u000aAs an increasingly unpopular Macron prepares to launch his domestic economic reforms after the summer holidays, making it easier to hire and fire, unions are already planning protests. To discourage French workers from taking to the streets, Macron needs to show he\u2019s taking steps to defend them: That\u2019s why he\u2019s looking for allies in his effort to revamp the EU\u2019s Posted Workers Directive \u2014 which governs the conditions under which people from one country can work in another.\u000a\u000aFrance has long tried to stem the number of foreign workers able to work in Western Europe for lower salaries while paying taxes in their home countries, calling it \u201csocial dumping.\u201d Depicting the current system as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of EU values, Macron wants posted workers\u2019 contracts limited to one year instead of two, and for similar jobs to get similar pay, something that would undermine the competitive advantage for employers who currently avoid paying high social charges in France.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe single European market and the free movement of workers is not meant to create a race to the bottom in terms of social regulations,\u201d Macron said in Austria on Wednesday. \u201cIt is exactly this that is fueling populism and eroding confidence in the European project.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s where Poland comes in.\u000a\u000aMacron has long seen Poland\u2019s right-wing Law and Justice party government as a key foe in his program of rebuilding the EU.\u000a\u000aOut of 1.9 million such workers, about 420,000 are Poles, the highest number from any EU country, according to the European Commission. They largely work in building trades and seek employment in wealthy countries such as France, Austria and Germany. Even though such workers account for less than 1 percent of the EU\u2019s workforce, they have become a target in many countries worried about low-wage competition from Central Europe.\u000a\u000aAlthough Poland agrees with efforts to tighten up abuses, it balks at radical changes to the directive that could affect so many of its people. But Warsaw\u2019s growing problems with Brussels and tense relations with Paris make it an easy target for Macron.\u000a\u000aIn Austria, Macron met with the prime ministers of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, seeking to undermine the common position on posted workers of the Visegrad Group, a bloc that also includes Poland and Hungary. He made progress, winning cautious backing for his reform plans from the Slovaks and the Czechs.\u000a\u000aIn return, Macron acknowledged both countries\u2019 distaste for the EU program of allocating asylum seekers among member countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to say how many migrants should be sent to Slovakia,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe made no such effort to win over Poland and Hungary.\u000a\u000aTaking aim at Poland\u000a\u000aMacron has long seen Poland\u2019s right-wing Law and Justice party government as a key foe in his program of rebuilding the EU. During his election campaign, he urged the EU to impose sanctions on Poland if it continues to breach the bloc\u2019s democratic norms, and railed at a country he said \u201cviolates\u201d the EU\u2019s principles. He also made an appearance at a French Whirlpool factory that plans to move to Poland.\u000a\u000aOn Friday while in Bulgaria, Macron again laid into Poland, saying the Polish people \u201cdeserve better\u201d than the current government. He also made clear that Warsaw won\u2019t be able to block reforms to the Posted Workers Directive\u000a\u000a\u201cIn no way will the decision by a country that has decided to isolate itself in the workings of Europe jeopardize the finding of an ambitious compromise,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTies between Warsaw and Paris soured after the Polish government last year unexpectedly dropped a \u20ac3.2 billion contract to equip its military with multipurpose helicopters from Airbus. There have been a host of small annoyances since, with a Polish deputy defense minister saying that the French had learned to eat with forks thanks to Poles. A planned effort to limit Sunday shopping will deal a blow to big French retail chains that are a dominant presence in Poland.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s part of a broader Polish retreat from the European mainstream. Poland\u2019s closest ally, the U.K., is leaving the EU, and ties with Germany are frayed thanks to the Polish government\u2019s effort to seek reparations for wartime atrocities.\u000a\u000aRegular meetings among the leaders of Poland, France and Germany \u2014 the so-called Weimar Triangle \u2014 are sputtering. No summit has been planned for this year, and a French official said that scheduling another would be contingent on \u201ccontext\u201d \u2014 in other words the state of relations between Warsaw and the other two countries.\u000a\u000aWith few friends left, Warsaw is having difficulty blocking Macron\u2019s moves.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re either sitting at the table or you\u2019re on the menu. We\u2019re on the menu,\u201d said Marcin Zaborowski, a senior associate with Visegrad Insight, a foreign policy magazine. \u201cMacron is cleverly playing off Central Europe to change the Posted Workers Directive. That helps him a lot at home.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Polish government insists nothing is wrong.\u000a\u000a\u201cVisegrad is very united and has a common position [on the directive],\u201d Konrad Szyma\u0144ski, the deputy foreign minister in charge of European affairs, told the Polish Press Agency.\u000a\u000aBut his boss, Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski, couldn\u2019t resist a poke at the French, telling the Catholic Radio Maryja station on Thursday that Macron is trying to patch up deep weaknesses at home.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe French economy isn\u2019t able to compete with the powerful economies of many European countries, including Poland,\u201d he said, adding that instead of trying to make his own country more competitive, Macron \u201cthought up a way to limit our ability to function in the common European market.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not clear whether Macron\u2019s efforts to revamp the directive will work. Labor ministers will discuss the directive in late October, and there are still deep differences among member countries and within the European Parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cPoland is not lost. It\u2019s a great European country with which we have serious divergences\u201d \u2014 French MP Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade\u000a\u000aBut the sight of the French president touring Central Europe to do battle for French workers could help Macron, who is explicit about the link between revising the directive and delivering on his campaign promise of better \u201cprotection\u201d for French workers.\u000a\u000aAlthough France has turned a cold shoulder to Warsaw over concerns about rule of law, and Macron showed no interest in including Poland in this week\u2019s regional tour, MP Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade, vice president of the French parliament\u2019s European affairs commission, said that behind the scenes, Macron has close relations with President Andrzej Duda, with whom he has spoken three times since taking office.\u000a\u000a\u201cPoland is not lost. It\u2019s a great European country with which we have serious divergences,\u201d he told POLITICO. \u201cIf Macron is not going, it\u2019s mostly because he wants to see what can be done with countries that are willing to move forward. But his dialogue with Duda is very straightforward, notably on rule of law.\u201d\u000a\u000aNicholas Vinocur contributed reporting from Paris.\u000a\u000aThis article has been updated with Macron\u2019s comments Friday in Bulgaria.

aVNorth Korea was never supposed to get the bomb.\u000a\u000aFor decades, the United States and international community have worked hard to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons; we\u2019ve put in place a series of increasingly strong policies built on what we know, or what we think we know, about how countries manage to construct their own bombs. Yet North Korea successfully defied these efforts, raising a question that has long been debated by experts: Just what does it take for a country to become a nuclear power, and how can we stop it from happening?\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn the past year alone, North Korea has conducted a nuclear test of considerable yield and a flurry of medium and long-range missile tests. Intelligence reports suggest that North Korea is moving at a rapid clip to develop a whole suite of missiles on land and sea, may already have an inventory of sixty nuclear warheads based on a blend of fissile materials, can fit a compact warhead atop a missile, and shows no signs of slowing down despite repeated threats.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s little dispute as to why North Korean leaders wanted nuclear weapons\u2014to deter an attack and assure regime survival. But could it really happen? Many experts thought not. If you look at the academic theories about how nations nuclearize, few of them gave North Korea much of a chance. A program that was once derided as a \u201cjoke\u201d is anything but funny anymore. In addition to raising a host of strategic problems for the United States, Kim Jong Un has demolished our assumptions about how nuclear weapons spread, and raises a first-order question of significant global importance: How did a nation President Nixon once derided as a \u201cfourth rate\u201d \u201cpipsqueak\u201d acquire nuclear weapons against the will of the world? How did Pyongyang manage to defy the experts?\u000a\u000aThe question is more than an academic exercise. Scholarly theories about nuclear proliferation give us important insights into why and how states acquire nuclear weapons, and help policymakers build the tools to stop states from doing so. So if our theories are wrong or incomplete, then our policy prescriptions are likely to be off base as well. To put it simply: understanding why North Korea managed to acquire nuclear weapons is necessary to help ensure other countries can\u2019t follow the same playbook.\u000a\u000aTo appreciate why North Korea\u2019s achievement was so surprising, we need to understand what experts believed\u2014and how the Kim regime proved them wrong. A handful of big theories have driven the expert debate on nonproliferation in recent years.\u000a\u000a1. An impoverished state can\u2019t build a bomb. North Korea is a famine ridden, backward state\u2014it has trouble feeding its own people, lacks access to Western technology, and its sole car factory hasn\u2019t made a car in half a decade. One strand of nonproliferation theory focuses on technical and industrial capacity, arguing that acquiring nuclear weapons tends to require either an advanced economy, or substantial technological help from an existing nuclear power. Yet North Korea needed neither. It succeeded despite being one of the poorer countries in the world and managed to indigenously build the facilities needed to produce plutonium for weapons. While it did get some outside help \u2013 we know, for instance, that the Pakistan-based AQ Khan network assisted its uranium enrichment technology in the 1990s.\u2014Pyongyang already had the capability to produce fissile material for weapons. And although there is a debate about the provenance of its missile components and design assistance over the years, which likely came from a variety of countries ranging from the Soviet Union (and its successors) to China to Iran and Pakistan, experts now believe that North Korea is now able to indigenously produce its nuclear weapons and many of its missiles, and has shown an impressive ability to innovate by necessity.\u000a\u000a2. Dictators can\u2019t manage complex projects. North Korea is run by a tinpot dictator who is a notorious playboy and once had his own uncle brutally killed. Another strand of nuclear proliferation research argues that dictatorships of North Korea\u2019s variety are singularly incapable of managing complex projects like nuclear weapons programs. They require collaboration, trust in scientists, and delegation of resources; countries with neopatrimonial regimes like North Korea, where power derives from networks of personal loyalty, tend to be especially poor managers of nuclear programs. These regimes are prone to meddling in scientists\u2019 activities and can threaten execution for failure. Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq had multiple siloed efforts to produce nuclear material, but he so terrorized his scientists that they made almost no headway for a decade. Yet despite being a poster child for this type of regime, and being particularly brutal and ruthless dictators, Kim Jong Un and his father, Kim Jong Il, not only acquired nuclear weapons but also made rapid advances in their program. One prominent scholar predicted that North Korea\u2019s regime relegated it to forever pursuing nuclear weapons at a \u201csnail\u2019s pace,\u201d if at all. That snail is now clearly a hare.\u000a\u000a3. Vulnerable states can be deterred or denied As a relatively weak state under intense international scrutiny, North Korea should have been deterred or simply blocked from brazenly acquiring and testing nuclear weapons, especially in the face of American and allied military threats. North Korea faced a deadly serious threat of preventive war from the United States starting in the 1990s, and while it is easy to dismiss such threats as lacking credibility due to Pyongyang\u2019s ability to retaliate against Seoul, Kim Jong Il apparently did believe US threats of force in 1993 and 1994 were credible, and these threats were followed by the Agreed Framework in 1994, which temporarily froze North Korea\u2019s plutonium program. But North Korea learned from this experience, hiding and dispersing its program better, rendering the threat of successful preventive strikes even less credible. Over time, North Korea was seemingly emboldened by the threat of US military action, openly testing missiles and eventually nuclear weapons in defiance of not just the United States but its erstwhile patron China.\u000a\u000aSo if experts were wrong about all that, what does explain North Korea\u2019s nuclearization? A couple academic theories do a better job at explaining this outcome. Indeed, the oldest theory in the book\u2014which holds that states that perceive severe threats will bear high costs to acquire nuclear weapons\u2014may help explain North Korea\u2019s success despite a crumbling economy. As the late realist Kenneth Waltz once argued: \u201cno country has been able to prevent other countries from going nuclear if they were determined to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet there is something fundamentally unsatisfying about this argument: It suggests, at heart, that stopping highly motivated proliferators is a hopeless task. Fortunately history shows that\u2019s not the case: The United States has prevented a handful of countries, even those in their own dire security environments, from acquiring nuclear weapons, such as South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany, Iraq, and Iran.\u000a\u000aA more complete explanation would account for why North Korea was able to weather harsh international pressure from the United States and its partners, while other similarly threatened countries were not. Here, theories that focus on North Korea\u2019s economic orientation and its ability to maintain the support of key allies do a better job.\u000a\u000aAs a hypernationalist regime with a state-managed, closed economy, North Korea had relatively little to lose from international pressure. As an influential 2007 study argued, these types of regimes face low costs from sanctions\u2014since they aren\u2019t economically integrated to begin with\u2014and in fact they may relish a nuclear weapons program as a tool for bolstering nationalist myths. North Korea was particularly immune to unilateral sanctions levied by the United States, as it had virtually no political or economic ties to Washington even before it began pursuing nuclear weapons.\u000a\u000aThe fact is though that North Korea has never been entirely impervious to outside forces. In particular, Pyongyang has relied on the economic and political support of China, especially since the fall of the Soviet Union\u2014Kim Jong Un\u2019s defiant assertion of independence from Beijing is only occurring now. If a country\u2019s key patron is willing to look the other way and limit any sanctions to token measures\u2014and indeed, increase trade as international sanctions ramp up\u2014this provides shelter that can facilitate the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Similarly, America\u2019s willingness to look the other way helped give Pakistan the space to acquire nuclear weapons three decades ago.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s ability to defy expectations might seem like cause for pessimism. After all, if a country as poor and backward as North Korea can do it\u2014under the constant threat of sanctions and military action\u2014a better question may be not who can acquire nuclear weapons, but who can\u2019t?\u000a\u000aNevertheless, we can and should draw useful lessons from North Korea. It seems time to put to bed a couple of theories as comforting myths. We now know that countries with weak economies can eventually master nuclear or missile technology. Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani acquisition of nuclear weapons already suggested as much, but the North Korean example has made it clear once and for all. Nuclear technology is old, many components are readily available and masterable, and smart determined states can stay one step ahead of the international community with even a little breathing room. We should also stop assuming that even the most pathological and brutal dictators can\u2019t manage these programs successfully.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea may be an outlier, in many ways\u2026so far. But it may not be for long, and our policies need to be updated to internalize the lessons of North Korea\u2019s odds-defying acquisition of nuclear weapons. Nonproliferation efforts relying primarily on export controls and efforts to limit technology may buy time but are clearly insufficient against a motivated proliferator. Policies that depend on hoping for the regime to fail or fall are misguided in a world where impoverished dictators can indigenously master nuclear technology.\u000a\u000aTo be successful against isolated countries like North Korea, nonproliferation policies must either address the proliferator\u2019s underlying motives\u2014in other words, their sense of insecurity\u2014or they must enlist a strong multilateral coalition that enforces sanctions vigorously, with few exploitable cracks. This is a tall order, but North Korea shows that the stakes are rarely higher.\u000a\u000aNicholas L.

aVMost of the news President Donald Trump generated this week was, as usual, about Donald Trump himself: He induced whiplash by delivering a sober address on Afghanistan Monday night and then, less than 24 hours later, pumping up the crowd at a fiery, off-the-leash campaign rally in Arizona. He also continued to accelerate his war of words with leaders of his own party, attacking Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Sens. Bob Corker, Jeff Flake and John McCain.\u000a\u000aAnd as usual, there wasn\u2019t much policy behind all that noise: Even the new Afghanistan strategy includes only a modest bump in troops overseas. But in Washington, Trump\u2019s appointees continued to push their own priorities on the government, rolling back Obama-era policies largely out of the public eye. Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s White House changed policy this week:\u000a\u000a1. The State Department turns up the heat on Egypt\u000a\u000aWhen Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi visited the White House in April, Trump lavished the foreign leader with praise, saying he\u2019s doing a \u201cfantastic job in a very difficult situation\u201d and that \u201cwe are very much behind President al-Sisi.\u201d Those comments drew a sharp rebuke from human-rights groups that had been sharply critical of Sisi\u2019s human rights record.\u000a\u000aSo, it came as some surprise this week when the State Department delayed $200 million in aid to Egypt and cut another $100 million in aid altogether. State officials said the move was a result of Egypt\u2019s human rights record, including a new law that restricts the activities of nongovernmental organizations. But experts also suggested another motive: isolating North Korea. Egypt has historically had ties to North Korea, with North Korean pilots training Egyptian pilots in the 1970s. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did not deny that North Korea was a reason for the cuts in aid, saying, \u201cWe have a deep and multifaceted relationship with the country of Egypt. We have a lot of areas of close cooperation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe move also created troubles for White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was scheduled to meet top Egyptian leaders, including Sisi, this week to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. A meeting between Kushner and Egypt\u2019s foreign minister was canceled at the last minute, potentially a rebuke to State\u2019s move, though it otherwise did not appear to significantly disrupt the trip.\u000a\u000a2. Interior could shrink national monuments\u000a\u000aIn his final weeks in office, Barack Obama protected over 1.5 million acres of federal land from development by designating national monuments in the West, a final attempt to solidify his environmental legacy. Republican lawmakers, oil and gas interests and fishing and hunting groups blasted the move and appealed to Trump to review the designations. In April, they got their wish when Trump directed the Interior Department to review all monument designations larger than 100,000 acres all the way back to 1996.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke delivered that review to the White House. He didn\u2019t release it publicly, instead publishing a vague two-page fact sheet; in an interview with The Associated Press, Zinke said he was not recommending any monuments be rescinded but was suggesting a \u201chandful\u201d of changes. The New York Times later reported that Zinke recommended shrinking at least four monuments. It\u2019s unclear whether\u2014or when\u2014the White House will accept the recommendations. But given Trump\u2019s commitment to rolling back Obama\u2019s environmental legacy, Zinke\u2019s recommendations will likely find a favorable reception in the Oval Office. And if it does, it would be historic\u2014no national monument has been shrunk by a president since 1963.\u000a\u000a3. The White House changes American research priorities\u000a\u000aEvery year, the government funds billions of dollars in research, from large National Institutes of Health grants to small housing experiments. The sheer magnitude of money gives the government great influence over the direction of research across industries, a hidden lever for a sophisticated administration to guide the country well into the future.\u000a\u000aThis week, the Trump administration revealed that it intends to use that lever. The Office of Management and Budget, led by Director Mick Mulvaney, published a four-page memo\u2014dated August 27\u2014that lays out the administration\u2019s research and development priorities for fiscal 2019, which includes a focus on military technologies, border security and treatments for drug addiction. In a break from the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to combat climate change, there is almost no mention of environmental research, with the exception of one reference to renewable energy. The memo also directs agencies to focus on early stage research and, in a bolded section, strongly recommends the use of quantitative data to evaluate any R&D investments, terminating those in which \u201cfederal involvement is no longer needed or appropriate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe real-world effects of such a memo won\u2019t be immediately apparent. Research projects generally operate on a multiyear time frame, so the White House can\u2019t just shift the direction of federal R&D overnight. But these priorities can eventually have big policy implications as researchers focus on certain issues and ignore others. That assumes, of course, that there is actual R&D funding to disburse for research\u2014and if Trump has his way, that may not be the case. The White House has proposed huge cuts to research programs, rolling back federal nondefense R&D by almost 20 percent. Republicans and Democrats alike have rejected those cuts, so they will not become law. While that may be disappointing to a fiscal conservative like Mulvaney, it does help the administration in one sense: More R&D money gives agencies greater influence over the direction of American research.\u000a\u000a4. The Amazon-Whole Foods merger sails through\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s disdain for Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, is well known. "Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?" Trump tweeted in July. Last week, he wrote, "Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite those attacks, Amazon had no problem receiving approval from regulators to acquire the grocery giant Whole Foods. Although the deal has alarmed some antitrust watchers, who worry that Amazon\u2019s expansion is undermining competition in the long run by driving out competitors through its low prices, it barely hit a speed bump in Washington: The Federal Trade Commission released a short statement saying it had completed its investigation into the $13.7 billion deal, which was announced in June, and isn\u2019t going to challenge it. The quick approval also assuaged concerns that Trump would attempt to interfere in the regulatory review for political reasons. The deal is set to close on Monday.\u000a\u000aAmazon promptly announced that it will cut prices on a wide array of Whole Foods products, from avocados to tilapia, on Monday and intends to introduce benefits at Whole Foods stores for its Prime members.\u000a\u000a5. Trump ratchets up sanctions\u000a\u000aDuring his first few months in office, Trump attempted to woo Chinese President Xi Jinping, even saying he would relax his trade stance if China applied more pressure to North Korea. But those efforts have fizzled in the past few months, even as North Korea\u2019s nuclear program has continued to advance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis week, the administration took another unilateral step to stop Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions when the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Chinese and Russian individuals and entities, an effort to reduce North Korea\u2019s exports, which it uses to finance its nuclear program, and to choke off its access to the global financial system. The move is the second time in two months that Trump has sanctioned Chinese entities over North Korea. In addition, on Friday, the White House also announced new sanctions on Venezuela that attempt to cut financing to the country and its state-owned oil company.

aVFor many people, the first thing that jumps to mind upon hearing Marie Antoinette\u2019s name is the phrase \u2018Let them eat cake.\u2019 This quotation is frequently ascribed to France\u2019s doomed queen, given as her careless response to the famine affecting the people as the revolution began.\u000a\u000a\u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 is evidently a catchy phrase, because it\u2019s been recorded in use multiple times, dating back to sometime earlier than 1737. It was first ascribed to a Spanish princess, Marie Thérèse, who was the wife of French king Louis XIV, who reigned several decades prior to the French revolution. Marie Thérèse\u2019s apparent use of the phrase was slightly different, being more in reference to crusts of bread left in the pan.\u000a\u000aIn 1751, four years before Marie Antoinette was even born, the phrase was again attributed Madame Sophie of France and other times, to Madame Victoire of France. Sophie and Victoire were both great aunts of Marie Antoinette\u2019s husband, Louis XVI, and high-ranking within the royal family.\u000a\u000aBut the most telling proof of its origin prior to Marie Antoinette\u2019s reign as queen is that it can be found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s Confessions, which was a popular work during the queen\u2019s lifetime. Completed in 1769 but not published until about twenty years later, the work contains the line, \u201cAt length I recollected the thoughtless saying of a great princess, who, on being informed that the country people had no bread, replied, \u201cThen let them eat cake!\u201d\u2019 Sometimes it is translated as pastry, but the sentiment remains the same \u2013 an utterly naïve royal lady betrays a lack of comprehension and sympathy by making such a frivolous remark.\u000a\u000aIt must have been particularly frustrating for Marie Antoinette to hear slander that attributed the quotation to her. After all, she would have been familiar with Rousseau\u2019s work since it was very popular at the time, and one of her closest ladies in waiting, Madame Campan, often read aloud to her. I had some fun writing this scene in The Wardrobe Mistress.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s often thought that the cake of the quotation refers to brioche, a rich type of bread, which could account for the alternate translation to pastry. The texture of brioche is a cross between pastry and bread, with an even crumb and a dairy-sweet flavour \u2013 due to the high butter content. The richest brioche (which the upper classes would have eaten) can contain up to 80% butter! It\u2019s best baked in a metal tin, to create a delicate, hairline thin crust. Less decadent brioche is closer to 20% butter, and ranges in the middle can be baked as well.\u000a\u000aSince Marie Antoinette undoubtedly would have eaten brioche sometimes, even if she never suggested it as an alternative to plain bread for the peasants, I wanted to try baking it. My mom and I made it together, so now I can not only recommend brioche as tasty, if rich, but it was also a fun activity to do together. I couldn\u2019t help but think of Marie Antoinette while I ate it, enjoying the connection to history.\u000a\u000aThe Wardrobe Mistress, a novel of one of Marie Antoinette\u2019s wardrobe women who casually spies on the queen during the French Revolution and finds herself torn between her loyalty to the queen and her sympathy for the revolution, is available now.\u000a\u000aBuy links:\u000a\u000aAmazon | B&N | IndieBound | BAM | Macmillan\u000a\u000aShare this: Share\u000a\u000aFacebook\u000a\u000aPrint\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTwitter\u000a\u000aEmail\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLike this: Like Loading...

Some issues need to be explored in greater detail, the spokesman said in a statement.\u000a\u000aIn April, Mr. Trump ordered a sweeping review of 27 national monuments that were designated or expanded in recent years under the Antiquities Act. The review included places like Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks in New Mexico, Mojave Trails in California, and Katahdin Woods and Waters in Maine. National monuments are typically protected from new development in much the same way the national parks are.\u000a\u000aNative American tribes in the Southwest, which lobbied for years to get the Bears Ears region designated a national monument, are expected to fight any move to reduce its size. Charles Wilkinson, a professor of public land law and an adviser to the tribes, said such a decision would be \u201can attack on a significant part of the foundation of American conservation law.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have our complaint already ready to file,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aOutdoor recreation and environmental groups are also expected to fight to preserve the monuments at their present sizes.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump said in April that the goal of the review was to end \u201canother egregious use of federal power\u201d and give the states more say in how public lands are used.\u000a\u000aMike Noel, a Republican state representative in Utah, said that shrinking Bears Ears would be \u201ca victory for our state.\u201d Federal management of land in his state had constrained drilling, mining and grazing, he said, adding that Washington had no business setting aside so much land.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you turn the management over to the tree-huggers, the bird and bunny lovers and the rock lickers, you turn your heritage over,\u201d Mr. Noel said.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aDemocratic lawmakers who oversee federal land management and whose districts include some of the monuments under review expressed dismay at the process and at Mr. Zinke\u2019s decision not to make his recommendations public on Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou would think that, being a member of Congress, that I would be able to get some details,\u201d said Representative Ruben Kihuen, a Democrat whose Nevada district includes Gold Butte National Monument. \u201cMy constituents are asking what\u2019s going to happen to these lands, and I can\u2019t even go back and tell them. I\u2019m frustrated, and my constituents are frustrated.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of the territory that Mr. Trump targeted for review \u2014 about 553 million acres of land and sea in all \u2014 was set aside by Mr. Obama. But the review also included areas designated by Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000aThe Antiquities Act, signed into law in 1906 by President Theodore Roosevelt, gives presidents the power to designate national monuments that safeguard \u201chistoric landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest.\u201d Sweeping landscapes like the Canyons of the Ancients in Colorado and ocean areas like the Mariana Trench in the Pacific have been protected under the law, along with sites like the Statue of Liberty.\u000a\u000aPast presidents have altered the boundaries of national monuments, including about 19 occasions when acreage was removed from them, according to federal data.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aThose reductions were often small, and were sometimes offset by enlargements elsewhere. The largest reduction by far came in 1915 when President Woodrow Wilson cut 313,280 acres from the monument in Washington State that later became Olympic National Park.\u000a\u000aScholars are divided over whether the Antiquities Act authorizes a president to do that. But none of the previous reductions were contested in court, Mr. Wilkinson said.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMonument designations have been particularly contentious in Utah since 1996, when President Clinton made a surprise announcement that he was putting aside 1.9 million acres in the state for the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.

Twenty years later, when Mr. Obama designated Bears Ears, the step divided the region.\u000a\u000aSupporters of the monument, many of them Navajo, saw its creation as a victory for indigenous rights. (Bears Ears, named for two towering buttes, is just north of the Navajo reservation.)\u000a\u000aBut opponents, many of them descended from Mormon settlers, said it would strangle the region economically by barring future mining and drilling on its land.\u000a\u000aVideo\u000a\u000aIt is not clear that any mining or energy companies are eager to rush into Bears Ears. A study by the left-leaning Center for American Progress found that the land did not offer especially strong prospects for mineral resources \u2014 mostly uranium \u2014 or for oil or gas.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe area has slightly above-average resource potential, but there are no signs that it\u2019s a big play,\u201d said Matt Lee-Ashley, a spokesman for the center.\u000a\u000aThe Antiquities Act limits monument designations to the \u201csmallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected,\u201d a requirement that many conservative lawmakers have accused presidents of ignoring.\u000a\u000aIn his announcement on Thursday, Mr. Zinke said, \u201cNo president should use the authority under the Antiquities Act to restrict public access, prevent hunting and fishing, burden private land, or eliminate traditional land uses, unless such action is needed to protect\u201d the monument.\u000a\u000aDuring the review process, Mr. Zinke visited eight of the monuments on the list and met with local officials, business leaders and members of Native American tribes.

aVCLUJ-NAPOCA, Romania \u2014 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán\u2019s focus on border fences may have earned his country the nickname \u201cfortress Hungary,\u201d but his party is not shy about courting voters abroad.\u000a\u000aAs the spring 2018 election approaches, the ruling Fidesz party is ramping up its efforts to encourage Hungarian citizens in surrounding countries to register to vote.\u000a\u000a\u201cDual citizenship has allowed several hundred thousand Hungarians to officially become part of the Hungarian nation,\u201d Orbán wrote in a July letter sent to ethnic Hungarians living in neighboring countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the coming years, we will need to make decisions that will decide Hungary\u2019s fate, decisions that will have an effect on the entire Carpathian Basin,\u201d he wrote, urging dual citizens to register.\u000a\u000aOver the summer, billboards sponsored by a local chapter of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) party appeared in Romania\u2019s Transylvania region, calling for Hungarians to register to vote. Another local branch announced in late July that it was launching a phone campaign to encourage local Hungarian citizens to register.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe absolute majority of Fidesz is at risk\u201d \u2014 Viktor Szigetvári of Hungary\u2019s liberal opposition party Együtt\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian government estimates that by November the number of new citizens \u2014 added since a 2010 expansion of citizenship rights to ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries\u2014 will reach 1 million.\u000a\u000aHungary\u2019s parliament is selected using a mixed system, whereby some MPs are elected through single-member districts and others through party lists. Citizens in surrounding countries don\u2019t have districts \u2014 but they may cast a vote for a party list.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, it is widely believed that voters in surrounding countries could make a difference in the election\u2019s outcome.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe absolute majority of Fidesz is at risk,\u201d said Viktor Szigetvári, who heads the National Political Council of Hungary\u2019s liberal opposition party Együtt.\u000a\u000aFidesz is currently two MPs\u2019 votes short of a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is required for making constitutional changes. Votes from abroad could sway two seats, said Szigetvári, thus potentially changing the equation for the ruling party.\u000a\u000aCentury-old tensions\u000a\u000aHungary lost two-thirds of its territory following World War I (although chunks of this were in any case disputed with its neighbors). There are now Hungarian-speaking communities in Slovakia, Serbia, Romania and Ukraine. The largest, in Romania, consists of about 1.2 million Hungarian speakers.\u000a\u000aIn Cluj-Napoca, the capital of Transylvania and Romania\u2019s second largest city, Hungarian-speaking residents maintain a mental map of the city, referring to each street by its Hungarian name \u2014 even though the names cannot be found on any signs or formal maps. A statue of King Matthias, a 15th-century leader revered by Hungarians, stands in the main square.\u000a\u000aBut in the surrounding cafes, most people can be heard chatting in Romanian. Hungarians are a minority in the city, although in other parts of the country \u2014 the counties of Harghita and Covasna in pariticular \u2014 they are a sizable majority.\u000a\u000a\u201cHungarians living in Romania, while being Romanian citizens, from a cultural, linguistic and historical perspective see themselves as part of the Hungarian nation, a feeling reinforced by the fact that the Romanian state is often hostile to the Hungarian minority,\u201d said Csaba Sógor, a member of the European Parliament from UDMR, the main Romanian political group representing ethnic Hungarians. UDMR won 6.2 percent of the popular vote in the 2016 election.\u000a\u000aWith Romania preparing to celebrate the centenary of its creation in its modern-day form, heightened tensions over minority language and cultural rights are dominating many conversations.\u000a\u000aAnd with Romania\u2019s presidential election and the European Parliament election coming up in 2019 \u2014 plus a lack of progress on raising living standards \u2014 there are fears that local politicians may resort to nationalist rhetoric as a political tactic.\u000a\u000aAttila László, a member of Romania\u2019s senate representing UDMR, said: \u201c2018 won\u2019t be a simple year for anyone.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want Transylvanian Hungarian society to be a kind of target,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aFidesz courts voters\u000a\u000aFidesz has used this \u201coutsider\u201d feeling among the ethnic Hungarian minority to develop a unique relationship with potential voters living within Romania\u2019s borders.\u000a\u000aOn a recent summer evening, hundreds crowded into the Hungarian theater building in the city center of Cluj (as it is commonly known) for the opening of a Hungarian cultural festival. Among the guests of honor in the front row were not only local politicians but also László Kövér, the speaker of Hungary\u2019s national assembly and one of the founders of Fidesz.\u000a\u000aFidesz works closely with some local Hungarian groups, and the government in Budapest funds a wide range of projects in the region, from language education and the arts to voter registration drives. Thus far, its efforts have paid off: In Hungary\u2019s 2014 election, over 95 percent of votes cast by non-domestic citizens went to Fidesz.\u000a\u000a\u201cFidesz pursues a policy of national unity above borders and supports the aspirations for autonomy of Hungarians beyond the border,\u201d said László T\u0151kés, a protestant pastor from Transylvania who was elected to the European Parliament on Fidesz\u2019s list as a Hungarian politician.\u000a\u000aFidesz is popular among Transylvanian Hungarians in part because it supports the fight against \u201cassimilation and emigration,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBut some politicians believe that Fidesz\u2019s appeal in Transylvania has to do with more than ideology.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m counting on you!\u201d \u2014 Viktor Orbán, in a letter to Hungarians in neighboring countries\u000a\u000a\u201cI am convinced that those who vote for Fidesz don\u2019t all agree with each of its decisions,\u201d said Hunor Kelemen, a member of Romania\u2019s Chamber of Deputies who serves as president of the UDMR party. \u201cOrbán and a few other people\u2019s personalities \u2014 and the emotional connection \u2014 is much stronger,\u201d he said, citing the fact that Orbán and other top Fidesz politicians have been traveling to the region and meeting with locals since the 1980s.\u000a\u000aEach year, Orbán\u2019s most important policy speech takes place not in Hungary, but across the border in Tusnádfürd\u0151 (B\u0103ile Tu\u015fnad in Romanian) where Fidesz has been organizing a summer camp for the past 28 years. And when his party came to power in 2010, one of the first major policy changes Orbán implemented was extending citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in surrounding countries \u2014 a policy move that left-wing parties campaigned against during a 2004 referendum.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe vast majority, at least 75 or 80 percent according to our own opinion polls, will vote Fidesz for sure \u2026 and it could be even higher,\u201d said Kelemen, who meets with the Hungarian prime minister about four times a year.\u000a\u000aControversial voting system\u000a\u000aSome opposition politicians though, argue that the cross-border voting is unfair and designed to boost Fidesz\u2019s electoral prospects.\u000a\u000aUnlike Hungarians living within Hungary itself or Hungarians working in Western Europe \u2014 who generally have an address in Hungary \u2014 Hungarian voters in surrounding countries don\u2019t have to have a base in Hungary and are thus allowed to vote by mail. These voters are typically much more pro-Fidesz than Hungarian citizens residing in cities such as London.\u000a\u000aCritics also worry that the system Fidesz implemented for voting in surrounding nations leaves the door open to fraud: Citizens in surrounding countries only need to register to vote every 10 years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere will be tens of thousands of dead citizens in the electoral registry,\u201d said Szigetvári of opposition party Együtt.\u000a\u000aBut Fidesz faces challenges in mobilizing voters in the region. The Cluj theater building where Kövér spoke was packed, but the crowd was mostly older: Low birth rates and decades of emigration are taking their toll as Hungarians become a smaller minority.\u000a\u000aMoreover, not all Hungarian speakers are keen to vote for representation in Budapest. It is estimated that in 2014 less than half of eligible citizens in surrounding countries voted in Hungary\u2019s election.\u000a\u000aBut the government in Budapest still hopes that by engaging energetically with Hungarians in surrounding countries, the electorate will grow.\u000a\u000aAs Orbán wrote in his letter to Hungarians in neighboring countries: \u201cThe unification of the nation across borders was not only a gesture on our behalf \u2014 a past due reparation \u2014 it was more of an everyday act to allow us to shape our destiny together, to determine our own future.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m counting on you!\u201d he added.

aV(WASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 17, 2017) \u2013 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced today that the government of South Korea has lifted its ban on imports of U.S. poultry and poultry products, including fresh eggs. Korea had imposed the ban in response to a recent detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\u000a\u000aOn August 11, the United States notified the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) that it is now free of HPAI. This notification removed any justification for U.S. trading partners to restrict imports of U.S. poultry due to HPAI concerns. Currently, Korea imposes a ban on all U.S. poultry in response to any HPAI detection, but USDA continues to work with Korean officials towards limiting any future import restrictions to the affected area, consistent with OIE guidelines.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world and we were at once able to quickly identify, confine, and control this most recent disease outbreak. Our hope is that Korean officials will recognize that our system works and will move towards a regional approach in the event of any future findings of bird flu,\u201d said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. \u201cSouth Korea is one of our best trading partners, and we want to continue being their most dependable supplier of high-quality food and farm products. Korea\u2019s lifting of its most recent ban is an important move for our poultry and egg industries, but it is still just the first step.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the last full year without any HPAI-related trade restrictions in place, South Korea purchased $122 million in U.S. poultry products, including eggs, making it the United States\u2019 tenth-largest market. South Korea\u2019s imports from all sources exceeded $350 million in 2016, but only $39 million came from the United States.\u000a\u000aKorea has also announced a temporary measure that will allow U.S. eggs and egg products to enter the country duty free in the face of a shortage of domestic supplies. Earlier this year, USDA worked with Korea\u2019s agriculture ministry to reopen the market for U.S. eggs and egg products, but imports were again restricted after the HPAI detection in Tennessee. Year-to-date exports through June have totaled $12 million, up nearly $10 million compared with the same period last year.\u000a\u000a#\u000a\u000aUSDA is an equal opportunity lender, provider and employer.

aVWashington was jolted from its August recess this week after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly, President Donald Trump stoked racial tension by blaming \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence\u2014and then combative top aide Steve Bannon was pushed out on Friday.\u000a\u000aRumors swirled that other White House officials were on the verge of resigning, but there\u2019s a reason why those aides, in the White House and agencies, have yet to pull the cord: They\u2019re still achieving conservative reforms, despite the distractions coming from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. This week, big policy changes came from the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services. Here\u2019s how Trump changed policy in America this week:\u000a\u000a1. DHS ends parole program for Central American children\u000a\u000aIn November 2014, Vice President Joe Biden announced that the Obama administration was taking steps to stem that summer\u2019s border crisis, in which tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors flooded into the United States from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The State Department set up a program to allow the children of parents who are lawfully present in the U.S. to seek refugee or parole status while still in their home countries\u2014without actually making the dangerous journey to the United States. The goal was to reduce the flow of unaccompanied children without leaving them in danger.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security immediately ended the parole component of that program; DHS canceled the approvals of 2,700 kids who had been conditionally approved for parole but had not received final signoff. The program was small\u2014about 1,400 kids had been paroled and entered the United States\u2014but had still angered immigration hawks who said it was too generous to the children.\u000a\u000aThe announcement follows Trump\u2019s executive order in February in which he directed the three main immigration agencies to use parole \u201csparingly.\u201d It will please immigration hawks who have long criticized the way officials use parole, but it also carries some risk: The number of unaccompanied minors dropped by almost half in fiscal 2015, and ticked up again last year. The exact reasons for the drop are unknown, but the parole program may have been part of the reason. (The children are still eligible to apply for refugee status without crossing into the U.S., but that bar is higher.) Trump\u2019s repeal of the program could persuade them to head north without U.S. approval, illegally crossing the border.\u000a\u000a2. The end of an Obama health care payment experiment\u000a\u000aWhile most of the attention on Obamacare has focused on the individual insurance market and the Medicaid expansion, the law also tests numerous ideas to lower the spiraling cost of health care. One approach is known as \u201cbundled payments,\u201d which institutes a fixed price for certain medical procedures, like hip surgery or knee replacement. If the hospital could perform the procedure for a lower cost, it kept the difference. If not, it lost money.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration had begun testing the concept of bundled payments through a few different programs\u2014with mandatory participation by hospitals that take Medicare money. The mandated participation always irked Tom Price, the former congressman and current secretary of Health and Human Services, and this week, he significantly scaled back those programs. Hospitals will no longer be required to participate in a bundled payment program for certain joint replacements in many markets. Two yet-to-launch bundled care programs\u2014an expansion of the existing joint replacements program and a new program for heart attacks and cardiac surgeries\u2014were canceled altogether.\u000a\u000aThe rollback isn\u2019t a repudiation of \u201cvalue-based-care,\u201d the movement to pay doctors for quality over quantity, which has bipartisan support. But it does scale back one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act, which was keeping costs under control, and signals that Price, a former physician, will be less aggressive in forcing the new payment system on hospitals, a victory for doctors who are critical of the new payment plans and a defeat for health officials seeking a rapid transition.\u000a\u000a3. EPA\u2019s regulatory rollback continues\u000a\u000aNo agency has been more aggressive than the Environmental Protection Agency in undoing Obama-era regulations and the August recess has not slowed down the agency. This week, EPA said it would reconsider two more rules, one on the toxic discharges from coal plants and another on emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, in a court filing, Pruitt said EPA would conduct a rule-making to \u201cpotentially revise\u201d a 2015 rule from the Obama administration that set limits on the dumping of toxic metals, like mercury, from coal-fired power plants. The news wasn\u2019t a surprise, since Pruitt issued a rule earlier this spring delaying the compliance dates of the Obama-era rule. Then, on Thursday, EPA announced that it would review certain parts of the agency\u2019s 2016 rule that set emissions standards on heavy trucks for model years 2021-27. It was seen as one of Obama\u2019s last big pushes for cleaner air, as the Obama-era EPA attempted to lock down as many climate rules as possible, before a climate-skeptic administration took over.\u000a\u000a4. The end of \u201cOperation Choke Point\u201d\u000a\u000aIn 2013, the Department of Justice announced a new initiative to cut off certain predatory lenders and online merchants from the banking system by cracking down on banks and payment processors. The idea was to pressure banks, as potential facilitators of potential financial crimes, to cease doing business with those companies. The program, officially called Operation Choke Point, was heavily criticized by Republicans who said DOJ was targeting legal businesses that the Obama administration just happened to dislike, like payday lenders and gun retailers, without any evidence of wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aThis week, in a letter to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ said it would end Operation Choke Point, which it called a \u201cmisguided initiative.\u201d The move is a victory for Republicans and industries like payday lenders who felt targeted by the program.\u000a\u000a5. A flurry of small trade deals\u000a\u000aIn the trade world, all eyes were on Washington where American, Canadian and Mexican officials converged for the first session on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the Trump administration also made a series of small trade announcements this week to coincide with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s trip through four South American countries.\u000a\u000aIn Colombia, Pence announced that the Colombian government would lift restrictions on a certain type of U.S. rice exports, while the U.S. will now allow the import of Colombian avocados. In Argentina, Pence inked a deal to allow the export of U.S. pork products for the first time since 1992, opening up a potential $10 million per year pork market to U.S. producers. Finally, the Department of Agriculture announced that South Korea was lifting its ban on U.S. poultry and egg products, which was imposed in March after a series of bird flu cases in the United States.\u000a\u000aAll these deals are dwarfed by top issues under discussion as part of the NAFTA renegotiation. But they continue to show that career officials can make progress on sticky trade issues, willing to compromise with foreign nations despite Trump\u2019s at-times bellicose trade rhetoric.

But she added that only focusing on internal affairs is not good for the U.S.\u000a\u000a\u201cAmerica cannot be great if it does not concern itself with things outside its borders,\u201d Merkel said during an interview with business newspaper Handelsblatt on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aStill, Merkel also pointed out that Trump won the election democratically. \u201cHe won a tough campaign. No matter my opinion of him, he deserves respect,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aMerkel has admitted in the past that the two leaders don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye on matters such as trade and climate change.\u000a\u000aWhen Trump announced, for example, that he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate deal, Merkel called the decision \u201cextremely regrettable\u201d but also stressed it would not stop the rest of the world from tackling the issue.\u000a\u000aMerkel also on Wednesday reiterated her view that Europe cannot just rely on the U.S. to solve problems and should \u201cformulate its own interests,\u201d which may or may not overlap with those of their ally across the Atlantic.\u000a\u000aTrump has also been critical of Germany\u2019s level of defense spending. Germany\u2019s defense expenditure amounts to 1.2 percent of its gross domestic product, whereas the NATO target is 2 percent.\u000a\u000aBut Merkel insisted on Wednesday that the push for Germany to spend more on defense started long before Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Former President Barack] Obama told me frequently that it cannot be that we only spend 1.2 percent.\u201d

President Trump first raised the issue with President Macri during their bilateral meeting at the White House on April 27.\u000a\u000aSecretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were also fully engaged in completing the agreement.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a big win for American pork producers and proves that President Trump is getting real results for America\u2019s farmers and ranchers,\u201d said Vice President Pence. \u201cAfter 25 years of discussions, America\u2019s pork producers will soon be able to export their fine product to Argentina.

aVDonald Trump speaks at a 'Make America Great Again' rally in Phoenix | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images A wounded Trump lashes out at Phoenix rally A week after the Charlotesville controversy, the president attacks the media, Obama and GOP senators.\u000a\u000aU.S. President Donald Trump took to the stage in Phoenix wounded.\u000a\u000aA week after he was widely condemned for blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that took the life of a counterprotester, the president went beyond a scripted plea for unity and love on Tuesday night by quickly devolving into a series of animated attacks on the media, former President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. John McCain.\u000a\u000aBack in his natural element, revving up a stadium of supporters, Trump dispensed with any veneer of contrition and vigorously defended his response to Charlottesville just one day after a scripted, sober address about an increased American military presence in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aTrump seemed to be reveling in the crowd\u2019s love from the moment he entered, clapping his hands as he made his way slowly to the podium, and before long he was enticing the crowd to rain boos on reporters.\u000a\u000a\u201cWow, what a crowd, what a crowd,\u201d were Trump\u2019s first words when he stepped to the microphone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere aren\u2019t too many people outside protesting, that I can tell you,\u201d Trump quickly added, before going on to marvel at the size of the crowd, and noting that some people were still in line waiting to get in.\u000a\u000aTrump then issued \u2014 quickly \u2014 his scripted call for unity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future,\u201d he said. \u201cA wound inflicted on one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all. When one part of America hurts, we all hurt. And one American suffers and injustice, all of America suffers together. We\u2019re all together.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the president quickly became animated, moved off script and began a broadside against the \u201cvery dishonest media,\u201d as the crowd booed loudly. Apparently lifted by the energy of the crowd, Trump appeared to disregard his prepared remarks for large portions of the address.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have a home in Charlottesville,\u201d Trump quipped, before attacking the press and re-reading his initial statements from after Charlottesville, claiming repeatedly that he was misrepresented by the press. He did not repeat his call for blame on \u201cmany sides.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump derided The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN \u2014 the crowd chanted \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d \u2014 and \u201clittle George Stephanopoulos\u201d of ABC. The crowd roared along with each attack, as Trump was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, one of whom he berated for not having a \u201cpowerful voice.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is the fault of the media, Trump declared, for \u201cfomenting divisions\u201d in the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey are trying to take away our history and our heritage, you see that,\u201d Trump said, an apparent reference to removing monuments to Confederate generals.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are really, really dishonest people and they\u2019re bad people and I really think they don\u2019t like our country,\u201d Trump said of the press. \u201cThe only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are sick people,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know the thing I don\u2019t understand? You would think they\u2019d want to make our country great again and I honestly believe they don\u2019t.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump repeatedly said, falsely, that television channels were switching away from his address.\u000a\u000aTrump did praise Fox News, and specifically conservative host Sean Hannity and the morning show \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d which he said treated him fairly.\u000a\u000aAfter the extended diatribe against the press, the president switched gears.\u000a\u000aHe asked the crowd how it felt about Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigration crusader who lost re-election in November and was recently convicted of criminal contempt for disobeying a court order about mistreating Latinos. Trump previously announced that he was considering a pardon for Arpaio, but the White House announced earlier Tuesday it would not take place at the Phoenix rally.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be just fine, okay?\u201d Trump said of Arpaio. \u201cI won\u2019t do it tonight because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe visit came a day after Trump announced deepening U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, and as he seeks a reset from the disastrous week that followed his \u201cmany sides\u201d remarks.\u000a\u000aWhile Monday night\u2019s address offered a clear opportunity to appear presidential, Tuesday night\u2019s rally gave Trump the chance to veer off script, and he embraced the opportunity.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019d spent much of the day in transit, traveling first to Yuma, Arizona, where he visited a Marine air station and met with border patrol officers. He made the trip to Phoenix despite a plea from the city\u2019s Democratic to postpone it out of concerns over violence stemming from the Charlottesville fallout.\u000a\u000aLarge protests were planned near the Phoenix Convention Center, where Trump appeared.\u000a\u000aArizona is not exactly friendly territory for Trump to begin with. He carried the state in November by less than four points, a slim margin in a state that hasn\u2019t gone Democratic in a presidential race since 1996. Neither of the state\u2019s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, supported him on election day. Flake never endorsed Trump, and McCain withdrew his support after a tape surfaced in October in which Trump bragged about groping women.\u000a\u000aThe two senators have not warmed to Trump since he took office. McCain cast the deciding vote to sink the GOP\u2019s latest Obamacare repeal push, even after a personal plea from Trump. And Flake has repeatedly criticized Trump, most recently in his new book \u201cConscience of a Conservative.\u201d He slammed his fellow Republicans for their \u201cunnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump hit back recently, praising one of Flake\u2019s primary challengers in a tweet and calling Flake \u201cWEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s toxic!\u201d Trump added.\u000a\u000aThe state\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, did not attend the Phoenix rally.

aVSecretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke declined to say whether portions of the monuments would be opened up to oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other industries for which President Trump has advocated. | George Frey/Getty Images Zinke won't eliminate any national monuments\u000a\u000aBILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he's recommending that none of 27 national monuments carved from wilderness and ocean and under review by the Trump administration be eliminated.\u000a\u000aBut there would be changes to a "handful," he said.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aZinke told The Associated Press that unspecified boundary adjustments for some monuments carved out of wilderness and ocean over the past four decades will be included in the recommendations he planned to give President Donald Trump on Thursday. None of the sites would revert to new ownership, he said, while public access for uses such as hunting, fishing or grazing would be maintained or restored.\u000a\u000aHe also spoke of protecting tribal interests and historical land grants, pointing to monuments in New Mexico, where Hispanic ranchers have opposed two monuments proclaimed by President Barack Obama.\u000a\u000aZinke declined to say whether portions of the monuments would be opened up to oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other industries for which Trump has advocated.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

"You can protect the monument by keeping public access to traditional uses."\u000a\u000aThe recommendations cap an unprecedented four-month review based on a belief that the century-old Antiquities Act had been misused by past presidents to create oversized monuments that hinder energy development, grazing and other uses.\u000a\u000aThe review raised alarm among conservationists who said protections could be lost for areas that are home to ancient cliff dwellings, towering sequoia trees, deep canyons and ocean habitats. They've vowed to file lawsuits if Trump attempts any changes that would reduce the size of monuments or rescind their designations.\u000a\u000aZinke had previously announced that no changes would be made at six national monuments \u2014 in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, California, Arizona and Washington. He's also said that Bears Ears monument in Utah should be downsized.\u000a\u000aThe former Montana congressman declined to reveal specifics on individual sites in an interview with the AP. He offered no further details on his recommendations for the two New Mexico monuments \u2014 Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument and the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument.\u000a\u000aHe also struck back against conservationists who had warned of impending mass selloffs of public lands by the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a"I've heard this narrative that somehow the land is going to be sold or transferred," Zinke said. "That narrative is patently false and shameful. The land was public before and it will be public after."\u000a\u000aNational monument designations add protections for lands revered for their natural beauty and historical significance with the goal of preserving them for future generations. The restrictions aren't as stringent as national parks, but some policies include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles.\u000a\u000aThe monuments under review were designated by four presidents over the last two decades. Several are about the size of the state of Delaware, including Mojave Trails in California, Grand-Staircase Escalante in Utah and Bears Ears, which is on sacred tribal land.\u000a\u000aMany national monuments were later declared national parks. Among them were Zion National Park in Utah and Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona.\u000a\u000aNo other president has tried to eliminate a monument, but some have trimmed and redrawn boundaries 18 times, according to the National Park Service.\u000a\u000aMany times, presidents reduced monuments only slightly, like when Franklin Roosevelt removed about 52 acres from Arizona's Wupatki National Monument in 1941 to make way for a dam. But occasionally the changes were drastic, like President Woodrow Wilson's move in 1915 to cut Mount Olympus National Monument roughly in half to open more land for logging.\u000a\u000aEnvironmental groups said the 1906 Antiquities Act is intended to shield significant historical and archaeological sites, and that it allows presidents to create the monuments, but only gives Congress the power to modify them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVWhite House chief of staff John Kelly walks from Air Force One as he arrives with US President Donald Trump in Reno, Nevada | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Kelly moves to control the information Trump sees A new process, laid out in two memos circulating in the West Wing this week, is supposed to ensure Kelly vets everything that hits the Resolute Desk.\u000a\u000aConfronted with a West Wing that treated policymaking as a free-for-all, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff John Kelly is instituting a system used by previous administrations to limit internal competition \u2014and to make himself the last word on the material that crosses the president\u2019s desk.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a quiet effort to make Trump conform to White House decision-making norms he\u2019s flouted without making him feel out of the loop. In a conference call last week, Kelly initiated a new policymaking process in which just he and one other aide \u2014 White House staff secretary Rob Porter, a little-known but highly regarded Rhodes Scholar who overlapped with Jared Kushner as an undergraduate at Harvard \u2014 will review all documents that cross the Resolute Desk.\u000a\u000aThe new system, laid out in two memos co-authored by Kelly and Porter and distributed to Cabinet members and White House staffers in recent days, is designed to ensure that the president won\u2019t see any external policy documents, internal policy memos, agency reports, and even news articles that haven\u2019t been vetted. Kelly\u2019s deputy, Kristjen Nielson, is also expected to assume an integral role.\u000a\u000aThe keystone of the new system is a \u201cdecision memo\u201d that will \u2014 for each Trump policy \u2014 integrate the input of cabinet agencies and policy councils and present the president with various options, as well as with the advantages and drawbacks of each one.\u000a\u000aSome hope that this new policymaking process will deliver legislative victories that have so far been elusive.\u000a\u000aThe Kelly-Porter reforms are in many ways a reversion to habits of previous administrations, particularly in their attempt to ensure competing views are completely and straightforwardly presented to the president \u2014 and allow Kelly to impose some discipline on the president without making him feel shackled.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a White House policy process, tried and true, that is not endemic to Republicans or Democrats, and it includes having the various policy councils bringing in the information and perspectives from agencies and elsewhere and then having the staff secretary\u2019s office share the policy council\u2019s memo around the office to get it vetted,\u201d said Tevi Troy, who served as deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy under George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aPorter, a Harvard Law graduate, has assumed a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in the administration, working even before Kelly\u2019s arrival to create form from chaos and to serve as an honest broker between the competing factions that populate the Trump White House. He\u2019s no stranger to the GOP\u2019s vast ideological spectrum, having served as chief of staff to Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and before that as counsel to Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an Ivy League blueblood and George H.W. Bush partisan, as well as to Tea Party Junior Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah).\u000a\u000aIn the Obama administration, the staff secretary\u2019s office prepared briefing books for the president that he took home each evening, making sure to incorporate competing viewpoints. \u201cWe really worked hard to limit the extent to which he would see anything outside of that channel,\u201d said Doug Kramer, who served as staff secretary for President Barack Obama. \u201cPeople are constantly trying to circumvent the process because they want to get to the president, particularly during emergencies,\u201d Kramer added.\u000a\u000aSome Oval Office veterans say the staff secretary has in recent years taken on an outsized role typically reserved for the White House chief of staff, from mediating policy disputes between senior advisers to resolving turf wars between the White House policy councils. In policy meetings on trade, Porter has been left to resolve disputes between National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, who favors free trade, and protectionist Peter Navarro, the head of the White House\u2019s National Trade Council.\u000a\u000aWhite House aides note that the new system is likely to slow the policymaking process. Executive orders, dashed out in a matter of days at the outset of the administration, are now likely to go through weeks of review as they are circulated to policy advisers, lawyers, and the president\u2019s legislative affairs team.\u000a\u000aBut some hope that this new policymaking process will deliver legislative victories that have so far been elusive\u2014particularly now that senior strategist Steve Bannon, who was known for skipping formal meetings to take his proposals directly to Trump, is out of the White House. One official called Bannon a \u201cdisruptive force\u201d who did not want to follow any set path for making White House decisions.\u000a\u000a\u201cGeneral Kelly is instilling processes to ensure that the President has the information and analysis he needs to make decisions,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cThe White House staff will continue to support the President by ensuring that the policy options presented to him reflect all relevant viewpoints, including any dissenting views.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus worked to systematize the policymaking process, White House aides say Priebus spent much of his time doing damage control and never instituted a holistic approach or managed to corral the flow of people and paper through the Oval Office, which until recently served as the social hub of the White House.\u000a\u000aThe president made policy pronouncements without consulting with all the stakeholders in his own administration; absent a formal policy process, their input often didn\u2019t make it to the president\u2019s desk. \u201cIn the past, a few senior administration officials unilaterally made policy calls that everyone had to live with,\u201d said one senior administration official. \u201cIt seems like those days are over.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe drawn-out saga to repeal and replace Obamacare revealed the weaknesses of the old system. In the early days of the administration and even the Trump transition, a number of domestic policy aides developed proposals for the potential repeal and replacement of Obamacare that included giving grants to states and the use of health savings accounts. Those ideas got tossed out once Tom Price was confirmed as secretary of health and human services and indicated during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room that the White House would instead back the House plan, supported by Speaker Paul Ryan and Priebus.\u000a\u000aPriebus was so insistent on this option, according to two White House officials, and called a meeting at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in February where the House\u2019s plan was presented as the lone option to senior advisers.\u000a\u000aSince taking over for Priebus last month, Kelly has sought to crack down not just on the White House\u2019s sneakiness and backbiting that affected policymaking but also to impose order more broadly. He has tasked deputy chiefs of staff Rick Dearborn and Joe Hagin with bringing some order to the president\u2019s schedule, pushing them to planning events further in advance and to including one public-facing event each day and one travel event each week, according to a senior White House aide.\u000a\u000aHe is also reworking what were once free-flowing White House meetings. Each one now includes a list of attendees to prevent aides from inserting themselves gratuitously where Kelly does not want them. Said a top White House aide: \u201cIf you\u2019re not on the list, you can\u2019t get into the meeting.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether a president known for freelancing can live with military discipline is another matter. \u201cIf there was not this structure beforehand and if the structure has now been created and if they adhere to it, you will get better results, but there are some \u2018ifs\u2019 in my statement,\u201d Troy said. \u201dThe process works if people stick to it.\u201d

If they don\u2019t, then the talks cannot progress to dealing with a future trade agreement between the U.K. and the EU.\u000a\u000aBut at a briefing for journalists on Monday, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said the U.K. government was \u201cworking at pace\u201d and would be able to \u201cget to that point.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe comments came after Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar, one of the leaders who will make the \u201csufficient progress\u201d decision, said he thought the process would \u201cdefinitely take more time than we expected at the start of the negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an interview with the Guardian, he said there were \u201cso many difficult topics on the table,\u201d he did not expect all the issues to be solved according to the schedule.\u000a\u000aBut the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cWe are confident that we will have made sufficient progress by October to be able to advance talks to the next phase \u2026 that is our aim and we are confident that we are working at pace and we will be able to get to that point.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K. government is publishing another five position papers on aspects of the talks this week, including on how a future trade deal will be enforced and disputes resolved after May set departure from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as a negotiation red line.\u000a\u000aMay\u2019s spokesperson said the prime minister believed both sides needed to demonstrate a \u201cdynamic and flexible approach to each round of the negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think we are working at pace and David Davis set out at the weekend [in a comment piece in the Sunday Times] that we want to be able to move on to the next stage by European Council in October and that is our aim.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe said the U.K. Brexit team would be talking to their counterparts about it at the next week\u2019s Brexit negotiations round.\u000a\u000a\u201cDExEU [Department for Exiting the European Union] officials and officials in Brussels talk all the time in between negotiation rounds.

Visa holders who are family members of refugees or people who receive asylum will also be required to undergo an in-person interview when they apply for provisional status, a stage that precedes receiving a green card, according to USCIS.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn fiscal year 2015, nearly 168,000 immigrants in these categories obtained lawful permanent residency, according to annual statistics from the Department of Homeland Security.

aVIn Donald Trump\u2019s White House, it seems like almost everyone has an exit strategy. But leaving isn\u2019t always a simple affair, and offers\u2014or threats\u2014to leave don\u2019t always pan out.\u000a\u000aGary Cohn considered quitting after President Donald Trump\u2019s Charlottesville comments and wrote multiple resignation letters, a draft op-ed and answers to reporters\u2019 anticipated questions.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s top economic adviser talked to his family about quitting, and his wife urged him to do so. He went to Bedminster for a last-minute meeting with the president last Friday, according to people familiar with the session. But he didn\u2019t quit, instead choosing to criticize Trump in an interview with the Financial Times while sticking around to see what Trump will do \u2013 leaving Cohn in limbo and his White House colleagues and others mystified.\u000a\u000aA number of senior administration officials have offered to leave or privately told confidants they might, only to be told to stay \u2013 or decide to stay on their own. Some were pushed out, or claimed to have resigned after they were pushed out, while one \u2013 former press secretary Sean Spicer \u2013 publicly quit only to stick around in the building with no clear duties, and after facing months of rumors about his demise.\u000a\u000aJeff Sessions offered his resignation earlier this year, after Trump criticized him at length for the attorney general recusing himself in the Russia probe without notifying Trump in advance. He then was in perpetual limbo for several weeks while Trump publicly castigated him, waiting to be fired only not to be. The two men are still aloof, and Sessions has told others he doesn\u2019t understand the episode.\u000a\u000aSteve Bannon vociferously said he was staying in the White House for two weeks after he had supposedly resigned and attacked stories about his departure as \u201cbullshit.\u201d He later told others the decision was entirely his; while senior administration officials said he was ousted after being isolated.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Priebus, these people said, told people he was staying around even after he publicly said he resigned and flew to Long Island on Air Force One, a strange move if one had already resigned. He \u201creally wanted to make it a year,\u201d one person said.\u000a\u000aRegardless, he wandered around the halls of the Executive Office Building for days, taking occasional meetings, looking for other gigs and taking a vacation before his employment formally concludes at the end of August. Priebus declined to comment.\u000a\u000aNo one is exactly sure what Spicer is doing these days at the White House; he quit five weeks ago but is still there while negotiating his next gig and meeting with TV networks, while staying on the payroll.\u000a\u000aThe only clear departure seemed to be Scaramucci, who was ousted by new chief of staff John Kelly after accusing Bannon of performing sexual acrobatics on himself and accusing Priebus of being paranoid in profane terms.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put together a stable team when you have such an unstable work environment,\u201d said Ron Klain, who worked in the White House under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump, who ran the Trump Organization much the same way. \u201cIf he\u2019s unhappy with you, he can make your life miserable, and you know he\u2019s unhappy,\u201d said Louise Sunshine, a longtime real estate executive who worked for him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really fire people.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne senior administration official said Trump seems to relish the personnel dramas. He\u2019ll ask aides what they think of each other. He will tell advisers that he is considering firing someone. He doesn\u2019t mind trial balloons. He likes to see how much public embarrassment someone can take.\u000a\u000aMany aides are \u201cdeeply, deeply miserable,\u201d this official said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to just walk out of the White House,\u201d this person added. \u201cYou think you\u2019re helping.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther advisers attribute the turnover to a president who hasn\u2019t worked with his staff for long and doesn\u2019t necessarily trust them, therefore he keeps them out of the loop and they don\u2019t understand him. \u201cNo previous president has hired this many people who had no connection to his campaign or his candidacy or his vision for the country,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. \u201cI don\u2019t understand many of the hiring decisions he has made.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn was was deeply upset after the press conference where Trump said \u201cmany sides\u201d were to blame for Charlottesville, according to a person who spoke to him, and began plotting a potential exit. He spoke to friends in the business community, who gave him mixed reactions. Privately, some business executives said they didn\u2019t understand how he could continue to work there \u2014 and were amazed at the response. But other friends say Cohn is needed to help in a dysfunctional building.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe business community is depending on Gary Cohn for his substance and his focus to carry forward the most important initiatives. It would be very disappointing if he were to leave in terms of our hopes for the big agenda items that need to get done,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, who leads the Partnership for New York City, an influential group of CEOs.\u000a\u000aAfter weighing the decision with his family, he went to Bedminster to talk with Trump. He told Trump he would publicly criticize him and then did it in the Financial Times interview that published Friday, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president, as I have said many times, and Gary have spoken many times. Gary has not held back on what his feelings are,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday. \u201cHe has not held back how he feels about the situation. He's been very open and honest so I don't think that anyone was surprised by the comments.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet the moves could isolate Cohn in Washington, where some have questioned his allegiance with Trump after being a longtime Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat. However, people familiar with the discussions say he has developed some good relationships with senior Capitol Hill Republicans working on tax reform and is seen by many as a steadying force in an unsteady administration.\u000a\u000aCohn, however, has become a flashpoint for many of Trump\u2019s nationalist supporters, particularly those affiliated with former chief strategist Steve Bannon, whose Breitbart website often torches Cohn. Stone said he should be fired immediately.\u000a\u000aAmong many Democrats and business friends, there was little sympathy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that complicated at all,\u201d Klain said. \u201cBeing there indicates their assent to President Trump\u2019s agenda and statements. The idea that they\u2019re somehow doing us a favor by trying to prevent President Trump from making certain decisions is some combination of self-aggrandizement and self-delusion.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump hasn\u2019t commented on Cohn, who told others he chose his words carefully, doesn\u2019t regret the interview \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to quit, but would not be devastated if the president forced him out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the broader tactical drama of doing interviews with the media saying you contemplated quitting and that you were ready to go and unhappy with the president but are staying,\u201d said Trump biographer Timothy O\u2019Brien.\u000a\u000a\u201cHas the president ever accepted public criticism well?\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange form of brinkmanship that I don\u2019t think will go over well.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVU.S. President Donald Trump | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images White House dodges on whether Trump has eased off demand that Mexico pay for wall Press secretary became frustrated as reporters pressed about border security issue.\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Thursday refused to answer whether President Donald Trump has backed off his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall, and appeared to get frustrated as reporters repeatedly pressed the issue.\u000a\u000aTrump aggressively campaigned on the idea that Mexico would foot the bill, but has shifted to demanding that Congress get the funds for the wall \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and this week threatened a government shutdown if lawmakers don\u2019t come through.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s committed to making sure this gets done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe know that the wall and other security measures at the border work. We\u2019ve seen that take place over the last decade and we\u2019re committed to making sure the American people are protected and we\u2019re going to continue to push forward and make sure that the wall gets built.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen asked why he has backed away from saying Mexico will pay for the project, Sanders quipped, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said they\u2019re not either.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders instead called on Democrats for bipartisan support on the measure. \u201c[Trump] won on talking about building a wall. And he\u2019s going to make sure that that gets done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll continue to fight for that funding and ensure that it takes place.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s not forget that there were a lot of Democrat senators that also voted for border security and a border fence and hopefully some of those same individuals will talk to members in their current party and maybe we can get a bipartisan group to support that and make sure it happens, because this president\u2019s going to see it,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aIf Mexico denies funding for the wall, as they\u2019ve promised to do, Sanders wouldn\u2019t answer whether that would be a concession made to Mexico from the White House at the expense of American taxpayers.\u000a\u000a\u201cAgain, this is something the president committed to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s committed to protecting American Lives, and doing that through the border wall is something that\u2019s important, it\u2019s a priority, and we\u2019re moving forward with it.\u201d

aVDuring a town hall on CNN on Monday, House Speaker Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) argued that President Trump \u201cmessed up\u201d in his statement on Charlottesville last Tuesday, but praised Trump\u2019s comments last Monday and earlier that night.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aRyan stated that Trump\u2019s statement last Monday was \u201cpitch-perfect.\u201d He added that during his press conference on Tuesday, Trump \u201cmade comments that were much more morally ambiguous, much more confusing, and I do think he could have done better. I think he needed to do better. I actually think what he did two days ago in commending the peaceful protests against the hate in Boston was a good start. And I think, just what I heard\u202625 minutes ago, was exactly what a president needs to say, what we needed to hear. So, I do believe that he messed up in his comments on Tuesday, when it sounded like a moral equivocation, or at the very least moral ambiguity, when we need extreme moral clarity.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan added that the discussion about Charlottesville shouldn\u2019t be about the president or politics, but rather goes to American and human values, and urged everyone to stand up against bigotry.\u000a\u000aHe further stated that he had \u201ca hard time believing\u201d that any good people would have stuck around a rally full of anti-Semitism and neo-Nazis.\u000a\u000aWhen asked if he thought President Trump had done enough to denounce bigotry, Ryan answered that none of us have done enough and that all of us have to do more to ensure bigots aren\u2019t normalized.\u000a\u000aRyan also denounced the censure resolution against President Trump, stating that it \u201cwould be so counterproductive. If we descend this issue into some partisan hackfest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country? We want to unify this country against this kind of hatred and this kind of bigotry. So, I think that would be the absolutely worst thing we should do.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan concluded that there needs to be more civil dialogue and listening about how to unify against bigotry and by declaring that people should be \u201ccalling out bigotry when we see it and we hear it and never getting right with it and always standing up and opposing it peacefully.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

aVIs Melania Trump the modern-day Marie Antoinette?\u000a\u000a/ The Spectrum The Spectrum\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMelania Trump is featured on the cover of February\u2019s Vanity Fair Mexico in diamonds \u2013 a must see.\u000a\u000aThe First Lady is wearing diamond rings and bracelets and posed as if she is \u201ceating\u201d a bowl of stringed jewels like spaghetti. Inside the issue, there is another photo of Melania drinking a jewel-laced cocktail through a straw.\u000a\u000aHer cover photo is being criticized as insensitive and out of touch, coming at a tense time between Mexico and the U.S.\u000a\u000aThis is a time when Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is refusing to pay for the border wall Trump intends to build. As nearly half the Mexican people live in poverty, Melania is seen literally playing with her jewelry.\u000a\u000aYet the cover photo is less known in the U.S. and nobody I have talked to about it has heard of or seen it themselves.\u000a\u000aLooking at these images, a certain phrase came to mind: \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d\u000a\u000aHistorians argue whether or not this is something that the infamous French Queen Marie Antoinette actually said but nevertheless, Antoinette is bound to it forever.\u000a\u000aAfter having this first revelation, I began to realize our First Lady and the former Queen of France have more in common than meets the eye.\u000a\u000aFor those of you who aren\u2019t as familiar with past French monarchs (or who haven\u2019t seen the film \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d with Kirsten Dunst), here is a quick history lesson.\u000a\u000aMarie Antoinette was born in Austria as Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna \u2013 not very French. She married the crown prince of France, Louis XVI at the age of fifteen.\u000a\u000aThe French people thought Marie Antoinette did not know her people at all and rumors spread the Antoinette was a foreign spy.\u000a\u000aAntoinette also became known as a spendthrift or, in simpler terms, the girl had a shopping problem.\u000a\u000aShe frequently wore the most high-end fashion, gambled all night in Versailles and lived in luxury as her people starved. The French blamed their economic depression in part on her spending habits.\u000a\u000aThe two also married powerful men from other countries.\u000a\u000aAntoinette was born in Austria and moved to France upon her engagement to the Dauphin whereas Melania is from Slovenia and married Donald Trump. She did not know it at the time but she married the future president of the United States.\u000a\u000aCurrently, the First Lady is residing in Trump Tower with her and Trump\u2019s son Barron. This is occurring at the same time as New York City foots the bill for her stay.\u000a\u000aMany people are outraged that our country can afford to support her lifestyle as the people in Flint, Michigan still have lead-poisoned water. This does not even include the cost to cart President Trump back and forth to Mar-a-Lago every weekend to work on his golf game.\u000a\u000aMelania Trump is miserable and this is not the life she wanted, according to a recent article published in the New York Post.\u000a\u000aShe feels trapped by Trump\u2019s decision and rarely leaves their $100 million penthouse in Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aOne positive attribute the two women seem to share, however, is a love for their children. The reason the First Lady is staying in Trump Tower alongside Barron is so he can finish the school year uninterrupted.\u000a\u000aOn the campaign trail, Melania\u2019s appearances were rare due to her primary devotion to raising her child. Marie Antoinette is described as also being very focused on her children and their education.\u000a\u000aBut was Marie Antoinette really the reason France went bankrupt followed by a subsequent revolution and fall of the French monarchy? Or was she a scapegoat, a woman to put the blame on during difficult times?\u000a\u000aSure, Melania Trump gracing the cover of a magazine appearing to eat a string of jewels as if they were spaghetti isn\u2019t the best thing to do given the current state of the world.\u000a\u000aIt does, nonetheless, beg the question if she is really the person we want to be aiming our anger and frustration at.\u000a\u000aWill she prove to be careless with the American people\u2019s money? And most importantly, could this presidency in any way lead to another American Revolution?\u000a\u000aMolly Dietz is an arts staff writer and can be reached at arts@ubspectrum.com\u000a\u000aRelated Stories\u000a\u000aComments

aVJohn McCain likes to joke that any senator not under investigation or detoxification sees himself as a candidate for president \u2014 in other words, not the type who would normally seek out professional mentorship.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, for many senators \u2014 past and present \u2014 that\u2019s exactly the word they use to describe their relationship with the 80-year-old McCain, who for years has been working to impart his vision of a more muscular foreign policy on a younger generation of his colleagues.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Arizona Republican, now undergoing radiation and chemotherapy after being diagnosed last month with brain cancer, remains the GOP\u2019s leading champion of the kind of interventionist foreign policy that supporters of President Donald Trump often dismiss as \u201cglobalism.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd McCain\u2019s mentees say his efforts to groom a younger cadre of defense hawks have ensured that his ideas will live on in the Senate for decades to come, even as Trump seeks to rebrand the Republican Party under his banner of America-first nationalism.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has long been McCain\u2019s chief acolyte. \u201cI will certainly carry on the tradition of leading from the front, not from behind.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther acolytes, according to a half-dozen people who spoke to POLITICO about their relationships with McCain, include Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee such as Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. There are also some Democrats who\u2019ve formed strong bonds with McCain, like Armed Services members Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, along with Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u201cI consider him a mentor,\u201d said King, who developed a friendship with McCain after the Armed Services chairman noticed King was one of the few senators who stuck around for the entirety of the committee\u2019s hearings. \u201cYou can\u2019t be in the same room with John McCain very long and not be influenced by his thinking.\u201d\u000a\u000aKing, Graham and others said McCain has a talent for drawing people into his worldview. One tool he uses is congressional delegation trips, when fellow lawmakers are a captive audience during long flights overseas.\u000a\u000aEvery year, he leads trips to defense conferences all over the world, from the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada to the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Senators jump at the chance to travel with McCain, several of them said, since, as the best-known U.S. lawmaker on the international stage, he has no trouble lining up meetings with prominent foreign leaders. (It\u2019s like \u201ca forced march with Paul McCartney,\u201d King recently quipped in an Instagram post.)\u000a\u000aMcCain likes to engage his fellow senators in in-flight debates.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of people get on a long airplane ride and they\u2019ll put the earphones in and listen to John Grisham or something,\u201d King said. McCain, on the other hand, \u201cwas constantly engaged, talking about issues. What are we going to do in the Middle East? What are we going to do with the Palestinians and the Israelis? What should be our role in Syria?\u201d\u000a\u000aGraham said these flights with McCain were \u201ckind of like a tutorial.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn will gather everybody up and say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe makes sure that you\u2019re involved.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany current and former senators have vivid memories of the origins of their relationships with McCain.\u000a\u000aSullivan said that when he joined the Armed Services panel as a first-year senator in 2015, McCain asked him to take the lead for the committee on Asia-Pacific and Arctic issues. \u201cHe came to me and said, \u2018Hey, Dan, there aren\u2019t a lot of senators focused on this part of the world,'\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cOf course, I took that up.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Tim Kaine is one of a handful of Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee who've formed strong bonds with McCain. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo.\u000a\u000aFormer Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte said that when she was running for Senate in 2010, McCain agreed to attend a town hall with her in New Hampshire. McCain had a legendary status as a campaigner in New Hampshire because of the hundreds of town halls he held there during his runs for president in 2000 and 2008, when he took questions from all comers and occasionally invited some of the more colorful personalities up on stage to debate him.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere I was, a candidate for U.S. Senate, with someone who had done so many town halls across my state,\u201d Ayotte said. After the event, she explained with a laugh, McCain told her she needed to give shorter answers.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s always given me the advice to answer the question and be plain about it and be straight about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I got elected to the Senate he really, really was a mentor to me.\u201d\u000a\u000aAyotte also forged a close relationship with Graham, often issuing joint statements on defense issues with him and McCain. This led to her being branded as the successor to former Sen. Joe Lieberman in a group of defense hawks dubbed the \u201cthree amigos.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount from [McCain] in working with him on the Armed Services Committee,\u201d added Ayotte, who lost reelection last year and is now back in New Hampshire serving on several corporate and nonprofit boards. \u201cTo me, that is really such an important part of his legacy, his mentorship of leaders in the United States and around the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain\u2019s hawkish views were once dominant in the Republican Party but have lost some of their hold with the rise of Trump. Campaigning last year under the mantra of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Trump blasted U.S. leaders in both parties for wasting so much blood and treasure in Iraq. He questioned U.S. alliances such as NATO and said he wanted to repair relations with Russia.\u000a\u000aTrump also took aim at McCain himself, saying he was "not a war hero" despite the 5½ years McCain spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. "I like people who weren't captured," Trump said.\u000a\u000aBut even as McCain\u2019s wing of the party has seen its power wane, it has remained dominant in the Senate. McCain and his acolytes have taken a number of steps seen as a rebuke of Trump\u2019s worldview. The Senate voted unanimously for a resolution by Graham reaffirming the U.S. commitment to NATO. It voted 98-2 to strengthen sanctions on Russia.\u000a\u000aAnd over the past few months, McCain and other defense hawks put pressure on the administration to maintain or boost the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, even as Trump was considering a full withdrawal. The president came around to their position, announcing an increase in the U.S. footprint there earlier this week.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of senators in my class who believe\u201d in a strong foreign policy role for the United States, Sullivan said. \u201cHaving [McCain] reinforce that certainly makes a difference.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcCain has always had an outsized role in influencing his fellow senators, even before he got to the Senate \u2014 because of his status as a nationally known war hero and the son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals.\u000a\u000aBefore launching his political career, McCain did a stint as a Navy liaison officer to the Senate, a job that required him to organize and travel on congressional delegation trips. On one such trip to China in 1978, McCain struck up a conversation with a just-elected Republican senator from Maine, William Cohen, who told McCain he planned to join the Government Affairs and Judiciary committees.\u000a\u000a\u201cJohn said, \u2018No, no,\u2019\u201d Cohen recalled in an interview. \u201c\u2018You have got to go on the Armed Services Committee.\u2019 I said, \u2018But I\u2019m already committed to the others.\u2019 He said, \u2018You owe it to your country.\u2019 \u2026 His joy of life was infectious, and his commitment to the country was so persistent, so palpable, that I said, \u2018OK.\u2019 I finally yielded.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohen would go on to be a key member of the Armed Services panel and serve as secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe mentoring is by example,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cJohn is genetically predisposed to kinetic behavior. He's never not in motion. He's always moving.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe stakes are high for President Donald Trump and other elected leaders, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images. Hurricane Harvey packs political perils for Trump Political leaders often get penalized for their response to natural disasters.\u000a\u000aHurricane Harvey gained steam Friday as it neared the Texas coast, bringing with it destructive winds of up to 130 mph, a deadly storm surge, epic flooding \u2014 and perhaps the first real test of Donald Trump as a crisis president.\u000a\u000aThe stakes are high for Trump and other elected leaders, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. It\u2019s been nearly 12 years since a major hurricane \u2014 one with maximum sustained winds stronger than 110 mph \u2014 made landfall in the United States, much less a Category 4 Hurricane, something Harvey morphed into Friday evening. It\u2019s been nine years since Texas has seen a direct hit from a hurricane. And the storm could have a national impact, too: Much of Texas\u2019 oil and gas production is likely to be disrupted, at least in the short term and perhaps longer.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe president issued a major disaster declaration Friday night as the storm was about to make landfall, granting Texas federal money and the "full force" of government assistance.\u000a\u000aRecognizing the high stakes, the White House earlier in the day Friday pushed the message that Trump was sharply focused on the threat Harvey posed, and that he planned to visit Texas early next week. But, according to the latest forecasts, the storm may not clear the area until the middle or later next week.\u000a\u000a"This is right up President Trump's alley," Tom Bossert, Trump's homeland security adviser, said at the White House briefing. "When we go in and brief him on preparations, he is focused on making sure that the American people in the storm's path have what they need. His questions weren't about issues or about large political consequences."\u000a\u000aWhite House officials emphasized that while Trump would be at Camp David this weekend, he would be in full communication with the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Also, Vice President Mike Pence will stay back in Washington, to help with response to the storm.\u000a\u000aHurricanes making landfall have a way of dominating the news cycle. Even a president whose tweets typically send the media scrambling can be blown off cable news by live footage of reporters struggling to remain standing in tropical-storm-force wind gusts. And after the storm passes, all attention turns to rescue and recovery efforts.\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

At dawn on Thursday, Harvey was barely a tropical storm, with winds of 45 mph.\u000a\u000aBy Friday evening the National Weather Service declared it a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained wind speeds of 130 mph. Forecasts suggest the storm will maintain that intensity or strengthen even more before it makes landfall along the middle Texas coast \u2014 just north of Corpus Christi \u2014 late Friday night or early Saturday morning.\u000a\u000a"Storm turned Hurricane is getting much bigger and more powerful than projected," Trump posted on Twitter on Friday evening, prior to the storm being upgraded by the National Weather Service from its projected strength as a Category 3 Hurricane to a Category 4.\u000a\u000aHe added: "Federal Government is on site and ready to respond. Be safe!"\u000a\u000aThe biggest threats: The storm surge that accompanies a tropical system along the coast, with its damaging winds and flooding rains. The National Hurricane Center is predicting \u201ccatastrophic and life-threatening flooding for large swaths of Texas and Louisiana\u201d \u2014 even in areas that won\u2019t see the strong winds near the storm\u2019s center, like Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city. And those flooding rains could linger for four or five days, as Harvey stalls out near the coast.\u000a\u000aNatural disasters can be opportunities for elected officials to shine, delivering resources and compassion to affected populations. Barack Obama may have clinched a second term when the remnants of Hurricane Sandy came ashore the week before Election Day in 2012, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who embraced Obama \u2014figuratively and literally \u2014 rode a wave of post-Sandy goodwill to an easy reelection campaign the year after.\u000a\u000aTrump understood this five years ago. \u201cHurricane is good luck for Obama again,\u201d Trump tweeted on Oct. 30, 2012 \u2014 the day after the remnants of Sandy made landfall in New Jersey. \u201c[H]e will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.\u201d\u000a\u000aHurricanes are more typically perilous events, however. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged President George W. Bush\u2019s political standing, which was already slipping as a result of the Iraq War. But many Louisianans also blamed the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Kathleen Blanco, for the slow response to Katrina. After Katrina, Blanco was so unpopular in Louisiana that she didn\u2019t even try to seek a second term as governor.\u000a\u000aFor now, elected officials from Trump down to the state and local levels want voters to know that they are working hard on the storm. On Thursday afternoon, Trump encouraged those in the storm\u2019s path to plan ahead, posting a video on Twitter of his visit to FEMA headquarters earlier this month.\u000a\u000aLate Friday morning, he tweeted that he was staying on top of the latest developments. \u201cI have spoken w/ @GovAbbott of Texas and @LouisianaGov Edwards. Closely monitoring #HurricaneHarvey developments & here to assist as needed,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aAbbott, a first-term governor with national aspirations, posted a photo of him talking with Trump on the phone Thursday, writing that the \u201cheads of Homeland Security [and] FEMA\u201d were also on the call. (Trump retweeted Abbott\u2019s post.)\u000a\u000aIn a proactive move, Abbott on Friday asked Trump for a presidential disaster declaration, and Bossert said the president would move quickly in response to the request.\u000a\u000aThe head of Homeland Security is Elaine Duke, who is serving as acting secretary following John Kelly\u2019s resignation late last month to become White House chief of staff. At Thursday\u2019s White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked whether not having a permanent secretary hurts the administration\u2019s ability to respond to Harvey.\u000a\u000aSanders countered, arguing Kelly\u2019s six months on the job at DHS, in addition to his military experience, is an asset to Trump in the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that we are in great shape having Gen. Kelly sitting next to the president throughout this process,\u201d said Sanders, who added that there was \u201cprobably no better chief of staff for the president during the hurricane season.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the permanent post at DHS is vacant after Kelly\u2019s departure, Trump does have a full-time FEMA director in place: Brock Long worked at FEMA during the Bush administration, holding the positions of regional hurricane program manager and hurricane and evacuation liaison team leader, according to his official biography.\u000a\u000aBut for the people most affected by a storm, it is ultimately their state and local officials who come under the most scrutiny.\u000a\u000aAshley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, has studied how Sandy affected New Jerseyans\u2019 opinions of Christie. \u201cWith a lot of these instances with natural disasters, we actually see that elected officials can get penalized, rather than get a bump,\u201d Koning said, noting that Christie bucked that trend, earning a \u201clong, sustained boost.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt might be a challenge for the soft-spoken Abbott to replicate what made Christie successful, however.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it was the combination of that tough-guy attitude with his leadership \u2014 and how he just kind of made the state feel safe,\u201d Koning said of Christie\u2019s response to Sandy. \u201cHis scores in terms of leadership, effectiveness and trust just skyrocketed in the wake of Sandy.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther officials have gotten whacked after a storm raged through. Consider Blanco, the former Democratic governor in Louisiana. She carried high approval ratings into the 2005 hurricane season, when Katrina and Rita struck the state. But a year-and-a-half after Katrina, Blanco trailed then-Rep. Bobby Jindal \u2014 the man she had defeated in 2003 \u2014 in a public poll of the 2007 governor\u2019s race by 22 percentage points.\u000a\u000aWhen Blanco decided a few months later not to seek a second term, former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile, a Louisiana native, told The Washington Post, \u201cKatrina just washed away all the good that Gov. Blanco has done for the state of Louisiana."\u000a\u000aNationally, Katrina is remembered more for the public perception of the Bush administration\u2019s sluggish response to the storm. Bush was mocked for congratulating his FEMA director \u2014 \u201cBrownie, you\u2019re doing a heck of a job\u201d \u2014 before the full destruction of the storm had become apparent. Rapper Kanye West told the nation on a telethon broadcast across multiple networks that Bush \u201cdoes not care about black people.\u201d\u000a\u000aBush\u2019s approval ratings were already in decline in the summer of 2005, but Katrina may have accelerated that deterioration.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why Republicans are concerned about Trump. While he did tweet about the storm later on Friday, his morning began with the president picking fights with Senate Republicans \u2014 including airing private conversations with Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) about Corker\u2019s pending decision about whether to seek a third term next year.\u000a\u000aThat earned a rebuke from one of Corker\u2019s colleagues, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who replied directly on Twitter to one of Trump\u2019s posts Friday morning.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2026 [K]eep on top of hurricane Harvey,\u201d Grassley wrote in his distinctive shorthand. \u201cdont mke same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina.\u201d\u000a\u000aCristiano Lima contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBitcoin hit a record value of over $4,480 this month, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s steep rise is attracting copycats \u2014 one of which, SolarCoin, hopes to boost solar energy by giving people an incentive to go green.\u000a\u000aSolarCoins work like a reward program for solar power generators: People or businesses with solar panels can get a coin for each megawatt hour of electricity their solar panels generate. Users have to send scans of verified meter readings as proof of power generation, which are checked by volunteers.\u000a\u000aAn average individual producer in Belgium would get about five SolarCoins per year, said François Sonnet, an advisor to the SolarCoin project who is also co-founder of ElectriCChain, a solar energy generation data project that helps with the disbursement of the digital currency.\u000a\u000aUnlike bitcoins, SolarCoins aren\u2019t yet going to make anyone rich. The average value of a coin is about 18 cents, up from 6 cents at the beginning of this year. That gives the hypothetical individual Belgian solar power producer an annual windfall of about 90 cents.\u000a\u000aBut the ambitions are big.\u000a\u000aHalting early steps aren\u2019t preventing the project\u2019s founders from dreaming of vast riches.\u000a\u000aThe project started in 2014, and its founders set a maximum limit of 97.5 billion SolarCoins that can be claimed over the next 40 years, based on solar power generation estimates from the International Energy Agency, Sonnet said. They are stored in a reserve account owned by the Solarcoin Foundation and will be exchanged gradually as solar panel owners claim them.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe idea is to create a global network of solar installations so that people can start using this digital asset as a means to buy, trade and sell goods and services into this currency,\u201d said Sonnet.\u000a\u000aAbout 240,000 SolarCoins, worth a total of about \u20ac43,000, have gone to solar power producers in 39 countries, Sonnet said.\u000a\u000aUsers can load their coins in an online wallet application, shop online from stores that partner with the project, or trade them for dollars, euros or other currencies on Lykke Exchange, a Swiss-based exchange platform.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment there are not that many shops doing that,\u201d Sonnet said.\u000a\u000aA few business are accepting SolarCoins. ekWateur, a Paris-based independent renewable energy distributor with about 13,000 customers, began taking the digital currency in March. It has seen three transactions with SolarCoins so far from two different customers, one worth \u20ac4 and the other two worth about \u20ac100, said Julien Tchernia, president of ekWateur.\u000a\u000aTchernia said he plans to exchange the SolarCoins for euros in the fall.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we can\u2019t get the euros back, we will have to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, the risk is very low because we only have small transactions.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf demand for the coins goes up, businesses would have to be sure the currency is fully tradable, said Georg Zachmann, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank. \u201cIf there are not enough people that believe in SolarCoins, then nobody will take it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSo far uptake is small.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not very easy for people to trust an application and start exchanging value,\u201d said Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP from the Socialists & Democrats who is interested in the project and the blockchain technology underpinning digital currencies.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s also not simple to register for the coins. \u201cThe application process is too complex,\u201d Tchernia said. \u201cIt is hard for someone to get the system working.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese halting early steps aren\u2019t preventing the project\u2019s founders from dreaming of vast riches.\u000a\u000aIf things go right and people start to see the digital currency as a store of value, Sonnet said the value could go up as high as \u20ac20-\u20ac30 per coin once the number of solar power installations registered to the network grows.\u000a\u000aHowever, the currency is based on a very different model from bitcoin, which is limited to only 21 million coins, so scarcity has driven up its value. SolarCoins are based on solar power generation, and as the technology has become cheaper and more efficient, its use has skyrocketed. There was only 5.1 gigawatts of installed photovoltaics worldwide in 2005. A decade later that was up to 227 GW, according to the 2016 Renewables Global Status Report, and new facilities are coming online at an ever-increasing pace.\u000a\u000aBut early adopters are keeping the faith.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s the future. I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d said Johan De Beugher, a Belgian investing in SolarCoins. \u201cBecause it\u2019s free and because it\u2019s ecological.\u201d

aVBERLIN \u2014 Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan could end up influencing Germany\u2019s election \u2014 just not in the way he might have hoped.\u000a\u000aInadvertently, Erdogan\u2019s appeal to more than 1.2 million German Turks not to vote for either of Germany\u2019s major parties \u2014 or the Greens \u2014 could help strengthen Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he has clashed repeatedly in a series of disputes between the two countries.\u000a\u000aWhile the conservative chancellor has never had much support among ethnic Turks, her principal rival Martin Schulz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) have traditionally been the community\u2019s political home \u2014 so they will be hit harder if many German Turks heed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s call.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s true that Germans with a Turkish background have tended to vote for leftist parties, even though the distinction has not been quite as clear-cut in the last couple of years,\u201d Niels Annen, a German member of parliament and the spokesperson on foreign affairs for the SPD\u2019s Bundestag group, told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aNot every German of Turkish descent will blindly follow Erdo\u011fan\u2019s appeal, Annen said, adding that \u201cin Germany, votes aren\u2019t given out \u2018en bloc,\u2019 and it\u2019s not decided abroad who is voting for whom.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also said German politicians should think not about party politics when it comes to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s behavior, but about how Germany should respond to repeated attacks from Ankara.\u000a\u000aGrowing tension\u000a\u000aAmong Germany\u2019s 61.5 million eligible voters, the share of a little more than 1.2 million German Turks seems minute at first glance. But such relatively small groups can make a difference. Not only could German voters of Turkish heritage depress the SPD\u2019s share of the vote, they could also have a say in which coalition options are possible after the September 24 parliamentary election.\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s conservatives look set to lead the next government but their partners in office could be determined by fine margins, with more parties than ever expected to enter the German parliament this year.\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, and amid growing tension between Berlin and Ankara over the arrests of German human rights activists in Turkey, Erdo\u011fan launched an attack on Merkel\u2019s conservatives, Schulz\u2019s SPD and the Greens last Friday, calling them \u201cenemies of Turkey\u201d and urging his fellow Turks not to vote for them.\u000a\u000aHis intervention caused fury among German politicians, who were further angered a day later when writer Do\u011fan Akhanli, a Turkish-born German citizen who is an outspoken critic of the Turkish president, was arrested in Spain due to a Turkish extradition request to Interpol.\u000a\u000aMerkel shot back at a campaign event that evening, declaring that Germany \u201cwould not allow any kind of interference\u201d in the election and would \u201cnot let anyone, including President Erdo\u011fan, influence the right of our German citizens, whatever their origin, to vote freely.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD struck a similar note, saying Berlin would not tolerate any Turkish meddling in German politics.\u000a\u000aErdo\u011fan responded swiftly, telling Gabriel that he should learn to \u201cknow your limits\u201d while repeating his call to German Turks to \u201cteach [the parties] a lesson in the German election.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe SPD\u2019s Annen said, \u201cGermany must not rise to provocation, but at the same time, Germany also needs to repudiate those attacks with determination \u2014 and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Papa\u2019 Schmidt\u000a\u000aOver the decades, the SPD built support among Turks living in Germany \u2014 now more than 3.2 million people \u2014 with its image as an advocate for the working class appealing to many inside the community who never felt fully accepted by the core of German society.\u000a\u000a\u201cHelmut Schmidt is still considered the Papa of Turks in Germany,\u201d said Umut Karaka\u015f, the director of Berlin-based polling institute Data 4U, referring to the former SPD chancellor who pushed \u2014 albeit with limited success \u2014 for better integration of Turkish Gastarbeiter, \u201cguest workers,\u201d during his chancellorship from 1974 to 1982.\u000a\u000aDuring the last national election in 2013, almost two-thirds of all eligible German Turks voted for the Social Democrats, compared to the mere 25.7 percent the party scored overall in the election, according to research by Data 4U, which specializes in surveying German Turks and other ethnic minorities.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Merkel\u2019s conservatives \u2014 who ended up winning the election resoundingly with 41.5 percent of the vote \u2014 only got 7 percent of the German Turkish vote.\u000a\u000aPolitical estrangement\u000a\u000aBut some German Turkish voters became estranged from German political parties long before Erdo\u011fan\u2019s intervention due to a series of events, including the 2016 decision of the German parliament to declare Ottoman-era killings of Armenians in Turkey a genocide, Karaka\u015f said.\u000a\u000aInfluenced by Turkish state media, which is consumed heavily by German Turks, a feeling within the community of being considered second-class citizens in Germany was reinforced over the last couple of years, she said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe feeling is that as Turks, they were never really treated on an equal footing.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe SPD\u2019s Annen agreed that \u2014 independent of the discussion provoked by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s comments \u2014 Germany had to look critically at its integration efforts and become better at involving German Turks in the political process.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have to signal to our German citizens with a Turkish family background that they are part of our country and society,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey have their place here, and they should not be impressed by the divisive politics of Mr. Erdo\u011fan.\u201d

aVFormer Sheriff Joe Arpaio (right), an outspoken immigration opponent, has long backed President Donald Trump. Trump pardons former Sheriff Arpaio\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on Friday, according to a White House announcement.\u000a\u000aThe White House broke the news just after 8 p.m. and laid out the case for why the 85-year-old Arpaio \u2014 to some a symbol of animosity toward immigrants and Hispanics \u2014 deserved the president\u2019s first such reprieve. The announcement highlighted Arpaio\u2019s military service and \u201chis life\u2019s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aArpaio, who lost a reelection bid for sheriff in November 2016, took to Twitter to thank the president.\u000a\u000a"Thank you @realdonaldtrump for seeing my conviction for what it is: a political witch hunt by holdovers in the Obama justice department!" Arpaio wrote. "I am humbled and incredibly grateful to President Trump. I look fwd to putting this chapter behind me and helping to #MAGA."\u000a\u000aArpaio later vowed, during an appearance on Fox News, to speak out against the \u201cabuse of the judicial system in politics\u201d in light of his conviction.\u000a\u000aThe move was widely anticipated \u2014 mainly because Trump himself suggested at a rally earlier this week that he planned to pardon the controversial lawman, who was convicted of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case and faced up to six months in jail.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"I\u2019ll make a prediction: I think he\u2019s going to be just fine. Okay?" Trump told a crowd at the rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. "But I won\u2019t do it tonight because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy. Is that okay? All right? But Sheriff Joe can feel good."\u000a\u000aTrump touted Arpaio's lifetime of "selfless public service" in the White House's official announcement Friday. The president had cast Arpaio's conviction earlier in the week as unfair, saying he'd been "convicted for doing his job."\u000a\u000aPardons for individuals who haven't been sentenced aren't common, but Obama issued two. One went to a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Cartwright, who had pleaded guilty to lying in a leak investigation. Another went to an Iranian who pleaded guilty in a computer hacking case but had not been sentenced. Obama also pardoned three businessmen of Iranian origin who were awaiting trial for export violations.\u000a\u000aArpaio never filed an application for the pardon with the Justice Department, an administration official told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has sparred with the president in recent days, expressed disappointment that Trump did not allow Arpaio's conviction to make its way through the sentencing phase.\u000a\u000a"Regarding the Arpaio pardon, I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course," Flake tweeted Friday night.\u000a\u000aSen. John McCain, Arizona's other Republican senator, similarly rebuked the action, saying in a statement that while the president acted within his rights, the pardon "undermines [Trump's] claim for the respect of rule of law as Mr. Arpaio has shown no remorse for his actions.\u201d\u000a\u000aRep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), an outspoken critic of Trump, blasted Arpaio's "racist and unconstitutional police practices," adding that, "Trump's pardon of Arpaio is unconscionable and unworthy of the White House."\u000a\u000aCivil liberties and immigrant rights groups reacted with disgust after the White House released news of the pardon Friday night. Less than two weeks prior, Trump set off a racially charged firestorm when he said \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for violence at a gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, that drew white nationalists, Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis.\u000a\u000aDuring his 24 years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio cultivated a reputation as a zealous opponent of illegal immigration. He dressed jail detainees in pink boxer shorts, ostensibly so they wouldn\u2019t be stolen, and housed them in an open-air \u201ctent city\u201d exposed to Arizona\u2019s withering heat.\u000a\u000aHe gained supporters among immigration hawks \u2014 Trump included. After Trump surged into view as a serious candidate for the Republican presidential election, he won the endorsement of Arpaio in January 2016.\u000a\u000a\u201cEverybody knows I\u2019ve been with him anyway these last two years, so I\u2019m not changing, pardon or no pardon,\u201d Arpaio told POLITICO earlier this month. \u201cBut if he wants to do it, I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d\u000a\u000aJosh Gerstein contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVGermany, France and Italy are pressing Brussels to play a bigger role in protecting some of Europe\u2019s most innovative companies from what they see as politically motivated Chinese acquisitions.\u000a\u000aIn a policy paper obtained by POLITICO, the three countries propose that the European Commission should determine whether acquisitions are being steered by a foreign country\u2019s political objectives rather than market forces. Such a decision from Brussels would then offer EU countries greater leverage in rejecting advances from Chinese suitors.\u000a\u000aChinese moves to buy some of the crown jewels of Europe\u2019s tech industry \u2014 such as German robot maker Kuka last year \u2014 have turned into a hot political issue. Europeans increasingly fear that the Middle Kingdom\u2019s wave of acquisitions is not driven by the market but by Beijing\u2019s hunger to acquire technology, which is a political goal mapped out in its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program.\u000a\u000aAs POLITICO reported last month, Brussels is already working on new rules to allow EU countries to rein in Chinese takeovers. Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expected to announce plans on how to manage foreign investments in his State of the European Union speech on September 13 \u2014 but it remains unclear how much power the new mechanism will grant the Commission to act as policeman.\u000a\u000aThe scope of the proposal goes beyond blocking state-funded takeovers and also seeks to enforce a broader principle of \u201creciprocity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe policy paper gives an indication of how a vetting process will work if the eurozone\u2019s most powerful trio get their way, as they often do.\u000a\u000aAccording to their proposal, the Commission should take on a new role in judging whether a foreign takeover is subsidized, or has a \u201cdegree of state influence.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe paper, which was sent to Juncker earlier this month, said member countries should then have the right to \u201cprohibit\u201d takeovers in strategic sectors, which the paper says \u201cstill need to be more clearly defined.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the ultimate power to block an acquisition would remain with national governments, the rules grant the EU new powers to judge whether an investment is in line with the free market.\u000a\u000aJudging a fair price\u000a\u000a\u201cUpon request by the member state, the Commission would assess the market compatibility of the operation,\u201d the proposal says. This includes \u201cthe extent to which the investment decision of the non-EU investor has directly or indirectly been influenced by government regulations\u201d as well as \u201cthe extent to which the actual acquisition is funded or co-financed by government-controlled or government-influenced agencies, and the extent to which the investor\u2019s bid for the target company clearly exceeds the market price.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat final point opens up difficult new territory for the Commission as it would have to value a company to determine a fair market price for a takeover. Analysts note that this is a contentious and inexact science as companies regularly pay more than the stock valuation for acquisitions they think will grant a strategic advantage.\u000a\u000aThe proposal also wants the Commission to prepare a biannual report on the scale of investment across Europe. In a clear reference to China, the trio of EU countries also said that Brussels should study the \u201csubsidies put in place by the main states from which foreign investors in the EU originate.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe scope of the proposal goes beyond blocking state-funded takeovers and also seeks to enforce a broader principle of \u201creciprocity.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis means countries that currently restrict investments by EU companies should be punished for doing so by being treated in the same way. A country should be allowed to \u201cexamine an acquisition and, where necessary, make it subject to conditions or prohibit it, if the investment conditions for European investors in the investor\u2019s country of origin discriminate against European investors,\u201d the proposal says.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe rely on the European Commission\u2019s expertise as far as the analysis of the investment and foreign investment conditions is concerned. The final decision should be left to member states,\u201d the proposal reads.\u000a\u000aChina has said that it is \u201cconcerned\u201d about the EU\u2019s accelerating crackdown on takeovers.\u000a\u000aGerman Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries on Thursday also sent a letter to Juncker, in which she asked him to consider the joint proposal in his drafts for new EU-wide rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am grateful that you have, in the meantime, personally looked at this issue, and that the offices of the Commission have already discussed concrete questions and ideas with us,\u201d Zypries wrote.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the one hand, the inflow of capital is a positive development, as it shows the attractiveness of Europe,\u201d Zypries wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, one has to note that these investments are one-sidedly concentrated on hi-tech companies and companies that provide key technologies \u2014 which shows obvious connections to the \u2018China 2025\u2019 strategy decided by the Chinese government.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis article is part of an occasional series: China looks West.

aVHurricane Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast Friday with the potential for up to 3 feet of rain, 125 mph winds and 12-foot storm surges in what could be the fiercest hurricane to hit the United States in almost a dozen years. | Eric Gay/AP Harvey rolls over Texas coast, smashes homes and businesses\u000a\u000aCORPUS CHRISTI, Texas \u2014 Hurricane Harvey rolled over the Texas Gulf Coast on Saturday, smashing homes and businesses and lashing the shore with wind and rain so intense that drivers were forced off the road because they could not see the pavement in front of them.\u000a\u000aThe fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in more than a decade spun across hundreds of miles of coastline where communities had prepared for life-threatening storm surges \u2014 walls of water rushing inland.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe mammoth system made landfall late Friday about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 storm with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. It gradually weakened over several hours to Category 1 but remained destructive, with sustained winds of 90 mph (144 kph).\u000a\u000aNo deaths were immediately reported. High winds kept emergency crews out of many places, and authorities said it could be hours before emergency teams are able to fully assess damage.\u000a\u000aAside from the wind and a storm surge of up 12 feet, the hurricane posed a grave risk of flooding, with a potential to hug the coast for days and drop as much as 40 inches of rain on dangerously flood-prone flatlands.\u000a\u000aBy dawn, nearly 300,000 consumers were without power in the coastal region, and nearly 20 inches (0.5 meters) of rain had fallen in some places.\u000a\u000aThe mayor of Rockport, a coastal city of about 10,000 that was directly in the storm's path, said his community took a blow "right on the nose" that left "widespread devastation," including homes, businesses and schools that were heavily damaged. Some structures were destroyed.\u000a\u000aMayor Charles "C.J." Wax told The Weather Channel that the city's emergency response system had been hampered by the loss of cellphone service and other forms of communication.\u000a\u000aAbout 10 people were taken to the county jail for treatment after the roof of a senior housing complex collapsed, television station KIII reported.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The president signed a federal disaster declaration for coastal counties Friday night.\u000a\u000aTrump commended the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for his handling of the hurricane.\u000a\u000aIn a tweet Saturday morning addressed to FEMA head Brock Long, Trump said: "You are doing a great job \u2014 the world is watching! Be safe."\u000a\u000aIn a separate tweet, Trump said he is monitoring the hurricane closely from Camp David. "We are leaving nothing to chance. City, State and Federal Govs. working great together!"\u000a\u000aThe president also tweeted, "We have fantastic people on the ground, got there long before #Harvey. So far, so good!"\u000a\u000aHarvey's approach sent tens of thousands of people fleeing inland, hoping to escape the wrath of a menacing storm that threatened not only the coast but a wide swath of Texas that is home to oil refineries, chemical plants and Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city.\u000a\u000aIn Corpus Christi, the major city closest to the storm's center, wind whipped palm trees and stinging sheets of horizontal rain slapped against hotels and office buildings along the seawall as the storm made landfall.\u000a\u000aDaybreak revealed downed lamp posts and tree limbs and roof tiles torn off buildings. The city's marina was nearly unscathed, save an awning ripped from a restaurant entrance and a wooden garbage bin uprooted and thrown.\u000a\u000aOn along Interstate 45 leaving Galveston, motorists had to stop under bridges to avoid driving in whiteout conditions.\u000a\u000aFueled by warm Gulf of Mexico waters, Harvey grew rapidly, accelerating from a Category 1 early Friday morning to a Category 4 by evening. Its transformation from an unnamed storm to a life-threatening behemoth took only 56 hours, an incredibly fast intensification.\u000a\u000aHarvey came ashore as the fiercest hurricane to hit the U.S. in 13 years and the strongest to strike Texas since 1961's Hurricane Carla, the most powerful Texas hurricane on record.\u000a\u000aBefore the storm arrived, property owners raced to nail plywood over windows and fill sandbags. Steady traffic filled the highways leaving Corpus Christi, but there were no apparent jams. In Houston, where mass evacuations can include changing major highways to a one-way vehicle flow, authorities left traffic patterns unchanged.\u000a\u000aJust hours before the projected landfall, the governor and Houston leaders issued conflicting statements on evacuation.\u000a\u000aAfter Gov. Greg Abbott urged more people to flee, Houston authorities told people to remain in their homes and recommended no widespread evacuations.\u000a\u000aIn a Friday news conference that addressed Houston officials' decision to not have a voluntary or mandatory evacuation, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said there might be a "greater danger" in having people who don't need to be evacuated on roads that could flood.\u000a\u000aHarris County Judge Ed Emmett said that because the hurricane was not taking direct aim at Houston, the city's primary concern was heavy flooding.\u000a\u000a"We are not having a hurricane," said Emmett, the top elected official for the county, which encompasses Houston. "We are having a rain event."\u000a\u000aAt a convenience store in Houston's Meyerland neighborhood, at least 12 cars lined up for fuel. Brent Borgstedte said this was the fourth gas station he had visited to try to fill up his son's car. The 55-year-old insurance agent shrugged off Harvey's risks.\u000a\u000a"I don't think anybody is really that worried about it. I've lived here my whole life," he said. "I've been through several hurricanes."\u000a\u000aScientists warned that Harvey could swamp counties more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) inland and stir up dangerous surf as far away as Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) from the projected landfall. It may also spawn tornadoes.\u000a\u000aAll seven Texas counties on the coast from Corpus Christi to the western end of Galveston Island ordered mandatory evacuations from low-lying areas. Four counties ordered full evacuations and warned there was no guarantee of rescue for people staying behind.\u000a\u000aState officials said they had no count on how many people actually left their homes.\u000a\u000aThe last Category 4 storm to hit the U.S. was Hurricane Charley in August 2004 in Florida. Superstorm Sandy, which pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, never had the high winds and had lost tropical status by the time it struck. But it was devastating without formally being called a major hurricane.\u000a\u000aHarvey is the first significant hurricane to hit Texas since Ike in September 2008 brought winds of 110 mph (177 kph) to the Galveston and Houston areas, inflicting $22 billion in damage.\u000a\u000aAuthors:\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Texas

El Mundo published an editorial heavily criticizing the regional government for failing to prevent the attacks. The paper blamed Catalan police for not sharing the information received from the Belgians with national intelligence and security forces, and accused Catalonia of having a lax approach to Islamic radicalism. While Es Satty was not allowed to run a mosque in Belgium, \u201che had no problem months later running a mosque in Ripoll,\u201d the paper said, \u201cwhich leads us to ask about the lack of controls in religious centers in our country, and specifically in Catalonia.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Catalan government maintains its plan to hold the illegal referendum,\u201d El País reported.\u000a\u000aUK\u000a\u000aMigration was on the front pages of the British press this morning.

The storm, previously projected to arrive in Texas as a Category 3 storm, was upgraded to Category 4 late Friday and was projected to reach wind speeds of up to 130 mph.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump repeatedly vowed to assist Texas officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott, in dealing with the storm.\u000a\u000aThe White House added in a statement released Friday that federal aid could include "grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."\u000a\u000aSen. Chuck Grassley urged Trump Friday morning in a tweet to "keep on top of hurricane Harvey" and not make the "same mistake" former President George W.

aVBERLIN \u2014 Railing against an unpopular U.S. president has worked for Germany\u2019s Social Democrats in an election campaign before. Now they\u2019re trying the same tactic again.\u000a\u000aFifteen years ago, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was lagging in opinion polls and widely expected to lose to his conservative challenger \u2014 until he denied U.S. President George Bush support for the invasion of Iraq, made his opposition to the war a key campaign theme, and ended up being reelected by a whisker.\u000a\u000aWith less than six weeks to go until this year\u2019s parliamentary election, the SPD \u2014 now spearheaded by former European Parliament President Martin Schulz \u2014 is trying to damage Chancellor Angela Merkel by linking her to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for higher military spending by Germany and other NATO allies.\u000a\u000aThe message: Unless you want Germany to become an armed-to-the-teeth military power, vote for Schulz.\u000a\u000aTrailing by more than 15 percentage points in the polls, the center-left party \u2014 currently the junior partner in Merkel\u2019s coalition government \u2014 has amped up its rhetoric on the issue. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel declared this week that the election was a vote on whether Germany \u201cremained a force for peace or followed Trump\u2019s armament madness.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Social Democrats are not suggesting that Merkel, a cautious leader most at home in the political center, is anything like Trump. But they are \u2014 sometimes subtly, sometimes not so subtly \u2014 suggesting that she and the U.S. president are tied together in wanting to ramp up military expenditure.\u000a\u000aThe SPD know they could be onto a winner if they can link any of Merkel\u2019s policies to Trump, who \u2014 unlike his predecessor Barack Obama \u2014 is highly unpopular in Germany.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to defense spending, [Merkel\u2019s] conservatives traditionally represent a position that seems to be in line with the current position of the White House,\u201d Rolf Mützenich, the deputy chairman of the SPD\u2019s group in the German parliament, told POLITICO from the campaign trail in his constituency in Cologne.\u000a\u000aHis party, Mützenich said, has \u201ca completely different position, which we will make clear over the next couple of weeks,\u201d adding that instead of boosting military spending, Germany should spend more on humanitarian aid and other ways to prevent and resolve conflicts peacefully.\u000a\u000a\u2018Vast sums\u2019\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s military budget was a point of contention between Washington and Berlin even before Trump entered the White House. But Trump\u2019s presidency pushed it to the forefront of public debate.\u000a\u000aBerlin will spend around \u20ac39 billion on defense this year, some 1.22 percent of its GDP, according to NATO estimates \u2014 far below a guideline figure of 2 percent of GDP outlined by NATO leaders in a declaration in 2014.\u000a\u000aSince taking office, Trump has repeatedly castigated NATO allies for their military dependence on the U.S., which is projected to spend around 3.6 percent of its GDP on defense this year, and demanded all members of the alliance meet the 2 percent benchmark. He singled out Germany for criticism, declaring Berlin owes NATO \u201cvast sums.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo reach the NATO figure in the timeframe set out in the 2014 declaration, Berlin would have to almost double its defense expenditure by 2024, turning Germany into by far the biggest military spender in Europe.\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s conservative bloc, traditionally an advocate for more defense spending, supports this goal. But Schulz and his party consider 2 percent much more of an advisory figure than a binding target.\u000a\u000aSchulz has pointed out the 2014 declaration is far from clear-cut, with NATO leaders committing themselves merely to \u201caim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter Merkel\u2019s conservatives pledged to \u201cincrementally increase defense spending toward 2 percent of GDP\u201d in their election platform, the SPD went on the attack.\u000a\u000aForeign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called the commitment \u201ca subjugation to the U.S. president of a type that until recently I would not have thought possible.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the SPD\u2019s Manuela Schwesig, the premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state, questioned where the money would come from for such a large increase in military spending. She said the SPD wanted to use any extra government spending to invest in education.\u000a\u000aLong odds\u000a\u000aThe SPD know they could be onto a winner if they can link any of Merkel\u2019s policies to Trump, who \u2014 unlike his predecessor Barack Obama \u2014 is highly unpopular in Germany.\u000a\u000aOnly 1 out of 10 Germans believes that Trump does the right thing in world affairs, compared with almost 9 out of 10 for Obama, according to a June 2017 study by the Pew Research Center.\u000a\u000aAgainst this backdrop, campaigning on the defense spending commitment could strike a chord with Germans, who are extremely wary of militarism given the country\u2019s history.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe 2002 election showed that you can campaign on a foreign policy issue and win elections with that,\u201d said Hendrik Träger, who teaches politics at the University of Leipzig.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, the odds for Schulz are long.\u000a\u000aHis greatest obstacle is that unlike Schröder, who could run 15 years ago on a simple anti-war message, Schulz is opposing an abstract number \u2014 the amount of military spending as a share of GDP.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Merkel \u2014 although more cautious in her words than the SPD \u2014 has repeatedly distanced herself from Trump since he took office. While defending the close relationship between Germany and the United States, she has made clear that she has very different views from Trump on a range of issues including globalization, trade and climate change.\u000a\u000aHaving such a brash and volatile president in the White House could actually help Merkel in the election.\u000a\u000aWhen Merkel returned from a three-week vacation last Friday, she used her first press conference to take a swipe at Trump\u2019s threat to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea. In her usual measured tone, Merkel warned that an \u201cescalation of rhetoric [was] the wrong answer.\u201d\u000a\u000aStatements like that go down well in a country which values few things as much as stability. In fact, having such a brash and volatile president in the White House could actually help Merkel in the election.\u000a\u000a\u201cWith Donald Trump, there\u2019s a U.S. president who likes to tweet at night and whose actions are hard to predict,\u201d Träger said. \u201cThat\u2019s why many people in Germany feel good about having a calm and controlled politician like Angela Merkel as their \u2018anchor for stability\u2019 and a counterpart to Trump.\u201d

aVNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, visits the Chemical Material Institute of Academy of Defense Science at an undisclosed location in North Korea on Aug. 23. | Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP North Korea fires short-range missiles in latest test\u000a\u000aSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea fired several rockets into the sea Saturday in the continuation of its rapid nuclear and missile expansion, prompting South Korea to press ahead with military drills involving U.S. troops that have angered Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Pacific Command revised its initial assessment that the first and third short-range missiles failed during flight to say they flew about 250 kilometers (155 miles). It said that the second missile appears to have blown up immediately and that none posed threat to the U.S. territory of Guam, which the North had previously warned it would fire missiles toward.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's presidential office and military said North Korea fired "several" projectiles in what was presumed as a test of its 300-millimeter rocket artillery system.\u000a\u000aKim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said that South Korean assessment doesn't necessarily contradict the U.S. evaluation that the launches involved ballistic missiles. North Korea's large-sized artillery rockets blur the boundaries between artillery systems and ballistic missiles because they create their own thrust and are guided during delivery, Kim said.\u000a\u000aThe presidential office in Seoul said the U.S. and South Korean militaries will proceed with their ongoing war games "even more thoroughly" in response to the launch. They are the first known missile firings since July, when the North successfully flight tested a pair of intercontinental ballistic missiles that analysts say could reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\u000a\u000aThe White House said that President Donald Trump \u2014 who has warned that he would unleash "fire and fury" if the North continued its threats \u2014 was briefed on the latest North Korean activity and "we are monitoring the situation."\u000a\u000aThe rival Koreas recently saw their always testy relationship get worse after Trump traded warlike threats. Saturday's launch comes during an annual joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea that the North condemns as an invasion rehearsal, and weeks after Pyongyang threatened to lob missiles toward Guam.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea had walked back from the threat to lob missiles toward Guam, but there had been concerns that hostility will flare up again during the Ulchi-Freedom Guardian drills between the allies that run through Aug. 31.\u000a\u000aHowever, some experts say North Korea is now mainly focused on the bigger picture of testing its bargaining power against the United States with its new long-range missiles and likely has no interest in letting things get too tense during the drills. They say the North may limit its reactions to low-level provocations like artillery and short-range missile launches.\u000a\u000aWhile the projectile that supposedly blew up immediately after launch was clearly a failure, Kim, the analyst, said the North with the other missiles could have been experimenting with developmental technologies or deliberately detonated the warheads at certain heights and locations. If the South Korean assessments are correct, the North might have conducted tests to expand the range of its 300-millimeter multiple rocket launchers, which are believed to have a radius of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles), Kim said.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea's state media earlier Saturday said that leader Kim Jong Un inspected a special operation forces training of the country's army that simulated attacks on South Korean islands along the countries' western sea border in what appeared to be in response to the ongoing U.S.-South Korea war games.\u000a\u000aKim reportedly told his troops that they "should think of mercilessly wiping out the enemy with arms only and occupying Seoul at one go and the southern half of Korea."\u000a\u000aThe Korean Central News Agency said that the "target striking contest" involved war planes, multiple-rocket launchers and self-propelled guns that attacked targets meant to represent South Korea's Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong islands before special operation combatants "landed by surprise" on rubber boats.\u000a\u000aThe border islands have occasionally seen military skirmishes between the rivals, including a North Korean artillery barrage on Yeonpyeong in 2010 that left two South Korean marines and two civilians dead.\u000a\u000aIn response to North Korea's expanding nuclear weapons program, South Korea has been moving to strengthen its own capabilities, planning talks with the United States on raising the warhead limits on its missiles and taking steps to place additional launchers to a U.S. anti-missile defense system in the country's southeast.\u000a\u000aSouth Korea has also been testing new missiles of its own, including the 800-kilometer (497 mile)-range Hyunmoo-2. Although the missile has not been operationally deployed yet, it is considered a key component to the so-called "kill chain" pre-emptive strike capability the South is pursuing to cope with the North's growing nuclear and missile threat.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe \u201cWest Wing Democrats\u201d in the White House are eager to sacrifice President Donald Trump\u2019s top campaign promise in exchange for Democratic approval of the tax cuts sought by wealthy donors and business interests, according to an article in Politico.\u000a\u000aIn an August 23 article about Trump\u2019s push to get funding for an extended border wall, Politico described the lack of support for the wall among his business-affiliated aides:\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aFew staff members in the West Wing are as concerned about it [as the President], senior administration officials said. Some in the White House have urged Trump not to focus as much on the wall, try to pass a clean debt-ceiling bill and move to tax reform. \u201cYou have barely anyone here saying, \u2018Wall, wall, we have to get the wall at all costs,\u2019\u201d one White House official said. \u2026 Two people who have spoken to Trump said he sees not building the wall as a personal embarrassment \u2014 and that he has shown more interest in building the wall than in other issues, like the upcoming budget negotiations. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a government shutdown,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cHe is told that. He says, \u2018I want money for the wall.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aThe same emphasis on tax cuts for the elite before immigration reform for voters was also cited by Axios on August 20, in an article which claimed to explain why top staff chose to stay in the White House amid elite hatred of his populist, wage-boosting, pro-American priorities. Axios reported:\u000a\u000aWe talked to a half dozen senior administration officials, who range from dismayed but certain to stay, to disgusted and likely soon to leave. They all work closely with Trump and his senior team so, of course, wouldn\u2019t talk on the record. Instead, they agreed to let us distill their thinking/rationale: \u201cYou have no idea how much crazy stuff we kill\u201d: The most common response centers on the urgent importance of having smart, sane people around Trump to fight his worst impulses. If they weren\u2019t there, they say, we would have a trade war with China, massive deportations, and a government shutdown to force construction of a Southern wall. \u201cGeneral Mattis needs us\u201d: Many talk about their reluctance to bolt on their friends and colleagues who are fighting the good fight to force better Trump behavior/decisions. They rightly point out that together, they have learned how to ignore Trump\u2019s rhetoric and, at times, collectively steer him to more conventional policy responses.\u000a\u000aThis situation leaves Trump dependent on a few aides \u2014 such as immigration reformer Steve Miller \u2014 and his supporters at his rallies to help fend off the insistent demands by his globalist aides for a back-room surrender of his presidential goals.\u000a\u000aThat surrender would help his aides win Democratic support for their goals \u2014 but it would leave Trump with few friends heading into the 2018 midterm elections and the crucial 2020 reelection, says D.C. insiders. For example, the pro-American immigration reformers who backed Trump in the election fear his globalist aides will push Trump to accept and establish former President Barack Obama\u2019s DACA amnesty in exchange for minor concessions, such as a modest amount of funds to build a short distance of border wall.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf [Trump\u2019s aides] are left to their own devices, they would exchange this for a few trinkets,\u201d so violating Trump\u2019s campaign promise before the 2018 and 2020 elections, said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\u000a\u000aThe suggested deal was outlined in a Tuesday article by Anita Kumar, a reporter for the McClatchy news service. She uses the Democrats\u2019 term \u2014 \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2013 to describe the 800,000 DACA illegals as she wrote:\u000a\u000aWhite House officials want Trump to strike an ambitious deal with Congress that offers Dreamers protection in exchange for legislation that pays for a border wall and more detention facilities, curbs legal immigration and implements E-verify, an online system that allows businesses to check immigration status, according to a half-dozen people familiar with situation, most involved with the negotiations. The group includes former and current White House chiefs of staff, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both serve as presidential advisers, they said. Others who have not been as vocal publicly about their stance but are thought to agree include Vice President Mike Pence, who as a congressman worked on a failed immigration deal that called for citizenship, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn, a Democrat who serves as director of the National Economic Council.\u000a\u000aThere is no evidence that Democrats will accept that ambitious deal before the 2018 election, and much evidence that Trump\u2019s aides will quickly give up wall funding and the popular RAISE Act to win Democratic support for tax cuts. So far, top Democrats have responded that they would not offer anything as they demand a permanent DACA amnesty.\u000a\u000aHowever, Trump\u2019s determination to resist his aides is likely boosted by the cheering he gets at rallies when he promises to build the wall.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are building a wall on the southern border, which is absolutely necessary,\u201d he told roughly 30,000 cheering supporters at an August 22 rally in Phoenix, Ariz. \u201cThe obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, believe me, [but] if we have to close down our government, we are building that wall \u2026 We\u2019re going to have our wall. We\u2019re going to get our wall.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere you have it, @realDonaldTrump! Your own 30k focus-group. LIKE: deportations, a wall, jobs; DON'T LIKE: Media, Afghan War & tax cuts. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 23, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump later thanked the crowd.\u000a\u000aPhoenix crowd last night was amazing \u2013 a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2017\u000a\u000aRead the Axios article here, and the Politico article here.\u000a\u000aUnder current immigration policy, the federal government accepts 1 million legal immigrants each year, even though 4 million young Americans enter the workforce to look for decent jobs. Each year, the government also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.\u000a\u000aThe current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids\u2019 schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.\u000a\u000aMany polls show that Americans are very generous, they do welcome individual immigrants, and they do want to like the idea of immigration. But the polls also show that most Americans are increasingly worried that large-scale legal immigration will change their country and disadvantage themselves and their children. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d policies are also extremely popular, including among Democratic-leaning voters.

aVFormer U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks during BookExpo 2017 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Clinton\u2019s \u2018skin crawled\u2019 from Trump\u2019s looming behavior at debate In excerpts from her new memoir, the former presidential candidate describes moments from her failed 2016 campaign.\u000a\u000aFormer Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said her \u201cskin crawled\u201d during last year\u2019s second presidential debate, a reaction to Donald Trump standing ominously near her as she delivered answers before a national audience.\u000a\u000aIn an excerpt from her forthcoming book on the 2016 race, Clinton recalled Trump\u2019s uncomfortably close positioning on stage during the town hall-style debate at Washington University in St. Louis. The event took place just days after an audio recording from a years-old \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d interview surfaced of the president bragging in vulgar terms about how his celebrity status allowed him to sexually assault women without consequence.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not OK, I thought. It was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me. Two days before, the world heard him brag about groping women. Now we were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces,\u201d Clinton wrote in her book \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d an excerpt of which was broadcast Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was incredibly uncomfortable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled. It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching, well, what would you do? Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren\u2019t repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly, \u2018back up you creep, get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women but you can\u2019t intimidate me, so back up.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the time of the debate, Trump\u2019s campaign was thought to be on the ropes, battered by the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape as well as a wave of accusations of sexual assault from multiple women. Trump responded with a taped apology for his remarks on the recording and a denial of every assault accusation. As his guests at the second debate, Trump brought multiple women who had accused former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband, of sexual assault, hosting a media event with them 90 minutes before he was to take the stage.\u000a\u000aCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, then Trump\u2019s campaign manager, later confirmed that the president had planned to seat the women in his family\u2019s box, where they would have been more visible to Hillary Clinton while she was on stage.\u000a\u000aTrump loomed often over Hillary Clinton while she gave answers to the town hall debate attendees. In her book, the former secretary of state wrote that she opted not to make an issue of it, although she wondered in writing whether she should have.\u000a\u000a\u201cI chose option A. I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off. I did, however, grip the microphone extra hard,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI wonder, though, whether I should have chosen option B. It certainly would have been better TV. Maybe I have overlearned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn another excerpt, Hillary Clinton wrote of the disappointment she still feels in having lost the election and of the emotional highs and lows of the presidential race. She said her race for the presidency was \u201cexhilarating, joyful, humbling, infuriating and just plain baffling\u201d and that her book should not be considered an exhaustive account of her 2016 run because \u201cI have too little distance and too great a stake in it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery day that I was a candidate for president, I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of letting them down, but I did. I couldn\u2019t get the job done and I\u2019ll have to live with that for the rest of my life,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cIn this book, I write about moments from the campaign that I wish I could go back and do over. If the Russians could hack my subconscious, they\u2019d find a long list.\u000a\u000a\u201cI also capture some moments I want to remember forever,\u201d she continued. \u201cLike when my tiny granddaughter raced into the room while I was practicing my convention speech and what it was like hours later to step on stage to deliver that speech as the first woman ever nominated by a major political party for president of the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe book is scheduled to be released September 12.

aVIn Donald Trump\u2019s White House, it seems like almost everyone has an exit strategy. But leaving isn\u2019t always a simple affair, and offers\u2014or threats\u2014to leave don\u2019t always pan out.\u000a\u000aGary Cohn considered quitting after President Donald Trump\u2019s Charlottesville comments and wrote multiple resignation letters, a draft op-ed and answers to reporters\u2019 anticipated questions.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s top economic adviser talked to his family about quitting, and his wife urged him to do so. He went to Bedminster for a last-minute meeting with the president last Friday, according to people familiar with the session. But he didn\u2019t quit, instead choosing to criticize Trump in an interview with the Financial Times while sticking around to see what Trump will do \u2013 leaving Cohn in limbo and his White House colleagues and others mystified.\u000a\u000aA number of senior administration officials have offered to leave or privately told confidants they might, only to be told to stay \u2013 or decide to stay on their own. Some were pushed out, or claimed to have resigned after they were pushed out, while one \u2013 former press secretary Sean Spicer \u2013 publicly quit only to stick around in the building with no clear duties, and after facing months of rumors about his demise.\u000a\u000aJeff Sessions offered his resignation earlier this year, after Trump criticized him at length for the attorney general recusing himself in the Russia probe without notifying Trump in advance. He then was in perpetual limbo for several weeks while Trump publicly castigated him, waiting to be fired only not to be. The two men are still aloof, and Sessions has told others he doesn\u2019t understand the episode.\u000a\u000aSteve Bannon vociferously said he was staying in the White House for two weeks after he had supposedly resigned and attacked stories about his departure as \u201cbullshit.\u201d He later told others the decision was entirely his; while senior administration officials said he was ousted after being isolated.\u000a\u000aReince Priebus said he resigned in a private meeting with Trump earlier this summer after Anthony Scaramucci attacked him in comments to the New Yorker, but others believe he was dismissed on Air Force One. Priebus, these people said, told people he was staying around even after he publicly said he resigned and flew to Long Island on Air Force One, a strange move if one had already resigned. He \u201creally wanted to make it a year,\u201d one person said.\u000a\u000aRegardless, he wandered around the halls of the Executive Office Building for days, taking occasional meetings, looking for other gigs and taking a vacation before his employment formally concludes at the end of August. Priebus declined to comment.\u000a\u000aNo one is exactly sure what Spicer is doing these days at the White House; he quit five weeks ago but is still there while negotiating his next gig and meeting with TV networks, while staying on the payroll.\u000a\u000aThe only clear departure seemed to be Scaramucci, who was ousted by new chief of staff John Kelly after accusing Bannon of performing sexual acrobatics on himself and accusing Priebus of being paranoid in profane terms.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put together a stable team when you have such an unstable work environment,\u201d said Ron Klain, who worked in the White House under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump, who ran the Trump Organization much the same way. \u201cIf he\u2019s unhappy with you, he can make your life miserable, and you know he\u2019s unhappy,\u201d said Louise Sunshine, a longtime real estate executive who worked for him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really fire people.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne senior administration official said Trump seems to relish the personnel dramas. He\u2019ll ask aides what they think of each other. He will tell advisers that he is considering firing someone. He doesn\u2019t mind trial balloons. He likes to see how much public embarrassment someone can take.\u000a\u000aMany aides are \u201cdeeply, deeply miserable,\u201d this official said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not easy to just walk out of the White House,\u201d this person added. \u201cYou think you\u2019re helping.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther advisers attribute the turnover to a president who hasn\u2019t worked with his staff for long and doesn\u2019t necessarily trust them, therefore he keeps them out of the loop and they don\u2019t understand him. \u201cNo previous president has hired this many people who had no connection to his campaign or his candidacy or his vision for the country,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. \u201cI don\u2019t understand many of the hiring decisions he has made.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn was was deeply upset after the press conference where Trump said \u201cmany sides\u201d were to blame for Charlottesville, according to a person who spoke to him, and began plotting a potential exit. He spoke to friends in the business community, who gave him mixed reactions. Privately, some business executives said they didn\u2019t understand how he could continue to work there \u2014 and were amazed at the response. But other friends say Cohn is needed to help in a dysfunctional building.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe business community is depending on Gary Cohn for his substance and his focus to carry forward the most important initiatives. It would be very disappointing if he were to leave in terms of our hopes for the big agenda items that need to get done,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, who leads the Partnership for New York City, an influential group of CEOs.\u000a\u000aAfter weighing the decision with his family, he went to Bedminster to talk with Trump. He told Trump he would publicly criticize him and then did it in the Financial Times interview that published Friday, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president, as I have said many times, and Gary have spoken many times. Gary has not held back on what his feelings are,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Friday. \u201cHe has not held back how he feels about the situation. He\u2019s been very open and honest so I don\u2019t think that anyone was surprised by the comments.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet the moves could isolate Cohn in Washington, where some have questioned his allegiance with Trump after being a longtime Goldman Sachs executive and Democrat. However, people familiar with the discussions say he has developed some good relationships with senior Capitol Hill Republicans working on tax reform and is seen by many as a steadying force in an unsteady administration.\u000a\u000aCohn, however, has become a flashpoint for many of Trump\u2019s nationalist supporters, particularly those affiliated with former chief strategist Steve Bannon, whose Breitbart website often torches Cohn. Stone said he should be fired immediately.\u000a\u000aAmong many Democrats and business friends, there was little sympathy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that complicated at all,\u201d Klain said. \u201cBeing there indicates their assent to President Trump\u2019s agenda and statements. The idea that they\u2019re somehow doing us a favor by trying to prevent President Trump from making certain decisions is some combination of self-aggrandizement and self-delusion.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump hasn\u2019t commented on Cohn, who told others he chose his words carefully, doesn\u2019t regret the interview \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to quit, but would not be devastated if the president forced him out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the broader tactical drama of doing interviews with the media saying you contemplated quitting and that you were ready to go and unhappy with the president but are staying,\u201d said Trump biographer Timothy O\u2019Brien.\u000a\u000a\u201cHas the president ever accepted public criticism well?\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange form of brinkmanship that I don\u2019t think will go over well.\u201d

aVBritish ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow | Aurore Belot/AFP via Getty Images UK says EU\u2019s \u20ac2 billion China fraud estimate \u2018inflated\u2019 The UK is disputing the calculation by the EU\u2019s anti-fraud office.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is disputing an \u201cinflated\u201d estimate by the EU that it owes \u20ac2 billion in lost duties and VAT connected to a Chinese fraud network.\u000a\u000aIn a robust four-page letter to the European Commission, obtained by POLITICO, the British ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow, questioned the EU anti-fraud agency OLAF\u2019s methodology for calculating the bill as \u201coverly simplistic.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe dispute \u2014 which is embarrassing for the U.K. at a time when it is attempting to win support in Brussels for its post-Brexit proposals on future customs arrangements \u2014 stems from a two-year investigation by OLAF concluded in March. It accuses London of having turned a blind eye to one of the largest alleged fraud rings it has ever uncovered, which allowed Chinese textiles and footwear to flood into Europe at a tiny fraction of their true cost of production.\u000a\u000aOLAF calculated that U.K. customs\u2019 \u201ccontinuous negligence\u201d deprived the EU of \u20ac1.987 billion in lost duties on Chinese merchandise. The highly sophisticated organized crime network also stripped \u20ac3.2 billion from the value-added-tax income of major EU countries such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, the investigators said.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s response comes on the eve of Britain\u2019s third round of negotiations on its EU departure, which are due to take place next week.\u000a\u000aThe investigation concluded that British customs played a central role by repeatedly ignoring warnings from Brussels and by refusing to implement so-called \u201crisk profiles\u201d aimed at curbing the fraudulent traffic. EU investigators also accused the U.K. of having failed to open a criminal investigation into the fraud scheme. The alleged fraud is still ongoing, according to OLAF.\u000a\u000aIn an attempt to recoup some of the funds, EU investigators sent a recommendation to the European Commission\u2019s budget department that the U.K. government should be forced to pay the \u20ac2 billion directly into the EU budget \u2014 so-called own resources.\u000a\u000aFive months later the U.K. government has responded directly to the accusation. \u201cThe U.K. wishes to note that we continue to dispute OLAF\u2019s assessment of the sums allegedly owed for own resources to the Commission for customs duty that has not been accounted for,\u201d Barrow wrote to Nadia Calviño, the director general of the budget department. The letter, dated August 8, is a response to two letters from the Commission on March 24 and July 28.\u000a\u000aBarrow\u2019s letter says the \u201cU.K. is taking this matter seriously\u201d and is \u201ccontinuing to investigate,\u201d but it identifies \u201cconcerns\u201d with OLAF\u2019s calculation. It asserts that OLAF overvalued \u201cgoods identified as undervalued, thus generating an inflated customs duty liability from these imports,\u201d as well as identifying \u201cinstances of undervaluation where imports have been made by large high street traders who are importing genuinely low value goods.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s response comes on the eve of Britain\u2019s third round of negotiations on its EU departure, which are due to take place next week. The timing of the dispute is awkward because the U.K. is hoping to move the Brexit talks on to Britain\u2019s future customs relationship with the bloc. It published a position paper last week outlining its proposals, but EU diplomats say the ongoing fraud dispute has dented the U.K.\u2019s credibility on the issue.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s customs agency, Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said in a statement that it had made \u201cclear to the European Commission that we do not recognise OLAF\u2019s estimate of alleged duty loss,\u201d and that it intends to give \u201ca detailed response in due course.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201c[HMRC] has a very strong track record for tackling evasion and rule breaking of all kinds, securing a record £28.9 billion last year alone in revenue that would otherwise have gone unpaid,\u201d it added.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for the Commission\u2019s budget department declined to comment, saying the procedure is \u201congoing.\u201d A spokesperson for the British Permanent Representation in Brussels said it would not comment on leaks.\u000a\u000aOLAF\u2019s press office said the agency had \u201cconducted its investigation in a comprehensive manner, and stands by the accuracy of its methodology and the results it yielded.\u201d

aVThere was a time in U.S. history, and not so long ago, when General John \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Pershing was the most famous American alive.\u000a\u000aFeted by presidents, revered by soldiers, celebrated as a military genius by his followers and the subject of salacious gossip columnists (he was handsome, a widower\u2014and available), Pershing was a legend in his time. Large numbers of Americans would have been able to recite the Missouri farm boy\u2019s life story: A West Point graduate, Pershing was an officer in the African-American 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Indian Wars, participated in the Battle of San Juan Heights (where Teddy Roosevelt served as a Rough Rider), served as a key officer during the Moro Rebellion in the southern Philippines (from 1909 to 1913) and served a governor there, chased Pancho Villa around northern Mexico (starting in 1914), then led the American Expeditionary Force to victory in World War I.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn 1919, after Pershing returned from Europe to public acclaim, the Congress named him general of the Armies\u2014only George Washington still outranks him.\u000a\u000aIronically, Black Jack, whose fame has faded in the seven decades since his death, is still celebrated among military scholars, but not for what he did\u2014but for what he didn\u2019t : and he most certainly didn\u2019t take 50 bullets, dip them in pigs blood and execute 49 Muslims in retaliation for Islamic terrorism, as Donald Trump has repeatedly told us. Trump\u2019s claim, first aired at a February 19, 2016 campaign rally in South Carolina, cited Pershing as \u201ca rough guy\u201d\u2014a personality trait that, it seems, the president very much admires. After this week\u2019s attack in Barcelona, Trump tweeted: \u201cStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was an allusion to a fictional yarn the president told on the campaign trail. According to candidate Trump, during his time fighting the Muslim Moro tribesmen in the southern Philippines, Pershing \u201ccaught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage ... and he took the 50 terrorists and he took 50 men and dipped 50 bullets in pig\u2019s blood. You heard about that? He took 50 bullets and dipped them in pig\u2019s blood. And he had his men load up their rifles and he lined up 50 people and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said, you go back to your people and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years there wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d The fable, like all such, gets more grandiose with the telling: During a campaign rally in March 2016, Trump\u2019s initial 25 years became 42.\u000a\u000aThe story seems to have been kicking around the fever swamps of the internet for years. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing this story since 9/11,\u201d says historian Brian Linn, the author of a much-admired book on the Philippine insurrection (The Philippine War, 1899-1902), \u201cand it\u2019s no truer now than it was when I first heard it. It\u2019s almost as if people want it to be true. But when you dig into it, when you try to find specifics, you realize the story is nonsense.\u201d\u000a\u000aLinn remains unsatisfied with simply debunking a well-worn myth. It\u2019s not only that the public should be aware that their president is repeating a story about Pershing that isn\u2019t true, he argues, what is true is actually more interesting\u2014and instructive. In fact, while American soldiers occasionally responded to the Moro insurgency by burying the tribesmen they killed with dead pigs, Pershing thought the practice was, at best, a deterrent; he never adopted it as a useful policy, or instructed his subordinates to practice it. It was, as Pershing understood, going to take a lot more to convince knife-wielding Moro assassins (they called themselves juramentados), than burying them with pigs\u2014or urinating on their Qurans. For Pershing, Muslim resistance was only tangentially related to religion; what he was dealing with, he thought, were disaffect tribes fearful of losing their way of life. He\u2019d not only seen this before\u2014he empathized with it.\u000a\u000a\u201cPershing would have never described the Moro violence as terrorism,\u201d Linn says. \u201cFor him, the problem was banditry and endemic violence, which had comparatively little to do with Muslims versus Christians. This was tribal. Pershing knew the U.S. wasn\u2019t going to solve this problem with more and more American soldiers, and more and more violence. Instead, he applied the lessons he learned when dealing with native Americans on the Plains.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich is to say that, while Pershing never recoiled from using force, he adopted a military strategy that would later be reinvented as FM 3-24, the famous counterinsurgency manual written by David Petraeus and James Amos and applied in Iraq. Pershing brought down the levels of violence (which had been used liberally, and to little effect, by his predecessors), recruited Filipinos to carry out law enforcement duties, simplified the provincial court system, designated government land for the building of mosques, took a go-slow approach to changing tribal customs (which included polygamy), reformed the laws governing contract labor, put aside more money for the building of schools and established trading posts to rebuild the Moro economy. Pershing also diligently provided a personal example for his soldiers by learning the Moro dialect, getting to know local Muslim leaders and reading the Quran. In essence, he became a kind of Lawrence of the Philippines\u2014a Moro Whisperer.\u000a\u000aFor all of that, there are some things not to like about Pershing. He could be imperious, opinionated, short-tempered, stubborn and something of a martinet. In later years, senior officers would note that he seeded the U.S. military with his acolytes, which Douglas MacArthur (who disliked him, and intensely) called the \u201cPershing Mafia.\u201d He got his nickname \u201cBlack Jack\u201d while serving as a drill instructor at West Point, where the cadets resented his manner and took to calling him \u201cN----- Jack,\u201d which was later softened to \u201cBlack Jack.\u201d Additionally, like Teddy Roosevelt (who, as president, admired and promoted him), he had an unbending belief in white America\u2019s civilizing influence\u2014a kind of default position for that era. During the Plains Wars, he forcibly deported large numbers of Cree Indians from their ancestral lands to Canada and, despite his celebrated leadership of the 10th Cavalry, he readily agreed to the continued segregation of African-American soldiers from white troops during World War I.\u000a\u000aBut by the standards of his age, Pershing was fairly enlightened. When he fought the Moros at what has gone down in history as the Battle of Bud Bagsak (in June 1913), Pershing proved adept at implementing tactics that would dampen Philippine (and U.S.) casualties: He recruited local leaders to denounce the uprising, attempted to negotiate a political agreement with the rebels, then waited them out (which siphoned off their strength) before attacking. Despite this, Bud Bagsak resulted in the deaths of approximately 500 Moro tribesmen and 13 Americans. \u201cThe fighting was the fiercest I have ever seen,\u201d he later wrote. \u201cThey [the tribesmen] are absolutely fearless, and once committed to combat they count death as a mere incident.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor surprisingly, while Trump\u2019s ill-advised monologues and tweets on Pershing have focused the public on swine blood and the treatment of terrorists (including the blinkered notion that if you bury ISIS fighters with pigs, their paradise-loving co-religionists will surrender), Pershing\u2019s legacy has almost nothing to do with his service fighting Moros and everything to do with his command of U.S. troops in World War I. In 1917, when America entered the war, Woodrow Wilson named Pershing to head the U.S. forces\u2014a perfect if surprising choice, as it turned out. Pershing not only had absolute faith in America\u2019s military prowess, he had little regard for British and French commanders who\u2019d spent the previous three years sending their soldiers \u201cover the top\u201d in useless slugging matches with well-armed Germans.\u000a\u000aWhen British and French commanders insisted that U.S. troops be disbursed among European units (they had little regard for the green \u201cdoughboys,\u201d but liked the idea of using their numbers to succeed in doing what they\u2019d failed to do for three years), Pershing dug in his heels. He eschewed the constant frontal assaults preferred by his European peers and not only insisted that U.S. troops be commanded by Americans, but that the U.S. be given its own front on the allied lines\u2014where they would attack the Germans as a single American Army. The British and French finally relented, but Pershing\u2019s stubborn insistence influenced a generation of American officers who would not only fight in Europe as a part of an Allied coalition in World War II, but command them. And among the leaders of that effort were senior soldiers whom Pershing had trained\u2014including the legendary George Marshall, who revered him.\u000a\u000a\u201cPershing is a seminal figure,\u201d historian Linn says, \u201cwho\u2019s been too long forgotten. In a sense, I suppose, you might consider him a transitional figure, but that\u2019s not to diminish what he accomplished. He transformed the U.S. Army from a constabulary force sitting in forts on the frontier into a world-class military. He was also an officer of immense moral courage, and would it be a great disservice to Pershing\u2019s memory, and to the honor of the United States Army, that this malicious lie be allowed to stand without challenge.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s generals\u2014McMaster, Mattis, Kelly and Dunford\u2014almost certainly agree. While not as celebrated as later commanders like Eisenhower or Patton, Pershing holds a prominent place in U.S. military history, his visage visible in a Pentagon portrait, his tactics studied at West Point. Then too, each of Trump\u2019s generals are not only steeped in history, they understand its first and most important lesson: that to learn from it, you must first get it right.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMark Perry\u2019s book The Pentagon\u2019s Wars will be released in October. @markperrydc.\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Donald Trump\u000a\u000aHistory Dept.

aVIt was the Instagram post heard \u2018round the world, its ugly words resounding long after it was hastily deleted and disavowed. Louise Linton, the actress-turned-trophy-wife of Treasury Secretary (and foreclosure billionaire) Steven Mnuchin, achieved a trollish trifecta with a screed directed at a random Instagram user and mother of three that was tacky, mean and self-pitying all at once.\u000a\u000aThe offending post:\u000a\u000aScreenshot of Louise Linton's post and the comment she posted.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAt the speed of cyberspace, the media and Twitterverse invoked the memory of another politically toxic blonde, Marie Antoinette, the fashion-conscious queen beheaded during the French Revolution. The #hermesscarf and #valentinorockstudheels hashtags in Linton\u2019s caption and the apparently frivolous use of a taxpayer-maintained jet might have been enough to draw the comparison on their own, but her sneering response really brought the comparisons to fever pitch. The Washington Post called it \u201cLouise Linton\u2019s \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 moment.\u201d The Huffington Post agreed: \u201cSteve Mnuchin\u2019s Wife Has A \u2018Let Them Eat Cake\u2019 Moment on Instagram.\u201d Vanity Fair declared: \u201cMnuchin\u2019s Wife Goes Full Marie Antoinette In Instagram Meltdown.\u201d One Instagrammer altered the photo of Linton deplaning to depict Marie Antoinette in \u201csunnies.\u201d (It was later revealed that the \u201cForeclosure Queen\u201d had played a Marie Antoinette reenactor in her most notable screen credit, which Vogue damningly described as \u201cexactly one episode\u201d of CSI: New York.)\u000a\u000aBut I have some objections to this. I literally wrote a book on Marie Antoinette and her role as a fashion icon. And while I don\u2019t have undue sympathy for her, I can\u2019t help feeling that she\u2019s the one being maligned by these comparisons and cake references. That\u2019s right: likening Louise Linton\u2014or Ivanka or Melania\u2014to Marie Antoinette isn\u2019t fair to Marie Antoinette.\u000a\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first time the queen\u2019s ghost has returned to haunt the Trump administration. First lady Melania Trump has made several claims to the title of modern-day Marie Antoinette\u2014for example, by appearing on the cover of a magazine pretending to eat a bowl of jewels, or wearing a $51,500 coat to the G-7 summit. Ivanka Trump has also invited comparisons to the queen. There was the $10,000 Trump-branded bracelet she wore on 60 Minutes (then promoted in a press release), the Chinese sweatshops that produce her clothing line, and the infamous Memorial Day champagne popsicle recipe. \u201cIvanka Has Her \u2018Let Them Eat Cake\u2019 Moment, Recommends Champagne Popsicles to Remember Those Who Died In War,\u201d Reddit reported.\u000a\u000aIn a case of history rhyming, cake itself has played a peculiarly prominent role in Trump\u2019s presidency, from Trump touting the \u201cbeautiful piece of chocolate cake\u201d he shared with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago to Tina Fey\u2019s satirical advocacy of \u201csheetcaking\u201d as a lazy, self-indulgent alternative to political activism. Eating cake is still a powerful metaphor for performing privilege.\u000a\u000aOf course, Marie Antoinette never actually said \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Scholars believe that the quote (\u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d)\u2014which she supposedly uttered after being told that her starving peasants had no bread\u2014is likely attributable to one of her predecessors, or perhaps to the imagination of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who included the phrase in his autobiography. (Though published in 1782, Rousseau\u2019s Confessions were finished in 1770, four years before Marie Antoinette became queen.) But the legend persists precisely because it so conveniently fits our received notions of the queen\u2019s selfishness and immaturity; maybe she didn\u2019t say it, but she could have. Nero didn\u2019t really fiddle while Rome burned, either, but he was unquestionably cruel (and arguably insane).\u000a\u000aBlessed with beauty, wealth, good taste and good intentions, Marie Antoinette was also extravagant, immature and highly susceptible to flattery. But her most significant failings were entirely beyond her control. Born an archduchess of Austria, she was just 14 when she married the heir to the French throne; naturally, it was an arranged union, contracted for dynastic reasons rather than sentimental ones. Her foreign upbringing (and accent) meant that she was never fully accepted or trusted by the French; her husband\u2019s sexual dysfunction kept her from fulfilling her duty of producing a male heir until 11 years into her marriage.\u000a\u000aBy that time, her public image was already in tatters. When a con artist posed as the queen to extort money from a social-climbing cardinal in an elaborate swindle involving a diamond necklace, it was Marie Antoinette whose reputation suffered, though she was entirely innocent. Many other attacks on her fell under the banner of fake news, concocted by gutter journalists and pamphleteers. There was a cottage industry of lesbian porn featuring the queen and her ladies-in-waiting, which many readers took as fact. Further offenses were added to the list of Marie Antoinette\u2019s transgressions long after her death, in heavily fictionalized histories of the ancien régime.\u000a\u000aThough Marie Antoinette was no angel, she was not the snobbish spendthrift she\u2019s often portrayed to be. In fact, if I were to anoint a modern-day Marie Antoinette, it would be Hillary Clinton, not Louise Linton or Ivanka Trump. Like the doomed queen, Clinton on the campaign trail was perfectly well-qualified and well-meaning, but also flawed and naive. She was prone to self-inflicted damage\u2014like her snobby \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comment\u2014yet was ultimately brought down by insurmountable exterior forces, including marital baggage, fake news, perverse conspiracy theories and rampant sexism.\u000a\u000aEvery horror story needs a villain. While it\u2019s vastly reductive to blame the entire French Revolution on one person, it\u2019s human nature to seek out a scapegoat\u2014preferably a female, foreign one who wasn\u2019t very popular in the first place. Today, Marie Antoinette is remembered as an unrepentant clotheshorse; her name remains a byword for sartorial extravagance and profligacy. In truth, her wardrobe expenditures weren\u2019t all that unusual for someone in her position, and the revolution wasn\u2019t fought over fashion. Among other things, it was fought over income inequality, tax reform and government debt, of which the queen\u2019s expensive wardrobe was a highly visible reminder.\u000a\u000aWhich brings us to Louise Linton.\u000a\u000aSome fashion writers have argued that Linton\u2019s crime was her rude response to a critic, not advertising her taste for luxury goods in the first place. After all, who among us doesn\u2019t have a healthy appreciation for a #hermesscarf? But context is everything, and Linton was posting as the wife of a civil servant, taking a taxpayer-funded business trip to tour Fort Knox and discuss tax cuts for the wealthy, in one of the country\u2019s poorest states. (What was she even doing there, anyway?)\u000a\u000aThe problem here is Linton\u2019s shamelessness. The generally well-intentioned Marie Antoinette at least fudged her wardrobe accounts so it looked like she was spending less money than she was during an economic crisis. Linton didn\u2019t just dress in an all-designer outfit for the social media cameras; she covered the post with hashtags, recalling actresses and other \u201cinfluencers\u201d who are paid to promote designer labels. Furthermore, the clothes themselves were elitist clichés: Hermès scarf, Birkin bag, \u201cit\u201d shoes, head-to-toe white. And then there\u2019s the disdain: Before she wrote a word of criticism, Linton betrayed her contempt for middle-class America by making sure everyone knew who had designed her clothes and, by extension, how much they had cost. Instagram noticed: After all, Linton\u2019s tantrum was in response to one of many commenters who found her original post distasteful.\u000a\u000aWhile many of Marie Antoinette\u2019s alleged sins were spurious, today\u2019s \u201clet them eat cake\u201d moments are disturbingly credible, chronicled in real time on television and social media. History will remember that Ivanka Trump really did recommend celebrating a day of remembrance with champagne popsicles, and Louise Linton actually had the gall to tag her designer clothes before calling a stranger \u201cadorably out of touch\u201d for questioning her \u201cself-sacrifice.\u201d\u000a\u000aComparisons to Marie-Antoinette normalize this offensive behavior even as they call it out. They remind us that rich and powerful leaders\u2014even pretty, female ones\u2014have always behaved badly. Indeed, they minimize the actions of the Ivankas, Melanias and Louises of the world, because they come across as hyperbole. We all know how Marie Antoinette\u2019s story ended: in bloody revolution, prison and death by guillotine. We\u2019re not there\u2014at least not yet.\u000a\u000aIf Marie Antoinette were around today, I have no doubt she\u2019d be Instagramming her fashion choices (#bighair, #hoopskirt, #diamondnecklace) and making the occasional clueless gaffe on social media. But viciously, publicly, personally attacking a suburban mom? That takes the cake.\u000a\u000aKimberly Chrisman-Campbell is the author of Fashion Victims: Dress at the Court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.

aVPresident Trump and press secretary Sean Spicer highlighted Frederick Douglass on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a "Make America Great Again" rally in Phoenix, Arizona | Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images Trump rejects wealthy friends\u2019 pleas for help Two of Trump\u2019s wealthy confidants\u2019 dubious pleas for federal help have been rebuffed in the past month \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s apparent approval.\u000a\u000aCoal magnate Robert Murray has just joined Wall Street billionaire Carl Icahn in an exclusive club \u2014 wealthy backers of President Donald Trump who tried and failed to get lucrative concessions from his administration.\u000a\u000aMurray, CEO of Murray Energy, one of the nation\u2019s biggest and most politically active coal miners, complained in an Aug. 4 letter made public Tuesday that the Energy Department had dragged its feet on his request that it use its emergency powers to force some Rust Belt coal-fired power plants to stay open. Trump was so taken by the idea that he immediately turned to Energy Secretary Rick Perry and ordered him to do it, wrote Murray, who said he had witnessed the conversation.\u000a\u000aBut DOE said no.\u000a\u000aMurray\u2019s failure to shift the policy, and Icahn\u2019s earlier inability to convince the Environmental Protection Agency to alter its ethanol rule, raises questions about the limits of bulldog business leaders to circumvent the government\u2019s bureaucracy, even in an administration run by a sympathetic billionaire.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are two people who really don\u2019t understand how government works talking to a president who came into office not understanding how government works,\u201d said Jeff Navin, a founder of Boundary Stone Partners and former acting chief of staff at the Department of Energy under President Barack Obama. \u201cWhat they\u2019re asking for causes serious legal problems for the agencies they\u2019re asking to take these steps.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome conservatives, meanwhile, praised Trump for sticking up for market principles by refusing to grant favors to individual supporters.\u000a\u000aThe Trump administration \u201cis committed to making sound policy decisions based on market principles and the rule of law, not political favoritism,\u201d said Tom Pyle, president of the industry-funded American Energy Alliance and former head of the Trump transition team at the Energy Department. \u201cThis is welcome news for Main Street and a wake-up call for K Street.\u201d\u000a\u000aIcahn was an early Trump supporter \u2014 the two men go back decades \u2014 and though Murray started 2016 backing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, he eventually boarded the Trump train, hosting a major fundraiser in West Virginia and offering to educate Trump on coal issues. Trump\u2019s victory in November meant both had a chance to advance pet policies, especially since it seems both men have regular access to the president.\u000a\u000aYet both met with defeat.\u000a\u000aThe Energy Department rejected Murray\u2019s request that it use a special authority meant to protect the electric grid during emergencies to order FirstEnergy Solutions, part of Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy Corp., to keep open its coal-fired plants supplied by Murray\u2019s mines, even if the utility enters bankruptcy proceedings and would otherwise shut them down. Murray said that if those power plants shut down, it would force his company into bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aTrump seemed fully supportive in private meetings, Murray revealed in letters to the White House, which were first published by The Associated Press.\u000a\u000aAt one meeting with the president, Trump turned to Perry in front of Murray \u201cand said three (3) times \u2018I want this done,'\u201d the coal company owner wrote. During a subsequent meeting with Murray and FirstEnergy Corp. CEO Charles Jones, Trump told an aide to \u201c\u2018tell [National Economic Council Director Gary] Cohn to do whatever these two want him to do.'\u201d\u000a\u000aBut despite Trump\u2019s reported enthusiasm about granting Murray\u2019s unusual request, and despite Murray\u2019s assurances that other coal producers would benefit as well, the administration this week rejected it. DOE said in a short statement that \u201cthe evidence does not warrant the use of this emergency authority.\u201d\u000a\u000aA White House spokeswoman did not address whether Trump had made the promises to Murray but said the president had acted on behalf of coal miners by killing Obama-era rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhether through repealing the Clean Power Plan and the \u2018Waters of the U.S. Rule,\u2019 removing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, or signing legislation to overturn rules and policies designed to stop coal mining, President Trump continues to fight for miners every day,\u201d White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said in a statement.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, Icahn\u2019s push to change a federal biofuel program to help his oil refining company CVR Energy suffered defeat earlier in the month. The Wall Street investor for years had railed against the EPA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires gasoline refiners to blend ethanol into their fuel, and Icahn\u2019s role as an unofficial Trump adviser on regulations presented him the opening he had sought.\u000a\u000aIn the early weeks of the Trump administration, Icahn presented the White House with language for an executive order to overturn the rule, which was costing his company hundreds of millions of dollars. But Icahn\u2019s effort hit a wall of opposition from oil companies and biofuel makers, and by spring, the proposal was largely left for dead. Sources told POLITICO earlier this month that the president would not be changing the biofuel program, though EPA has yet to make the decision official.\u000a\u000aIcahn \u201ccomes in hot, his guy wins, Trump places a crown on Icahn\u2019s head, and Icahn says \u2018OK, it\u2019s corporate raider time,'\u201d said Tyson Slocum, energy director for the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \u201cHe knows hardball tactics. What Carl Icahn doesn\u2019t know is D.C.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast week, Icahn resigned his title, and in another sign that he was wrapping up his affairs in D.C., he settled a court challenge to an enforcement action brought by the Federal Railroad Administration against American Railcar Industries, another Icahn-controlled company. That final settlement largely resembles the inspection regime the agency originally imposed, an FRA spokeswoman said.\u000a\u000aOne critic said the lack of experience in the new administration appeared to open the door for both Icahn and Murray, even if neither managed to step through it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen, in this administration, at least, reports of an under-attentiveness to those procedural and institutional safeguards. That creates risk for unsound decisions to be made,\u201d said Ali Zaidi, a former Obama White House energy adviser now at the law firm Morrison & Foerster.\u000a\u000aIcahn and Murray aren\u2019t the only ones seeking special treatment.\u000a\u000aCoal billionaire-turned-West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice has proposed a federal subsidy for Appalachian coal in a plan that could net his own mines millions of dollars.\u000a\u000aJustice privately pitched Trump on a subsidy that would pay utilities $15 per ton of Appalachian coal burned, and he said in a recent interview the president was \u201creally interested\u201d in the plan, which would cost an estimated $4.5 billion a year and likely require congressional approval.\u000a\u000aBut Justice\u2019s proposal has not been received well by key circles. It\u2019s gone over \u201clike a fart in church\u201d with Western coal miners, according to Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. And Wyoming\u2019s congressional delegation \u2014 including Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, a Republican \u2014 panned the idea in a letter to Trump. Democrats, environmentalists and budget-hawk Republicans are also opposed to any coal subsidy.\u000a\u000aJustice might look to the results that Icahn and Murray got.\u000a\u000aIcahn and Murray \u201cboth became completely consumed with their own narrow self-interest, and they completely lost sight that there are a lot of stakeholders \u2014 including corporate stakeholders \u2014 that may not like their proposals,\u201d said Public Citizen\u2019s Slocum.

aVMnuchin: 'Under no circumstances was I going to resign' after Charlottesville\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that "under no circumstances" was he planning to resign after President Donald Trump\u2019s remarks that "both sides" were to blame for the violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s remarks were widely panned by politicians across the political spectrum and many accused him of equivocating between the hate groups and protesters who had gathered to object to their presence.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cI think you know I put out an extensive statement earlier last week on my view of the situation,\u201d Mnuchin, who is Jewish, said at Friday\u2019s White House news briefing. \u201cI think there's no question that the president was not equating the hate groups with people who were peacefully [protesting] and under no circumstances was I going to resign.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who is also Jewish, told the Financial Times in an interview published Friday that \u201cthis administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities.\u201d Cohn also said that \u201ccitizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK.\u201d\u000a\u000aCohn said in the interview that he had "come under enormous pressure both to resign and to remain in my current position.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said that he was reluctant to leave his job over the president\u2019s remarks \u201cbecause I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people,\u201d but he also felt \u201ccompelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a Jewish-American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting, \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAt Friday\u2019s news briefing, Mnuchin said he and Cohn were working together on tax reform, a top legislative priority of the president\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cGary and I have known each other for 20 years. I can tell you I\u2019m speaking to him every day,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cHis No. 1 focus is absolutely working on tax reform with me and getting tax reform done, and Gary is committed to be here, and I couldn't be more excited about that. \u201c\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

And on you go, up and up, and there is the bill. That is not going to happen and we are not going to play that game,\u201d said an official familiar with the U.K. negotiating position.\u000a\u000aBut despite the hard line on the bill, the official was optimistic the talks would move on to phase two in October, claiming they would be \u201cstaggered\u201d if any of the separation issues became a serious stumbling block.\u000a\u000aThat optimism does not appear to be shared in Brussels. EU diplomats briefed by a senior member of Barnier\u2019s team at an all-day meeting on Thursday told POLITICO they are \u201cincreasingly doubtful\u201d that the talks will move to the second phase of discussing trade in October.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, a research paper for Oxford Economics concluded that the chance of a successful separation and transition arrangement being agreed between Britain and the EU has fallen. And Charles Grant, the well-connected director of the Centre for European Reform, tweeted that while \u201cgreater than zero,\u201d the chances of the talks making sufficient progress by October are \u201csmall.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith the two sides determined to hold their line on the Brexit bill next week, it will be a matter of who blinks first or whether a compromise can be found.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s clear is that time in which to find a middle way is running out.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2019s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVFour fashion models\u2014all in white hardhats, two in bikinis\u2014posed in an earthmover\u2019s scoop with an ax-wielding Fred Trump while his guests at the big \u201cV.I.P. Farewell Ceremony\u201d sipped Champagne and hefted bricks.\u000a\u000aThe Trump patriarch had personally distributed the bricks and urged everyone to take a turn throwing them through an iconic smiling face that had become the symbol of Coney Island when it was America\u2019s capital of merriment.\u000a\u000aThe smiling face was painted on glass at the entrance to the Palace of Fun at Steeplechase Park, the country\u2019s original and longest running amusement park. Fred Trump had bought Steeplechase from the founder\u2019s aging daughter in 1965 for $2.5 million. He shut it down with the intention of building seaside apartment towers in its place.\u000a\u000aThe tract was not zoned for residential use, but Fred Trump figured the Brooklyn Democratic machine would be able to make that obstacle disappear. His particular pal with the machine, Abe Beame, was the favorite to become the next mayor of New York in the 1965 election.\u000a\u000aAnd being connected with the machine also meant being connected to the Mafia along with the construction industry the mob controlled. The fix was in for the towers to rise by the sea and dispel the scandals that had swirled around the Trump name.\u000a\u000aFred Trump had at one point been charged with seeking to overcharge veterans for subsidized housing. He also had been the subject of front-page allegations that he had run up millions in overcharges in a government-funded project. He had denied it all and had not been criminally charged. Now he would show them all with Trump\u2019s triumph by the sea.\u000a\u000aThen, in a big surprise, the Republican candidate, John Lindsay, won the mayoral election. Lindsay was a liberal patrician who thought zoning restrictions should actually be zoning restrictions. He seemed receptive when the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce proposed that the area be turned into a public park. This stretch of beach was, after all, where the courts had made the precedent-setting ruling that the sand between low and high tide was public domain.\u000a\u000aFred Trump feared that Lindsay\u2019s people might go so far as to designate Steeplechase\u2019s famed Pavilion of Fun and its world famous smiling face a landmark. He resolved to ensure there was nothing left to preserve. He set about ensuring that the press would not portray the maneuver as another Trump scheme.\u000a\u000aEngraved invitations went out for a V.I.P. Farewell Ceremony at noon on Wednesday, Sept. 21, 1966. Reporters and TV news crews were on hand for what was presented as the prefect sendoff to the fabled Steeplechase. Fred Trump\u2019s 20-year-old son, Donald, may have been present, though this was the middle of the week and he had just transferred from Fordham University to the tonier Wharton School and was likely in Philadelphia. The son does not appear in the photos showing the elder Trump posing with the models. Everybody was beaming as if they were sharing the spirit of the smiling face even as they smashed it.\u000a\u000aAfter the guests departed and the models stepped down from the scoop, the earthmover proceeded to level Steeplechase Park, leaving only the pier and the famous parachute jump, which was by the boardwalk and did not interfere with Fred Trump\u2019s plans. The destruction of the parachute jump would no doubt have caused more trouble than it was worth.\u000a\u000aFred Trump was still unable to secure a variance, and the towers were never built. He finally sold the tract to the city for $3.7 million. He walked away with a $1.2 million profit, but the vacant sky over the site remained a testament to what the Trump name could not achieve without political connections.\u000a\u000aAfter eight long years, Lindsay was on the way out and Beame was mounting another run for mayor. But the seemingly prohibitive favorite to replace Lindsay was Mario Biaggi, a retired, highly decorated NYPD lieutenant who had gone on to serve in the U.S. Congress. Biaggi remained a puppet of the Queens Democratic boss, Matty Troy, who reportedly vowed to cut out the Brooklyn Democratic machine\u2014and therefore Trump\u2014once he gained control of City Hall.\u000a\u000aGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\u000a\u000aSome years before, Biaggi had been a crucial defense witness for Roy Cohn, a lawyer and fixer extraordinaire who was on trial for extortion. Biaggi had proven his loyalty to Cohn, and he must have figured that it would be reciprocated when he sought the lawyer\u2019s advice about an upcoming grand jury appearance. Cohn advised Biaggi not to take the Fifth Amendment. Biaggi afterward reported to Cohn that he had done so anyway at least 30 times with the belief that the proceeding would remain secret.\u000a\u000aCohn is said to have promptly called Meade Esposito, boss of the Brooklyn machine. The New York Times soon after ran a front-page article reporting that Biaggi had taken the Fifth Amendment at least 30 times. Biaggi was finished. Beame became the next mayor.\u000a\u000aOn top of having his pal Beame in City Hall and Roy Cohn as his lawyer, Fred Trump also had very close ties to the new governor, a son of Brooklyn named Hugh Carey. Fred Trump set out to prove what the Trump name could do with political connections.\u000a\u000aFred Trump arranged for beyond favorable financing and an unprecedented tax abatement that enabled his son Donald to transform the Commodore Hotel in Manhattan into the glitzy Grand Hyatt. The younger Trump was actually telling the truth when he later denied getting a $200 million inheritance from his father. Donald Trump in fact got his start through his father\u2019s connections and with his father\u2019s continued backing. Some believe that The Donald was for years essentially a Fred front man.\u000a\u000aThat might help explain why the son would become so self-obsessed, so insistent on celebrating his own magnificence.\u000a\u000aEven connections such as Fred Trump\u2019s were tested when he and his son then contrived to secure a huge tax abatement for what would be the ultra-luxury Trump Tower. The situation was complicated by static between Donald Trump and Beame\u2019s successor as mayor, Ed Koch. The Trumps still managed to pull it off with the help of Cohn and Stanley Friedman, a one-time deputy mayor and current Bronx Democratic boss who would later go to prison for corruption.\u000a\u000aThe site of the tower-to-be was occupied by the Bonwit Teller department store, whose façade featured a trademark limestone bas-relief. Donald Trump\u2014who was officially in charge but seemed afraid of his father and did his bidding\u2014pledged to preserve the sculpture and donate it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u000a\u000aNo engraved invitations went out for the start of this demolition. No Champagne was served, and the hard hat-wearing figures were not models in bikinis smiling for the press but a group of illegal immigrants from Poland nicknamed \u201cthe Polish army.\u201d They had already set to work and smashed the artwork before anybody noticed.\u000a\u000aFred Trump was ever present during the ensuing construction, arriving in a brown limousine that matched his hair dye. The son chose such things as the marble for the lobby (the most expensive) and for the apartments above (the cheapest), but dad decided such things as which concrete company to use.\u000a\u000aThe grand opening of Trump Tower was held on Valentine\u2019s Day, 1983. The gleaming structure on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue far outshone what Fred Trump had hoped to build on Brooklyn\u2019s Surf Avenue.\u000a\u000aThe parachute jump in Coney Island still stands, a surviving presence in the absence that is a monument to what the Trump name cannot do when things are legit. The Trump-less sky was bright blue this past weekend.\u000a\u000aA chunk of the old Steeplechase site remains a vacant lot these 50 years later and is used for parking and storage by the Paul Bunyon Tree Service. The rest is occupied by the new Thunderbolt roller coaster and by a minor league baseball park.\u000a\u000aA banner hanging from the fence outside the Thunderbolt depicts three figures in a roller coaster. The middle one has a variation on the iconic smiling face before it was destroyed at Fred Trump\u2019s demolition party a half-century ago.\u000a\u000aOpening Day for the 2016 season at the home of the Brooklyn Cyclones is weeks away, but passers-by were pausing to gaze upon the two bronze figures out front. The statues depict Brooklyn Dodger Pee Wee Reese standing with his hand on the shoulder of his teammate Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. The inscription reads:\u000a\u000a\u201cIn 1947, on Cincinnati\u2019s Crosley Field, Robinson endured racist taunts, jeers and death threats that would have broken the spirit of a lesser man. Reese, captain of the Brooklyn Dodgers, walked over to his teammate Robinson and stood by his side, silencing the taunts of the crowd. The simple gesture challenged prejudice and created a powerful and enduring friendship.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo look at the two figures is to be reminded that real American greatness lies not in erecting towers but in becoming a bridge, reaching across what divides us to make us truly one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u000a\u000aBy that same measure, anybody who divides us makes America less great, no matter how grand a tower he and his father were able to build thanks to government subsidies and tax breaks once they got the political juice.\u000a\u000aThe statues and the message remain, no matter who wins what primaries.

aVTheodore A. Postol Markus Schiller Robert Schmucker\u000a\u000aRobert Schmucker has more than five decades of experience researching rocketry, missiles, and astronautics. In the 1990s, he was a weapons inspector for the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) in Iraq...\u000a\u000aOn July 3, 2017, while Americans were preparing for the 241st celebration of the Declaration of Independence, a lone rocket rose from North Korea on a near-vertical trajectory. After five to six minutes of powered flight, the second stage of the missile shut down and coasted to an altitude of about 2,720 kilometers. It then fell back to Earth, reentering the atmosphere above the Sea of Japan some 900 kilometers to the east of where it had launched. The rocket\u2019s upper stage coasted in freefall for about 32 minutes, and the overall time-of-flight, from launch to atmospheric reentry, was about 37 minutes. The launch occurred at 8:39 p.m., United States\u2019 Eastern time. Within hours, the news of the launch was trumpeted by the US mainstream press: North Korea had flown an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a missile that could carry nuclear warheads to Anchorage, Alaska, and to the continental United States as well!\u000a\u000aBut the Western press apparently did not know one crucial fact: The rocket carried a reduced payload and, therefore, was able to reach a much higher altitude than would have been possible if it had instead carried the weight associated with the type of first-generation atomic bomb North Korea might possess. Experts quoted by the press apparently assumed that the rocket had carried a payload large enough to simulate the weight of such an atomic bomb, in the process incorrectly assigning a near-ICBM status to a rocket that was in reality far less capable.\u000a\u000aOnly three and a half weeks later, on July 28, there was a second launch of the same type of missile, this time at night, Korean time. The rocket flew approximately the same powered flight trajectory that it had on July 3 (or July 4 in North Korea), this time, however, reaching a higher altitude\u2014a reported 3,725 kilometers. This longer flight path led to yet more unwarranted conclusions that the continental United States was now directly under threat of nuclear attack by North Korea. Actually, however, in this second case, by our calculations, the second stage of the so-called ICBM carried an even smaller payload and tumbled into the atmosphere at night over the Sea of Japan. The spectacular night-reentry of the rocket\u2014what was almost certainly the heavy front-end of the nearly empty upper stage\u2014created an impressive meteoric display that some experts mistook for the breakup of a failed warhead reentry vehicle.\u000a\u000aFrom the point of view of North Korean political leadership, the general reaction to the July 4 and July 28 launches could not have been better. The world suddenly believed that the North Koreans had an ICBM that could reach the West Coast of the United States and beyond. But calculations we have made\u2014based on detailed study of the type and size of the rocket motors used, the flight times of the stages of the rockets, the propellant likely used, and other technical factors\u2014indicate that these rockets actually carried very small payloads that were nowhere near the weight of a nuclear warhead of the type North Korea could have, or could eventually have. These small payloads allowed the rockets to be lofted to far higher altitudes than they would have if loaded with a much-heavier warhead, creating the impression that North Korea was on the cusp of achieving ICBM capability.\u000a\u000aIn reality, the North Korean rocket fired twice last month\u2014the Hwasong-14\u2014is a \u201csub-level\u201d ICBM that will not be able to deliver nuclear warheads to the continental United States. Our analysis shows that the current variant of the Hwasong-14 may not even be capable of delivering a first-generation nuclear warhead to Anchorage, Alaska, although such a possibility cannot be categorically ruled out. But even if North Korea is now capable of fabricating a relatively light-weight, \u201cminiaturized\u201d atomic bomb that can survive the extreme reentry environments of long-range rocket delivery, it will, with certainty, not be able to deliver such an atomic bomb to the lower 48 states of the United States with the rocket tested on July 3 and July 28.\u000a\u000aFirst, the bottom line. In each of the two North Korean tests in July, the rockets were fired on a trajectory that sent them to high altitudes; on these trajectories, the rockets travelled relatively short horizontal distances. But after the tests, analysts projected the maximum range the rockets could have traveled by assuming that they could have been placed on trajectories that would result in a maximum achievable range, rather than a maximum achievable altitude. For example, the 2,720-kilometer altitude achieved by the July 3 rocket was determined by its burnout speed. If it is assumed that the rocket could achieve roughly the same burnout speed on a trajectory that is shaped for maximum range, it would be sufficient to carry the payload to Anchorage, Alaska.\u000a\u000aIn the case of the July 28 test, the same rocket achieved a higher burnout speed and a higher altitude\u2014about 3,725 kilometers. If it were again assumed that the rocket\u2019s trajectory is shaped for maximum range instead of maximum altitude, the new higher burnout speed would be able to carry the payload to Seattle, Washington.\u000a\u000aFigure 1 below shows the trajectories flown on July 4 and July 28 that were misinterpreted as tests of a North Korean rocket capable of delivering atomic bombs to the continental United States.\u000a\u000aBulletin-Hwasong-Article-Figure-1.jpg\u000a\u000aFigure 1. The highly lofted rocket trajectories for the burnout speeds achieved in the July 4 and the July 28 tests are shown on the left side of the figure. The center and right side of the figure show alternative rocket trajectories that could instead have been flown with loft angles optimized for maximum range instead of for maximum altitude.\u000a\u000aOne question is not answered by this basic kinematic study of the July 4 and July 28 tests: How did the rocket achieve its burnout speed? That\u2019s to say, what kind of rocket motors did it need to achieve the resulting burnout speed, what was the rocket\u2019s launch weight, and most, important, what was the payload-weight carried by the rocket?\u000a\u000aFigure 2 shows a summary of our estimates of the range versus the weight of atomic bomb that might be carried by a Hwasong-14 missile, derived from our technical analysis of the Hwasong-14\u2019s weight and propulsive capabilities and the likely weight of a North Korean nuclear warhead.\u000a\u000aBulletin-Hwasong-Article-Figure-2.jpg\u000a\u000aFigure 2.\u000a\u000aThe analysis results summarized in the graph are for two different \u201cdesigns\u201d of the Hwasong-14.\u000a\u000aThe first design uses published information about the powered flight time of the second stages of the rockets and is reflected by the red curves in Figure 2. Those two curves correspond to reported second-stage flight times of 224 and 233 seconds for the two rocket tests. We have received two independent confirmations of these published flight times from sources that we believe to be reliable. As those curves show, if the North Koreans have achieved the capability of creating a missile warhead as light-weight as those used by the Chinese and Pakistani militaries\u2014no small feat for a country with means as limited as North Korea\u2019s\u2014the two missiles fired in July could carry that missile roughly 6,000 kilometers, approximately the distance to Anchorage, Alaska. The missiles simply could not carry such a warhead to the lower 48 states.\u000a\u000aThe second design\u2014reflected by the blue curves in Figure 2\u2014assumes that the North Koreans actually use more efficient rocket motors than are indicated by the information published in major media about the powered flight trajectory of the second upper stage. In this second design, we assumed that the rocket\u2019s upper stage would be powered by rocket motors similar to those with characteristics demonstrated in the top stages of the North Korean Unha-3 and the Iranian Safir Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). We believe North Korea is capable of building such a variant of the Hwasong-14, and that variant could have the capability to deliver a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska, and slightly beyond.\u000a\u000aBut neither variant of the Hwasong-14 we have studied could carry a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb to any part of the continental United States beyond Alaska.\u000a\u000aAtomic bomb weights\u2014without the hype. At this time, no one outside of North Korea has solid information about the characteristics of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons designs\u2014especially about whether or not the weapons that have been tested are cumbersome laboratory devices or readily militarized designs that could be put into bombs or carried on ballistic missiles. This information is simply not available at this time.\u000a\u000aWe are therefore left to speculate based on intelligence information that we have from other sources and on an understanding of the very significant technical problems of design and implementation that must be solved to be able to build and deliver atomic bombs by ICBM.\u000a\u000aThere is general information about an atomic bomb design that was obtained by Pakistan from China, and by Libya from Pakistan. A.Q. Khan, a Pakistani known to have trafficked equipment and information that would facilitate the building of atomic bombs, is reported to have sold that design to Libya. Khan is known to have sold uranium enrichment gas-centrifuge technology to North Korea; it is very likely he also shared atomic bomb design information similar to what he sold Libya.\u000a\u000aIt is reported that the bomb design Khan sold to Libya and possibly to North Korea would produce a warhead that weighed about 500 kilograms and yielded about 10 kilotons, if properly implemented. All of the original design information from China was for devices that were aimed at assembling uranium 235 cores. This information could have been modified and used by North Korea to implement similar implosion devices to instead assemble plutonium 239 cores. However, these devices would have had to be developed and modified from the original designs.\u000a\u000aThis information is consistent with the seismic data from Pakistan\u2019s nuclear tests in 1998, which suggest that the yield of atomic bombs tested by Pakistan is between 10 and 15 kilotons. It is also consistent with the seismic data from North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests, which indicate maximum explosive yields of perhaps 10 to 20 kilotons.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has publicly displayed what it claims to be a standardized atomic bomb that dimensional analysis indicates could weigh as little as 400 kilograms. The device displayed by North Korea is clearly a spherical implosion design\u2014seemingly based on the same design concept that Khan sold to Libya and used by Pakistan. (If North Korea had instead sought to impress the outside world by displaying an atomic bomb that was shaped somewhat like an egg, it could have indicated an entirely different and far more advanced design.) But the payload of a missile consists of more than a warhead. Because of the extreme environments created by long-range missile reentry to the atmosphere\u2014including temperatures in the thousands of degrees and high deceleration forces\u2014we have assumed that 25 percent of the payload-weight of these North Korean rockets would have to be given over to a heat shield and the structure needed to hold an atomic bomb in place during deceleration. This is an intentional underestimate of the weight of the warhead assembly, to make our assessment of the Hwasong-14\u2019s capabilities as favorable to North Korean capabilities as possible.\u000a\u000aIn this extremely conservative estimate, and as a result of a review of the very sketchy information about nuclear weapons design information that has leaked from China to Pakistan and beyond, we think that a reasonable guess for the minimum weight of an advanced first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb that is able to survive the extreme environments associated with ICBM delivery could be as low as 500 to 600 kilograms.\u000a\u000aIn our view, the engineering challenges of implementing a nuclear weapon are substantial and highly dependent on material resources, national experience, and the skill and depth of knowledge of scientists, engineers, and technicians involved at every level of the enterprise. As such, it cannot be ruled out that a North Korean weaponized device could weigh considerably more than 600 kilograms or less than 500 kilograms, but we believe it is overwhelmingly likely that it would not weigh less than 500.\u000a\u000aOur estimates show that the Hwasong-14, using the publicly reported burn times for the upper rocket stage, could deliver a nuclear warhead only as far as Anchorage, Alaska if the warhead weighed 500 kilograms to 550 kilograms. To reach Seattle, the warhead would have to be substantially smaller, weighing no more than 300 kilos. We believe that an advanced North Korean weaponized atomic bomb would be unlikely to weigh less than 500 to 600 kilograms. So it is entirely possible that this variant of the Hwasong-14 will not be able to deliver an atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska.\u000a\u000aIf the upper stage of the Hwasong-14 were instead fitted with the more capable vernier motors from the SS-N-6 submarine launched ballistic missile (known in Russia as the R-27), it could potentially deliver an atomic bomb to Anchorage, if the bomb weighed less than between 650 and 750 kg. The same upgraded variant of the Hwasong-14 could only deliver an atomic bomb to Seattle if the bomb weighed less than between 400 and 450 kg.\u000a\u000aSince it is extremely unlikely that a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb would weigh substantially less than 500 kilograms, we conclude that neither variant of the Hwasong-14 missile could deliver a first-generation North Korean atomic bomb to the continental United States.\u000a\u000aWe emphasize at this point that advances in rocketry demonstrated by North Korea in the Hwasong-14 are significant, and although the Hwasong-14 is not an immediate threat to the continental United States, variants that are almost certainly now under development, but probably years away from completion, will eventually become missiles with sufficient payloads to deliver atomic bombs to the continental United States.\u000a\u000aPerformance assessment of the Hwasong-14. Like any missile system, the actual lifting and range capability of the Hwasong-14 depends on many technical details. Among these are the type of fuel burned by the missile, the efficiency of its rocket motors, the total amount of propellant carried in each stage, the weight of the missile\u2019s airframe, and the weight of different components, including rocket motors, plumbing, guidance and control systems, and the like.\u000a\u000aIn the case of the Hwasong-14, almost all of the critical parameters that ultimately determine the rocket\u2019s ability to carry a payload-weight to a given range can be deduced from photographs, videos of its initial powered flight, engineering knowledge of rocket systems, and specific other engineering information that can be determined by other observations of the missile and its motor components.\u000a\u000aFor example, the performance characteristics of the main rocket motor that powers the first stage are well known. This is in part because the rocket motor has been unambiguously identified as derived from components of a well-known family of Russian rocket motors. The type of propellant used by this family of motors is also known\u2014unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), a highly energetic propellant combination used extensively in Russian rocket systems.\u000a\u000aThe dimensions of the Hwasong-14 are readily determined from photographs of the missile and its length, as measured relative to the known length of the Chinese-made vehicle that carries it. Since the density of the propellant is known, and the dimensions of the rocket stages and the functions of the different sections of the rocket stages are easily identified, very good estimates of the weights of the stages, airframes and rocket motors can be deduced from simple volumetric analysis and knowledge of design features. Although many of the refined details of the rocket may not be known, the general information of the type described above provides quite good estimates of how well the rocket will perform.\u000a\u000aThese data lead to an overall weight estimate of roughly 37 metric tons for the Hwasong-14. The known characteristics of the main first-stage rocket motor, and the observed rate of acceleration of the rocket at launch, result in a highly constrained check on the missile model we created to estimate its overall range and payload performance.\u000a\u000aOne critical parameter of the Hwasong-14 is not yet known with certainty: the exact powered flight time of the second stage. This parameter is an important factor in determining the overall performance of the Hwasong-14, due to a phenomenon known among rocket engineers as \u201cgravitational losses\u201d during powered flight. To perhaps oversimplify the physics involved, the longer the rocket motor burns against the gravitational pull of the Earth, the less efficiently it accelerates its payload to a final speed. But two articles in The Diplomat magazine have included flight times for the second stages of the rockets that North Korea launched in July. Two independent sources have confirmed those times to us as accurate.\u000a\u000aFigure 3 shows photographs extracted from North Korean videos of the launches of the Hwasong-14 missile during the morning of July 4 (in North Korea; the evening of July 3 in the United States) and during the night-launch on July 28. Careful examination shows that the first stage of the Hwasong-14 is powered by a large single rocket motor supported by 4 small \u201cvernier\u201d motors that are used to change the direction of the rocket during powered flight and to maintain its vertical stability during its initial lift-off and vertical acceleration. North Korea has also released videos of tests of the Hwasong-14 rocket motor (shown firing on a test stand in Figure 4).\u000a\u000aBulletin-Hwasong-Article-Figure-3A.jpg\u000a\u000aFigure 3.\u000a\u000aWe have identified this rocket motor as a being derived from a family of Russian rocket motors known as the RD-250 or RD-251. The original motors used six thrust chambers fed by three turbo pumps to together generate roughly about 240 tons (about 530,000 pounds) of lift.\u000a\u000aThe North Koreans probably obtained this motor and many others as part of a vast shipment of rocket components to North Korea that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the simultaneous disintegration of the national economy and political system of the Soviet Union. Until recently, almost all of the liquid-propellant motors seen in North Korea\u2019s rockets could be traced back to the Makayev Institute, a vast and highly capable organization that was responsible for the design of all types of Soviet ballistic missiles. Because of the prominent role of Makayev in Soviet ballistic missile production, this institute would have had large numbers of rocket motors in storage that were used to build various models of SCUDs and the SS-N-6 submarine-launched ballistic missile (aka R-27) used on Russian Yankee class submarines.\u000a\u000aThe newest Russian rocket motor we have identified in the North Korean arsenal, derived from the RD-250/251 and used in the Hwasong-14, is not from the Makayev Institute, but from an entirely different major rocket motor manufacturer, NPO Energomash, which supported the OKB-456 Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. This rocket motor was associated with rocket and space launch vehicles produced in Ukraine. The presence of RD-250/251 rocket components in a new North Korean rocket raises new and potentially ominous questions about the variety and extent to which Soviet rocket motors might have been obtained by North Korea during the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aBulletin-Hwasong-Article-Figure-4.jpg\u000a\u000aFigure 4.\u000a\u000aThe adaptation that North Korean engineers have worked, using components from the powerful RD 250/251 rocket motor, can be appreciated by examining Figure 5. The original RD 250/251 was a rocket motor that consisted of six thrust chambers, driven by three powerful turbo pumps. This rocket engine can be seen in the image on the left in figure 5.\u000a\u000aEach of the three turbo pumps in the original rocket engine was nested between two thrust chambers, at a height below the combustion chamber and above the gas exhaust nozzle of each thrust chamber. This clever design made it possible to shorten the length of the rocket motor compartment and to reduce the overall length of the first stage of a rocket.\u000a\u000aThe image on the right in figure 5 is an enlargement taken from Figure 4, a photo of the Hwasong-14 rocket motor firing on a test stand. The outline of the motor\u2019s thrust chamber is shown in a silhouette overlay and the location of the turbopump next to the single thrust chamber is shown to be exactly at the height of the turbopump in the RD 250/251 motor complex. It is clear that the final rocket motor mounted in the Hwasong-14 has this single powerful turbopump feeding propellant to both the main rocket motor and the four smaller vernier motors used to control the direction of the missile.\u000a\u000aThe design indicates a well-thought-out approach to a completely new missile that was not seen in public until the launch of the Hwasong-12, which was essentially a test aimed at proving the functionality of the first stage of the two-stage Hwasong-14. It is a remarkable achievement in itself that North Korea has been able to master the use of these components well enough to be able to adapt them to their special purposes.\u000a\u000aWe have determined that the approximate properties of the Hwasong-14 missile, with a second stage upgraded with more capable vernier motors from the Russian R-27 missile, will be as follows:\u000a\u000apostol-chart final.jpg\u000a\u000aBulletin-Hwasong-Article-Figure-5.jpg\u000a\u000aFigure 5.\u000a\u000aGeneral conclusions\u2014for now. Our general conclusions from intensive study of a wide variety of data relating to the two rockets that North Korea launched in July:\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-14 does not currently constitute a nuclear threat to the lower 48 states of the United States.\u000a\u000aThe flight tests on July 4 and 28 were a carefully choreographed deception by North Korea to create a false impression that the Hwasong-14 is a near-ICBM that poses a nuclear threat to the continental US.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-14 tested on July 4 and 28 may not even be able to deliver a North Korean atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska.\u000a\u000aAlthough it is clear that North Korea is not capable of manufacturing sophisticated rocket components, their skill and ingenuity in using Soviet rocket motor components has grown very substantially. This is not good news for the long run.\u000a\u000aIt is time for the United States to get serious about diplomacy and appropriate defensive preparations (see sidebar, \u201cComments on the developing situation with North Korea\u201d) to constructively support those diplomatic efforts.

aVU.S. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up to supporters at the Phoenix Convention Center during a rally on August 22, 2017 in Phoenix | Ralph Freso/Getty Images Poll: Trump hits new low after Charlottesville Only 39 percent of voters approve of the job Trump is doing in this week\u2019s poll.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has hit a new low following a week in which a majority of voters believe he did more to divide the country than unite it, a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows.\u000a\u000aOnly 39 percent of voters approve of the job Trump is doing in this week\u2019s poll \u2014 conducted entirely following the president\u2019s various scripted and impromptu reactions to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 down from 44 percent just a week ago. Fifty-six percent of voters disapprove in the new poll, up from 52 percent last week.\u000a\u000aMuch of the decline in Trump\u2019s approval rating appears to have come from self-identified Republican voters \u2014 73 percent, down from 81 percent last week. By contrast, the president\u2019s approval rating slid just a single point among Democrats and independents.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s previous overall low \u2014 a 40 percent rating \u2014 was two weeks ago.\u000a\u000aThe poll was conducted last Thursday through Saturday, all following Trump\u2019s comments on the violence that claimed the life of a woman protesting against white supremacists and neo-Nazis, but before his address Monday night outlining his strategy for the war in Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aWith the poll going into the field five days after the violence in Charlottesville, 52 percent of voters say they have heard a lot about the events there, and half say they have heard a lot about Trump\u2019s responses.\u000a\u000aDespite the slide in the president\u2019s approval rating, much of the reaction to the events in Charlottesville and his responses tracks closely with views of the president\u2019s job performance. A 43 percent plurality of voters blame the white nationalist protesters most for the violence, but nearly as many, 36 percent, say both the white nationalists and the counterprotesters are equally to blame. Nine percent blame the counterprotesters most.\u000a\u000aAmong those who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, only 15 percent assign more blame to the white nationalists. Fifty-six percent of voters who approve of Trump\u2019s job performance blame both groups equally, and another 15 percent blame the counterprotesters.\u000a\u000aAmong those who disapprove of Trump, however, 65 percent assign more blame to the white nationalists.\u000a\u000aMore respondents think Trump\u2019s reaction to the events \u2014 condemning hate groups but also citing good and bad people on both sides of the protests \u2014 was inappropriate than those who think it was appropriate. But it\u2019s not overwhelming: 37 percent of voters call Trump\u2019s reaction appropriate, compared with 46 percent who say it was inappropriate.\u000a\u000aAt a minimum, however, Charlottesville was a missed opportunity for Trump, said Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult\u2019s co-founder and chief research officer. Fifty-three percent of voters say Trump\u2019s reaction did more to divide the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cResponding to national tragedies often provides presidents ground to rise above politics and demonstrate leadership,\u201d Dropp said. \u201cIn his remarks on Charlottesville, President Trump missed that opportunity to appeal to constituencies who don\u2019t already side with him, according to our polling. A large majority of Democrats, 71 percent, found his reaction to be inappropriate. And just 16 percent of voters overall say that his response was unifying.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump is at the lowest point of his presidency, but the poll also shows \u2014 on some measures \u2014 that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence. Fifty-one percent of voters say Trump is not a strong leader. Fifty-three percent say he is not moral. Fifty-five percent say he isn\u2019t stable. Fifty-eight percent of voters call him reckless. Fifty-two percent say he isn\u2019t honest. Fifty-two percent say Trump doesn\u2019t care about people like them. Fifty-six percent say he can\u2019t unite the country.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s standing isn\u2019t much better on other questions. Only 41 percent say he is knowledgeable, compared with 47 percent who say he isn\u2019t. Just 35 percent say he keeps his promises; 49 percent say he doesn\u2019t. Forty-one percent say he is capable, but 48 percent say he isn\u2019t.\u000a\u000aOn Trump\u2019s political future, only 26 percent of voters say they think he will win reelection. A narrow majority, 51 percent, say he won\u2019t. The remaining 23 percent have no opinion.\u000a\u000aTrump opponents are fairly confident in his ouster: 79 percent of those who disapprove of his job performance say he won\u2019t be reelected. By comparison, 58 percent of Trump approvers think he\u2019ll win reelection \u2014 though 79 percent of those who strongly approve of Trump think he\u2019ll capture a second term.\u000a\u000aAsked whom they would rather see as president, voters overall pick Vice President Mike Pence over Trump, 34 percent to 30 percent \u2014 with a 35 percent plurality undecided. But a majority of Republican voters, 58 percent, would rather have Trump as president, compared with 28 percent who picked Pence.\u000a\u000aThe poll surveyed 1,987 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\u000a\u000aMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\u000a\u000aMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents \u2014 Toplines here | Crosstabs here

aV\u201cWhat would you do if we asked you to write something that wasn\u2019t true?\u201d\u000a\u000aI was sitting in a 10th-floor conference room in the K Street offices of \u201cRIA Global,\u201d otherwise known as the Washington, D.C., bureau of the Russian-owned Sputnik News Service, where I\u2019d come for a job interview. It was in mid-December, just over a month after Donald Trump\u2019s upset election victory, and I\u2019d applied to the company looking to escape from what I like to call \u201cfreelance hell,\u201d a period in my life during which I never knew where my next paycheck would come from or whether it would be enough to keep me going.\u000a\u000aThe question took me by surprise. Sure, I knew Sputnik was state-owned and had a reputation for sometimes playing fast and loose with facts, but was my interviewer probing my willingness to lie or did he want to know whether I possessed the honest-to-goodness ethics that are prized at most news agencies?\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019d quit,\u201d I replied.\u000a\u000aI then explained that I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with working for a state-sponsored news organization \u2014 even a Russian one \u2014 so long as I had the editorial independence I\u2019d have at any journalism organization, since there are many state-sponsored news organizations, including the BBC, Voice of America, Agence France-Presse and Al-Jazeera, that all do excellent work.\u000a\u000aThe Russians were the ones who were unquestionably in charge, and they had their own agenda, which didn\u2019t always include the whole truth.\u000a\u000aMy interlocutor, a tall man with a thick accent named Peter Martinichev, replied that Sputnik was no different from those agencies, and, seemingly satisfied with my answer, later told me I\u2019d been hired to be Sputnik\u2019s first White House correspondent.\u000a\u000aBut when I walked out of the office five months later \u2014 termination letter in hand \u2014 I thought back to that moment, and given my answer, wondered why he\u2019d hired me in the first place.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aFrom the first day that I took a seat in Sputnik\u2019s newsroom in January, something seemed a little off. For a place that billed itself as a major international wire service and news agency, there didn\u2019t seem to be much experience at the top.\u000a\u000aMost people associate Sputnik with its SputnikNews.com website, which is incendiary and outrageous enough that Foreign Policy bestowed Sputnik with the nickname \u201cThe BuzzFeed of Propaganda.\u201d But most of Sputnik\u2019s original reporting is done by the reporters of Sputnik Newswires \u2014 a more sedate arm of the company that has its roots in the once well-regarded RIA Novosti news agency. Most wire content is hidden behind a paywall, reserved for an unknown number of subscribers, but when a wire story is important enough, it will make its way to Sputnik\u2019s website.\u000a\u000aAs one of the reporters for Sputnik\u2019s wire service, I reported to a triumvirate of editors: Martinichev (who\u2019d interviewed and hired me), Anastasia Sheveleva and Zlatko Kovach. Martinichev and Sheveleva were Russian, and neither appeared to be any older than my (then) 34 years. Nor did either of them seem to know much about how journalism works in the U.S., since they found standard practices \u2014 like keeping the names of sources I was meeting with secret from them or using company resources to expense meals or drinks to facilitate the meetings with those sources \u2014 to be outrageous.\u000a\u000aKovach, who is Macedonian by birth but also a naturalized U.S. citizen, wasn\u2019t even a journalist, having spent his career working for General Dynamics, which was contracted to run the Southeast European Times, a multilingual website that targeted the Balkans by pushing back against propaganda efforts from Russia and other countries. After funding for that program lapsed, Kovach \u2014 who says he speaks six languages fluently \u2014 switched sides in the propaganda war.\u000a\u000aAnd while other co-workers (including an American or two) would copy edit my stories, the Russians (and Kovach) were the ones who were unquestionably in charge, and they had their own agenda, which didn\u2019t always include the whole truth.\u000a\u000aI began to realize that Sputnik\u2019s mission wasn\u2019t really to report the news as much as it was to push a narrative that would either sow doubts about situations that weren\u2019t flattering to Russia or its allies.\u000a\u000aThis became evident after I first began to get called on by then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. One of the first times I asked a question on camera was on a Friday in early March 2017, when I inquired about why Trump was refusing to use the funding and authority granted him by Congress to send weapons to Ukraine to assist in that country\u2019s fight against Russian aggression.\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t know it then, but I\u2019d broken one of the biggest unwritten rules of how things are done at Sputnik.\u000a\u000aIn practice, Sputnik\u2019s mission statement \u2014 \u201cTelling the Untold\u201d \u2014 means that Sputnik\u2019s content should reflect the Russian side of any news story, whether it lines up with reality or not. When it came to the issue of Crimea (which has been occupied by Russian-backed troops since 2014), we were never to write anything on the subject that didn\u2019t include language noting that 90 percent of Crimea residents voted in a referendum to rejoin Russia. Of course, when I\u2019d include details of the tanks and armed men that lined the streets while the people of Crimea voted in that referendum, it would be removed from the story before it went live.\u000a\u000aWhen asking about Ukraine, I\u2019d based the premise of my question on the reality of the situation, and the pushback, as I interpreted it, was swift.\u000a\u000aOn Monday \u2014 our next day back in the office \u2014 I received an email from Martinichev ordering me to clear any future questions I intended to ask at the White House with my editors, \u201cso that everyone is on the same page.\u201d That is, he instructed me, if my editors didn\u2019t have a specific question they wanted me to ask. My question \u201cshould never be a surprise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe also need emergency questions in case [somebody] asks the same before us.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo every morning I\u2019d submit my questions via email, and his reply would almost always dismiss them in favor of his own replacement questions on other topics, with no regard to whether they were based on reality or not.\u000a\u000aFor example, about two weeks after the April sarin gas attack in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, and a week after Trump bombed a Syrian airfield in response, I emailed Martinichev two planned questions, about Syrian peace talks and government policy toward the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. In response, he referred me to an article on the website of RT, the Russian-owned cable news channel, which, like Sputnik, is controlled by the Russian government. The article talked about an emeritus professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who, based on some photographs he\u2019d seen, had somehow come up with the idea that the attack was carried out by Syrian rebels, not the government of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. (At that point the U.S. government had concluded not only that the Assad regime was responsible for the attack but also that the Syrian regime and Russia had attempted to cover up that fact.) Martinichev also pointed to a report that the Islamic State terror group had exploded an old mustard-gas shell near an Iraqi army base outside of Mosul \u2014 seemingly contradicting the U.S. government line that no one but the Syrian regime had the technology to pull off the Sarin gas attack. (He was, of course, ignoring the fact that the mustard-gas shell was probably older than I was and had caused no casualties, whereas the highly effective sarin had been dropped by an airplane.)\u000a\u000aSitting in the televised daily White House press briefing that day, I was ordered to ask Spicer whether the White House or U.S. intelligence community planned to review \u201calternate versions and new data\u201d about the attack in response to the professor\u2019s findings and the news of the ISIS attack.\u000a\u000aI was regularly accused on social media of spreading propaganda; some people even accused me of treason.\u000a\u000aHistory will note that I didn\u2019t raise my hand very high for either question that day. But I did follow up with Sarah Huckabee Sanders in person, sheepishly beginning my query: \u201cMy editor will not let this go \u2026\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen I got back to the office, Martinichev expressed disappointment that I hadn\u2019t asked the question on camera (as if I had control over who Sean Spicer called on) and explained that Moscow wanted me to follow up with Spicer on why the ISIS chemical weapons attack hadn\u2019t caused the U.S. government to send cruise missiles into Iraq the way it bombed Syria after Assad gassed his own people.\u000a\u000aBut the point of the question wasn\u2019t to get an answer; it was to use the platform of the televised briefing to portray the U.S. government as hypocritical for not reacting to the Islamic State\u2019s use of an old mustard gas shell the same way it had reacted to Assad\u2019s use of sarin gas against civilians.\u000a\u000aI began to realize that Sputnik\u2019s mission wasn\u2019t really to report the news as much as it was to push a narrative that would either sow doubts about situations that weren\u2019t flattering to Russia or its allies, or hurt the reputation of the United States and its allies. Consider, for example, when Trump\u2019s budget proposed massive cuts to foreign aid sent to Ukraine. While these decreases in funding were a result of across-the-board cuts to the State Department and other agencies, I was told to ask whether such cuts were related to unspecified \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine\u2019s government. Instead of humiliating myself by asking such a stupid question on camera, I emailed a White House spokesperson. Considering how ridiculous the query was, I was not the least bit surprised when I got no reply.\u000a\u000aConsidering the U.S. government conclusion that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, using fake news stories and the slanted content at outlets like Sputnik to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and bolster Trump, one might assume that I was ordered to write stories that were unabashedly pro-Trump. I never was. Instead, the stories I was told to cover invariably could be used to push narratives that the U.S. government is hypocritical, corrupt and lacks the moral standing to confront Putin\u2019s dictatorship on human rights or any other similar issue. One prominent pro-Trump journalist who worked at Sputnik during the election told me that she was never ordered to write pro-Trump stories but often did so on her own initiative; another former Sputnik reporter said that he was pressured to exploit his contacts to get ahold of hacked emails belonging to former CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 and was fired after he refused to traffic in stolen data.\u000a\u000aWhen the Washington Post identified me as Sputnik\u2019s White House reporter, my bosses indicated they were not pleased, and pointed out to me that company policy was to not put bylines on stories.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s possible that the White House also believed that Sputnik would be a friendly outlet, as my initial reception by the White House press office was warm and welcoming, at least until I started asking questions \u2014 such as why wouldn\u2019t Trump send weapons to Ukraine and why Jared Kushner omitted meetings with Russians from his security clearance forms \u2014 that indicated I intended to do my job like any other reporter. After that, my White House access became almost nonexistent. Like many other White House reporters, I\u2019m sure, I struggled to get questions answered and emails returned.\u000a\u000aI was regularly accused on social media of spreading propaganda; some people even accused me of treason. I always responded in defense of myself and my colleagues. The way I saw it, at least at first, was that I was simply doing the job the way I\u2019d do any other, and that I wasn\u2019t spreading disinformation. But eventually, all the little things I\u2019d noticed about how my job at Sputnik wasn\u2019t quite like any other reporting job started to add up, and I became more and more uneasy. I realized that it didn\u2019t matter how hard I worked or how aggressively I pushed back at the strictures my bosses were putting on me \u2014 as long as I was working at Sputnik I\u2019d be contributing to the spread of disinformation and propaganda, even if I wasn\u2019t actively writing it myself.\u000a\u000aI started looking at job boards and asking more experienced colleagues outside of Sputnik for advice on how best to extricate myself.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIf during the months since starting at Sputnik I\u2019d began having concerns that things weren\u2019t the way I\u2019d been promised they would be, my last week at Sputnik removed any doubt.\u000a\u000aOn May 22, the White House held a briefing with budget director Mick Mulvaney, during which I asked why a proposal to keep families with undocumented immigrant parents from getting a tax credit to help them raise children even if those children were American citizens made any sense. A columnist for the Washington Post noted the exchange, identifying me as Sputnik\u2019s White House reporter, and writing \u201cTrump\u2019s budget is so cruel a Russian propaganda outfit set the White House straight.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis did not make my bosses happy. A characteristic feature of Sputnik\u2019s news wire content is that the names of reporters rarely accompany the stories they write. While I was able to push back on this practice on a number of occasions, I was never given a concrete reason for why Sputnik wants its reporters to remain anonymous. If I were to hazard a guess, it would be so that no one can be held accountable for errors, lies and half-truths in any given story. When the Post identified me as Sputnik\u2019s White House reporter, my bosses indicated they were not pleased, and pointed out to me that company policy was to not put bylines on stories.\u000a\u000aI\u2019d also pushed back against some of the more ridiculous questions they wanted me to ask at the White House, so I am sure they knew I wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable with things, either. The day after one editor in particular dressed me down over the Post column, I brought a suitcase to the office, ostensibly to hold the spare suit I\u2019d been keeping there. But I was really preparing myself to clean out my desk and give my notice.\u000a\u000aI never got that chance. On May 26 \u2014 a few days after the Post article had pierced my anonymity \u2014 I was called into a meeting with Martinichev and another man I\u2019d never met. This much older man, who also spoke with a thick Russian accent, called himself Mikhail Safronov and identified himself as Sputnik\u2019s Washington bureau chief, though I\u2019d never once seen him set foot in the bureau.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the president comes back from Europe, we\u2019d like you to start asking about the Seth Rich case,\u201d Martinichev told me.\u000a\u000aI thought Sputnik wanted me for my skills as a journalist, but what they wanted was to use the veneer of journalism to push their own agenda.\u000a\u000aSeth Rich was a Democratic National Committee employee who had been murdered near his Washington, D.C., home in what the D.C. Metropolitan Police determined to be a botched robbery. But many on the fringes of the American right had been pushing the idea that his murder was retaliation for what they alleged was his role in leaking thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks during the 2016 election. Earlier that month, Fox News had run a story claiming that a private investigator had found information linking Rich\u2019s murder to the theft and leaking of those thousands of emails, and the right-wing media universe had exploded with talk of a cover-up perpetrated by the Clintons, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic communications consultant who was assisting Rich\u2019s family in dealing with the feeding frenzy kicked off by the Fox story.\u000a\u000aWas this a test, I wondered? Because there was no way Martinichev or Safronov could think this was a legitimate story, since Fox News had retracted their story several days earlier.\u000a\u000aI replied that I wasn\u2019t comfortable asking questions or writing about such a thing when there was absolutely no factual basis for doing so. But that story served a purpose, and Sputnik wouldn\u2019t let it go. If Sputnik\u2019s readers could be made to believe that Rich was the DNC leaker, it would shift blame from the Russian hackers the U.S. intelligence community had said were responsible.\u000a\u000aThat was the last straw, I told myself, and I began to open my mouth again. But before I could explain that I couldn\u2019t continue to work there under such conditions, Martinichev spoke again.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn that case, we are terminating your contract, effective immediately,\u201d he said, opening a folder to present me a letter to that effect.\u000a\u000aI asked whether I was being fired for refusing to report lies, or for any other reason, but both he and Safronov wouldn\u2019t elaborate on any reasons, explaining that because Washington, D.C., is an at-will employment jurisdiction, they could fire me for any reason, at any time, and didn\u2019t have to tell me why. Months later, after Yahoo News published a story about the circumstances surrounding my departure, a Sputnik spokesperson claimed that I was let go for \u201cperformance related issues.\u201d If Martinichev or my other supervisors had problems with my work, I wasn\u2019t aware of any. Nor was I aware of any problems with my work ethic, as I regularly arrived early to prepare for each day before my scheduled start time and on many days stayed past my scheduled end time. At no time was I ever told there was a problem with my performance that threatened my job.\u000a\u000aI retrieved my suitcase, packed, and, feeling the weight of so many months of intolerable conditions lift from my shoulders, left Sputnik\u2019s office for the last time, tweeting about my departure as I walked out the door: \u201cI\u2019m no longer working for @SputnikInt \u2014 I\u2019d love to tell you why. Please feel free to contact me.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom my first day at Sputnik, I truly believed that even at a Russian state-owned news service, I could do good work so long as I maintained my own ethical standards. I even believed that Sputnik\u2019s stated mission \u2014 to \u201ctell the untold\u201d \u2014 is one worth undertaking. Other state-owned news services aim to report stories ignored by other outlets, and to provide a different perspective on the news. Many of them do an excellent job.\u000a\u000aBut when the \u201cuntold\u201d is untold because it\u2019s not true, and the \u201calternative perspective\u201d is a way to push a hostile government\u2019s agenda by tearing down the reputation of other nations, all the ethics in the world can\u2019t help you. I thought Sputnik wanted me for my skills as a journalist, but what they wanted was to use the veneer of journalism to push their own agenda. I won\u2019t make the mistake of taking someone like Martinichev at his word again.\u000a\u000aEDITORS\u2019 NOTE: Martinichev denies that during the job interview he asked Feinberg about reporting untruths. He also maintains that the circumstances of Feinberg\u2019s firing as Feinberg reports them are untrue: \u201cThe statement that Seth Rich was brought up in the final meeting is a complete fabrication,\u201d Martinichev says. \u201cThe story had nothing to do with the grounds of Mr. Feinberg\u2019s departure.\u201d\u000a\u000aFurthermore, Martinichev says, \u201cThe claim that asking questions during on-camera White House briefings was aimed at promoting conspiracy theories is nonsense. All queries are made to get the administration\u2019s position on different issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn response to Feinberg\u2019s allegations, Sputnik\u2019s editor-in-chief responded: \u201cSince Politico Magazine puts so much trust in Mr. Feinberg\u2019s statements, it would be utterly hypocritical from your side not to employ him to prove what a wonderful journalist he is. I\u2019ll be glad if you prove us wrong. Please, let me know if you are interested in employing Mr. Feinberg. I\u2019ll be happy to provide you with a letter of recommendation.\u201d\u000a\u000aAndrew Feinberg is a journalist based in Washington, D.C.

aVMr. Jang was convicted of treason in 2013. He was executed at the same place and in the same way as his deputies, the South Korean intelligence agency said.\u000a\u000aThe book asserts that although he was a fixture of the North Korean political elite for decades, he dreamed of reforming his country. \u201cWith his execution, North Korea lost virtually the only person there who could have helped the country introduce reform and openness,\u201d Mr. Ra said during a recent interview.\u000a\u000aMr. Ra, who is also a professor of political science and a former South Korean ambassador to Japan and Britain, mined existing publications but also interviewed sources in South Korea, Japan and China, including high-ranking defectors from the North who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aMr. Jang met one of the daughters of North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, while both attended Kim Il-sung University in the mid-1960s. The daughter, Kim Kyong-hee, developed a crush on Mr. Jang, who was tall and humorous \u2014 and sang and played the accordion.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aHer father transferred the young man to a provincial college to keep the two apart. But Ms. Kim hopped in her Soviet Volga sedan to see Mr. Jang each weekend.\u000a\u000aOnce they married in 1972, Mr. Jang\u2019s career took off under the patronage of Kim Jong-il, his brother-in-law and the designated successor of the regime.\u000a\u000aIn his memoir, a Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong-il from 1988 to 2001 who goes by the alias Kenji Fujimoto remembered Mr. Jang as a fun-loving prankster who was a regular at banquets that could last until morning or even stretch a few days. A key feature of the events was a \u201cpleasure squad\u201d of young, attractive women who would dance the cancan, sing American country songs or perform a striptease, according to the book and accounts by defectors.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMr. Jang also mobilized North Korean diplomats abroad to import Danish dairy products, Black Sea caviar, French cognac and Japanese electronics \u2014 gifts Mr. Kim handed out during his parties to keep his elites loyal.\u000a\u000aBut North Korean diplomats who have defected to South Korea also said that during his frequent trips overseas to shop for Mr. Kim, Mr. Jang would drink heavily and speak dejectedly about people dying of hunger back home.\u000a\u000aFew benefited more than Mr. Jang from the regime he loyally served. But he was never fully embraced by the Kim family because he was not blood kin. This \u201climinal existence\u201d enabled him to see the absurdities of the regime more clearly than any other figure within it, Mr. Ra wrote.\u000a\u000aMr. Ra said Hwang Jang-yop, a North Korean party secretary who defected to Seoul in 1997 and lived here until his death in 2010, shared a conversation he once had with Mr. Jang. When told that the North\u2019s economy was cratering, Mr. Jang responded sarcastically: \u201cHow can an economy already at the bottom go further down?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Jang\u2019s frequent partying with the \u201cpleasure squad\u201d strained his marriage. Senior defectors from the North said it was an open secret among the Pyongyang elite that the couple both had extramarital affairs.\u000a\u000aTheir only child, Jang Kum-song, killed herself in Paris in 2006. She overdosed on sleeping pills after the Pyongyang government caught wind of her dating a Frenchman and summoned her home.\u000a\u000aStill, the marriage endured. When Kim Jong-il banished Mr. Jang three times for overstepping his authority, his wife intervened on his behalf.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Today\u2019s Headlines: Asia Edition Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.

He purged his rivals, including Ri Yong-ho, the chief of the military\u2019s general staff, and U Dong-chuk, a deputy director at the Ministry of State Security, the North\u2019s secret police.\u000a\u000aMr. Jang\u2019s campaign for more influence was apparently aimed at pushing for the kind of economic overhaul that China has introduced, Mr. Ra wrote. But he underestimated how unpalatable the idea was to Kim Jong-un, whose totalitarian rule would be undermined by such reform.\u000a\u000aMr. Ra said it was impossible to establish the exact sequence of events that led to Mr. Jang\u2019s downfall. But it was clear his hubris played a role. At the height of his power, photographs in the North Korean media showed Mr. Jang leaning on an armrest, looking almost bored, while his nephew spoke.\u000a\u000aAnnouncing his execution, North Korea said Mr. Jang, \u201chuman scum worse than a dog,\u201d had betrayed the Kim family by plotting to overthrow the younger Mr. Kim, using economic collapse as a pretext, and to rule the country himself as premier and \u201creformer.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe was accused of planting his followers in key posts and profiteering from minerals exports. His indictment pointedly noted that Mr. Jang had stood up and clapped only \u201chalfheartedly\u201d when Mr. Kim was being upheld as supreme leader.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Mr. Kim, after hearing complaints about Mr. Jang\u2019s expansion of power, ordered his department to relinquish the management of a fishing farm and a condensed milk factory. But officials loyal to their \u201cComrade No. 1,\u201d Mr. Jang, blocked those who arrived to carry out Mr. Kim\u2019s orders from entering their premises.\u000a\u000aIt was probably the last straw for Mr. Kim, still unsure about himself and extremely sensitive about any challenge to his supposedly monolithic leadership. Meanwhile, Mr. Jang\u2019s enemies in the secret police were eager to go after him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was no indication that he had a lawyer or was allowed to speak for himself during his trial,\u201d Mr. Ra said. \u201cIt was not a trial but a murder.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Jang\u2019s name has been expurgated from all official records in the North. Hundreds of his associates were purged. His wife is alive but sickly, according to the South Korean intelligence agency.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aBut some people in Pyongyang still remember his role in the tall apartment buildings, water parks and other showpiece projects he once zealously promoted to glorify his nephew\u2019s nascent leadership.

aVDavid Davis (left) and Michel Barnier (right) speak at a joint news conference in July 2017 | Stephanie Lecocq/EPA Brussels scoffs at Britain\u2019s customs proposal ahead of Brexit talks EU diplomats will meet on Thursday to discuss the proposals and prepare for official negotiations next week.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s \u201cfairy tale\u201d plan for post-Brexit customs arrangements with the EU will be a key topic of discussion Thursday at a crucial Brussels meeting ahead of the next round of official Brexit negotiations next week.\u000a\u000aEU diplomats from the 27 remaining member countries will be briefed by Stéphanie Riso, a senior member of the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiating team, on the current state of the talks and on the bloc\u2019s reaction to U.K. position papers released last week on post-Brexit customs arrangements and the Northern Irish border.\u000a\u000aAccording to five senior diplomats involved in the negotiations, the U.K.\u2019s proposals have found little favor in Brussels. \u201cThe solution proposed by London on customs and the Irish border sounds like a fairy tale,\u201d said one diplomatic official. \u201cIf you read through the two papers, most of them are about how not to ruin things and not on how to fix them.\u201d\u000a\u000aA second diplomat said the British proposals aspired to maintain the status quo on EU customs while avoiding the long list of obligations that stem from being a full EU member.\u000a\u000aDiplomats in Brussels are doubtful that the U.K. customs authority has the capacity to deal with beefed-up customs checks post Brexit.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe feel with customs, the Brits are cherry-picking. Some of their proposals could work since they are based on arrangements in place for Norway and Switzerland,\u201d said a third diplomat. \u201cThe problem is the U.K. does not have a good track record,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aThe meeting \u2014 which comes ahead of the third round of official negotiations with the U.K. in Brussels \u2014 is intended to allow representatives of the member countries to discuss the bloc\u2019s position in next week\u2019s talks with Commission officials.\u000a\u000aEU officials regard the flurry of position papers published by the U.K. in the last two weeks as a distraction tactic, intended to gloss over Britain\u2019s failure \u2014 in the eyes of the EU \u2014 to engage substantively on key separation issues such as the Brexit bill.\u000a\u000aBut the mere fact that the EU is discussing the U.K.\u2019s customs proposals will be seen as a victory in London. The EU has been adamant that it will not engage with anything to do with the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the bloc until the talks have achieved \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the divorce.\u000a\u000aThe customs position paper was the first in the latest round of publications. It laid out proposals for a transitional arrangement followed by two options for a long-term customs arrangement that would mean minimal border checks while at the same time allowing the U.K. to leave the EU customs union and strike its own trade deals.\u000a\u000aThe issue has huge economic ramifications for the U.K., since imports and exports represent about one-third of gross domestic product in Britain.\u000a\u000aGoodwill for the U.K. on the customs issue is in short supply in Brussels though. It is currently undergoing infringement procedures in the EU for falling short on VAT collection. And the EU\u2019s anti-fraud office determined in March that Britain\u2019s customs authorities deliberately ignored a massive fraud network \u2014 which is still ongoing \u2014 orchestrated by Chinese textiles and footwear exporters. The U.K. is facing a \u20ac2 billion bill for turning a blind eye to the fraud.\u000a\u000aDiplomats in Brussels are doubtful that the U.K. customs authority has the capacity to deal with beefed-up customs checks post Brexit.\u000a\u000aThe main stumbling block for the EU in the U.K.\u2019s proposals though, is the notion that it simply wants to maintain the positive aspects of EU membership without having to comply with the obligations that come with being a full member.\u000a\u000aThat has left many in Brussels wondering why the U.K. now wants to leave the Union.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey basically want to maintain the status quo, without having to comply with the obligations you have to incur when you are a full EU member. They want customs and Ireland à la carte,\u201d one of the diplomats said.\u000a\u000aDespite what is being perceived as wishful thinking from the U.K., analysts looking at the current options on the table for London believe no post-Brexit scenario will be pain-free.\u000a\u000aA report by the Institute for Government released last week said \u201cthere is no model of future relationship that can offer traders \u2018the exact same benefits\u2019 as EU membership.\u201d\u000a\u000aPOLITICO approached the U.K. Department for Exiting the European Union for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

aVPresident Andrew Jackson died in 1845, 16 years before the Civil War erupted at Fort Sumter. | AP Photo Historians see a dark underside to Trump's Civil War riff\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump on Monday once again defied the history books, this time claiming that Andrew Jackson was \u201creally angry\u201d about the Civil War \u2013 despite having died 16 years before the first shots were fired \u2013 and puzzled why a deal wasn\u2019t cut to avoid the war altogether.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was really angry that he saw with regard to the Civil War, he said, \u2018There\u2019s no reason for this,\u2019\u201d Trump said in a radio interview with conservative writer Salena Zito broadcast Monday.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don\u2019t ask the question but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\u201d Trump added.\u000a\u000aTrump for months has riled up history buffs with a range of eyebrow-raising comments, including his claim that not many people knew Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, his apparent ignorance that famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass died many years ago, and his question about whether anyone had heard of Susan B. Anthony.\u000a\u000aAnd the fact that he didn\u2019t seem to be aware of the extensive literature about the cause of the Civil War is now added to the list.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most hotly debated issue in American history,\u201d said historian Charles B. Dew, a professor at Williams College, who wrote a landmark 2001 book, "Apostles of Disunion," on the causes of the war.\u000a\u000aThe president's comments on Monday struck some historians as darker than a history goof, with the president seeming to minimize the painful history of slavery in the United States and to talk up Jackson\u2019s role as a strongman leader who proudly owned many slaves.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of comment that will get applause from neo-Confederate circles in the South,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University.\u000a\u000aConfederate flags were a common sight at Trump rallies during the 2016 campaign, and monuments to Confederate leaders are common in Southern states.\u000a\u000aSome in Trump\u2019s circle, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, have sought to liken Trump to Jackson, a populist. In March, Trump visited Jackson\u2019s gravesite in Nashville, Tennessee, where he declared himself \u201ca fan.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSteve Bannon has made Jackson the epitome of the hardscrabble, American folk hero,\u201d added Brinkley. \u201cAnd Trump has bought into Steve Bannon\u2019s version of Andrew Jackson.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Monday night, the president tweeted: \u201cPresident Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry. Would never have let it happen!\u201c\u000a\u000aJackson, who was a slaveholder, threatened to use federal military force against South Carolina when the state sought to nullify federal tariffs. He died in 1845, 16 years before the Civil War erupted at Fort Sumter.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I saw in that comment was his belief, his attraction to a kind of strongman history,\u201d said David Blight, a Civil War historian at Yale University. \u201cIt\u2019s so completely out of any knowledge or context to suggest that somehow Jackson would have headed off the Civil War.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe broad consensus among historians is that the secession of 11 Southern states, and the resulting war, was driven by slavery and the racial order that slavery represented. The Confederacy\u2019s vice president, Alexander H. Stephens, said himself that the South\u2019s \u201cfoundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe myth that the Civil War was fought over not slavery, but states\u2019 rights, has become an article of faith for some in the South and those in the white supremacist movement. Some Southern states instituted Robert E. Lee Day, celebrating the Confederate general, to fall on the same day as Martin Luther King Jr. Day after Congress established the holiday in 1983.\u000a\u000aTo have the occupant of the Oval Office cast doubt on the historical consensus could hearten those who downplay the significance that racism had in driving the war, historians said.\u000a\u000aBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox.

aVPARIS \u2014 When Emmanuel Macron\u2019s team said the president would be taking off for a few days in August, word went out that the location was to remain a state secret.\u000a\u000aSo much for discretion. Within days of the government breaking for annual recess, a resident of a tony neighborhood in Marseille spotted a woman who she thought looked suspiciously like Brigitte Macron, the first lady, emerging from an official-looking car, at the end of an even more official-looking motorcade.\u000a\u000aA tweet went out, and by Sunday, all of France knew not just where the presidential couple was holidaying, but also the precise route of Macron\u2019s afternoon jog (along the Prado beach, in an Olympique de Marseille football shirt with his name on the back).\u000a\u000aThere were plenty of reasons for the choice, starting with the fact that Macron had no interest in using the official holiday residence beloved by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, at Fort Bregançon; and that his own home in Le Touquet, northern France, was too tricky to secure. Politically, it made sense, as the president would be following his own edict to his ministers to remain in-country, and within a few hours of Paris, through the summer break.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the New York Times dubbed Marseille a favorite destination, and the rest of the world seemed to agree, as tourism is booming.\u000a\u000aAnd so the choice fell on Marseille, where the couple are reported to be staying in a villa lent by a local prefect, conveniently located at the end of a cul-de-sac easily secured by his detail. But the choice of Marseille was about more than convenience: It was a major vote of confidence in a city with a growing reputation as an ideal weekend getaway, and a sunny foil to Paris\u2019 seriousness.\u000a\u000aRelaxed where Paris can be uptight, sunny where Paris is often wet, Marseille always lost out in comparisons with the capital due to its longstanding, and frankly justified, reputation for corrupt politics and gangland violence. Marseille\u2019s heady mix of Riviera charm, Tammany Hall shenanigans and Kalashnikov scooter-by shootings furnished the material for Netflix\u2019s first French series, which was named after the city (reviews are, let\u2019s say, mixed, but check it out here).\u000a\u000aYet its depiction as Paris\u2019 eternally seedy, helplessly derelict cousin is, fortunately, outdated. Over the past five years, under a steamroller of taxpayer money and the leadership of conservative Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin \u2014 a local legend and the last of France\u2019s political \u201cbarons\u201d \u2014 Marseille has cleaned up its act, renovated its old-city port, thrown up a stunning waterfront museum, and quietly established itself as France\u2019s No. 1 weekend getaway for the chic and bobo (bohemian bourgeois) set, as well as a major football pilgrimage site thanks to the Olympique de Marseille \u2014 Macron\u2019s favorite team.\u000a\u000aIn 2015, the New York Times dubbed Marseille a favorite destination, and the rest of the world seemed to agree, as tourism is booming \u2014 from 2 million visitors annually in 2013, when it was named European Capital of Culture, to 5 million in 2016. Spurred on by the influx of urbane visitors, many of them from Paris, Marseille\u2019s hotel and restaurant scene is flourishing, with the benefit that most of what\u2019s on offer is high-quality and affordable. The city retains its unique wit, cheerful accent and urban grittiness, but it\u2019s fast becoming aware of its own cool.\u000a\u000aHere are a few good reasons to follow in Macron\u2019s footsteps and check out Marseille, before it falls victim to its own popularity and becomes overrun, as Barcelona \u2014 a frequent comparison \u2014 often is.\u000a\u000aEasy access and accommodation\u000a\u000aGetting to Marseille from Paris is so easy, it feels like cheating. Since 2001, a high-speed TGV line has linked the Gare du Nord in Paris directly with Marseille\u2019s Gare Saint Charles in three hours, hardly enough time to get antsy. The view from the station\u2019s terrace is a spectacular opener, taking in the old town and port area. It\u2019s also possible to fly direct to Marseille from London, and with a quick stopover from Berlin. Boutique hotels nestled in the winding streets tend to be up to international standards, and English-speaking. (A funky one is the Mama Shelter, in an off-beat but well-situated neighborhood. It\u2019s also got a good bar.) Public transportation via bus or metro is functional, and while taxi drivers can be gruff, or worse, it was possible to order an Uber when POLITICO last visited the city earlier this year.\u000a\u000aYes, the Calanques are great\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s almost a cliché, but as it happens, one that deserves its iconic status. The Calanques in and around Marseille \u2014 inlets of turquoise water, flanked by steep walls of limestone or dolomite \u2014 are a global attraction for excellent reasons. It\u2019s a rare and thrilling experience to reach a secluded slice of the Mediterranean after a sturdy hike through forests, lay a towel over a rock and dip into the clear cold sea water. Proper Calanques are a bus ride away from the city, but there is a hack: the Malmousque neighborhood is within walking distance of the port, and features its own little Calanque, complete with rock-side fishing shacks, white stone and perfectly blue sea. Watch the locals and learn: go for a sporty late morning swim, crack a beer and lie back on the rocks under the sun.\u000a\u000aAn actual cultural scene\u000a\u000aForget the days when watching locals arguing in the local accent was the best entertainment. Marseille now boasts one of the most impressive museums in France, architecturally speaking at least: the MuCEM (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations), perched at the aperture of the old port, and intertwined with a medieval fortress whose upper reaches can be explored via a series of gangways. It\u2019s worth visiting just for the view, and Marseille has plenty more to offer, most notably the \u201cFriche de la Belle de Mai\u201d \u2014 an old tobacco manufacturing site that was taken over by artists after its closure in the 1990s, since converted to an all-purpose cultural hub with a gigantic rooftop terrace where you can watch the sun go down with a cocktail. Les Docks and Terraces du Port offer off-beat shopping.\u000a\u000aFresh food & high standards\u000a\u000aBy sticking to unpretentious cafés and restaurants (port area excluded), it\u2019s hard to have a bad meal in Marseille, and some are exceptional. Lunch at a café in Le Panier, a warren of streets high above the port\u2019s eastern side; snacks from Moroccan vendors at the Marché de Noailles behind the Old Port; dinner at a fish place like La Poisonnerie or a good Italian downtown like La Cantinetta: the premium is almost invariably on fresh ingredients and Mediterranean flavors. Another indulgence is to eat overlooking one of the Calanques, like at the Chateau overlooking the beach at Sormiou. Mayor Gaudin himself can be spotted there, sharing a gigantic platter of seafood with friends.\u000a\u000aLess violent crime\u000a\u000aGlance at news articles about crime in Marseille from as little as five years ago, and it\u2019s easy to be horrified. Stabbings, machine-gun attacks and score-settling between rival gangs in Quartier Nord, in addition to smaller-bore robbery and assault \u2014 drug-related violence was so common that one local Socialist senator, Samia Ghali, called in 2012 for the army to be sent in. While most of the bloodshed took place in housing projects, not downtown Marseille, it was off-putting, even more so when paired with episodes like a garbage strike that stunk up the city in 2010. Yet, in this respect, too, the city is changing. Overall crime fell for four consecutive years between 2012 and 2016, with robbery and assault collapsing by 60.5 percent over the period, according to police statistics. Homicides are still high, however, with 29 gang related killings in 2016.

aVSo far in the negotiations over Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis has seemed less than keen to spend any longer in Brussels than absolutely necessary.\u000a\u000aWhen the talks with his EU counterparts got going in earnest in July, he was back in London before you could say \u201cwhere are your briefing papers, David?\u201d But by dashing for the Eurostar as soon as the talks hit the detailed stuff, London\u2019s Brexit honcho risks missing out on some of the European capital\u2019s summer delights.\u000a\u000aSure, Brussels\u2019 EU quarter in August can resemble the apocalyptic wasteland of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cThe Road\u201d (with more tourists and less cannibalism), but with another trip sous La Manche to come next week, there\u2019s plenty else to occupy Davis and his team when they aren\u2019t stuck in the Commission\u2019s solemn Berlaymont building.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to Brussels for the Brexit negotiator in search of late summer downtime:\u000a\u000aGet pissed\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s in the British sense (drunk) not the American sense (angry, there\u2019s plenty of time for that). BXLBeerFest takes place on August 26-27 and offers a chance to sample some Belgian brews. According to the PR blurb, there\u2019ll be beers from around the world \u201cbecause beer has no borders.\u201d It bloody well will after March 2019!\u000a\u000aSalsa time!\u000a\u000aWarm up for a week of meetings with a party at the Fiesta Latina in the Bois de la Cambre, which will see Latin rhythms until late on August 25-27. It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to sample Brazilian beef and get a taste for a delicacy that will flood supermarket shelves in the U.K. after Brexit \u2014 if negotiators can seal that much-anticipated trade deal with the Mercosur bloc once Britain leaves the EU.\u000a\u000aTake the Tintin tour\u000a\u000aTry to forget all about those nasty Eurocrats and their \u201cTintin and the Brexit plan\u201d poster showing Tintin, Captain Haddock and Snowy in a boat that\u2019s on fire. Instead, admire the Tintin street art on Rue de l\u2019Étuve. Belgium\u2019s most famous literary export can be found searching for his friend Professor Calculus, abducted by both Bordurian and Syldavian secret agents after he invented an ultrasonic weapon both sides wanted to misemploy. (Insert joke about Brexit and mutually assured destruction here, dear reader.)\u000a\u000aStock up on Great British supplies\u000a\u000aWith long meetings and closed restaurants, it\u2019s time to grab some British delicacies from the Marks & Spencer store on Avenue de la Toison d\u2019Or before the chain closes the doors of its sole Belgian outlet in late September. British food supplier Stonemanor is open throughout the summer holiday period, peddling its top-selling wares of Cravendale milk, Walkers crisps (or chips, if you will) and Hovis crumpets to hungry officials. If all else fails, there\u2019s the Simply British Fish and Chips food truck.\u000a\u000aRelive the gory glory days\u000a\u000aA day trip to the Lion\u2019s Mound overlooking the site at which British-led forces saw off Napoleon\u2019s French Imperial Guard in 1815 would be the perfect way to remember that other time the Brits changed the course of European history. (In that muddy field 2 kilometers south of Waterloo \u2014 a mere 17-minute train ride from Brussels \u2014 it was support from the Prussian and Dutch armies that allowed the Duke of Wellington to claim victory, but anyway\u2026) Add to the Eurostar itinerary a quick stop at Lille, home of the Fromelles and Ypres battlefields, for more sobering memories of Europe\u2019s past.\u000a\u000aCulture circuit\u000a\u000aA trip to the 1899 art nouveau Old England department store \u2014 now the Musical Instruments Museum \u2014 should be followed by a tipple of Scottish-made Hendrick\u2019s at the aptly named gin bar Pharmacie Anglaise on Coudenberg 66 \u2014 just what the doctor ordered! Finish with a tour of the Magritte Museum to discover just how surreal working in Brussels can be.\u000a\u000aFind a friend\u000a\u000aTake the chance to spend quality time with lesser known EU officials left holding the fort for the summer \u2014 including the Cypriot Christos Stylianides, who will be the sole commissioner in town until August 27. Count MEPs out, of course, since they\u2019re on holiday until early September. New connections could come in handy when the U.K. is out of the EU club. If things go really well, maybe the Brits could even tag along on a European Commission away day, traditionally held at venues in the Belgian towns of Dinant, Grimbergen or Genval. To quote the organizers of such an event: \u201cAll aboard for a day of team fun.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich way to the beach?\u000a\u000aWith Brexit officials on both sides of the Channel forced to cancel summer holidays to make way for negotiations, the Belgian seaside town of Ostend offers an opportunity to paddle in the North Sea.

aVIt was \u201cEnergy Week\u201d in Washington\u2014but you\u2019d be forgiven for not noticing. The Supreme Court announced a series of major decisions on Monday, slightly easing the injunction on President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban and taking up a big gerrymandering case. Eyes then quickly turned to healthcare where Senate Republicans searched for a compromise between conservatives and moderates, an effort that is proving more challenging than expected. And then they just as quickly turned to Twitter, where Trump made life harder for his own party by launching crude personal attacks against Mika Brzezinski, a co-host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\u000a\u000aBeneath the chaos, though, the Trump administration continued to turn back Obama-era policies, especially at the Labor Department, which took aim at nearly every major Obama rule in just a few short days. The Agenda is back to document it all. Here are five big policy changes from last week:\u000a\u000aThe Labor Department was busy, Part 1\u000a\u000aThe Department of Labor issued some big regulations under Obama, and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta isn\u2019t wasting any time targeting those. Just this week, he took aim at three big ones: the overtime rule, the fiduciary standard and an electronic recordkeeping rule.\u000a\u000aUnder Obama, the department said it would require certain large employers to electronically submit data on injuries and illnesses, starting July 1. But on Tuesday, the Department of Labor officially proposed delaying the record-keeping rule to December 1. The rule isn\u2019t final yet, so it will technically take effect Saturday but the Department previously said it won\u2019t yet accept electronic submissions. Supporters of the rule hope that sunshine will act as a disinfectant, shaming companies into better labor practices; companies say it is onerous and unnecessary.\u000a\u000aThen on Thursday, the Department asked for comments about delaying the January 1, 2018 compliance date of another major Obama rule\u2014the \u201cfiduciary standard,\u201d which requires financial advisers selling investment products to act in the best interest of their clients. In May, Acosta announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he was going to allow the fiduciary rule to take effect as planned on June 9, prompting cheers from Democrats who thought the rule was doomed. Those cheers may have been premature: The department had previously announced that it wouldn\u2019t actually enforce the rule until January 1\u2014and Thursday\u2019s news is a sign that Acosta is considering more substantive reforms.\u000a\u000aFinally, this week the agency sent some signals against Obama\u2019s overtime rule, which doubled the salary threshold under which almost all employees are entitled to time-and-half pay for working overtime. What actually happened was technical: the department defended its authority to set a salary threshold in determining whether an employee qualifies for overtime, filing a brief in federal court in a case challenging the rule. However, what didn\u2019t happen was crucial: The agency didn\u2019t defend the overtime rule itself. In fact, it gave a very strong indication this week that it doesn\u2019t support the rule: On Tuesday, the Department sent a request for comments about the overtime rule to the White House for review, the first step towards significantly reforming the rule.\u000a\u000aThe Labor Department was busy, Part 2\u000a\u000aThe Department of Labor has two big policy tools at its disposal: rule-making and enforcement. Rules get most of the attention, but enforcement can have a larger impact on worker\u2019s daily lives\u2014and under Obama, the DOL used its enforcement powers broadly, earning praise from labor groups and criticism from businesses.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, the Labor Department gave a big hint that a new enforcement regime is beginning. The DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour division announced that it would resume issuing opinion letters, which are documents requested by an employer or employee that provide case-by-case legal guidance over potential federal labor law violations.\u000a\u000aBusinesses like opinion letters: They give individual companies a clear idea if their labor practices are likely to violate the law. Many labor groups don\u2019t: Critics say they suck up department resources that could be spent on investigations, and unfairly favor big employers, who have the resources and know-how to submit formal queries to the government, over employees, who don\u2019t.\u000a\u000aUnder Bush, the Labor Department issued lots of opinion letters. but Obama discontinued the practice, instead issuing general guidance documents that explain broadly how the DOL interprets the law. Acosta rescinded those guidance documents three weeks ago. The resumption of opinion letters doesn\u2019t signal a policy change in itself. But the shift is telling: Under the Acosta regime, business is finding the door open again.\u000a\u000aTrump expands his trade fight with Canada\u000a\u000aDuring his presidential campaign, Trump slammed China for its currency practices and sharply criticized Mexico over its cheap labor. But Canada largely avoided the crossfire\u2014until Trump took office.\u000a\u000aSince then, our Northern neighbor has become the chief target of Trump\u2019s trade ire as the Commerce Department imposed preliminary tariffs of 7.7 percent on certain Canadian lumber companies. This is the second time Trump has imposed penalties on the Canadian lumber industry; in April, Commerce announced tariffs of 24 percent on certain Canadian lumber companies. It\u2019s the latest moves in the long-simmering dispute that has turned hot in the last few months.\u000a\u000aThe lumber fight is the background battle as the two sides, along with Mexico, are preparing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. This week, the U.S. Trade Representative hosted a three-day public hearing on NAFTA with 140 witnesses giving five minute statements and then answering questions from government officials. All involved appear to agree that the renegotiation will be long and hard\u2014and the escalating fight over Canadian lumber won\u2019t engender any good will.\u000a\u000aEPA targets a top Obama-era rule\u000a\u000aIn May, 2015, the Obama administration issued the Waters of the United States rule\u2014colloquially known as WOTUS\u2014a far-reaching and long-awaited plan to limit pollution in America\u2019s wetlands. The culmination of years of work, WOTUS was hailed by environmentalists as a marquee moment in America\u2019s commitment to cleaning up its polluted waters.\u000a\u000aBut two years later, WOTUS is on the verge of defeat. Twenty seven states sued the Obama administration over the rule, arguing that the EPA exceeded its authority to regulate small streams and tributaries. A judge blocked the rule last year, so it hasn\u2019t taken effect, and on Tuesday, the EPA, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, took the first step towards killing it, issuing a 52-page proposed rule to repeal WOTUS. The agencies are accepting comments for 30 days. Soon after, they will issue a final rule.\u000a\u000aTrump tightens the grip on China\u2014and North Korea\u000a\u000aWhen Trump took office, he quickly realized the threat posed by North Korea, even saying he was willing to go easier on trade if China helped Washington with Pyongyang. Those days appear to be waning.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a small Chinese bank, saying that it \u201cacts as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity,\u201d along with two individuals and another Chinese company. The moves are the clearest sign that the Trump administration has decided that Beijing is unlikely to pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear program and that unilateral action is necessary. Apparently, Trump meant what he tweeted last week: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!\u201d

aVPARIS \u2014 If the spring of 2017 was all about Emmanuel Macron and his rise to power, it was his wife Brigitte who owned the summer.\u000a\u000aFrom a controversy over her official title to extensive coverage of her fashion choices, the 64-year-old emerged as a phenomenon in her own right \u2014 France\u2019s first bona fide \u201cfirst lady.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Elle magazine this week in her first major interview since her husband\u2019s election, Brigitte Macron said she would play an \u201cinformal\u201d role at the Elysée presidential palace. \u201cIf my presence ever becomes a complication, I will fade into the background,\u201d she told Elle in comments published on Friday.\u000a\u000aBut while she emphasized discretion, there is little doubt about the importance of the role she will end up playing.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has no intention of taking a frontline political role, but if she is able to help the president in her way, she will\u201d \u2014 Brigitte Macron\u2019s aide\u000a\u000aA constant and influential presence during the presidential campaign, she also had front-row access when her husband was economy minister, sitting in on meetings and weighing in on staffing decisions. At the Elysée, where she will run a staff of five from an office located one floor below her husband\u2019s, she can continue to act as one of his closest advisers.\u000a\u000aNow that she has stepped fully into the limelight, her role can take on an added dimension \u2014 that of a political asset who can be deployed to deflect attention when the going gets tough for her husband.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s already happening. While his poll scores tumbled ahead of a vacation in Marseille, she filled the news pages with a controversy about her official role and title that ran for most of the summer, culminating in her big set-piece interview for Elle.\u000a\u000aWith the country\u2019s attention distracted, Macron\u2019s team hammered out the final details of an explosive overhaul of labor rules that is to be pushed through via decree next month.\u000a\u000aThe Macrons\u2019 routine, in which the president steps back so his wife can step forward, may well prove to be a handy template during the tough months to come.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe has no intention of taking a frontline political role, but if she is able to help the president in her way, she will,\u201d said an aide to Brigitte Macron.\u000a\u000aQuasi-royal\u000a\u000aWhen the French public first started to take notice of Brigitte Macron around three years ago, stories focused on the details of her and her husband\u2019s romance.\u000a\u000aThere was fascination, and some incredulity, with a teacher who left a husband with whom she had three children to marry her former student, whom she met when he was 15.\u000a\u000aHer first magazine covers, in which the Macrons were photographed walking on the beach, came at a crucial time in his campaign \u2014 as opponents were circulating rumors about his sexual orientation.\u000a\u000aBut since Macron came to power, the salacious edge to media coverage of the presidential couple has gone. And Brigitte Macron, no longer an object of curiosity, now fascinates as a quasi-royal figure.\u000a\u000aThe summer of Brigitte started in July, when Donald Trump and his wife Melania visited Paris. The U.S. president\u2019s remark about Mrs. Macron\u2019s appearance, that she was in \u201csuch great shape,\u201d prompted outrage about him being ageist and sexist.\u000a\u000aBut it also focused worldwide attention onto Brigitte and the contrast between the French president\u2019s wife, more than two decades her husband\u2019s senior, and the self-effacing Melania Trump.\u000a\u000aBrigitte, friends argued, was a non-conformist, praiseworthy for having defied the idea that rich and powerful men should have much younger wives. She had a long career in education and participated closely in her husband\u2019s political rise. Melania, by contrast, was an extension of her husband, with no political role.\u000a\u000aThe encounter with Trump at the Invalides in Paris was also the moment that the fashion press noticed Brigitte Macron. Her white Louis Vuitton dress \u2014 she has several, in different colors \u2014 prompted dozens of articles about French chic. Brigitte Macron, typically, embraced her role as fashion ambassador.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhenever I travel abroad, I\u2019m constantly being asked about what I am wearing,\u201d she told France Info in July. \u201cIt\u2019s an art, a total art, and I am very happy if I can contribute by bringing some visibility.\u201d\u000a\u000aA few weeks later, high-street fashion brand H&M started selling a T-shirt emblazoned with her first name in pink letters at its flagship Paris store. The shirts sold out within a day, and after restocking the firm decided to extend its one-week \u201cBrigitte\u201d campaign for a month.\u000a\u000aBeyond her fashion choices, however, it was the question of Brigitte Macron\u2019s status within the power structure of the French Republic that gripped France. Despite no formal attempt having been made to enshrine the status of a \u201cfirst lady\u201d in the constitution, an artist launched an online petition opposing the idea.\u000a\u000aSome 250,000 virtual signatures later, the Macrons formally distanced themselves from the idea. However, it\u2019s been a positive for Brigitte Macron, who\u2019s now linked to the words \u201cfirst lady\u201d \u2014 \u201cpremière dame.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe used the issue to underscore, in her interview with Elle, how she would have a more important role than previous first wives because the budget for her staff, previously subsumed into the Elysée\u2019s general expenses, would be made public.\u000a\u000aWhen the presidential couple appeared in Marseille for their brief, supposedly secret, summer holiday, it was Brigitte, not Emmanuel, who was spotted by a bystander. She had gone to say hello to a neighbor.\u000a\u000aSo much for discretion \u2014 and so much the better for the woman who owned the summer of 2017.

aVSome GOP officials privately scoffed at the idea that the party felt the need to officially condemn the KKK in 2017. | Mark Humphrey/AP Photo Politics RNC approves anti-KKK resolution \u2014 after White House signoff Members said it was important to formally condemn hate groups, but some privately scoffed that Republicans felt it was even necessary.\u000a\u000aNASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 The Republican National Committee on Friday unanimously approved a resolution condemning Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, a move that comes just two weeks after President Donald Trump was widely criticized for going easy on white supremacist groups involved in the Charlottesville, Virginia, protests.\u000a\u000aSome GOP officials privately scoffed at the idea that the party felt the need to officially condemn the KKK in 2017. But the move by the GOP\u2019s official political arm \u2014 signed off on by the White House ahead of time \u2014 underscores the level of concern within the party over Trump\u2019s comments on the protests and the impact they could have on the party heading into the 2018 midterm election.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe resolution, sponsored by RNC member Bill Palatucci of New Jersey, states that \u201cthe racist beliefs of Nazis, the KKK, white supremacists and other like-minded groups are completely inconsistent with the Republican Party\u2019s platform,\u201d and that \u201cthe view that the color of one\u2019s skin determines or should determine one\u2019s standing, rights, opportunities, or duties to others is not consistent with the philosophy of the Republican Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt adds: \u201cThe racist beliefs of the Nazis, the KKK, white supremacists and others are repulsive, evil, and have no fruitful place in the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe forceful statement contrasts with the approach taken by Trump, who came under widespread criticism for equating white supremacists in Charlottesville with those protesting them. Much of the fire has come from within the president\u2019s own party, with senior GOP leaders arguing that the president needed to be far more forceful in singling out hate groups.\u000a\u000aTo underscore the peril confronting the party, the RNC\u2019s chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, used a substantial part of her speech during Friday\u2019s closing session to highlight the GOP\u2019s opposition to extremist groups \u2014 even as she avoided any criticism of Trump.\u000a\u000a"Last week, I joined the president in speaking out strongly against any group that uses hate or violence," Romney McDaniel said.\u000a\u000aOther GOP committee members also defended the need for a formal resolution.\u000a\u000a"You can\u2019t emphatically denounce the groups enough. You have to do it by name, you have to do it specifically,\u201d said Virginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck. \u201cIf nothing else, you want some leadership coming out of this. We\u2019re the national party.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhitbeck, who oversees a party in a state with a 2017 governor\u2019s race just months away, said the resolution was intended to be forceful and to call out specific groups that were involved in the Charlottesville violence.\u000a\u000aHowever, the committee was careful to avoid a fight with the White House. Ahead of Friday\u2019s approval, the committee received direct sign-off from the administration on that resolution and the nearly dozen or so other resolutions that were voted on, according to a party official briefed on the matter.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Much of the agenda was focused on laying out the party\u2019s plans for the 2018 midterms and for laying the groundwork for the 2020 election.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the committee began mapping out how the 2020 nomination process will work. On Friday afternoon, a group of officials were to begin the process of deciding which city will play host to the 2020 Republican National Convention.\u000a\u000aAmong those making the trek to Nashville were several key members of Trump\u2019s political circle, including strategists Brad Parscale and Michael Glassner.

Few RNC members were willing to publicly criticize the president, but in private conversations, many expressed dismay about Trump\u2019s remarks on race, his decision to stoke primaries against his Republican critics, and his attacks on ailing GOP Sen. John McCain.\u000a\u000aAs they shook their heads, some said it had become apparent they were dealing with a president who didn\u2019t seem to understand how politics is conducted.\u000a\u000aYet there also was a sense that, for all their complaints, there was little choice but to stand behind the president. Several noted Trump's fundraising prowess: He has raised more than $20 million for the committee over the course of the year, with more to come.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know that he\u2019s doing the best that he can, that it\u2019s a big job, and that he\u2019s got a lot of people that don\u2019t care for him,\u201d said Jonathan Barnett, an RNC member from Arkansas. \u201cBut this committee is very supportive and we\u2019re behind him 100 percent, and we\u2019re going to try to help him accomplish the goals and the value system we believe in.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt a time when the president finds himself in a fight with congressional GOP leaders, many of the president\u2019s staunchest allies on the committee rushed to his defense. During a closed-door lunch on Thursday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross pointedly complained about congressional inaction on Trump\u2019s agenda, a message that drew widespread agreement.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look at polling, Congress\u2019 approval rating is in the teens,\u201d said David Bossie, a Maryland RNC member who served as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign manager, \u201cand it\u2019s in the teens because people are frustrated they don\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVIt cost former Mayor of Brussels Yvan Mayeur (right) his job when it was revealed he had a dozen other roles | Stephanie Lecocq/EPA Belgium\u2019s problem: Too many jobs (for politicians) \u2018We have to be transparent but there is no real transparency,\u2019 says IT expert who exposed officials\u2019 many side gigs.\u000a\u000aWhen a scandal over politicians\u2019 side jobs forced one of Belgium\u2019s major parties from power, it shocked the country\u2019s political establishment. But the revelations came as no surprise to Christophe Van Gheluwe, a 41-year-old IT expert from Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe long-mighty Socialist Party (PS) lost the support of its junior partner in two regional governments, and the administration responsible for the Francophone community, after an outcry over politicians\u2019 numerous extra jobs in public bodies and companies, some of them highly paid.\u000a\u000aThe scandal also cost the Socialist mayor of Brussels his job after it was revealed he had a dozen other roles. Thanks to one of his extra posts, he even got paid to attend board meetings of Samusocial, an organization that helps the homeless.\u000a\u000aPoliticians\u2019 multiple jobs are a feature of Belgium\u2019s complex administrative system, with its many layers of government, which are also deeply involved in running many public organizations and companies. In a country of only 11 million people, that means politicians often have their fingers in many different pies.\u000a\u000aSince 2004, all politicians\u2019 jobs have had to be made public under Belgian law. But Van Gheluwe, an IT engineer from Brussels, noticed that it was hard to find this information. So he started a website, Cumuleo, that records all the roles and jobs of Belgian politicians.\u000a\u000aThe side-job culture in Belgium has its origin in the tangled web of administrations meant to ensure all the country\u2019s different regions and linguistic communities are adequately represented.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s typical of Belgium. Information about mandates has to be publicly available. We have to be transparent, but there is no real transparency. There seems to be a will not to disclose information,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u2018Berlusconi of Liège\u2019\u000a\u000aAlthough Van Gheluwe started the website back in 2009, the issue of side jobs really started to generate political heat in Belgium only last December. That\u2019s when a media outlet revealed that Publifin, a public utility company in Wallonia, had paid a total of \u20ac2 million to 24 politicians from various parties since 2013 to sit on advisory boards that turned out to be fake.\u000a\u000aThe most powerful man in the company was its CEO, Stéphane Moreau, mayor of the small Walloon town of Ans. Described by some media outlets as \u201cthe Berlusconi of Liège,\u201d Moreau earned almost \u20ac1 million from a total of 21 jobs in 2015. He quit the Socialist Party in April as a result of the scandal.\u000a\u000aThe revelations prompted the centrist cdH party in June to end its role as a junior partner with the PS in Wallonia, Brussels and the French-speaking community. It was a spectacular fall for the PS, particularly in Wallonia, where it has been part of every government for the past three decades.\u000a\u000aIn Brussels, Mayor Yvan Mayeur was also forced out in the same month after he was unable to justify taking payments to attend board meetings of Samusocial, an organization that provides shelter for homeless people.\u000a\u000aThe Samusocial role was just one of 13 jobs Mayeur held. He was paid for six of them \u2014 pocketing \u20ac56,546 last year, for example, for his advisory role at water distribution company Vivaqua, as well as a \u20ac714 attendance fee per board meeting. Those payments all came on top of his mayoral salary of \u20ac130,000 per year.\u000a\u000aMayeur was replaced by Philippe Close, another Socialist Party member. Close himself failed to declare 9 of his 30 mandates when he worked as an alderman in the city council. His other jobs include sitting on the board of directors of insurance company Ethias, health insurance agency CSD, and local housing agency CSAD.\u000a\u000aVan Gheluwe\u2019s Cumuleo website played a role in the case by listing those omissions.\u000a\u000aIn Francophone Belgium, the PS tops Cumuleo\u2019s list of mandates per politician, followed by the liberal Reformist Movement (MR), with some politicians holding as many as 50 or 60 side jobs, Van Gheluwe said. On the Flemish side, the center-left Socialistische Partij Anders (sp.a) records the most mandates. The overall average is between six and seven jobs per politician.\u000a\u000aBut according to Van Gheluwe, it\u2019s not always the number of roles that\u2019s the problem.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt can also be the conflict of interest between two jobs,\u201d he said, citing the case of Siegfried Bracke, the Flemish nationalist president of the federal parliament, who was also working as an adviser to cable television provider Telenet.\u000a\u000aBracke, a former journalist who had a total of 20 mandates in 2016, quit the Telenet job as a result of political pressure in February. He said he did not get paid for his advisory role and declared his work was \u201ca private matter.\u201d\u000a\u000aTangled web\u000a\u000aThe side-job culture in Belgium has its origin in the tangled web of administrations meant to ensure all the country\u2019s different regions and linguistic communities are adequately represented.\u000a\u000aThe federal and regional governments (Belgium has six) control many public institutions. In addition, Belgium\u2019s low privatization rate gives politicians a lot of power in the corporate world, said Pieter Cleppe, head of the Brussels office of liberal think tank Open Europe.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are many parallel structures and administrations needing political coordination and that therefore increases the power of political parties, which have been ruling the country for decades. This facilitates having dozens of mandates or, even worse, abuse of power,\u201d Cleppe said.\u000a\u000aMany political parties have arrangements in place where \u201cveteran politicians are rewarded with side jobs and sometimes receive too much money for the work they do,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIT expert Van Gheluwe spends about 30 hours a week transferring and checking data from the Court of Audit, the governmental institution that publishes a yearly overview of politicians\u2019 mandates.\u000a\u000aHe is now expanding Cumuleo with more information about payments. Politicians\u2019 declarations often do not specify how much they are getting paid, since this is not mandatory under Belgian law. So Van Gheluwe keeps himself busy by tracking down these figures in his spare time, searching companies\u2019 and politicians\u2019 websites and contacting their offices. To get full access to the database, he asks visitors for a contribution of \u20ac1 per month.\u000a\u000aModest change\u000a\u000aBoth Van Gheluwe and Cleppe believe the recent furor will bring about some change in Belgium\u2019s political culture.\u000a\u000aThe PS, in particular, has paid a heavy price for the side-jobs scandal \u2014 not just in losing power but also in a dramatic fall in its poll ratings.\u000a\u000aIf elections were held today, the communist Workers\u2019 Party of Belgium (PTB) would emerge as the largest party in Wallonia, with some 25 percent of the vote, up from just 5 percent in the 2014 election. The PS would fall back to 16 percent \u2014 half of the share of the vote it won in the last election.\u000a\u000aThe PS took a modest step at a July 2 party congress toward addressing the issue by backing plans to restrict the number of roles its MPs can hold \u2014 even if the measure was passed only narrowly, with 52 percent of the votes. MPs will now only be allowed a side job as a mayor or alderman of a city of up to 50,000 inhabitants, and they will not be paid for the second role. PS members also agreed to cap salaries of roles at organizations funded with public money.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe current situation will only change if the government gets into severe financial problems\u201d \u2014 Pieter Cleppe\u000a\u000aPS leader Elio Di Rupo declared that all the party\u2019s elected representatives now knew that the days of piling up public salaries had come to an end.\u000a\u000aBut Cleppe said the party would continue to have substantial clout in Wallonia.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe PS has appointed key people in administrations for decades. This network, with top officials in influential positions, will continue to exist for a long time,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAnd he added fundamental change would only come about through necessity.\u000a\u000a\u201cScandals happen more easily because governments across Belgium have enormous financial resources. And because they have the money, they will spend it,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe current situation will only change if the government gets into severe financial problems, maybe when interest rates go up, forcing it to privatize its companies and to address mismanagement.

While 90 percent of French Muslims stay in school until the age of 17, only 36 and 39 percent do the same in Germany and Austria.\u000a\u000aGermany leads the way in labor integration, where the proportion of Muslims in the labor force is at parity with the general population. The study cited France\u2019s \u201ctight labor market\u201d as why the unemployment rate for Muslims is at 14 percent, far higher than the 8 percent average for non-Muslims.\u000a\u000aThe study also found that devout Muslims are likely to be less well-educated, less likely to be employed and earn less than other Muslims. The inequality may be down to discrimination \u2014 the study also found that 20 percent of non-Muslims do not want to live next to a Muslim \u2014 but it may also be due to devout Muslims\u2019 jobs conflicting with their religious duties, such as fasting or praying five times a day.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far, no country in Western Europe has found a convincing strategy that addresses both equal opportunity as well as respect for religious diversity,\u201d said Yasemin El-Menouar, Islam expert at the Bertelsmann Foundation.

aVAngela Merkel\u2019s return for a fourth term as German chancellor seems such a foregone conclusion, given her conservatives\u2019 wide lead in opinion polls, that interest is mostly focused on who her coalition partner will be after the September 24 federal election.\u000a\u000aMore than ever, Europeans are looking to Berlin for a lead following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and France\u2019s election of an untested pro-European novice president. Whether there will be decisive steps to strengthen the eurozone, complete the European banking union and build a European defense union, or more last-minute crisis management and missed opportunities hinges, more than ever, on German politics.\u000a\u000aMerkel has presided over 12 years of cautious, steady-handed muddling through, in coalition first with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), then with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and then again with the Social Democrats. That has enabled her to rebrand her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as a more modern, centrist \u201cVolkspartei\u201d (people\u2019s party), shedding some of its socially conservative baggage.\u000a\u000aUndercutting the ecologist Greens, she decided after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan to phase out atomic power. She opened Germany\u2019s doors to a million refugees and other migrants in 2015, earning more plaudits from the left than from her own political family. She took the credit for implementing the Social Democrats\u2019 policies of a minimum wage and earlier retirement for people who started work young. And she disarmed the left by taking gay marriage off the table just before the election, allowing it to pass on a free vote in parliament (even if she voted against the measure herself).\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s steady-as-she-goes message is that things are not so bad in Germany and she will keep it that way. That is carefully tailored to a risk-averse society that likes to advance by consensus. But it evades the big challenges the EU faces to prevent another financial crisis, accelerate economic growth and strengthen security against rising external and internal threats.\u000a\u000aSPD challenger Martin Schulz has so far failed to strike much of a chord with his depiction of an unequal society crying out for more social justice rather than pouring money into U.S.-mandated rearmament. Having been the junior partner in government for the last four years and for eight of the last 12, it is hard for the SPD to distance itself from Merkel\u2019s record, or to project a credible alternative when a left-wing government would require the support of the hard-left Die Linke party, which wants to abolish NATO and cozy up to Russia.\u000a\u000aSo back to Merkel, who \u2014 whatever her reluctance to discuss deals before going to the polls \u2014 may have four coalition options depending on where the decimal points fall on September 24.\u000a\u000aCoalition conundrums\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s party\u2019s natural inclination would be to make a center-right coalition with the free-marketeering FDP, which looks set for a victorious return to the Bundestag after failing to jump the 5 percent hurdle for seats in 2013. She might also have the numbers to form a coalition with the Greens for the first time at the federal level. Or she might need both the FDP and the Greens to reach a majority, which would be tricky given their policy differences, and unprecedented at national level. And she has the option of another Grand Coalition with the SPD, if it were willing to be the junior partner again.\u000a\u000aThe Greens or the SPD would be the most pro-European partners. Even in opposition, they would likely assure Merkel of the votes needed to push bold eurozone reforms through the Bundestag, if she chose that route. Opinion polls show a clear majority of Germans support closer European integration, but Merkel will need to stand up to the German financial establishment, and some of her own lawmakers, to push through European deposit insurance and a fiscal backstop for bank resolution \u2014 and build a stronger economic and monetary union with French President Emmanuel Macron.\u000a\u000aA black-yellow CDU/CSU-FDP coalition \u2014 to use the parties\u2019 traditional colors \u2014 risks being firm on defense but reticent on eurozone integration. Both parties are committed to moving toward NATO\u2019s guideline of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. That would be a leap for Germany which is at just 1.2 percent this year. Both say they favor a European defense union and the FDP advocates a European army. But both would be deeply cautious about ideas floated by Macron such as a common eurozone budget and finance minister under European parliamentary scrutiny.\u000a\u000aThe FDP draws many votes from the better-off and self-employed. Its leader, Christian Lindner, called in a POLITICO interview for Greece to be pushed out of the eurozone. CDU Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble failed to achieve that in 2015 at the height of the Greek crisis, before Athens accepted and implemented a new bailout program. The idea looks anachronistic now. Lindner knows that, so his decision to play the anti-Greek card looks more like a dog-whistle to fiscal disciplinarians angry that Athens wasn\u2019t punished more harshly for breaching EU budget rules.\u000a\u000aThe FDP advocates a multispeed Europe in which a hard core of wealthier states would move forward in federal integration, but strictly respect the no-bailout rule. Lindner opposes a eurozone unemployment insurance fund and has said there should be no \u201cfriendly gifts\u201d for Macron.\u000a\u000aHe has made a play for the votes of Germans who don\u2019t want Vladimir Putin\u2019s behavior in Ukraine to get in the way of business with Russia. Moscow\u2019s seizure and annexation of Crimea should be considered a \u201cprovisional fait accompli\u201d, Lindner told the Hamburger Abendblatt. Berlin shouldn\u2019t wait for the Minsk accord on a ceasefire, military withdrawal and political settlement in eastern Ukraine to be fully implemented before easing sanctions on Russia, which needs incentives for good behavior, he argued.\u000a\u000aMerkel has distanced herself from such appeasement talk, but if the FDP were to take the foreign ministry, as it has in past black-yellow coalitions, it could make it harder for the chancellor to hold Europe to a firm line against Putin. Remember it was an FDP foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, who spearheaded German opposition to the Franco-British-led NATO air campaign in Libya in 2011, isolating Berlin from its Western allies.\u000a\u000aA black-yellow-green coalition might squabble a lot on European policy but it would put Merkel in the center position from which she operates most comfortably. Another Grand Coalition with the SPD would give her the broadest political base from which to pursue a bold European agenda with Macron. But she could face increased sniping from fiscal conservatives in the CDU/CSU against concessions to Southern Europe on more mutualization of risk in the eurozone. The SPD might also seek to put the brakes on defense spending and arms exports.\u000a\u000aSince this looks sure to be her last term, Merkel, 63, will be playing for her place in history, though she dismisses such considerations. If Schäuble, 75 next month, is still at her side, he too will have to choose between lifelong support for a closely integrated, federal core Europe, and grumpy determination to prevent eurozone laggards from picking German taxpayers\u2019 pockets.\u000a\u000aBoth CDU politicians, relieved to have a stronger partner in France, indicated cautious support before the election for some of Macron\u2019s ideas. If they choose the European high road in their last years in power and make a public case for it, any coalition is ultimately likely to follow their lead.\u000a\u000a\u201cWir schaffen das (We\u2019ll manage it),\u201d as Merkel said of the refugee challenge.\u000a\u000aPaul Taylor, a contributing editor at POLITICO, writes the Europe At Large column.

aVJennifer Martinez Young\u2019s 8-year-old daughter, Addison, blitzes through books: Lisa Yee\u2019s DC Super Hero Girls novels, the Rainbow Fairies and Mariella Mystery series. Just starting third grade, she\u2019s reading at almost a sixth-grade level. This year, at Addison\u2019s former elementary school, fifth-graders will read a story she wrote last year, as a model.\u000a\u000aAddison\u2019s mother credits her pre-school, San Antonio\u2019s Pre-K 4 SA North Education Center, for inspiring her love of reading. Addison is still pen pals with Mrs. Ashworth, her preschool teacher. \u201cShe says she taught her so much,\u201d Martinez Young, 37, says.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, Addison was one of the first 700 4-year-olds to enroll in San Antonio\u2019s Pre-K 4 SA program, which provides high-quality, full-day pre-kindergarten for disadvantaged 4-year-olds. It\u2019s the brainchild of former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro, who went on to serve as President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\u000a\u000aSince then, Pre-K 4 SA has posted impressive results. Its kids start below the national average in cognition, math and literacy, and finish the year above average. Its founders have become evangelists for the idea that early-childhood education is key to giving poor kids an equal chance to succeed in school and life. The goal, says Sarah Baray, Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s CEO, is nothing less than \u201cto change the trajectory of San Antonio in one generation.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an unusual way to transform a city. Often mayors get behind mass transit or downtown redevelopment to improve their cities, not educational play for 4-year-olds. But the need for pre-K is a hotly debated topic around the country. A few cities and states have adopted universal pre-K, while others are building toward it. Texas is not one of them. Castro\u2019s initiative represents an ambitious but controversial example of a city jumping to fill a void left by its state government. \u201cThe best way to make sure a young person gets ahead is to make sure she never gets behind in the first place,\u201d says Castro.\u000a\u000aIf the program succeeds, its backers say, it could transform San Antonio, a fast-growing, majority-Latino city of 1.5 million people that calls itself \u201cMilitary City\u201d because of several large bases it hosts. It could also be a signature résumé line for Castro, whom Hillary Clinton considered as a potential running mate last year, if he decides to pursue a run for office in 2020. Castro, 42, formed a PAC to support federal candidates last week and hasn\u2019t ruled out a run for president.\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA\u2019s curriculum is based on decades of research on how younger kids learn\u2014ways that don\u2019t look much like traditional school at all. Pre-K 4 SA kids tend gardens, make art and raise money for charities. They learn through play\u2014 scooping sand into jars, rolling balls down slopes. Teachers ask each of them questions, to turn their play into teachable moments.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMartinez Young, a stay-at-home mom, and her husband, a part-time insurance agent and student, were so impressed with Addison\u2019s experience in Pre-K 4 SA, they enrolled their younger daughter, Samantha, last year. Martinez Young could have spared herself the 20-minute drive to the North Education Center if she\u2019d enrolled Samantha in the pre-kindergarten program at Addison\u2019s school. But from what she\u2019d seen of it as PTA president, she wasn\u2019t impressed.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was, \u2018OK, everybody, we\u2019re doing this worksheet now. Color this, glue this,\u2019\u201d says Martinez Young. It looked like regular school to her, with all the kids doing the same thing. Pre-K 4 SA is more \u201chands-on,\u201d Martinez Young says. \u201cI liked the fact they work in the garden. They have their own sense of, \u2018This belongs to me, this is what I\u2019m working on, this is a plant that I\u2019m watering, this is what I\u2019m going to grow.\u2019\u201d The teachers even persuade some of the 4-year-olds (though not all, of course) to eat the vegetables they grew.\u000a\u000aFormer San Antonio mayor Julian Castro stands under a mural at Pre-K 4 SA's north campus with his 8-year old daughter, Carina. Inside, teachers train and set up their classrooms before the rapidly approaching first day of school. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aThe curriculum might sound wholesome and innocent, but the politics around the passage of Pre-K 4 SA were anything but. Castro had to fight conservative critics who felt the city government shouldn\u2019t raise taxes or get involved in education. Castro, who said he was prepared to stake his whole administration on the proposal, didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cCities are often good at asking for a sales tax hike to invest in stadiums, or roads, or an airport, but less so to invest in people directly,\u201d Castro told POLITICO Magazine in a July interview. Castro brought in local business leaders and sweetened the proposal by offering scholarships for middle-class families, grants to private schools and professional development for public-school teachers. In 2012, San Antonio a solid 54 percent of San Antonio voters approved a 1/8-cent tax hike to fund Pre-K 4 SA. The criticism hasn\u2019t entirely abated, however. Half of the 16 school districts that cover parts of the 467-square-mile city chose not to participate in the program. And even those that agreed to partner with Pre-K 4 SA have done so uneasily.\u000a\u000aThe next three years will be crucial for Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s future. In spring 2018, its first alumni will take Texas\u2019 standardized math and reading tests. How the kids do could be key to evaluating whether their carefully chosen pre-school curriculum really gives them a boost in education and life. It will also influence what San Antonio voters do in 2020, when they\u2019ll decide whether to keep the program or kill it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aJulián Castro launched his first San Antonio City Council campaign while he was still a Harvard Law student, fundraising among his classmates and tacking a map of the district onto his dorm room wall. Elected at age 26 in 2001, he was the city\u2019s youngest-ever councilman. He swept into the mayor\u2019s office on his second try in 2009, winning by a 27-point margin on a platform of job creation and improving early-childhood education. Within a year, a New York Times Magazine profile identified him as a rising talent, quoting Republican political adviser Mark McKinnon, who said Castro had a good chance of becoming the nation\u2019s first Hispanic president.\u000a\u000aImage Teachers stock their classrooms with toys made out of everyday objects students might also find within their homes\u2014encouraging them to play creatively during and after school. Desks and furniture are muted and neutral in hue, so students don't become distracted by color. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aPressed by the city\u2019s two-year election cycle, in 2010 Castro quickly launched an effort called SA 2020, which asked residents what they wanted their community to look like in 10 years. Public forums attracted 700 to 1,200 people. The consensus: San Antonians wanted to target transportation, housing, downtown development, and\u2014most of all\u2014their kids\u2019 low high-school and college graduation rates. Almost 20 percent of San Antonians age 25 and over didn\u2019t have a high-school diploma in 2012, and 75 percent didn\u2019t have a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the U.S. Census. \u201cHow do we ensure there are better opportunities for folks, because they\u2019re better educated?\u201d Castro tells POLITICO Magazine.\u000a\u000aSo Castro set up the Brainpower Initiative Task Force to choose the best way to help. He asked the heads of San Antonio\u2019s two largest private employers to serve as co-chairs: Charles Butt, founder and CEO of H-E-B, Texas\u2019 largest grocery store chain, and Joe Robles, Jr., a retired Army major-general who was then CEO of USAA, the insurance and financial-services company for veterans.\u000a\u000aButt and Robles looked at research studies on three possible areas of focus: college attainment, help for middle-school kids falling behind, or early-childhood education. The results were clear, they reported: spending on early childhood provided the best return on investment. A high-quality pre-kindergarten program sets up poorer kids to perform at grade level by third grade, the research showed, which increases their chances of graduating from high school.\u000a\u000aAt his State of the City address in March 2012, Castro announced his proposal to put Pre-K 4 SA on the ballot. \u201cI am willing to stake my entire mayoral tenure on the need to invest in these young people,\u201d he said at the time. The potential career risks and rewards for Castro grew stronger that summer, when President Obama chose him as the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention\u2014the same speaking slot that introduced Obama to a national audience in 2004.\u000a\u000aTo fund Pre-K 4 SA, Castro turned to the city sales tax. \u201cIt was the first time we ever asked residents to raise the sales tax to invest in people as opposed to things,\u201d Castro says. San Antonio already had a sales tax of 1.875 cents per dollar, which funded the city government, parks, roads and the local bus system. Texas law caps local sales taxes at 2 cents per dollar, leaving San Antonio 1/8 cent of taxing capacity, enough to raise about $32 million a year.\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA has centers located in each corner of San Antonio, all near freeway beltways. In all, 2000 lower-income students are taught at the four campuses. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s goal was to do early-childhood education better than Texas\u2019 existing programs. The state funds free half-day pre-kindergarten for low-income kids, English language learners, and kids from military families. School districts use those funds to pay for pre-K classes in their elementary schools, and some were adding local funds to offer full-day pre-K. Other city kids were in the federal Head Start program. But the task force found that 5,700 San Antonio kids\u2014about 30 percent of the city\u2019s population of 4-year-olds, most of them Latino or black, like the city as a whole\u2014were eligible for free pre-K, but were either enrolled in a half-day program or none at all.\u000a\u000aCreating a citywide education program was tough in San Antonio, a sprawling, fast-growing city whose boundaries overlap with 16 independent school districts. (Many districts were founded decades before San Antonio began to annex new territory in the 1940s.) Some districts fall entirely within the city, while some have only a sliver of overlap inside the city limits.\u000a\u000aAfter looking at the status quo, Castro and his advisers decided not to subsidize the schools\u2019 existing programs. \u201cThe quality of their pre-K was very uneven,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody involved wanted this to be an absolutely top-rate program.\u201d Besides, San Antonio\u2019s two largest school districts, Northside and North East, were too crowded to add more classes. Finally, Castro also wanted to expand pre-K access to reach parents with household incomes above Texas\u2019 cutoff, 185 percent of the poverty line\u2014a project the districts were leery of taking on. In Texas\u2019 system, \u201cthe middle class gets screwed,\u201d he argues. \u201cTons of families, essentially the lower middle class and middle class, can\u2019t afford good pre-K in a private school.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro\u2019s solution: \u201cexcellent full day pre-K that wasn\u2019t bounded by these district lines.\u201d The city would build four pre-K centers, each enrolling 500 kids a year, on the north, south, east and west sides. Parents could choose the one closest to home or work.\u000a\u000aGetting the tax passed wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe were asking people to tax themselves in a state and a community where that\u2019s not necessarily popular,\u201d Castro says. Pre-K 4 SA would teach 2,000 kids a year, about one-tenth of the 4-year-olds in the city. To expand the program\u2019s reach and political support, Castro, the task force and the city manager\u2019s staff also included a $4 million competitive grant program for public, private, parochial and charter schools, and child development centers. They also promised a teacher training initiative that would spread Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s approach to learning around town.\u000a\u000aStudents are off for the summer, but summer food programs at Boys and Girls Clubs across the city serve lunches and offer kids a space to gather, indoors and out. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000a\u201cThe biggest thing was promoting a vision of a much more well-educated San Antonio, for the sake of those children, but also for everybody\u2019s sake,\u201d says Castro. With the business community\u2019s help, Castro made the case that Pre-K 4 SA was a workforce development program with a very long-term payoff. (Four-year-olds starting Pre-K 4 SA this fall will be part of San Antonio\u2019s high school classes of 2031.)\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone would benefit from the better jobs that could be brought in, the higher salaries of the future,\u201d Castro says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aBefore Sarah Baray became CEO of Pre-K 4 SA in 2016, she was a tenured university professor who studied school improvement and focused on disenfranchised kids. She gave up the security of tenure for her new job because she was excited by her tour of a Pre-K 4 SA center.\u000a\u000a\u201cHere was this program where they\u2019d done it exactly right,\u201d Baray recalls. In every classroom, she says, all the children were focused on hands-on play, experimenting with objects chosen to fit a lesson. No teacher had a desk. Instead, the teachers were all going from child to child, interacting with them one-on-one.\u000a\u000aBaray was familiar with the strategy: Pre-K 4 SA was using early-childhood best practices, with kids learning through well-directed play. She\u2019d just never seen it this well-executed. In her research on school improvement, she was used to seeing schools where bright spots mixed with disengaged teachers and kids doing rote work. \u201cThe kids were very comfortable explaining their learning to me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey showed me around the classroom. They were very confident, eager learners.\u201d Some kids in a dramatic play area were pretending to run a restaurant: carrying sticks, rocks, empty food boxes, plastic plates brought from home, a plastic apple. They put on clothes, set tables, and acted as waitresses. Some wrote down letters and words as if writing recipes \u2014 learning literacy as they imagined.\u000a\u000aNow, Baray is in charge of all four Pre-K 4 SA centers, and she\u2019s spreading the word about pre-K best practices across San Antonio. The curriculum comes from HighScope, a Michigan-based early-childhood program that encourages active, participatory learning.\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA CEO Sarah Baray (center) in the East campus, surrounded by teachers participating in a training. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aHighScope\u2019s approach is based on the Perry Preschool Project, a 1960s preschool program for low-income kids at Perry Elementary School in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The Perry project was based on child-development research by pioneering psychologists Jerome Bruner and Lev Vygotsky, who found that children learn best through experimental play, with adults stepping in at the right time to help them grasp a new concept. A study checked in with Perry alumni at age 40 and found that they\u2019d been more successful in life than peers who didn\u2019t attend: They were more likely to have graduated from high school, used welfare less, were arrested less, and earned more. Studies by James Heckman, a University of Chicago economics professor and Nobel laureate, back up HighScope-style approaches to pre-school. \u201cA wide range of studies show that disadvantaged children benefit from access to quality early childhood programs\u2014and society benefits from targeted investments in disadvantaged children,\u201d says a summary of Heckman\u2019s findings on his website. \u201cHigher quality programs like Perry Preschool,\u201d it adds, \u201cproduce the highest quality outcomes.\u201d\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA launched fast. Castro asked city manager Sheryl Sculley to start the program in September 2013, just 10 months after voters approved the funding. The North and South education centers opened first, the East and West the following year. All are on the edge of the sprawling city, near a beltway of freeways.\u000a\u000aThe centers open at 7:15 a.m. for breakfast. The regular school day ends at 3 p.m., but about 40 percent of the kids stay for an extended day program for children of working parents, which goes to 6 p.m. Many parents say they couldn\u2019t enroll their children in pre-school without the extended day, says Sculley. Pre-K 4 SA is free for 80 percent of the families, who qualify under the Texas law for disadvantaged or military households. The other 20 percent are middle-class families with an income of more than 185 percent of the poverty line\u2014$44,000 for a family of four. They pay tuition based on a sliding scale.\u000a\u000aAll the centers except the North center are in newly consrtructed buildings. The North Education Center is housed in a former Southwest Airlines call center. It\u2019s been gutted to create classrooms with wide interior windows, for classroom observation. Five playgrounds line the building\u2019s façade on two sides. In warm, sunny San Antonio, outdoor education happens throughout the school year.\u000a\u000aThe goal of Pre-K 4 SA is to structure kids\u2019 play by creating an environment full of well-chosen objects, so they can\u2019t help but learn.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen kids are out in the sandbox, or working in a water tub and pouring from one jar into another, they\u2019re building the foundational understanding for capacity,\u201d says Baray. \u201cLater, a teacher in upper grades can tap into that, saying: \u2018Remember when you were pouring this?\u2019 So they have a foundational understanding that different containers hold different amounts.\u201d In regular day care, or pre-K with a less skilled teacher, says Baray, \u201ckids are doing those same kind of things, but they don\u2019t have the adult near them that can ask the questions that push the thinking, or set up the environment for the next step.\u201d\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA\u2019s curriculum also includes social and emotional learning, which teaches lessons such as teamwork, cooperation and self-control. Those lessons will pay off when the kids become teenagers, says Baray. \u201cIf children have not learned to have some control over their response to what\u2019s happening to them, that\u2019s when we see behavior that\u2019s much more problematic, [or] completely out of control.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe north campus playground was carefully designed to be colorful and stimulating; to balance natural elements and man-made structures; and to create an environment that feels exciting but keeps kids safe. Over the years, parents have volunteered to help build it themselves. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aThe North center includes a quiet room, with green-purple-and-blue flags hung from the ceiling to cover the fluorescent lights. \u201cCatch your breath, take your time,\u201d says a message on the wall, written in a dreamy cursive. Here, the pre-schoolers learn yoga and meditation. \u201cThat really helps children with regulating their emotions and behaviors,\u201d says center director Sandy Weser. \u201cBy the time children leave, they\u2019ve learned the importance of breathing: \u2018When I get upset I just breathe, and I calm down, and then I can talk about what I\u2019m upset about.\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aThe program also aims to teach kids to be creative citizens. A civic engagement program teaches them about charities. Near Election Day, the kids vote on which nonprofit to support. (Charities that help young children or animals usually win.) Then they fundraise, volunteer or participate in food drives. A field-trip program takes the kids and their families to parks in parts of San Antonio many haven\u2019t seen, where they learn about nature. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about going to see the Alamo\u2014it\u2019s really about understanding their community,\u201d Baray says. Local artists visit the center to teach kids to create art projects they sell at a community auction. Last year\u2019s auction raised more than $4,000.\u000a\u000aEach center has a professional development classroom, where Pre-K 4 SA trains other San Antonio pre-school teachers in its methods. This year, the program is ramping up similar training for kindergarten through third-grade teachers. They\u2019ll instruct them in the \u201cintentional release model,\u201d which transitions kids from learning by play in kindergarten to traditional, desk-based learning by third grade. The goals are to help the elementary schools, and to make sure the Pre-K 4 SA kids\u2019 successes last. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our children to get into the public school setting and then wait for all the other kids to catch up to where they are,\u201d Sculley says.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aPre-K 4 SA\u2019s job is uplift. It\u2019s not universal pre-kindergarten, it\u2019s pre-K for disadvantaged kids. It\u2019s meant to make up for differences at life\u2019s start: poverty, a language barrier. The approach assumes that affluent kids don\u2019t need a boost; their parents will pay for private preschool. It helps some middle-class families, but there\u2019s a limit; at high incomes, the sliding-scale tuition becomes pricier than private preschool. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke to Castro while putting together his preschool initiative, but he chose to go further than the San Antonio model and offer a universal program, Pre-K For All.\u000a\u000aThe results available so far suggest Pre-K 4 SA is working. At the start and end of the school year, Pre-K 4 SA teachers evaluate their kids according to six national standards for kindergarten readiness. They start the year significantly below the national average on all six. By year\u2019s end, they\u2019re above the national average on math, literacy and cognition, they\u2019ve reached the national average on oral language and social-emotional readiness, and they\u2019ve closed three-fourths of the gap on physical skills such as coordination, balance, playing with a ball and drawing.\u000a\u000aAnd the teachers are being assessed as well. Pre-K 4 SA pays its teachers an average salary of $66,500, compared with the San Antonio area\u2019s average salary of $51,400 for all teachers. Its first round of hires came mostly from San Antonio-area schools, but it\u2019s now recruiting nationally. Mostly, its efforts to attract top-quality teachers are paying off. An outside evaluator has given the teachers high ratings. \u201cOverall, teachers were observed displaying high levels of emotional support and relatively high levels of classroom organization,\u201d reported Edvance Research in its evaluation of Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s third year. Edvance rated the centers\u2019 instructional support as average and improving. Overall, the teachers scored above average compared to national standards for Head Start programs.\u000a\u000aThe exception was Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s East Education Center, which covers a lower-income part of the city. Its teachers got lower scores from Edvance than the other centers. Also, kids at the East and West showed smaller gains than the North and South centers (but better gains than the national average). \u201cThe East center lags a bit in teacher quality compared to the other centers, but they\u2019re still light years above most programs in San Antonio,\u201d Baray asserts. Without data to back that up, she cites her own experience as a researcher and scholarly work that she says \u201csuggests the quality of most pre-K programs is not high enough to improve [kindergarten] readiness.\u201d\u000a\u000aAbove, City Manager Sheryl Sculley framed by the wide interior window of a Pre-K 4 SA classroom.

Because teachers in the program aren\u2019t unionized, she notes, teachers are employed at-will, so \u201cwe can move teachers around, and also make adjustments in teacher performance.\u201d The East center\u2019s director retired this summer, and the program plans to conduct a national search for a successor.\u000a\u000aSo far, Pre-K 4 SA doesn\u2019t have data on how kids do once they move on to elementary school. The program\u2019s alumni aren\u2019t quite old enough to take Texas\u2019 standardized tests yet, and San Antonio\u2019s school districts have been loath to share their internal evaluations of students\u2019 progress.\u000a\u000a\u201cCandidly, the districts are a little bit worried about, are we going to show them up?\u201d says Sculley. \u201cThey say, \u2018Well, you\u2019re spending a lot of money per child. Of course your kids are going to perform better.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s the biggest point of contention in Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s complicated relationship with San Antonio\u2019s many school districts.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aRey Madrigal is superintendent of the Harlandale school district, one of eight in the city of San Antonio that partners with Pre-K 4 SA. Harlandale serves 15,000 students across a stretch of San Antonio\u2019s South Side, about 85 percent of them from low-income families. \u201cWe tax our community at the highest rate the state allows,\u201d Madrigal says. \u201cWe have to, to survive.\u201d\u000a\u000aHarlandale started a pre-K program 20 years ago and upgraded it to a full-day program 15 years ago. When voters approved Castro\u2019s brainpower initiative, Harlandale\u2019s pre-K was at capacity. \u201cI had 80 kids at home, who were waiting to be educated,\u201d Madrigal says. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll spend more money later, in remediation.\u201d\u000a\u000aNow, thanks to its partnership with Pre-K 4 SA, Harlandale has more kids ready for kindergarten, no waiting list for pre-school, and more professional development for its teachers. Pre-K 4 SA sets aside about 80 seats in its classrooms for Harlandale 4-year-olds. In exchange, Pre-K 4 SA gets almost all of the state\u2019s $3,600 per pupil pre-K grant for the kids it educates.\u000a\u000aMadrigal is mostly happy with the partnership, but adds there are downsides. \u201cI lost some quality pre-K teachers to Pre-K 4 SA, because they can afford to pay a lot more than we can,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of unfair, because if I could, I would, too.\u201d He\u2019s not eager to hand over data about how kids do at Harlandale after pre-K. \u201cI don\u2019t want the media to start comparing Pre-K 4 SA scores versus public schools\u2019,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not all on the same equal playing table.\u201d\u000a\u000aEight of the 16 districts in San Antonio have opted to partner with Pre-K 4 SA, including the three largest ones in the city: Northside, North East and San Antonio, the central-city district. Sculley, the city manager, says the partner districts cover 85 percent to 90 percent of San Antonio\u2019s population of kids. Families from the districts that opted out can still attend Pre-K 4 SA, but families from partner districts have enrollment priority.\u000a\u000aMadrigal says his fellow superintendents who\u2019ve opted out of the Pre-K 4 SA alliance feel their pre-school programs are just as good, or that the city should just give them the extra pre-K funding directly. The wealthy and partially suburban Alamo Heights school district, for instance, was happy with its full-day pre-K program, says Sculley. So was the South San Antonio school district, which dropped out of Pre-K 4 SA in 2014. (Pre-K 4 SA supporters blame political turmoil in the district, which has fallen under state oversight and closed schools.) One district, East Central, joined the partnership last year, after Pre-K 4 SA agreed to expand to some unincorporated areas outside the city.\u000a\u000aAbove, Rey Madrigal, Superintendent of the Harlandale Independent School District, stands inside Harlandale High School. Below, Mayor Ron Nirenberg in a Pre-K classroom. They're both working to improve San Antonio's education systems. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aKevin Wolff, a Bexar County commissioner who represents northern San Antonio, campaigned against Pre-K 4 SA in 2012 and debated Julián Castro over it four times. Wolff argues the program duplicates the pre-K programs the local schools offer.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s robbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d Wolff says. \u201cThat has hurt our public school systems here. The city created a top-tier, first-class pre-K program, along with the salary and benefits that go with that. So it took the best resources, especially the best teachers.\u201d\u000a\u000aWolff believes preschool isn\u2019t the role of city government. \u201cIt\u2019s not whether pre-K is a good thing or a bad thing. It\u2019s should [this] level of government be participating?\u201d Instead of the city taking on early-childhood education, he argued in 2012, supporters should have pushed school districts and Texas\u2019 state government to step up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an enabler for another governmental entity to not do its job,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000a\u201cPolitically, I get it,\u201d Wolff says. \u201cIf it\u2019s for the children, it\u2019s very hard to say no to. And it looks good, politically. You can look back and say, \u2018See what I did.\u2019\u201d But he thinks other cities should not look to San Antonio as a model for tackling early-childhood education. \u201cFix the education system,\u201d he advises. \u201cDon\u2019t go create a whole new one.\u201d\u000a\u000aGeorge Rodriguez, a Tea Party activist, made similar points more pointedly when he campaigned against the 2012 tax hike. \u201cThe reason behind it all, in my opinion,\u201d says Rodriguez now, \u201c[was] to help Julián Castro have a platform to move on.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaking on pre-K as a city, Wolff argues, means the city doesn\u2019t take on something else. San Antonio, he notes, dedicates only a half-cent of its sales tax to operating Via, the local bus system, while Dallas, Houston, and Austin all dedicate a full cent of sales tax to transit. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the other three cities have all built light rail systems; San Antonio hasn\u2019t.) \u201cIf I were the city, and I had an eighth of a cent left, I\u2019d be much more likely to put it toward something I\u2019m supposed to do, rather than something else.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat very point came up this year in San Antonio\u2019s mayor\u2019s race. The nonpartisan contest pitted incumbent Ivy Taylor, a moderate with some conservative support, against city councilman Ron Nirenberg, a progressive in Castro\u2019s activist mold.. Transportation, not education, became a top issue in the race, with Nirenberg pushing for mass transit and other alternatives to cars. Taylor, attempting to also position herself as a transit advocate, declared that she would consider shifting Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s sales-tax funding to transportation when the tax expires in 2020. Pre-K 4 SA wasn\u2019t a \u201csacred cow,\u201d she told the editorial board of the San Antonio Express-News. It\u2019s one factor that led Castro, who\u2019d just returned home from Washington, to endorse Nirenberg, who supports Pre-K 4 SA.\u000a\u000aIn June, Nirenberg beat Taylor with 55 percent of the vote. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to support [Pre-K 4 SA] as long as it works,\u201d the new mayor says. He\u2019s impressed with the students\u2019 growth results so far.\u000a\u000aImage Samantha Martinez Young just graduated from Pre-K 4 SA into kindergarten, but she already misses her teachers. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000a\u201cThe state\u2019s job is public education,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cIt isn\u2019t doing a very good job of that right now, and the consequences of that fall to local communities.\u201d Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, proposed expanding pre-K funding this year, but the Legislature slashed the new funds out of its budget. Does Pre-K 4 SA duplicate existing school programs? Maybe, says Nirenberg, but there\u2019s a population the existing programs aren\u2019t serving, or aren\u2019t all serving well. Besides, he argues, Pre-K 4 SA expands its reach beyond its 2,000 students with job-search and parenting support for families, competitive grants and teacher training. \u201cIf we were accomplishing all those things and reaching every student [without it],\u201d he says, \u201cthen we can argue about duplication.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis school year, an important benchmark will arrive for Pre-K 4 SA. Its first class of kids is starting third grade and will take Texas\u2019 standardized reading and math tests in the spring. In 2012, the Brainpower Initiative Task Force report declared that a key measurement of Pre-K 4 SA\u2019s success would be whether its kids posted better scores on Texas\u2019 third-grade tests than nonparticipating children. In 2016, 60 percent of third-graders in Harlandale, Rey Madrigal\u2019s district, scored satisfactory or better on the state reading test, while 63 percent did the same in math. Can Pre-K 4 SA alums do better?\u000a\u000a\u201cI told folks when I was campaigning for it in 2012, the way they should judge this program is by the numbers, by the evidence,\u201d says Castro, who\u2019s now back in San Antonio and writing a memoir. \u201cIf it demonstrates great results for these kids, then my hope is folks will support it again in 2020. If it doesn\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t support it, or it should never be on the ballot again. That\u2019s still the standard.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe critics are watching. Rodriguez, who says he\u2019ll oppose renewal in 2020, says Pre-K 4 SA still lacks comparative statistics to make a case for itself. \u201cI don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a measurable success, compared to other pre-K programs, or Head Start programs,\u201d he says. He says stats he\u2019s seen about preschool programs show that kids\u2019 gains don\u2019t last. (Heckman\u2019s research says cognitive gains from preschool, including test scores, do fade over time, but social and emotional gains last into adulthood.)\u000a\u000aWolff says he doubts Pre-K 4 SA will fail on the ballot, citing a common conservative maxim. \u201cOnce government turns on a service,\u201d he says, \u201cturning it off is next to impossible.\u201d But he says the program\u2019s results may determine whether he campaigns against it again. \u201cObviously, if it\u2019s doing horrible, that gives me more impetus to fight it,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aNirenberg is trying to manage expectations about the coming test results. \u201cThis is a brand-new program, and it\u2019s not going to be all aces right out of the gate,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it is, fantastic, but I\u2019m ready to see where the challenges are and get to work.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf he\u2019s reelected to another two-year term in 2019, Nirenberg will be in a position to lead a renewal campaign for the pre-K sales tax when it expires in 2020. \u201cIf this program continues to work as it is,\u201d says Nirenberg, \u201cand it\u2019s impacting the students as positively as we think it will, then yes, of course, why wouldn\u2019t I champion it?\u201d\u000a\u000aErick Trickey is a writer in Boston.\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Education

aVPresident Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d base was the biggest loser of Trump\u2019s speech on Afghanistan Monday night, and many quickly expressed their disappointment at the business-as-usual address from the president who had once promised to limit American intervention abroad and focus on nation-building at home.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s speech, in which he pledged to increase the number of troops in the 16-year-war, was the first since the departure of Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and confirmed the fears of many on the right that without a strong nationalist voice in the West Wing, the President would revert to the same old fare that Americans had voted to reject in November.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aUsing many of the same vague promises that previous presidents had used, including a repeat of Obama\u2019s promise not to give a \u201cblank check\u201d to Afghanistan and a pledge to finally get tough on Pakistan, it was a far cry from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy he laid out in the months before election day.\u000a\u000aConservative commentator Ann Coulter, who had been an enthusiastic supporter of Trump during the campaign and penned a book called In Trump we Trust, summed up the weariness of the nationalist right when she tweeted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you vote for. The military-industrial complex wins.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt doesn't matter who you vote for. The military-industrial complex wins. Only difference: GOP presidents pronounce "Pakistan" correctly. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aEven Trump himself admitted he had flip-flopped on his foreign policy, saying in the address that his original instinct was to pull out of the country, but that he had been convinced otherwise.\u000a\u000aOn Fox News, which has traditionally been supportive of military escapades, the reaction was mixed. While on-air the reception was broadly positive, other commentators weren\u2019t convinced. Fox News Radio\u2019s Todd Starnes accused the president of changing his campaign promise from \u201cAmerica First\u201d to \u201cAfghanistan First.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfghanistan First. \u2014 toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aThis is a fine speech \u2014 but President Trump campaigned on getting us OUT of Afghanistan. \u2014 toddstarnes (@toddstarnes) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aOther right-wingers also reacted negatively to the speech, noting what a contrast the new plan is from Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aI am not a neocon.

aVAnxious to find precedents for the frightening and ultimately deadly white nationalist, \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, some media outlets have likened the images of the recent mayhem in Virginia to the chilling ones of the German-American Bund rally that filled Madison Square Garden on February 20, 1939, with 22,000 hate-spewing American Nazis.\u000a\u000aThat rally, the largest such conclave in U.S. history, shocked Americans at the time. They had seen the press accounts and newsreel footage of the Nazis\u2019 massive Nuremburg rallies; they had read about Kristallnacht, the murderous, two-day anti-Semitic pogrom of November 1938, which the Bund\u2014the fast-growing, American version of the German Nazi party, which trumpeted the Nazi philosophy, but with a stars-and-stripes twist\u2014had unabashedly endorsed.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut that was in Europe. This was America. New York City. For Americans wondering whether it could happen here, the Bund rally provided the awful answer.\u000a\u000a\u201c22,000 Nazis Hold Rally In Garden,\u201d blared a front-page headline in the New York Times. Inside, photos captured the restless throng of counterprotesters outside the arena and the Bund\u2019s smiling uniformed leaders. \u201cWe need be in no doubt as to what the Bund would do to and in this country if it had the opportunity,\u201d the Times opined in an editorial later that week. \u201cIt would set up an American Hitler.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome 78 years after the Bund rally at Madison Square Garden, a new generation of hectoring troglodytes descended on Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1939, Brown Shirts at Madison Square Garden felt emboldened to seize a Jewish protester who had rushed the podium where the Bund\u2019s German-born leader, Fritz Kuhn, was speaking, and beat him near-senseless. In 2017, members of the so-called alt-right held a torchlight rally in Charlottesville, and the next day, one of those white nationalists went even further and allegedly used his car to mow down anti-Nazi protesters, killing a young woman, Heather Heyer.\u000a\u000aThose who have studied the Bund\u2019s rise and fall are alarmed at the historical parallels. \u201cWhen a large group of young men march through the streets of Charlottesville chanting, \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019 it\u2019s only steps removed from chanting \u2018death to the Jews\u2019 in New York or anywhere else in the 1930s,\u201d says David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. \u201cWhen those young men chant \u2018blood and soil,\u2019 it conveys the same meaning as those decades before who chanted \u2018blut and boden,\u2019 referring to the Nazi glorification of and link between race and land.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t see much of a difference, quite frankly, between the Bund and these groups, in their public presence,\u201d says Arnie Bernstein, the author of Swastika Nation, a history of the German American Bund. \u201cThe Bund had its storefronts in New York, Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles\u2014today\u2019s groups are also hanging out in the public space, but in this case, they\u2019re on the internet and anyone can access their \u2018storefronts,\u2019 or websites, and their philosophy, if you can call it that, is essentially the same.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor the Bund, the unnerving 1939 Madison Square Garden rally was at once the organization\u2019s high point and\u2014as a result of the shock and revulsion it caused\u2014its death knell. It\u2019s too soon to know exactly what effect Charlottesville\u2014which was smaller, but more violent than the Bund\u2019s 1939 demonstration\u2014will have on white nationalists or how the American public, which is still processing the horrific event, will ultimately respond to it. Will Charlottesville be the beginning of the end of this reborn generation of American Nazis? To foretell where we could be headed, you need to know how the Bund\u2019s version of it all played out 78 years ago\u2014and how this time is different.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aThe rise and fall of the German-American Bund in the late 1930s is essentially the story of the man behind it: Fritz Julius Kuhn.\u000a\u000aA German-born veteran of the Bavarian infantry during World War I, Kuhn was an early devotee of Adolf Hitler who emigrated to the United States for economic reasons in 1928 and got a job as a factory worker for Ford. After a few years in the U.S., Kuhn began his political career by becoming an officer with the Friends of New Germany, a Chicago-based, nationwide pro-Nazi group founded in 1933 with the explicit blessing of German deputy führer Rudolf Hess.\u000a\u000aAt the time, imitation Nazi parties were sprouting up throughout the world, and, at least initially, Hess and Hitler hoped to use them to incorporate new areas, particularly in Europe, into the Greater Reich. But soon, FONG\u2019s low-grade thuggery\u2014coercing American German-language newspapers into running Nazi-sympathetic articles, infiltrating patriotic German-American organizations, and the like\u2014became a nuisance to Berlin, which was still trying to maintain good relations with Washington. In 1935, Hess ordered all German citizens to resign from FONG, and he recalled its leaders to Germany, effectively putting the kibosh to it.\u000a\u000aKuhn, who had just become a U.S. citizen, saw this as his chance to create a more Americanized version of FONG, and he seized it. With his new German-American Bund, Kuhn had a vision of a homegrown Nazi Party that was more than simply a political group, but a way of life\u2014a \u201cSwastika Nation,\u201d as Bernstein calls it.\u000a\u000aAlthough Kuhn dressed his vision in American phraseology and icons\u2014he approvingly called George Washington \u201cthe first American fascist\u201d\u2014the Bund was, in fact, a clone of its Teutonic forebear, transposed to U.S. soil. In deference to his Berlin Kamerad, Kuhn gave himself the title of Bundesführer, the national leader. Just as Hitler had his own elite guard, the SS, Kuhn had his, the Ordnungsdienst or OD, who were charged with both protecting him and keeping order at Bund events. Although the OD were forbidden to carry firearms, they did carry blackjacks and truncheons, which they had no compunctions about using on non-fascist heads, as they did at an April 1938 Bund meeting in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, when seven protesters were injured by members of the OD.\u000a\u000aLike the German Nazi Party, the Bund was divided into different districts for the eastern, western and midwestern sections of the country. The Bund also had its own propaganda branch, which published a newspaper as well as the copies of Mein Kampf, Hitler\u2019s testament, which all Bund members were required to buy. Kuhn also oversaw the establishment of a score of gated training and summer camps with Teutonic-sounding names like Camp Siegfried and Camp Nordland in rural areas around the northeast, where his card-carrying volk could be indoctrinated in the American Nazi way, while their dutiful fraulein polished their German cooking skills and their brassard-wearing kinder could engage in singalongs while practicing their fraternal Seig Heils. Every so often, Kuhn would pull up in his motorcade, bless the proceedings and deliver himself of a sulfurous Hitler-style harangue\u2014in English.\u000a\u000aAt a German-American Bund camp in Andover, New Jersey, young campers stand at attention as the American flag and the German-American Youth Movement flag are lowered at sundown, July 21, 1937. | AP\u000a\u000aIn effect, the Bund was its own ethnostate, as today\u2019s neo-Nazis would call it. And it worked: By 1938, two years after its \u201crebirth,\u201d the group had become a political force to be reckoned with. Its meetings each drew up to several thousand visitors, and its activities were closely followed by the FBI. With the anti-Semitic radio broadcaster the Rev. Charles Coughlin having faded from the national scene following FDR\u2019s landslide second-term win, Kuhn was now the country\u2019s most vocal and best-known ultra-right leader and anti-Semite.\u000a\u000aIt was just as the führer would have wished. Except that the führer didn\u2019t wish.\u000a\u000aOne year ahead of the outbreak of World War II, Berlin still hoped for good relations with Washington. The Reich refused to give Kuhn\u2019s organization either financial or verbal support, lest it further alienate the Roosevelt administration, which had already made clear its extreme distaste for the Nazi ideology. Berlin went so far as to forbid German nationals in the United States from joining the German American Bund.\u000a\u000aThe führer\u2019s brush-off didn\u2019t deter Kuhn and his volk, who continued to sing the Reich\u2019s praises.\u000a\u000aNor did they mind the Kristallnacht of November 1938, the nationwide German pogrom set off by the assassination of a German diplomat by a Jew in Paris, which led to nearly 100 deaths, scores more injuries and the decimation of what remained of German-Jewish life. Comparing the assassination to the attacks on Bund meetings by anti-Nazis\u2014the spiritual predecessors of today\u2019s so-called antifa\u2014its propagandists claimed the Kristallnacht massacre was a justifiable act of retribution. The Bund\u2019s endorsement of the horrific event increased the American public\u2019s hostility toward it, while causing the most prestigious German-American organization, the Steuben Society, to repudiate it.\u000a\u000aThat didn\u2019t discourage Kuhn either. Now, he decided, as the sea of opprobrium rose around him, was the moment to step into the spotlight and show just how strong the Bund was.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what the Madison Square Garden rally was about. On the surface, the conclave, billed as a \u201cMass Demonstration for True Americanism,\u201d was supposed to honor George Washington on the occasion of his 207th birthday. But the unprecedented event was really intended to be the German-American Bund\u2019s apotheosis, proof positive to America and the world\u2014as well as Berlin\u2014that the American Nazis were here to stay. \u201cThe rally was to be Kuhn\u2019s shining moment, an elaborate pageant and vivid showcase of all he had built in three years,\u201d Bernstein wrote in his 2013 book. \u201cKuhn\u2019s dream of a Swastika Nation would be on display for the whole world, right in the heart of what the Berlin press called the \u2018Semitized metropolis of New York.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough the mass demonstration was intended for Bund members, walk-ins from sympathetic Nazi-minded American citizens also were welcome. Kuhn had big dreams: One of the posters that adorned the hall optimistically declared, \u201cONE MILLION BUND MEMBERS BY 1940.\u201d\u000a\u000aSkeptics wondered whether the bundesführer would be able to fill the massive arena. Any doubts on that score were quickly allayed, as the 20,000 Nazi faithful who had driven or flown in from every corner of Swastika Nation filed into the great hall. Meanwhile, an even larger crowd of counterdemonstrators, eventually estimated at close to 100,000, filled the surrounding midtown Manhattan streets.\u000a\u000aNew York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and Police Commissioner Lewis Valentine were prepared for both the Nazis and their adversaries, wrapping the Garden with a security cordon of 1,700 policemen\u2014the largest police presence in the city\u2019s history\u2014including a large contingent of mounted officers to keep the two sides apart. LaGuardia, an Episcopalian whose mother was a Jew, loathed the Bund, but he was determined to see to it that the Bundists\u2019 right to freedom of speech would be respected. Americans could judge the poisonous result for themselves.\u000a\u000aMounted NYPD officers form a line outside to hold back a crowd of protesters outside the German American Bund\u2019s Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden. | AP\u000a\u000aInside the Garden, things went pretty much according to Kuhn\u2019s faux-Nuremberg script. As drums rolled, an honor guard of young American Nazis marched in bearing the flags of the U.S. and the Bund, as well as the two fascist powers, Nazi Germany and Italy. One by one, the various officers of the Bund stepped forth to extol America (or their version of it) and condemn the \u201cracial amalgamation\u201d that had putatively taken place since the good old unmongrelized days of George Washington. Anti-Semitism, naturally, was a major theme of the venomous rhetoric that issued forth as the newsreel cameras rolled.\u000a\u000aFinally, after being introduced as \u201cthe man we love for the enemies he has made,\u201d the jackbooted bundesführer himself stepped up to the microphone to deliver one of his trademark jeremiads, scoring the \u201cslimy conspirators who would change this glorious republic into the inferno of a Bolshevik Paradise\u201d and \u201cthe grip of the palsied hand of Communism in our schools, our universities, our very homes.\u201d When he paused, he would be greeted with shouts of \u201cFree America!\u201d\u2014the new Bund greeting that had replaced "Seig Heil!" but with the same intonation and raised arm salute.\u000a\u000aAccording to Kuhn, both the federal government and New York City government were Jewish agents. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose antipathy for Nazism was a matter of record\u2014\u201cNazism is a cancer,\u201d he said\u2014was actually \u201cFrank D. Rosenfeld.\u201d "Free America!" District Attorney Thomas Dewey was \u201cThomas Jewey.\u201d "Free America!" Mayor LaGuardia was \u201cFiorello Lumpen LaGuardia.\u201d "Free America!" And so on.\u000a\u000aOf course, Kuhn\u2019s followers had heard it all before. Now it was time for the world to listen. The people would rise up, and as Kuhn\u2019s role model, Joseph Goebbels, the Third Reich\u2019s minister of propaganda put it, the storm would break loose.\u000a\u000aThe storm was certainly rising, both inside and outside the Garden.\u000a\u000aThe only alteration to the script took place when, halfway through Kuhn\u2019s speech, a young Jewish counterprotester by the name of Isadore Greenbaum decided that he couldn\u2019t bear Kuhn\u2019s diatribe anymore and spontaneously rushed the podium and attempted to tackle him.\u000a\u000aHe almost made it. On the newsreel footage of the rally shown in movie theaters throughout the country the following weekend, viewers could see Kuhn\u2019s shocked visage as the Jewish kamikaze shakes the podium. Next, they saw the hapless Greenbaum set upon by a gaggle of furious OD men, who covered him with blows before he was finally rescued by a squadron of New York policemen. It was all over in a moment\u2014but it was a moment that horrified America: a bunch of Nazis beating up a Jew in the middle of Madison Square Garden.\u000a\u000aThe bundesführer took the interruption in stride. Kuhn proceeded with his speech.\u000a\u000aAnd then it was over, and the thousands of Nazi faithful dutifully exited the arena. As far as the Bund was concerned, the rally was a success\u2014a shining moment for America\u2019s most prominent fascist. But the rally further angered Berlin, which was then preparing to go to war with the Allies\u2014a war Germany still desperately hoped the U.S. would steer clear of.\u000a\u000aLaGuardia was proud of the way his city and his police force had handled the Bund\u2019s rally. At the same time, the orgy of hatred at the Garden sealed his determination, along with that of Thomas Dewey, to take down Kuhn, and the Bund along with him, by investigating his suspicious finances (the married Kuhn liked to party and kept a number of mistresses, evidently, at the Bund\u2019s expense).\u000a\u000aA subsequent inquiry determined that the free-spending Kuhn had embezzled $14,000 from the organization. The Bund did not wish to have Kuhn prosecuted, because of Führerprinzip, the principle that the leader had absolute power. Nevertheless, with the implicit blessing of the White House, Dewey decided to go ahead and prosecute.\u000a\u000aOn December 5, 1939, Kuhn was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in jail for tax evasion. On December 11, 1941, while he was locked away in Sing Sing prison, Germany declared war on the U.S. Kuhn\u2019s support for a government now actively hostile to America gave the federal government the pretext to revoke his citizenship, which it did on June 1, 1943. Upon Kuhn\u2019s release from prison three weeks later, he was immediately re-arrested as a dangerous enemy agent. While Kuhn was in U.S. custody in Texas, Nazi Germany was destroyed, its quest for global domination permanently halted, and Hitler was dead. Four months after V-E Day, the U.S. deported Kuhn to war-ravaged West Germany. His dreams of a Swastika Nation had been smashed to pieces. He died in Munich in 1951, a broken man, in exile from the country he had sought to \u201cliberate.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aTo be sure, historical comparisons are, to an extent, folly. For all the similarities between the Bund\u2019s 1939 rally and the white nationalists' Charlottesville demonstration, there are substantial differences.\u000a\u000aFortunately, no one with Fritz Kuhn\u2019s particular demagogic skill set has emerged to lead his neo-Nazi descendants, though there are those attempting to play the part. \u201cI am worried that a Kuhn figure could marshal the disparate alt-right groups,\u201d says Arnie Bernstein, \u201cbe it a Richard Spencer, David Duke or someone of that ilk.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother difference is while the Bund\u2019s rally and the violence that spilled from it was denounced forcefully by America\u2019s top political leaders, President Donald Trump\u2019s half-hearted condemnation and shocking defense of the Charlottesville mob as including \u201cvery fine people\u201d has no antecedent, at least in modern American history. \u201cWe have a president blowing dog whistles loud and clear,\u201d says Bernstein. \u201cYou never saw that with FDR.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Bund\u2019s rally was at once the group\u2019s apex and its death rattle. But it\u2019s only in retrospect that one can make such pronouncements; nobody yet knows exactly what Charlottesville\u2014and Trump\u2019s response to it\u2014will mean for the alt-right. \u201cThe striking ambivalence coming out of the White House\u201d could help to galvanize Nazi sympathizers, says David Harris of the American Jewish Committee.\u000a\u000aBut much as the Bund-generated images of Nazi barbarism and violence drove everyday Americans from apathy 78 years ago, \u201cCharlottesville will also mobilize anti-Nazis to stand up and be counted,\u201d Harris says. Much as the Madison Square Garden rally did on the eve of World War II, says Harris, \u201cI choose to believe the net effect will be to marginalize the \u2018blut and boden\u2019 fan base.\u201d\u000a\u000aGordon F.

aVGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel | Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images UK must pay Brexit bill, says Angela Merkel German chancellor said bill was not a fine but an \u2018obligation\u2019 that Britain had entered into.\u000a\u000aGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the U.K. on Saturday that it would have to pay a settlement to leave the EU, denying that the obligation amounted to a \u201cfine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is about obligations that Great Britain has entered into and that naturally must remain on the books,\u201d Merkel said in her weekly podcast published Saturday ahead of the latest round of talks next week, Bloomberg reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the cost of divorce \u2014 that makes it sound like fines. We\u2019re still at the very start of these negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe divorce bill, or how much the U.K. should pay the EU upon leaving the bloc, is one of the most contentious issues in the Brexit talks. The EU has already outlined a full list of bodies and funds that it believes must be covered by the financial settlement. Estimates of the bill have ranged up to \u20ac100 billion.\u000a\u000aBrussels has told Britain to come forward with a proposal for how to calculate the bill or risk derailing next week\u2019s Brexit talks \u2014 something it has so far declined to do, preferring to critique the EU proposal.\u000a\u000aBoris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, said he did not \u201crecognize\u201d the \u20ac100 billion figure but added that \u201cwe should pay not a penny more, not a penny less, of what we think our legal obligations amount to.\u201d

aVHow partisan Twitter users saw and shared different narratives of Charlottesville and the aftermath.\u000a\u000aAfter violence erupted in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, media coverage differed on what aspect of the event to cover.\u000a\u000aUsing analyses from Cortico and the Laboratory for Social Machines at the MIT Media Lab, we looked at what partisan Twitter users shared during and after the events of Charlottesville. We found a clear split in the story as told through partisan sources.\u000a\u000aTake, for example, the shared headlines following President Donald Trump\u2019s news conference on Aug. 15 in Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aOn each side, one publication dominated the conversation. The New York Times and Breitbart, represented 32 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of the top links shared by each camp.\u000a\u000aOther stories broke through both sides, such as Vice\u2019s viral documentary on the events in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aThe data targets Twitter users with clear political allegiances \u2014 specifically, politically active users that exclusively followed either a Republican or Democratic 2016 presidential candidate. The top stories shared by both camps each day from Saturday, Aug. 12, through Wednesday, Aug. 16, show the political lines drawn between core supporters of Trump and the administration\u2019s staunchest detractors.\u000a\u000aOutside major media headlines, core Republicans were more likely to share videos, while Democrats were more likely to share petitions.\u000a\u000aFor example, Republicans widely shared a video conversation between Faith Goldy, reporting for Canadian hard-line conservative outlet, Rebel Media, and nationalist podcaster, Stefan Molyneux. In the video, Goldy describes violence by counter-protesters, \u201cI saw some [Black Lives Matter] folks and just young black men throwing rocks at former veterans.\u201d To date, the video has more than 330,000 views.\u000a\u000aDemocrats shared petitions targeting Steve Bannon and asking the Justice Department to file terrorism charges against the driver of the vehicle that killed Heather Heyer.\u000a\u000aDespite the split narratives between Trump\u2019s core supporters and Democrats, the effect on the voting base has been less conflicted. The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows the administration bungled the response in the eyes of many Republican voters, where support for the president fell 8 points last week.

aVPresident Donald Trump privately vented his frustration over Russia-related matters with at least two other Republican senators this month, according to people familiar with the conversations \u2014 in addition to the president\u2019s public admonishments of Mitch McConnell, John McCain and Jeff Flake.\u000a\u000aTrump expressed frustration over a bipartisan bill sanctioning Russia and tried to convince Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) that it wasn\u2019t good policy, according to three people familiar with the call. Trump argued that the legislation was unconstitutional and said it would damage his presidency. Corker was unrelenting, these people said, and told Trump the bill was going to pass both houses with bipartisan support.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was clearly frustrated,\u201d one person said of Trump\u2019s call with Corker earlier this month. The bill cleared Congress overwhelmingly last month and Trump grudgingly signed it on August 2.\u000a\u000aTrump dialed up Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) on August 7, two days before a blunt call with the Senate majority leader that spilled over into a public feud. Tillis is working with Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) on a bill designed to protect Robert Mueller, the independent counsel investigating the president\u2019s Russia connections, from any attempt by Trump to fire him.\u000a\u000aThe Mueller bill came up during the Tillis-Trump conversation, according to a source briefed on the call \u2014 the latest signal of the president\u2019s impatience with Republican senators\u2019 increasing declarations of independence from his White House. Trump was unhappy with the legislation and didn\u2019t want it to pass, one person familiar with the call said.\u000a\u000aA Tillis spokesman confirmed the date of the senator\u2019s call with the president and later described the call as \u201ccordial,\u201d saying other issues were discussed. A Corker spokeswoman described the late July conversation as a \u201cproductive conversation about the congressional review portion of the Russia sanctions bill.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, \u201cWe do not comment on private conversations the president has with members of Congress. We are committed to working together on tax relief, border security, strengthening the military, and other important issues.\u201d A separate statement from the White House press secretary Wednesday said that Trump and McConnell \u201cwill hold previously scheduled meetings following the August recess to discuss these critical items with members of the congressional leadership and the president\u2019s Cabinet. White House and leadership staff are coordinating regarding the details of those meetings.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe earlier, private calls offer more evidence of Trump\u2019s uneasy relationship with congressional Republicans. Trump has angered McConnell with a damning critique of the Kentucky Republican\u2019s performance on repealing Obamacare and threats to try to take out Flake (R-Ariz.) \u2014 a vocal Trump critic \u2014 in a Republican primary next year.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s chewing out of Republican senators, according to people briefed on the calls, reflected the president\u2019s frustration that fellow Republicans would make moves that could damage him, particularly on an investigation that he detests. Trump also complained about the Russian sanctions measure in a call with McConnell earlier this month that devolved into shouting. The New York Times first reported that Trump discussed the Russia probe with McConnell.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt seems he is just always focused on Russia,\u201d one senior Republican aide said.\u000a\u000aSince coming into the West Wing, chief of staff John Kelly has tried to curb Trump\u2019s unscheduled interactions with legislators, senior administration officials say. Trump has been known to see a senator on TV or think about an issue and immediately ask White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout to dial the senator.\u000a\u000aBut Kelly has asked that senior White House aides, such as legislative affairs head Marc Short, be present for the calls\u201a and for Trump to be briefed in advance on the topic.\u000a\u000aNo matter what Kelly does, Trump and the Senate Republicans are in for a rough September, a month that\u2019s shaping up as pivotal for his presidency. Along with his attacks on various Republican senators, Trump\u2019s aides and advisers are touting polls that show Congress is more unpopular than Trump is \u2014 and that they\u2019re prepared to run against the quintessential Washington institution.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s insistence on funding his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall promises to further strain relations with Senate Republicans, who must secure at least eight Democratic votes to keep the government funded past September 30. But the president appears unconcerned with helping McConnell navigate that challenge, declaring Tuesday night in Phoenix: \u201cIf we have to close down the government, we are going to build that wall.\u201d\u000a\u000aAny wall funding will almost certainly be a deal-breaker for Senate Democrats. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois underscored that with tweets Tuesday rejecting reports of a potential White House-initiated immigration deal involving border wall funding.\u000a\u000aDemocrats, aware of their leverage heading into next month\u2019s talks on government funding, are urging McConnell and his Republicans to ignore the president\u2019s threat.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a big task in front of us that requires bipartisanship, and may require bucking the president, and that\u2019s keeping the government funded,\u201d one senior Senate Democratic aide said. \u201cWe saw back in April, when the White House was making threats on the wall, that Republicans ignored those threats. We need to have that happen again to avoid a disaster at the end of September.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeveral senior Senate Republicans gave a cold shoulder to Trump\u2019s wall plans before leaving Washington for this month\u2019s recess. They floated a $15 billion border security bill that emphasizes \u201csmart, multi-layered infrastructure\u201d \u2014 but not the president\u2019s proposed physical barrier.\u000a\u000aStill, Trump\u2019s team is keeping up the pressure on the chamber that failed him on a Obamacare repeal effort. His campaign\u2019s joint fundraising arm with the Republican National Committee launched an online appeal this week urging supporters to directly lobby the Republicans in the Senate for a \u201cdown payment\u201d on the wall.\u000a\u000aSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) pushed back Wednesday during an appearance in Oregon, declaring that \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s interested in having a shutdown. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our interest to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump and McConnell are expected to meet for the first time following the president\u2019s jabs at the senator after this month\u2019s recess.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have regular meetings, and the White House and members of the congressional leadership have been working on the next meetings after recess,\u201d McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said by email. \u201cBut any scheduling announcements will come from the White House.\u201d\u000a\u000aMcConnell\u2019s office later released a statement that sidestepped Trump\u2019s shutdown threat but declared their mutual commitment \u201cto fund the government so we can advance our priorities in the short and long terms,\u201d alongside tax reform, infrastructure funding, and other top priorities.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president and I, and our teams, have been and continue to be in regular contact about our shared goals,\u201d McConnell said, before outlining the party\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation.\u201d

aVIncreasing the presence of the U.S. military in Afghanistan could cost Donald Trump support in key states, according to a new study.\u000a\u000aThe study by Boston University\u2019s Douglas Kriner and the University of Minnesota\u2019s Francis Shen found that communities hardest hit by military casualties in America\u2019s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan swung to Trump in the 2016 election. If Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin had suffered \u201ceven a modestly lower casualty rate,\u201d all three states would have flipped to Hillary Clinton, Kriner and Shen found.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cIf Trump wants to win again in 2020, his electoral fate may well rest on the administration\u2019s approach to the human costs of war,\u201d the authors warned.\u000a\u000aThose three states all went to Trump by narrow margins and also suffered a higher number of casualties per resident than other states. The authors controlled for factors such as race, education, income, rural population and even the population of military veterans.\u000a\u000a\u201cEven after including all these demographic control variables, the relationship between a county\u2019s casualty rate and Trump\u2019s electoral performance remains positive and statistically significant,\u201d Kriner and Shen wrote.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s anti-war rhetoric helped him get elected, the study finds. By positioning himself as less hawkish than Hillary Clinton, Trump was able to \u201cconnect with voters in communities exhausted by more than 15 years of war.\u201d That may have been \u201ccritically important to his narrow electoral victory,\u201d the author\u2019s wrote.\u000a\u000aThis appears to be one of the key reasons Trump outperformed Romney in some areas. \u201cTrump significantly outperformed Romney in counties that shouldered a disproportionate share of the war burden in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d they write.\u000a\u000aNow that Trump is president and in control of the U.S. military, voters in areas that suffer casualties may turn their anger against him instead of the establishment politicians.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf Trump wants to maintain his connection to this part of his base, his foreign policy would do well to be highly sensitive to American combat casualties,\u201d the authors wrote.

aVBoris Johnson at an event in Sydney, Australia on July 27, 2017 | Brook Mitchell/Getty Images Boris Johnson: We will pay Brexit bill as we see it \u2018We are law-abiding, bill-paying people,\u2019 UK foreign secretary says.\u000a\u000aBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Friday dismissed European estimates of what the U.K. owes the European Union as part of its departure from the bloc, saying \u201cwe should pay not a penny more, not a penny less, of what we think our legal obligations amount to.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking to BBC Radio\u2019s Today program, Johnson explained why he said the EU could \u201cgo whistle\u201d for the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations, also known as the Brexit bill, which some reports put at \u20ac100 billion.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not a figure I recognize,\u201d Johnson said.\u000a\u000aAsked whether the U.K. is ready to pay a lower amount, Johnson said: \u201cOf course we will meet our obligations. We are law-abiding, bill-paying people.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe certainly have to meet our obligations,\u201d Johnson said, but added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying I accept Mr. [Michel] Barnier\u2019s interpretations of what our obligations are \u2026 we have to meet our legal obligations as we understand them, and that\u2019s what you would expect the British government to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpeaking about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit, which has been criticized by many opposition figures, Johnson said the visit is \u201cmore likely [in] 2018 than this year.\u201d Johnson also said Trump \u201cgot it totally wrong\u201d in refusing to condemn white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville two weeks ago.

aVConfronted with a West Wing that treated policymaking as a free-for-all, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John Kelly, is instituting a system used by previous administrations to limit internal competition \u2014 and to make himself the last word on the material that crosses the president\u2019s desk.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a quiet effort to make Trump conform to White House decision-making norms he\u2019s flouted without making him feel shackled or out of the loop. In a conference call last week, Kelly initiated a new policymaking process in which just he and one other aide \u2014 White House staff secretary Rob Porter, a little-known but highly regarded Rhodes scholar who overlapped with Jared Kushner as an undergraduate at Harvard \u2014 will review all documents that cross the Resolute desk.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe new system, laid out in two memos co-authored by Kelly and Porter and distributed to Cabinet members and White House staffers in recent days, is designed to ensure that the president won\u2019t see any external policy documents, internal policy memos, agency reports and even news articles that haven\u2019t been vetted. Kelly\u2019s deputy, Kristjen Nielson, is also expected to assume an integral role.\u000a\u000aThe keystone of the new system is a \u201cdecision memo\u201d that will \u2014 for each Trump policy \u2014 integrate the input of Cabinet agencies and policy councils and present the president with various options, as well as with the advantages and drawbacks of each one.\u000a\u000aThe Kelly-Porter reforms are in many ways a reversion to the habits of previous administrations, particularly in their attempt to ensure competing views are completely and straightforwardly presented to the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere is a White House policy process, tried and true, that is not endemic to Republicans or Democrats, and it includes having the various policy councils bringing in the information and perspectives from agencies and elsewhere and then having the staff secretary\u2019s office share the policy council\u2019s memo around the office to get it vetted,\u201d said Tevi Troy, who served as deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy under George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter. Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aPorter, a Harvard Law graduate, has assumed a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in the administration, working even before Kelly\u2019s arrival to create form from chaos and to serve as an honest broker between the competing factions that populate the Trump White House. He\u2019s no stranger to the GOP\u2019s vast ideological spectrum, having served as chief of staff to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and before that as counsel to Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an Ivy League blueblood and George H.W. Bush partisan, as well as to tea partier Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).\u000a\u000aFormer President Barack Obama's staff secretary prepared briefing books for the president that he took home each evening, making sure to incorporate competing viewpoints. \u201cWe really worked hard to limit the extent to which he would see anything outside of that channel,\u201d said Doug Kramer, Obama's staff secretary. \u201cPeople are constantly trying to circumvent the process because they want to get to the president, particularly during emergencies.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome Oval Office veterans say the staff secretary has in recent years taken on an outsize role typically reserved for the White House chief of staff, from mediating policy disputes between senior advisers to resolving turf wars between the White House policy councils. In policy meetings on trade, for example, Porter has been left to mediate disputes between National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who favors free trade, and protectionist Peter Navarro, the head of the White House\u2019s National Trade Council.\u000a\u000aWhite House aides note that the new system is likely to slow the policymaking process. Executive orders, dashed out in a matter of days at the outset of the administration, are now likely to go through weeks of review as they are circulated to policy advisers, lawyers and the president\u2019s legislative affairs team.\u000a\u000aBut some hope that this new policymaking process will deliver legislative victories that have so far been elusive \u2014 particularly now that senior strategist Steve Bannon, who was known for skipping formal meetings to take his proposals directly to Trump, is out of the White House. One official called Bannon a \u201cdisruptive force\u201d who did not want to follow any set path for making White House decisions.\u000a\u000a\u201cGen. Kelly is instilling processes to ensure that the president has the information and analysis he needs to make decisions,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \u201cThe White House staff will continue to support the president by ensuring that the policy options presented to him reflect all relevant viewpoints, including any dissenting views.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus worked to systematize the policymaking process, White House aides say Priebus spent much of his time doing damage control and never instituted a holistic approach or managed to corral the flow of people and paper through the Oval Office, which until recently served as the social hub of the White House.\u000a\u000aThe president made policy pronouncements without consulting with all the stakeholders in his own administration; absent a formal policy process, their input often didn\u2019t make it to the president\u2019s desk. \u201cIn the past, a few senior administration officials unilaterally made policy calls that everyone had to live with,\u201d said one senior administration official. \u201cIt seems like those days are over.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe drawn-out saga to repeal and replace Obamacare revealed the weaknesses of the old system. In the early days of the administration and even the Trump transition, a number of domestic policy aides developed proposals for the potential repeal and replacement of Obamacare that included giving grants to states and the use of health savings accounts. Those ideas got tossed out once Tom Price was confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services and indicated during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room that the White House would instead back the House plan, supported by Speaker Paul Ryan and Priebus.\u000a\u000aPriebus was insistent on this option, according to two White House officials, and called a meeting at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in February where the House\u2019s plan was presented as the lone option to senior advisers.\u000a\u000aSince taking over for Priebus last month, Kelly has sought to crack down not just on sneakiness and backbiting but also to impose order more broadly. He has tasked deputy chiefs of staff Rick Dearborn and Joe Hagin with bringing some order to the president\u2019s schedule, pushing them to plan events further in advance and to include one public-facing event each day and one travel event each week, according to a senior White House aide.\u000a\u000aHe is also reworking what were once free-flowing White House meetings. Each one now includes a list of attendees to prevent aides from inserting themselves gratuitously where Kelly does not want them. Said a top White House aide: \u201cIf you\u2019re not on the list, you can\u2019t get into the meeting.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether a president known for freelancing can live with military discipline is another matter. \u201cIf there was not this structure beforehand and if the structure has now been created and if they adhere to it, you will get better results, but there are some \u2018ifs\u2019 in my statement,\u201d Troy said. \u201dThe process works if people stick to it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan addresses the media after the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Erdo\u011fan tightens grip on intelligence agency New powers allow president to veto appearance of MIT chief in court.\u000a\u000aISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan gained control over his country\u2019s intelligence agency with a presidential decree on Friday in a further step toward consolidating his hold over the state.\u000a\u000aThe National Intelligence Organisation, known by its Turkish acronym MIT, will now report to the president. Previously, it was overseen by the prime minister.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe changes give President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan control over domestic and overseas intelligence gathering,\u201d reported Turkey\u2019s state news agency Anadolu.\u000a\u000aShortly after last year\u2019s failed coup attempt, in which more than 240 people were killed, Erdo\u011fan announced he would attempt to rein in the country\u2019s military and intelligence services by bringing them under his own control.\u000a\u000aBut rather than bringing such a proposal before parliament, as he suggested last year, the change was made by presidential decree.\u000a\u000aSuch decrees, permitted under Turkey\u2019s ongoing state of emergency, allow Erdo\u011fan and his council of ministers to largely bypass parliament when issuing new rules and regulations.\u000a\u000aThe government has made liberal use of them for the past year, firing some tens of thousands of civil servants as Turkey sought to purge its state institutions of suspected coup sympathizers.\u000a\u000aAs part of the new rules, Erdo\u011fan will be able to veto prosecutors\u2019 requests to investigate the head of MIT or for him to testify as a witness in court.\u000a\u000aOpposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has accused the government of attempting to cover up how much it knew of the coup attempt in advance by preventing the current MIT chief from testifying before a commission set up to investigate the failed putsch.\u000a\u000aThe MIT announcement was one of several changes decreed Friday. The government also ordered the suspension of 928 people, among them ministerial staff and military personnel, and the closure of three Kurdish media outlets.\u000a\u000aFollowing the government\u2019s narrow referendum victory in April, Turkey will gradually transition from a parliamentary system to a presidential republic until 2019, considerably expanding Erdo\u011fan\u2019s power.

aVTrump coverage dwarfs Hurricane Harvey on cable news -- WSJ\u2019s Baker doubles down -- Gen Z tired of presidential politics?\u000a\u000aHURRICANE HARVEY WOULD BE THE TOP STORY ON CABLE NEWS UNDER MOST OTHER PRESIDENTS: But not in 2017. And not with President Donald Trump. Harvey, projected to make landfall in Texas potentially as a Category 3, could be the first major hurricane to strike in that part of the U.S. in 12 years. The last storms of that size to hit the U.S. from the Gulf of Mexico were Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina in 2005, the latter of which dominated news coverage in the U.S. for months and engulfed George W. Bush\u2019s presidency in controversy over relief efforts. And, of course, who could forget Superstorm Sandy, which owned the news cycle five years ago as it barreled up the East Coast. And yet Harvey, expected to make landfall in Texas this Saturday, was buried under a mound of Trump coverage on the cable news channels last night.\u000a\u000a\u2014Here were the lead stories last night on cable news:\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u2014MSNBC: \u201cAll In With Chris Hayes\u201d (8 to 9 p.m.) led with \u201cTrump & The Russians,\u201d discussing ongoing congressional probes into election tampering. Harvey was not covered. \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d led with a story on Russia and Vladimir Putin. \u201cThe Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell\u201d led with \u201cTrump vs. Ryan,\u201d a segment on GOP infighting.\u000a\u000a\u2014CNN: \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d (8 to 10 p.m.) led with \u201cIs Mexico Paying For The Wall?,\u201d discussing Tuesday\u2019s briefing exchange on the matter. Harvey was covered 49 minutes in. CNN aired a documentary about Elian Gonzalez from 10 to 11 p.m.\u000a\u000a\u2014Fox News: \u201cTucker\u201d led with \u201cErasing History,\u201d discussing the \u201cfate of U.S. monuments.\u201d Harvey was not covered. \u201cThe Five\u201d began with a segment on those questioning Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmental health.\u201d \u201cHannity\u201d led with a segment on the \u201cdestroy Trump media.\u201d\u000a\u000aTO BE FAIR: Every TV news outlet is gearing up for Harvey, and they all have crews on the ground in Texas. If for some reason today CNN, MSNBC or Fox News turn their focus to Trump, you can always turn to The Weather Channel, which went live at 5 a.m. and won\u2019t stop \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d Assuming Harvey doesn\u2019t weaken significantly, it should take over the news cycle at some point today.\u000a\u000a\u2014Still, the relatively modest coverage of Harvey so far is all the more surprising when you look back at coverage of Hurricane Matthew last October. Despite coming a month before the presidential election, coverage of Matthew swallowed up significant airtime.\u000a\u000aGood morning and welcome to Morning Media.

Enjoy the Labor Day weekend, and keep those tips coming!\u000a\u000aSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS RETURNED TO THE PRESS PODIUM at the White House on Thursday for the first on-camera briefing since Aug. 2, which was before President Donald Trump went on an extended vacation. You may remember the last one for featuring senior aide Stephen Miller\u2019s contentious spat with CNN correspondent Jim Acosta -- whom he accused of having a \u201ccosmopolitan bias\u201d -- over the meaning of Emma Lazarus\u2019 poem on the Statue of Liberty. Feels like an eternity ago, no?\u000a\u000a\u2014The briefing featured Sanders downplaying discord between the president and congressional Republicans, hours after Trump lashed out at Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan over their handling of the ongoing debt ceiling talks. Read POLITICO\u2019s take on the highlights here .\u000a\u000a\u2014It also featured reporters grilling Sanders on who exactly would be paying for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico, which you can watch here .\u000a\u000a\u2014Trump\u2019s morning tweetstorm \u2014 which was, in fact, a tweetstorm \u2014 featured more critiques of media coverage of this week\u2019s speeches: \u201cThe Fake News is now complaining about my different types of back to back speeches. Well, there was Afghanistan (somber), the big Rally.....\u201d \u201c..(enthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong). Too bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014The president also traded barbs with James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence turned-CNN analyst, who questioned Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness to be in this office\u201d Tuesday. \u201cWill he show you his beautiful letter to me?\u201d Trump tweeted. Clapper explained what Trump was talking about on CNN.\u000a\u000aFIRST IN MORNING MEDIA: Is \u201cGeneration Z\u201d shying away from presidential political coverage? They are, according to an exclusive breakdown from Oath -- the Verizon business unit that includes Yahoo, AOL and HuffPost -- of its aggregate news traffic over the past year. The new data shared with POLITICO's Cristiano Lima highlights a growing aversion to White House coverage among those born after 2001, and an increased interest in a more eclectic media diet. While an overwhelming majority of story visits across Oath sites by millennials, designated in this case as those born between 1981 and 2000, went toward coverage of presidential politics, at 87 percent, there was a marked drop off for those born later, with only 56 percent of their aggregate visits focused on West Wing politics. The youngest generation did, however, show a higher proportionate interest in other political stories, with 32 percent of their story hits falling along other political realms, the highest of any age group.\u000a\u000aTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL\u2019S GERARD BAKER IS NOT BACKING DOWN from his reported criticisms of his newsroom\u2019s coverage of President Trump\u2019s Tuesday rally in Phoenix. Baker panned a critical report of the event as \u201ccommentary dressed up as news reporting.\u201d According to The New York Times , which broke the news of Baker\u2019s post-rally admonishments, Baker doubled-down on the defense during a call with editors on Thursday, saying that that an \u201cassertion of challengeable contentions\u201d is not analysis.\u000a\u000a\u2014POLITICO\u2019s Jack Shafer on why he\u2019s \u201cnot mad\u201d at the Journal\u2019s top editor: \u201cComplicating any assessment of Baker\u2019s editorial philosophy is, of course, the fact that Rupert Murdoch owns the Journal, supports Trump and, as Times reporter Maggie Haberman tells us, he talks to the president nearly every day. Given Murdoch\u2019s history with phoning his editors almost daily, he must ring Baker daily, too. You don\u2019t have to connect the dots, Baker critics say, the dots connect themselves, and they glow.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut to fully convince me, you'll have to show me what is there, as opposed to what is not there in the paper that ends up plumping for Trump. Not calling Trump a liar and snipping news analysis from pieces does not automatically equal shilling. You can call it conservative coverage. You can call it soft. But you can\u2019t call it shilling.\u201d Read on here .\u000a\u000aARE JOURNALISTS THE OPPOSITION?: Point: This Nicholas Kristof column in The New York Times. He starts by noting that \u201cwe in journalism deserve to have our feet held to the fire. We make mistakes all the time, and too often we are superficial, sensationalist, unfair, defensive or diverted by shiny objects. Critics are right that we in the national media are often out of touch with working-class America, and distressingly often, we are lap dogs instead of watchdogs. Yet for all our failings, journalism remains an indispensable constraint on power. Trump has systematically tried to delegitimize the institutions that hold him accountable \u2014 courts, prosecutors, investigators, the media \u2014 and that\u2019s the context for his vilification of all them, for we collectively provide monitoring that outrages him.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014Counterpoint: Rich Lowry in this POLITICO Magazine piece. Republicans have always painted the media as an opposing force, but none with the aggressiveness of President Trump. Lowry\u2019s argument? \u201cHe\u2019s pushing against an open door with his audience because the media is, indeed, worse than ever before. As the media environment has fractured, organizations feel less obligation to try to cultivate a broader audience. And as politics becomes more culturally charged, the divide between the heartland and the coasts where the media lives and works becomes even more stark and important.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014In the midst of this debate, White House chief of staff John Kelly is taking matters in his own hands. According to POLITICO\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook, he is instituting a new system to monitor all information that gets to Trump\u2019s desk. The system is \u201cdesigned to ensure that the president won\u2019t see any external policy documents, internal policy memos, agency reports and even news articles that haven\u2019t been vetted.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014Recode\u2019s latest Recode Media podcast features a \u201cguided tour of pro-Trump media, from Drudge to Breitbart to Twitter trolls.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014Speaking of the pro-Trump media, Laura Ingraham\u2019s Lifezette described a photo of last year\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers NBA championship parade as being \u201c5 miles of Trump supporters\u201d in Phoenix. Here\u2019s why that keeps happening.\u000a\u000aNEW YORK TIMES, BREITBART DOMINATE CHARLOTTESVILLE COVERAGE: That\u2019s one of the takeaways from a POLITICO analysis of how Twitter users were exposed to the events unfolding in Virginia. But there\u2019s a catch: liberals and conservatives were treated to widely-divergent views of the violent clashes, with left-leaning users reading reports of Trump\u2019s \u201cunequivocal boost\u201d of white supremacists and right-leaning users reading about Trump blasting the \u201calt-left\u201d media\u2019s \u201cone-sided Charlottesville reporting.\u201d The findings, courtesy of data from Cortico and the Laboratory for Social Machines at the MIT Media Lab Experience, underscore how deeply partisanship impacts news consumption, particularly on social media channels. Experience coverage of the events from across the political spectrum here .\u000a\u000aWHILE WE\u2019RE ON THE SUBJECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA, President Trump\u2019s latest verbal attacks on news outlets and their ensuring coverage of the rally as well as his selective blocking of Twitter followers and the crackdown of white supremacist sites in the wake of Charlottesville have all raised questions about who exactly should be allowed to determine what content ought to be blocked or limited online. So are these latest attempts to mediate what gets disseminated online a positive or negative step for freedom of speech?\u000a\u000a\u2014The short answer: it\u2019s complicated. Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, gives his take on the messy business of regulating controversial content on the web: \u201c[I]n part because of moral outrage, and pressure from media watchdogs and international governments\u2014tech platforms do step up willy-nilly to exert their control over content. Well-intentioned or not, the loose rules and vague promises of technology companies threaten to block the important role of the free media and the ability of the public to stay informed.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014Remember Valerie Plame? Well, she wants to buy Twitter. Why? So she can ban President Trump. \u201cWell, John Oliver joked last week about how we never imagined that the invention of Twitter would lead us to the brink of nuclear Armageddon,\u201d she told Vanity Fair . \u201cA good chuckle, but the people who understand how crises escalate\u2014I worked on counter-proliferation at the C.I.A.\u2014we\u2019re not laughing very hard.

aVWhat happens when a rogue state with a history of bellicose anti-American rhetoric acquires the ability to hit parts of the United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile? Well, we\u2019re about to find out.\u000a\u000aOn July 4, North Korea flight-tested its longest-range proven ballistic missile to date, claiming that it has developed an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of striking the United States. The United States ultimately confirmed North Korea\u2019s claim after initially classifying the projectile as a \u201cland-based, intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM).\u201d U.S. officials now say they believe North Korea successfully flight-tested an ICBM. The missile appears to be a two-stage liquid fuel design. Six months after President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that a North Korean ICBM capability \u201cwon\u2019t happen,\u201d it appears that it has.\u000a\u000aThe consequences of what happened on July 4 are hard to exaggerate. The ICBM test is an important milestone in the overall development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, and crystallizes several ongoing trends in its nuclear force development and strategy. The launch also fundamentally changes the nature of the threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its regional allies, handing the Trump administration a difficult problem it can no longer avoid.\u000a\u000aWhat Is the Hwasong-14 ICBM?\u000a\u000aIt is difficult to overstate just how impressive North Korea\u2019s technological advances have been, all while it has faced significant international pressure and sanctions on its program. A look at the specifics of the missile that was tested, as well as the developmental path it took, provides a sense of how rapidly North Korea has developed its capabilities compared to its peers.\u000a\u000aThe missile that North Korea is calling the Hwasong-14 flew to a range of 934 kilometers, reached an apogee of 2,802 kilometers, and was in the air for 37 minutes. It splashed down inside Japan\u2019s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan, becoming the sixth North Korean missile to do so since a Nodong missile launch last year.\u000a\u000aGiven the range, apogee, and flight time, early open-source assessments estimate that the Hwasong-14\u2019s full flight range capability is well in excess of the 5,500-kilometer cut-off that the United States uses for classifying ballistic missiles as \u201cintercontinental.\u201d (To avoid sending the missile over Japan, North Korea tested it on a lofted trajectory to shorten the overall range \u2014 nearly firing it straight up. By assuming a firing angle that would put the missile on a more standard trajectory, analysts can estimate a minimum demonstrated flight range.) David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated a minimum demonstrated range of 6,700 kilometers, which would allow this missile to deliver a nuclear payload to population centers in Alaska and potentially reach Hawaii with a modified payload. The range could very well exceed 7,000 kilometers, which would bring Honolulu and the headquarters of U.S. Pacific Command within reach. John Schilling, another ballistic missile expert, estimates a \u201cmaximum range of perhaps 8,000 kilometers.\u201d\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s own released images allow us to understand some details about the developmental path this particular ICBM may have taken. The \u201cHwasong-14\u201d appears to be an entirely new missile that had never been seen before. It was not paraded at this year\u2019s April 15 military parade for Kim Il-Sung\u2019s 105th birth anniversary and it had not been seen at earlier parades.\u000a\u000aHowever, the few images that have been released of the missile itself show features that are familiar to anyone who closely watched the May 14 launch of the Hwasong-12 IRBM. (That missile was North Korea\u2019s longest-range missile to be successfully flight tested under the Hwasong-14.) The ICBM\u2019s first stage appears similar to the Hwasong-12, suggesting that it may have been indeed a stepping stone toward this two-stage ICBM.\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-14, like the -12, uses what appears to be a single large booster with four attached vernier engines for steering and does not use any grid fins or other control surfaces. The engines are liquid-fueled and appear mighty similar to the Hwasong-12\u2019s engine, which in turn is similar to the so-called \u201cMarch 18\u201d liquid fuel engine. North Korea tested a liquid fuel engine on March 18 and ominously signaled that the \u201cwhole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries.\u201d The Hwasong-12, and now the Hwasong -14, may have made it clear what Kim Jong-Un meant by that.\u000a\u000aAnother similarity is that the new ICBM uses a converted China-built 16-wheel WS-51200 truck converted into a transporter-erector. This is the second launch to use such a configuration after the Hwasong-12 IRBM test. The WS-51200 was first seen carrying the as-yet untested Hwasong-13 or KN-08 ICBM at a military parade in 2012.\u000a\u000aIn released imagery, the transporter-erector brings the missile to a launch area and erects it on to a static firing table. The launch takes place with the expensive transporter-erector clear of the launch area. It\u2019s unclear whether this configuration is meant to protect the expensive converted Chinese logging trucks or if North Korea would endeavor to use such a configuration operationally.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the use of a transporter-erector for now suggests a still-volatile system and would require significant time to fuel and prepare for first use. Indeed, sources claim the United States detected at least the first stage being fueled. By not preemptively destroying the missile or trying to intercept it, as some have advocated, the United States and the world have gathered valuable intelligence on what North Korea has developed, and how it tests and prepares the missile. North Korea had attempted to test two systems in October 2016, leading to two large explosions that open-source researchers were able to see in satellite imagery. It remains unclear if those were attempts at testing earlier iterations of the Hwasong-12 or Hwasong-14. (U.S. Strategic Command reported those tests as \u201cpresumed\u201d Musudans, another North Korean liquid-fuel IRBM with shorter demonstrated range than the Hwasong-12.)\u000a\u000aThe Hwasong-14\u2019s similarities with previously seen missiles end with its second stage and reentry vehicle, which appear to be total newcomers to the North Korean ballistic missile scene \u2014 and suggest that further development is on the way. Interestingly, North Korea tested a liquid-fuel engine on June 22 \u2014 less than two weeks before this launch \u2014 that was reportedly intended for the upper stage of an ICBM. It appears North Korea may have used that engine in the Hwasong-14 launch. The time between the tests would mimic the gap between the March 18 engine tests and the April 5 flight test attempt for the Hwasong-12 IRBM, which was a failure.\u000a\u000aSignificantly, North Korea appears to have had no trouble with stage separation and reentry with this launch, suggesting that its reentry vehicle technology is certainly good enough to allow for more ambitious ICBM development to longer ranges. Specifically, given the very high apogee for the Hwasong-14\u2019s first test, the reentry vehicle likely experienced conditions in excess of normal ICBM reentry, in terms of both speed and temperature. This test will no doubt have given North Korean engineers valuable information on reentry vehicle survivability, penetration (to help defeat missile defenses), and precision that could be put toward future ICBM development.\u000a\u000aThis is innovation by necessity. After only several years of concerted development, North Korea has tested an ICBM \u2014 albeit a liquid fuel one that may not be the ideal responsive deterrent. By comparison, India, which has had an indigenous missile program for over three decades, has yet to successfully test an ICBM. Once derided as a joke of a program, the North Koreans have displayed a remarkable level of innovation and capability. And although the technological feat achieved by the Hwasong-14 is impressive, there is every reason to believe that it will not be the last surprise Pyongyang reveals to the world.\u000a\u000aIndeed, there will be future ICBM development. North Korea has at least two ICBM prototypes in its inventory that represent different developmental paths toward a longer-range missile that could presumably deliver heavier payloads. As noted above, the new Hwasong-14 leaves much to be desired as a practical ICBM platform. North Korean engineers will be iterating and improving on this design while also pursuing parallel track development for other ICBMs. The July 4 test marks the start, not the end, of a new era in North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program.\u000a\u000aThe State of North Korea\u2019s Ballistic Missile Program\u000a\u000aThe ICBM test itself has understandably dominated the headlines, but Kim\u2019s strategy only becomes clear when we put this event in the context of the last few years: Since February 2017, North Korea has introduced and successfully flight-tested an entirely new suite of ballistic missiles. In the short-range (sub-1000 kilometer) class, we\u2019ve seen the KN-18, or the Scud-C with a maneuverable reentry vehicle, introduced. A maneuverable reentry vehicle is important because it is designed \u2014 given sufficient intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support \u2014 to hit moving targets, such as ships or aircraft carriers, in addition to defeating missile defenses. In the medium-range (1,000 to 2,000 kilometer) class, we\u2019ve seen the Pukkuksong-2 solid-fuel missile introduced and entering mass production in May. In the intermediate-range class, we\u2019ve seen the Hwasong-12 successfully flight tested. And now, North Korea has added an ICBM to its suite. It has also shown off a new coastal defense cruise missile launcher (the Kumsong-3) and declared initial operating capability for the Pongae-5 (KN-06) surface-to-air missile system.\u000a\u000aIf the message in 2016, when 24 ballistic missile tests and two nuclear tests were held, was that North Korea\u2019s missile development is accelerating, the message in 2017 is that Kim is in hot pursuit of a diversified and capable operational nuclear force \u2014 North Korea\u2019s own \u201cfull spectrum\u201d deterrent. The addition of an ICBM to the mix is the most significant, but also the least surprising development. North Korea has signaled serious intent to acquire an ICBM since its first flight-test of the Taepodong-1 back in 1998, which led the United States to negotiate a missile-launch moratorium that would incidentally collapse on July 4, 2006. Second, in the past year and a half, Pyongyang has shown off advances in its missile nose cones and liquid-fuel engines that have steadily signaled that a successful flight test like the one we saw on July 4 was imminent. That North Korea eventually tested an ICBM is not a shock (though the speed with which it did so is certainly surprising). The real story is the diversity of North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable missiles, not just the ICBM but the shorter and medium-range missiles as well.\u000a\u000aThere is some good news. North Korea\u2019s nuclear force ambitions will be constrained by its ability to procure adequate amounts of fissile material. North Korea watchers have been anticipating a sixth nuclear test for quite a while, and presume it is only a matter of time. The delay could signal difficulties on the warhead design or production side (or, to be fair, something else altogether). In other words, North Korea\u2019s manufacturing capacity for new and ever-more advanced missiles may outpace its fissile material stockpiles and actual nuclear warhead development. Though estimates vary and North Korea hinted it is looking into composite pits for its nuclear bombs that combine plutonium and highly enriched uranium, it will likely still be constrained in its targeting choices due to stockpile limits.\u000a\u000aImplications for North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Strategy\u000a\u000aWhat strategy does North Korea hope to develop with all these capabilities? The contours of North Korea\u2019s nuclear strategy have been relatively clear at least since the so-called \u201cmaps of doom\u201d were released, depicting a portfolio of regional military (soft counter-force) targets that would degrade the ability of the United States and its allies to mount and sustain conventional military options, as well as U.S. homeland targets that included a variety of military commands and population centers.\u000a\u000aOne of us has termed this an asymmetric escalation strategy \u2014 threatening to use nuclear weapons to defeat a conventional attack by \u201casymmetrically escalating\u201d the conflict to the nuclear level. Under this strategy, the rationale for developing shorter and medium-range missiles that can defeat American and allied forces in theater is obvious. However, asymmetric escalation only avoids suicide if it can deter American nuclear retaliation, which requires the development of a capability to hold the American homeland at risk. Enter the need for the ICBM.\u000a\u000aIf this sounds familiar, it should. This is exactly Pakistan\u2019s nuclear strategy against India (in addition to technological cooperation between Pakistan and North Korea, we are also seeing strategic mimicking). The difference is that Pakistan does not require ICBMs to hold its primary adversary, neighboring India, at risk. North Korea does. North Korea\u2019s strategy was telegraphed well before it could be implemented: Use short-range nuclear capabilities to defeat a conventional invasion, and long-range ICBM capabilities to deter American nuclear retaliation by holding U.S. homeland targets at risk. On July 4, North Korea completed the puzzle when it demonstrated the credible (if unreliable) ability to hold targets in America (if not the continental United States) at risk.\u000a\u000aBased on its deterrence strategy, we should not expect North Korea to stop with the Hwasong-14. Kim Jong-Un\u2019s plan calls for longer-range capabilities than this, and North Korea tends to do what it says. Expect longer-range missiles to appear in the near future, including ones that can reach America\u2019s eastern seaboard. Down the road, these may appear in larger numbers and with greater responsiveness, such as solid fuel missiles. We underestimate North Korea\u2019s ability to develop the capabilities it needs at our own peril.\u000a\u000aSo what? North Korea was nuclear before, it is nuclear after. What\u2019s the big deal? The big deal is that now the United States cannot threaten a conventional invasion of North Korea without risking direct nuclear attack on its homeland. Not only does this curtail American defense and deterrence options, it has significant implications for its allies in East Asia. North Korea\u2019s ability to hold the U.S. homeland at risk cuts a knife through the credibility of American extended deterrence commitments to Japan and South Korea. With North Korea developing the ability to strike the United States, Seoul and Tokyo may soon wonder whether the United States would truly give up New York or Los Angeles for them \u2014 in other words, would the United States still respond in kind to a nuclear attack on an East Asian city if it meant provoking retaliation on U.S. soil?\u000a\u000aIndeed, the core strategic implication of North Korea\u2019s ICBM development is an old Cold War goodie known as \u201cdecoupling.\u201d That is, Bonn, Paris, and London feared that with Soviet ICBMs pointed at the U.S. homeland, American security guarantees in continental Europe were not credible. It is one thing to expose American military forces forward deployed in theater; it is quite another to expose American population centers to nuclear retaliation. It is part of what motivated de Gaulle\u2019s France to pursue an independent nuclear deterrent. As hard as it may be to deter Kim, reassuring our allies may now be even harder.\u000a\u000aPolicy Options for Dealing With an ICBM-Armed North Korea\u000a\u000aWhat options does the United States now have to address the North Korean threat? Wishing the threat away or hoping it will dissipate on its own remains a fantasy, as it has been for some years now. Furthermore, so long as China fears North Korean collapse more than it fears the hermit kingdom\u2019s nuclear weapons program, this is not a problem the United States can outsource to China. The introduction of a nuclear ICBM does little to change these realities. Reported efforts to slow the program, such as cyber interventions like the so-called \u201cleft of launch\u201d strategy, coupled with \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d have clearly not hobbled the pace of development sufficiently, and patience in Washington \u2014 particularly with Trump \u2014 appears to be running thin. And such efforts could, at best, only slow North Korea, certainly not stop or roll its program back.\u000a\u000aThe United States and regional partners thus have three fundamental policy options for facing down an ICBM-armed North Korea. The first is to pursue the destruction of North Korea\u2019s new capability, i.e. a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d hard counter-force strike. This would have to be a sudden strike, because giving any warning time would prompt Pyongyang to just use its nuclear weapons before it loses them. But make no mistake, this guarantees a war, and probably a nuclear war. Even if the United States could find, fix, and destroy all of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and delivery systems, Seoul would almost certainly suffer unacceptable damage through conventional firepower alone. And if the United States missed a couple nuclear systems, particularly those that North Korea has so doggedly tested to defeat missile defenses, they would certainly be used on whatever targets they could find. The window for thinking about disarming North Korea by force without guaranteeing millions of fatalities has probably long closed.\u000a\u000aIf the costs of a regional war are unacceptable, a second option is to practice deterrence and learn to live with an ICBM-armed North Korea. This option strikes us as the most realistic, though a very hard sell to allies whose appetite for reassurance extends beyond \u201cwe will just keep North Korea at bay with our military forces.\u201d But at least for Washington, living with hundreds of ICBMs pointed at its territory is nothing new. A North Korean ICBM would be cause for unique concern if there were reason to believe either that Kim\u2019s nuclear strategy was premised on a nuclear first strike against the U.S. homeland (it isn\u2019t) or that Kim was irrational (he\u2019s not). Practicing deterrence would presumably require heavier investment by the United States, South Korea, and Japan at the conventional level. It would also lead to continued investment in missile defense systems and counterforce capabilities, which could exacerbate North Korean insecurity and lead to a larger and larger North Korean arsenal. And in a crisis, deterrence could fail and option two could quickly bleed into option one. It is not hard for the United States to directly deter North Korea. But it is very hard to do that while also extending the deterrence that our allies want, without triggering an arms race.\u000a\u000aThe third option is to consider negotiating with North Korea. This approach has been tried before, both bilaterally and multilaterally, and has always been a difficult sell to those in the policymaking community, who correctly note that it is North Korea that has been consistently in the wrong for years now, carrying out ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Pyongyang also maintains little goodwill or trust with prospective interlocutors given its decision to violate the spirit of the 1994 U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework by starting a clandestine uranium enrichment program and its refusal to recommit to denuclearization. Still, the Agreed Framework, despite its collapse in 2002, did succeed in delaying North Korea\u2019s ultimate acquisition of the bomb by freezing its plutonium stockpile. If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from the agreement, it\u2019s that negotiations can buy time, even with a dearth of trust between the United States and North Korea.\u000a\u000aHowever, one new problem with negotiations that moots many of the conditions that allowed for a freeze deal like the Agreed Framework is that North Korea, by showing us a working ICBM, has upped the ante and gained considerable leverage in any future talks. North Korea would presumably acquiesce to a freeze on its ballistic missile and nuclear testing, but its demands for concessions can now grow credibly steeper. Any prospective agreement with North Korea would require explicit acceptance of their nuclear state status and significant rollbacks to the U.S. conventional military presence in the Northeast Asian theater, both of which are nonstarters for the United States.\u000a\u000aThere are thus no good options at the moment for addressing the North Korean threat, only bad ones and catastrophic ones. North Korea\u2019s first successful flight test of an ICBM is a significant development that represents the culmination of years of research and development, but also the start of a new era in terms of how Pyongyang will think of its own capabilities and strategy. North Korean nuclear strategy, far from being irrational, was in fact predictable \u2014 states facing conventionally superior forces threatening to invade them have little choice but to seek first use capabilities to defeat a conventional attack, as well as long-range strategic nuclear systems to deter any subsequent nuclear retaliation. It is the only rationalizable nuclear strategy in an otherwise insane and paradoxical business. North Korea said it was going to do this, and it now has. This program is off to the races and the attending strategic dilemmas \u2014 how to deter North Korea, reassure U.S. allies, and defend the United States \u2014 can no longer be kicked down the road. The age of the North Korean ICBM is upon us and the Trump administration can no longer avoid this reality, thanks to an Independence Day fireworks display by Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aAnkit Panda (@nktpnd) is a senior editor at The Diplomat and an independent researcher.

McConnell, for his part, said Trump had \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d for what could be accomplished by Congress.\u000a\u000aThursday morning, McConnell said the president, along with the GOP-controlled House and Senate, \u201cis very oriented toward rural and small-town America.\u201d He heaped praise on the president\u2019s agenda and accomplishments, celebrating Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court and the reversal of several Obama-era regulations.\u000a\u000aMcConnell said the recovery from 2008\u2019s recession had been \u201ctepid\u201d because of an \u201cexperiment\u201d by the administration of former President Barack Obama in \u201coverregulation\u201d and \u201ctax increases on the most productive citizens and businesses.\u201d Trump and the Republican Congress, the majority leader said, is \u201ctaking our foot off the brake and putting it on the accelerator\u201d with the goal of achieving a 3 percent growth rate in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, a number the White House cites often in its economic proposals.\u000a\u000aThe majority leader also praised Trump\u2019s selection of Sonny Perdue to be secretary of agriculture, joking that it was a \u201cquaint notion\u201d that someone with a farming background would be given the job.\u000a\u000aOn another of the president\u2019s policy goals, tax reform, McConnell recalled the 1986 rewrite of the tax code, a bipartisan effort that was supported by prominent Democrats including Sen. Bill Bradley and Rep. Dick Gephardt. McConnell said he expected no such bipartisan cooperation this time around and that he had been told as much by Democrats in the Senate, although he would welcome it.\u000a\u000aOverall, McConnell said Trump\u2019s election represented a dramatic shift in Washington, away from the coasts and toward the more rural center of the nation.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look at the federal government today and last year\u2019s elections, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to characterize what happened last year in many respects as a comeback for rural and small-town America,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the map of last year\u2019s election, a sea of red between the coasts. Our friends on the other side are largely dominated by the coasts, by big cities and that characterizes so many of the debates that we have in Washington. I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say this Congress wants to look after rural America.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThis Monday greeted North Korea watchers with a one-two punch: an analysis by IISS Senior Fellow for Missile Defence Michael Elleman, plus a companion article in the New York Times, positing a connection between North Korea\u2019s new and powerful rocket engines and Ukraine\u2019s space-launch industry.\u000a\u000aThe gist of Elleman\u2019s thesis was that engines powering both North Korea\u2019s Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, or IRBMs, and the first stage of its Hwasong-14 intercontinental-range ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, could not have been produced in North Korea.\u000a\u000aHe judged them, instead, to be modified RD-250 engines, originally designed and built in the Soviet Union, and \u201cprobably acquired through illicit channels operating in Russia and/or Ukraine.\u201d This transfer would have taken place recently, in response to repeated failures of another rocket technology, the engine associated with the Musudan missile, in 2016.\u000a\u000aElleman also entertained the possibility that employees at the Yuzhnoye company in Ukraine might have become \u201csusceptible to exploitation by unscrupulous traders, arms dealers and transnational criminals operating in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere,\u201d perhaps leading to the transfer of a \u201cfew dozen\u201d engines from storage sites.\u000a\u000aWilliam Broad and David Sanger of the New York Times, for their part, went still further, claiming that classified U.S. intelligence assessments indicated that the engines had been acquired on the black market. They even reported that unspecified U.S. government \u201cinvestigators and experts\u201d had identified Ukraine\u2019s Yuzhmash rocket engine plant as \u201cprobably\u201d the source of the engines.\u000a\u000aThe responses were harsh and swift. Both Yuzhnoye, which designs rocket engines, and Yuzhmash, which builds them, are Ukrainian state enterprises. Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council quickly issued a strong denial. (It added that Monday\u2019s reports sprang from an \u201canti-Ukrainian campaign\u201d instigated by Russia\u2019s intelligence services\u2014a baseless, distasteful, and wholly unnecessary claim.)\u000a\u000aYuzhmash issued its own furious rejoinder, as did Yuzhnoye. Using a lighter touch, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko sarcastically thanked the Times \u201cfor the attention it has drawn to Ukraine\u2019s rocket and space industry in a gracious although not exactly satisfactory manner.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat wasn\u2019t all. The U.S. intelligence community, which usually keeps mum, signaled its own unhappiness with the New York Times, telling the PBS NewsHour, Reuters, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Times that the story was flat wrong.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have intelligence to suggest that North Korea is not reliant on imports of engines,\u201d an official told reporters. \u201cInstead, we judge they have the ability to produce the engines themselves.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Diplomat carried a similar report, while suggesting that the new North Korean engines were nevertheless considered probable \u201cvariants\u201d of the Soviet RD-250.\u000a\u000aFor a time, North Korea\u2019s willingness to sell weapons to virtually anyone made it the world\u2019s leading missile supplier\u000a\u000aThe basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment has not been shared, but it is still possible to sketch out how North Korea makes its liquid-fueled rocket engines using open sources. It also is apparent why North Korea\u2019s liquid-fueled engines have a Soviet technological heritage.\u000a\u000aFOREIGN ORIGINS\u000a\u000aThe origins of North Korea\u2019s missile program have already been described, notably by Joseph Bermudez in a 1999 MIIS paper and Daniel Pinkston in a 2008 SSI paper.\u000a\u000aTo summarize, North Korea is believed to have received Soviet-made Scud missiles from Egypt in the late 1970s. Drawing on an earlier period of training and cooperation with China, North Korean specialists \u201creverse-engineered\u201d the Scuds. The North Korean munitions industry was producing its own copies by the mid-1980s. Exports to Iran started a few years later, toward the end of the Iran-Iraq war, in exchange for oil supplies.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s next steps were to develop a scaled-up, medium-range version of the Scud, which Western analysts call the Rodong, along with a variety of Scud types with extended ranges.\u000a\u000aThe Rodong was flight-tested in North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran in the 1990s, with mixed results early on. Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Syria, also bought North Korean Scuds. For a time, North Korea\u2019s willingness to sell weapons to virtually anyone made it the world\u2019s leading missile supplier.\u000a\u000aIn the following years, the North Koreans appear to have provided training and equipment for missile production in Iran, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, and possibly also Myanmar, helping these customers establish their own missile factories. In 1999, Indian authorities searched a North Korean vessel in port, discovering a substantial amount of Scud missile production equipment and materials bound for Libya.\u000a\u000aThe process of acquiring and absorbing foreign technologies was not entirely smooth\u000a\u000aThe North Koreans also began combining their rocket engines into new configurations. In 1998, North Korea flew its first space launcher, called the Taepodong-1 in the West. It used a Rodong for a first stage and a Scud for the second stage, topped with a small solid-fueled third stage. The so-called Taepodong-2 first flew in 2006, resulting in a spectacular failure.\u000a\u000aIt underwent further development and improvements, eventually becoming a workable launcher. Its first stage consists of a cluster of four Rodong engines, as well as four small steering engines, or \u201cverniers.\u201d South Korea\u2019s Navy retrieved the remnants of these first-stage engines from the sea after successful launches in 2012 and 2016.\u000a\u000aAfter careful examination, the South Koreans informed the United Nations that the only foreign-made components in the engines were salvaged ball bearings from Soviet missiles. A handful of non-engine components in the first stage were also found to have been imported, but by and large, the rocket was an indigenous product.\u000a\u000aThe process of acquiring and absorbing foreign technologies was not entirely smooth. North Korea has poured substantial resources into national defense. It has long had its own research institutions and industrial facilities, and was able to train some of its scientists in the Soviet Union and other communist countries during the Cold War.\u000a\u000aBut its leadership came to the conclusion that the country had hobbled its own progress through an excessively strict interpretation of the ideology of self-reliance. In 1985, Kim Jong Il, the designated heir, berated senior Korean Workers\u2019 Party officials on this point, declaring: \u201cIn order to develop science and technology quickly you should introduce advanced science and technology from abroad.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt present,\u201d he said, \u201cour officials hesitate to introduce advanced science and technology because they are of the opinion that their introduction will go against the requirement of developing Juche-orientated science and technology\u2026 This has forced quite a few people returning from abroad to withdraw their suggestion of importing modern plant or machines and equipment based on the latest science and technology which they have seen in the foreign country and to say that nothing special is available.\u201d\u000a\u000aInstead, Kim urged Party leaders to aggressively import foreign manufacturing equipment, encourage scientific exchanges, and develop systematic plans for advancing North Korea\u2019s own scientific and technical capabilities.\u000a\u000aThese directives set the stage for aggressive recruitment of Soviet missile specialists in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After the collapse of the Soviet economy and state, scientists and engineers in the isolated nuclear and missile \u201ccities\u201d were in desperate straits, becoming vulnerable to enticements from abroad.\u000a\u000aThe leadership came to the conclusion that the country had hobbled its own progress through an excessively strict interpretation of the ideology of self-reliance\u000a\u000aIn the early 1990s, looking to strengthen ties with a thriving South Korea, Russia began to publicize the expulsion of North Korean diplomats for their activities in this field. In one infamous episode in October 1992, they even stopped a large group of missile experts from Russia\u2019s Makayev Design Bureau from boarding a flight from Moscow to Pyongyang.\u000a\u000aDespite these setbacks, the North Koreans appear to have scored major gains in design information and know-how from this period. Not only did their space and missile programs make advances in the 1990s, but in the following decades, they began to introduce more advanced Soviet-origin missile technologies than the 1950s-era Scuds.\u000a\u000aA copy of the engine from the 1970s-era Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile powered North Korea\u2019s new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called the Musudan in the West. But quality control problems emerged. When the Musudan was finally flight-tested in 2016, it failed repeatedly, succeeding fully just once.\u000a\u000aA NEW ENGINE\u000a\u000aFollowing this pattern, North Korea\u2019s newest family of engines did not appear overnight. In November 2013, the Washington Free Beacon reported that North Korea was developing a new, heavy liquid-fueled engine with help from Iran\u2019s Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, or SHIG, describing it as an \u201c80 ton\u201d engine\u2014a measure of the thrust it produces.\u000a\u000aIn January 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a press release confirming the outlines of this account by imposing sanctions on specific SHIG officials for their involvement in the development of the new North Korean engine.\u000a\u000aThat September, the North Koreans gave the world a glimpse of the new engine in a \u201cstatic\u201d test on the ground, describing it as the basis of a new heavy space launcher\u2014a program that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un first mentioned in public in April 2012.\u000a\u000aAs Elleman and other observers have noted, the engine seen in September 2016 resembles one-half of the two-chamber Soviet RD-250 engine. The technological debts owed by North Korea\u2019s space and missile program to its Cold War-era Soviet predecessor run deep, and the \u201c80-ton\u201d engine appears to be no exception.\u000a\u000aHow much of a relationship the engine used in the single stage of the Hwasong-12 and the first stage of the Hwasong-14 have to the \u201c80-ton\u201d engine is not entirely clear. Some basic features appear to be the same, but this new engine, first unveiled by the North Koreans in March 2017, is noticeably different in other respects.\u000a\u000aAlso unclear is whether North Korea acquired any RD-250 design information in the bonanza years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, but only recently became able to reproduce it successfully, with help from Iranian specialists.\u000a\u000aIt is also possible that they managed to acquire crucial data more recently. There is at least one indication of the continued pursuit of up-to-date foreign design information.\u000a\u000aA UN report issued in 2013 provides the most detailed available account of an episode at the Yuzhnoye Design Office in 2011. Two North Korean officials stationed in Belarus went to Ukraine, where they sought to gain access to photographs of secret documents on advanced rocket designs held at Yuzhnoye. The Ukrainian authorities caught them and tried them, sentencing them to eight years\u2019 imprisonment in 2012.\u000a\u000aThe technological debts owed by North Korea\u2019s space and missile program to its Cold War-era Soviet predecessor run deep\u000a\u000aCONFUSING ACCOUNTS\u000a\u000aThe IISS report mangles this incident, describing it not as an attempt to get pictures of secret documents containing design information, but as \u201can attempt to procure missile hardware.\u201d Similarly, it describes North Korean activities in the USSR in the 1980s and 1990s not in terms of recruitment of specialists, but as an \u201cillicit network that funneled Scud, Rodong and R-27 (Musudan) hardware to North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis claim reflects an opinion held by some rocketry experts that the Rodong must have secretly been developed in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, mass-produced, and finally exported to North Korea in the 1990s, all without prior detection.\u000a\u000aThis assumption that North Korea\u2014contrary to the understanding of most North Korea specialists\u2014has never learned to build rocket engines, but has instead had a free hand to import them at various times, without detection by foreign intelligence agencies\u2014is the source of confusion that underpins this week\u2019s IISS report and the accompanying the New York Times article.\u000a\u000aIt leads to a conclusion that the new engines must come from somewhere else, so where else but Russia or Ukraine, where similar engines were designed and built? It is this line of reasoning, not any nefarious influence from Moscow, that led to Elleman\u2019s highly doubtful conclusion that North Korea\u2019s new March 2017 engine must have been made either by Yuzhmash or its Russian counterpart, Energomash.\u000a\u000aIf one adheres to the view that North Korea can only be an importer, then each new development naturally must involve an exporter.\u000a\u000aRARE GLIMPSES OF DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENT\u000a\u000aContrary to the IISS report\u2019s assertion that no facilities for producing large liquid-fueled engines are known to exist in North Korea, a certain amount of information is already available about where North Korea makes missiles. Defectors who left the country during the famine of the mid-to-late 1990s included people with knowledge of the missile program.\u000a\u000aTwo notable accounts that are available to the public were offered in testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in October 1997. Ko Young Hwan, a former diplomat, described the training and employment of his brother as a designer of rocket engines for ballistic missiles, before being transferred to a program for the development of anti-ship missiles.\u000a\u000aChoi Ju Hwal, a former colonel in the Korean People\u2019s Army, who had served in a military trading company, named four specific facilities as involved in missile production, including the \u201cNumber 125 Factory\u201d on the outskirts of Pyongyang. There, he stated, military delegations from Iran and Egypt visited at different times to inspect missile assembly lines.\u000a\u000aThe Number 125 Factory\u2014also known as the Tae-Sung Machine Plant or the Chamjin Missile Factory\u2014also received a senior military delegation from Myanmar (Burma) in November 2008. The delegation\u2019s trip report, illustrated with photographs, was later leaked to an opposition group, which translated it and published it online.\u000a\u000aA certain amount of information is already available about where North Korea makes missiles\u000a\u000aOn November 28, 2008, according to the report, \u201cfrom 09:05 until 10:10 local time, the group went to Surface to Surface Missile (SCUD Missile) Factory and was welcomed by the Director Kim Su Gil. The group observed in detail how missiles were produced in the factory.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe factory, it continued, \u201cis located in a suburb in Pyongyang. It produces SCUD missiles. The component producing lines are kept in the underground tunnel. There are also above-ground factory where missile engines are assembled, where missile bodies are produced and assembled, and where complete missiles are assembled. In the factories that produce complete missiles, there are places that produce and assemble SCUD-D and SCUD-E. While SCUD-D can shoot a target up to 700 kilometers away, SCUD-E [Rodong] can shoot up to 1,500 kilometers, and SCUD-F [Musudan] can shoot up to 3,000 kilometers.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn analysis of satellite photographs of the facility and nearby entrances to underground facilities was published by Joseph Bermudez in 2011.\u000a\u000aKim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s third-generation leader, has made a series of visits to the Chamjin plant. He appeared there at least twice in March 2016. On the first occasion, he observed a ground test of a new heat shield for missile reentry. The second time was his infamous photo opportunity with a variety of missiles, as well as what was described as a nuclear warhead.\u000a\u000aUNDERESTIMATING PYONGYANG\u000a\u000aAfter the 1991 war with Iraq, international inspectors gained deep insights into the nature of the Iraqi missile program. Iraq\u2019s engineers started with Scud missiles imported from the Soviet Union, and later worked with Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missiles.\u000a\u000aTo improve or repurpose these weapons, they cut apart airframes and modified them. They did not develop their own robust missile industry. At one point in the late 1990s, they even turned to the North Koreans for new missiles, who ultimately did not deliver any.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea is not Iraq. By the standards of a poor country, it is heavily industrialized, and has long placed a heavy emphasis on military technology and production.\u000a\u000aIts people underwent the rigors of famine in the 1990s in no small part because of Kim Jong Il\u2019s decision to throw national resources at developing missiles and space launchers rather than food. From a certain narrow perspective, that gamble has paid off.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s missile designers remain decades behind their counterparts in countries like Russia or China, and they continue to lean on the technological legacy of the Soviet Union. But we can be confident that they are hard at work, on both liquid-fueled engines and solid rocket motors.\u000a\u000aThe new engines of September 2016 and March 2017 are probably not the last they will produce.\u000a\u000aEdited by Oliver Hotham

aVRyan: 'I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s interested in having a shutdown'\u000a\u000aHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday he did not think Republican lawmakers are interested in shutting down the government over funding for President Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised border wall.\u000a\u000aTrump told the crowd at a rally Tuesday night in Phoenix, \u201cbelieve me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall,\u201d a promise that prompted the crowd to chant \u201cbuild that wall.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut Ryan (R-Wis.), who spoke to reporters during a visit to Intel Corp. offices in Oregon, said the House has already passed border security legislation that includes money for a wall. He said lawmakers shouldn't have to choose between keeping the government open and making good on the president\u2019s border security pledge.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don\u2019t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included. And Congress, in the House, has already done its work on this issue. There are very legitimate problems and concerns on the border that need to be addressed,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s interested in having a shutdown. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in our interests to do so while we work on doing what we actually said we would do, what we\u2019ve done already in the House and we need to do, which is to control our border. So I don\u2019t think you have to choose between the two.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongress must pass funding legislation by the end of next month in order to avoid a government shutdown, and lawmakers are scheduled to have just 12 working days after their Sept. 5 return before the deadline hits. Ryan said he expects Congress will keep the government open via a short-term continuing resolution, as opposed to a full appropriations bill, because the schedule won\u2019t offer sufficient time for the Senate to process the latter.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact is though, given the time of year it is and the rest of the appropriations we have to do, we\u2019re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process, particularly in the Senate. So that\u2019s something that I think we all recognize and understand, that we\u2019re going to have to have some more time to complete our appropriations process,\u201d the speaker said.\u000a\u000aAsked if that meant a continuing resolution, he replied, \u201cI think that will probably be necessary, yes, because I can\u2019t imagine the Senate will be able to process the appropriations bill as quickly as the House is.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

But if you're among those who liked what you heard, you should also know those words won't come cheap.\u000a\u000aBy alienating so much of America, including his most important allies in the Republican Party and in protest business world, Donald Trump may have irreparably damaged his ability to deliver on his campaign promises.\u000a\u000aTrump needs Congress to get any of his big campaign promises done -- promises like the wall, tax reform, ObamaCare repeal, a big infrastructure plan.\u000a\u000aBut this week, because of what he said, his allies are deserting him.\u000a\u000aFor the country at large, the main concern is that the president failed to clearly reject racism or to rally the nation in a time of crisis.\u000a\u000a(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ (voice-over): Moments of crisis have historically been an opportunity for a president to show strength, compassion, to heal divisions.

I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unfair.\u000a\u000a(VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: But when confronted with the biggest, most violent white supremacist demonstration in years, one that took the life of an anti-racist protester, there was no healing.\u000a\u000aTRUMP: It looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest, because you know, I don't know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit.\u000a\u000aSo I'll tell you this, there are two sides to a story.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Those words did not unite the nation. And while the president was clear in his condemnation of Heather Heyer's accused murderer, his overall message was no comfort to her mother.\u000a\u000aSUSAN BRO, MOTHER OF HEATHER HEYER: I'm not talking to the president now. I'm sorry...\u000a\u000aUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What did you...\u000a\u000aBRO: -- after what he said about my child.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, among Trump's closest advisers, said the president may not understand the extent of the damage.\u000a\u000aNEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I think that he is much more isolated than he thinks he is. He has much weaker support in the Congress than he thinks he does.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: That may be an understatement. Among the Republicans speaking out, South Carolina's Tim Scott, who called the president's words indefensible.\u000a\u000aSEN. TIM SCOTT (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised when Tuesday happens.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Tennessee's Bob Corker, once a Trump vice presidential prospect, questioned his capacity to lead.\u000a\u000aCORKER: He also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation.\u000a\u000a(END VIDEO TAPE)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And so the question this morning, when a president's own party questions if he understands the character of this nation, can that president still be the unifier Donald Trump hoped to be, the unifier this country needs?\u000a\u000aWe have one sign this morning the president may actually be headed in the opposite direction, toward more division. Trump's long-time chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who left the White House Friday to rejoin Breitbart News, giving this ominous warning today to The Washington Post: "if the Republican Party on Capitol Hill gets behind the president on his plans and not theirs, it will all be sweetness and light, be one big happy family." But Bannon added with a smile that he does not expect sweetness anytime soon.\u000a\u000aIf the president and Bannon do go to war with fellow Republicans, they will likely be counting on support from evangelical leaders, long some of the president's closest allies. In fact, when we asked the White House for an official who could appear on this program today to speak on behalf of the president, they pointed us to our next guest, evangelical leader and Liberty University president Jerry Fallwell Jr. Fallwell was an early Trump supporter, endorsing him before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. They were together again in May of this year when President Trump returned to Liberty University to deliver the commencement address.\u000a\u000a(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aTRUMP: We must always remember that we share one home and one glorious destiny, whether we are brown, black, or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.\u000a\u000a(END VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And Jerry Fallwell Jr. joins me now. Thanks for joining us this morning, Mr. Fallwell.\u000a\u000aOn Twitter this week, you praised what you called the president's bold, truthful statement about Charlottesville saying you were so proud of Donald Trump. But the president said Tuesday, there were quote very fine people on both sides. Who were those very fine people marching with the neo-Nazis?\u000a\u000aJERRY FALLWELL JR., PRESIDENT, LIBERTY UNIVERSITY: The bold and truthful statements I was referring to were his willingness to call evil and terrorism by its name, to identify the groups, the Nazis, the KKK, the white supremacists. And that's something a leader should do. And I admire him for that.\u000a\u000aYou know, he -- President Trump is something we haven't had in national leadership in a long time. He's substance over form. So many of our politicians, recent leaders, national leaders, have been form over substance. They tell people what they want to hear. They sugar-coat everything, or they have sugar-coated everything. And I think the American people have gotten sort of thin-skinned and I think they need to listen to the substance of what he said.\u000a\u000aThe only groups he identified by name as evil and causing what happened in Charlottesville were the Nazis, KKK, and the white supremacists. That's what I thought was bold and truthful.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Well, let me tell you what he said, though, let's go back to this. He said, there were very fine people on both sides. Do you believe there were very fine people on both sides?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: He has inside information that I don't have. I don't know if there were historical purists there who were trying to preserve some statues. I don't know.\u000a\u000aBut he had information I didn't have. And I believe that he spoke what was...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: What made you think he knew that...\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I think he saw videos of who was there. I think he was talking about what he had seen, information that he had that I don't have.\u000a\u000aAll I know is it was pure evil. The media has tried to paint this as Republican versus Democrat, black versus white, Jew versus gentile, but it's just pure evil versus good. And that's what we all need to unite behind. We all need to unite behind stopping evil, whether it's Timothy McVeigh who is the terrorist in Oklahoma City, or it's Muslim terrorists in Barcelona, or it's somebody flying a plane into the World Trade Center, it's all evil.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: But when you say things like that, when you say it's all evil, but you say you're so proud of Donald Trump, that's the message that resonated. It didn't resonate that you think he might have some information.\u000a\u000aLet me also tell you what the chair of the RNC, Romney McDaniel said on Good Morning America this week, that the second people who joined that demonstration saw Nazi flags they should have turned tail. The second you join a group that has a Nazi flag or is joining the KKK, there is no good there. There is no good KKK member, there is no nice neo-Nazi.\u000a\u000aSo I'm still intrigued by your idea that Donald Trump somehow knows there were some good people there.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I don't know that to be the fact -- I just know that it's totally true what you just said, there's no good KKK, there's no good white supremacist.\u000a\u000aI have lived in Lynchburg, Virginia for 55 years. I went to law school at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. I lived there for three yeras. I never have met a white supremist member of a hate group in all my years in that part of the country. That is not what our central Virginia community is about. And Terry McAuliffe, our governor, was right when he said these people needed to go home. They're not of Virginia. They're not about Virginia. And they are all evil.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: So, would you say, given what you know, there were no very fine people on that side, that other -- the side of the neo-Nazis?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I don't have that information. All I know is those people are pure evil. And there's no moral equivalency -- the secretary of the Treasury said this morning that Donald Trump does not believe there is any moral equivalency.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: But back to the RNC statement. You should turn tail if there are neo-Nazis there. And you're still staying you're still not sure if there weren't very fine people on that side.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I think this should -- if something showed up and they saw that they were marching beside somebody who hates blacks, who hates Jews, who wants to do violence, I think they should just walk away, yes.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: The president also said there is blame on both sides. Susan Bro, the mother of the woman killed in the car attack, Heather Heyer, said she wouldn't talk to the president, as we heard there, because he equated counter protesters with the KKK. Let's listen.\u000a\u000a(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aSUSAN BRO, HEATHER HEYER'S MOTHER: I saw an actual clip of him at a press conference equating the protesters, like Miss Heyer, with the KKK and the white supremacists. You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying I'm sorry.\u000a\u000a(END VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: What would you say to that mother?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I think the president has made it very clear that there is no moral equivalency between what the counter protesters did, even though maybe some of them resorted to violence in response, there's no moral equivalence between that and somebody driving his car into a crowd because he hates people of other races. That's wrong. That's just evil. There's no two ways about it. And the president has made that clear. His secretary of the Treasury said it this morning.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Do you think he could have been clearer?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I think he...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: You've heard Republicans on the Hill. You have heard...\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: One of the reasons I supported him is because he doesn't say what's politically correct, he says what is is in his heart, what he believes, and sometimes that gets him in trouble. But he does not have a racist bone in his body. I know him well. He is working so hard to help minorities and people in the inner cities up through -- he says school choice is the civil rights issue of our time. Betsy DeVos has been traveling the country trying to promote school choice to help inner city youth get to choose which schools they attend and not be stuck in a public school that's failing in a big city, and he's doing so many other things to bring job back to the inner city.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Let's stay with this for a moment. An NPR report this morning says that a growing number of Liberty University graduates are preparing to return their diplomas in protest of your continuing support for President Trump. Chris Gaumer, a 2006 graduate, and former student government association president, told NPR that it was a simple decision. In defending the president's comments, Jerry Falwell Junior is making himself, and it seems to me, the university he represents, complicit.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: He completely misunderstands my support. My support for the president is his bold and truthful willingness to call terrorist groups by their names, and that's something we haven't seen in presidents in recent years.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Well, let's stay on that point. When you endorsed Mr. Trump last year in an op-ed, you criticized President Obama over his handling of ISIS saying his policies had the intended or unintended effect of breathing life into the lungs of the terrorist group, adding that President Obama and Hillary Clinton most definitely signal to Islamic State leaders that they had no intention of seriously challenging them or even of calling radical Islamic terrorism by its name.\u000a\u000aif that is is what you believe, then, is President Trump making the same mistake by not unequivocally calling the attack in Charlottesville domestic terrorism, domestic terrorism.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: Yes. He's doing exactly the opposite of what I was criticizing Obama and Clinton for not doing, he's calling them by their name. He's calling the Nazis and white supremacists evil.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: He's not calling it domestic terrorism. The president said Tuesday, you could call it terrorism, you can call it murder, you can call it whatever you want. Why hasn't he called the attack in Charlottesville domestic terrorism?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: He did. He said that is something for the officials to determine. Call it what you want. He said it was pure evil. He said the driver of that car is nothing but a murderer. How clear is...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: He's the president.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: How clear can he be? I don't understand.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: He could be clearer by calling it domestic terrorism. So, you don't think he needs to do that because other officials who have said it? Words matter. He's the one who was criticizing, and you, too, President Obama for not calling it Islamic terrorism.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: I think he did. He said it was -- he said you can call it terrorism, you can call it evil, you can call it murder. I'm not sure exactly what his words were. But he never said it was not terrorism.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: OK.\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: He left the door open for that, yes.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: OK, do you think he could be a little more careful in his words or not?\u000a\u000aFALLWELL: All of us could. All of us could. But at least he's not politically correct, he's not so concerned about rehearsing and focus grouping every statement he makes and that's one of the reasons I supported him.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And that unites the nation. Do you feel he's uniting the nation?\u000a\u000aFALWELL: I feel like the people -- you know, after that -- after I heard his statement the other day, I didn't hear anything there that would offend somebody.\u000a\u000aBut then I started speaking with some of my friends in the Jewish community in Charlottesville and some of my friends -- I have a very good friend who's president of the largest historically black college in the United States, Hampton University. And we started having conversations.\u000a\u000aThey started explaining to me how insecure and how scared they felt that day, when terrorists -- these groups -- these terrorist groups were walked up and down the sidewalk, right outside their synagogue.\u000a\u000aAnd I understood, after talking to them, how good people could hear the same statement and take away different things from it.\u000a\u000aAnd I -- after hearing that, I understand how some people could misunderstand his words. And so, yes, I think he could be more polished and more politically correct, but that's the reason I supported him, is because he's not. He says what he thinks and he is bold about it. I admire that in a leader.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Thanks for joining us this morning.\u000a\u000aFALWELL: Thank you.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Mr. Falwell, I appreciate it.\u000a\u000aFALWELL: Yes.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Joining me now is Jeh Johnson.\u000a\u000aHe served as President Obama's secretary of Homeland Security for the final three years of his administration.\u000a\u000aAnd Mr. Johnson, thanks very much for joining us.\u000a\u000aI'd like to...\u000a\u000aJEH JOHNSON, FORMER SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Thanks for inviting me, Martha.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- I'd like your reaction to what Mr. Falwell just said. He talked about it being political correctness.\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Well, it's interesting, sometimes people have more in common than one might realize. Like Mr. Falwell, I'm an attorney. Like Mr. Falwell's father, Reverend Falwell, my great grandfather was a Southern Baptist preacher, born in Lynchburg, Virginia.\u000a\u000aMy great grandfather was born a slave in 1860 in Lynchburg. He was freed by Abraham Lincoln when he was a child. He taught himself to read and write. He put himself through school. And he founded a church called The Lee Street Baptist Church in Bristol, Virginia in 1980, which is still there.\u000a\u000aAnd it's in that vein that I'd like to respond here, both as former secretary of Homeland Security and as an African-American.\u000a\u000aPresident Trump said this week that Jefferson and Washington were slave owners, where does it stop?\u000a\u000aWhere does it end?\u000a\u000aI think most Americans understand -- most African-Americans understand that many of the founders of our nation were slave owners. But most of us are not advocating that we take them off the currency or drop Washington's name from the nation's capital.\u000a\u000aI have first cousins -- I have cousins whose names are Washington and they're not changing their names. They're proud of their name.\u000a\u000aWhat alarms so many of us, from a security perspective, is that so many of the statues, the Confederate monuments, are now, modern-day, becoming symbols and rallying points for white nationalism, for neo-Nazis, for the KKK. And this is most alarming. We fought a world war against Nazism. The KKK rained terror on African-Americans for generations.\u000a\u000aAnd so a number of Americans, rightly, Republican and Democrat, are very concerned and very alarmed. And I salute those in cities and states who are taking down a lot of these monuments for reasons of public safety and security.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: If...\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: And that's not a matter of political correctness. That's a matter of public safety and homeland security and doing what's right.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: I think President Trump, the administration, would talk about that as a slippery slope. And we're here in Washington, DC. I'm in Washington, DC. Virginia, there's Jefferson Davis Highway. There's Washington-Lee High School.\u000a\u000aWhere should that stop?\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Well, you know, that's a good question. And I think that's a judgment that has to be made more at the local level. And Mitch Landrieu, mayor of New Orleans, two months ago, gave a very thoughtful speech on this.\u000a\u000aAnd so communities have to make judgments about this. A lot of these monuments are being moved to places of history, but my concern, as the former secretary of Homeland Security, is we see white nationalists now, neo-Nazis, using these symbols as rallying points, modern-day.\u000a\u000aAnd that has to be addressed. We saw what happened in Charlottesville. And we have to avoid repeat occurrences of that.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And I want to go back to President Trump's comments and what Mr. Falwell said.\u000a\u000aIs the media overreacting to this?\u000a\u000aDid the president just speak his mind?\u000a\u000aDid he make it clear, in your mind?\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Well, I don't think the media is overreacting. The media rightly covers everything the president says. And what the president doesn't seem to grasp here is that he -- our history is no doubt delicate, it's complicated, and you have to understand history to be president.\u000a\u000aI tell public audiences, those who know history learn from it. Those who don't know the mistakes of history are bound to repeat it. And so I'm very concern that this president is -- frankly dividing us when he should be bringing us together. That's one of the jobs of the president of the the United States. It's part of the job description to bring people together, particularly in times like this of high anxiety. High stress. And I would encourage him, through his words, to try to do that, not just speak to his base, but to speak to all of America. He is the president for all of us in this country.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Do you think the election of the first African-American president brought out some of these groups and KKK groups, brought them back? How much of a role did that play, do you think?\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Throughout his entire public career, Barack Obama has talked about bringing people together. And I know he dedicated much of his presidency to doing that. He talked to all American people, particularly in times like this. So I think that is a very unfair suggestion. His entire career was devoted to bringing people together.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: I want to turn now to what is going on in the White House and some of the turmoil in the White House. Steve Bannon leaving the White House this week. What do you think that says with Bannon leaving and we've got behind -- put on your Pentagon hat, if you will, from years ago? What do you think it says he surrounded himself with generals and they remain, and what do you expect going forward?\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Well, that it's interesting. I don't think anyone would expect -- would have expected we'd have so many retired general officers serving in civilian positions today. There's been a lot of talk this week about people resigning from the White House, whether people should resign from the White House. We saw a number of his advisers resign from advisory councils.\u000a\u000aFrankly, if John Kelly, or my friend Jim Mattis, came to me and said I'm thinking about resigning from this White House, I'd say absolutely not. You have to stay.\u000a\u000aAs John reportedly said, it's country first. And we need people like John Kelly, Jim Mattis, H.R. McMaster to right the ship.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Secretary Johnson.\u000a\u000aJOHNSON: Thank you.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: When we come back, Charlottesville renewed a debate over moving civil war statues. So, I traveled to Richmond, Virginia, the city that could be the next boiling point.\u000a\u000aPlus, the Powerhouse Roundtable takes on the political fallout of President Trump's response to Charlottesville. We'll be right back.\u000a\u000a(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And the Powerhouse Roundtable is here. Republican strategist and ABC News contributor Alex Castellanos; "Washington Post" chief correspondent Dan Balz; Republican strategist and pollster and ABC News contributor, Kristen Soltis Anderson; and FiveThirtyEight senior political writer Perry Bacon, Jr.\u000a\u000aNot much to talk about today, huh? But we'll try to get to it all.\u000a\u000aAnd, Dan, I want to start with you. Where would you rank this week in the Trump presidency?\u000a\u000aDAN BALZ, "WASHINGTON POST": He's had a lot of bad weeks. I think we can all stipulate to that. But this may be the worst that he's had. And I think the reason -- the way you can make that judgment is to look at what his fellow Republicans have been saying about him since Tuesday. Whatever he thought he was doing Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, with his varying statements, the judgment on him has been extremely harsh from fellow Republicans. And I think that really sums up the problem that he's had this week.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: So what does that really mean for him going forward?\u000a\u000aALEX CASTELLANOS, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it doesn't mean the end of the Trump presidency but it may mean the end of Trump government. It's going to be impossible for Donald Trump now to attract good people to government. And he hasn't filled out these positions that he needs to appoint. He has appointed about half of what Obama and Bush before him appointed at this point. It's going to be very hard for him to build his army to fight their army.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And Perry, a CBS poll out this week shows a partisan divide in how President Trump's remarks on Charlottesville are being received -- 82 percent of Democrats disapproved how he responded to Charlottesville; 67 percent of Republicans approved.\u000a\u000aSo, yes, there was a lot of talk on the Hill. There's a lot of talk around the city. There's a lot of talk everywhere. But when you look at those poll numbers, what to you see?\u000a\u000aPERRY BACON, JR., FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: You have two big things going on here. First of all, you look at the polls. About 80 percent of Republicans still approve of Trump overall. So when you say why is Paul Ryan not criticizing Trump very strongly? That is the answer to the question.\u000a\u000aAnd the second thing is, you look in the polls this week, you see, you know, everyone opposes the KKK and neo-Nazis. And when you get into the polls in terms of Confederate monuments, should we take tem down? You know, there are people who have this view that Trump does. The culture is changing too quickly. The monuments maybe should stay up. And are sort of nervous about where things are going.\u000a\u000aSo I think Trump did speak to something in the Republican base this week, even though people may not like it.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Although only 24 percent of those surveyed identified as Republican.\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: Right. One thing you're seeing (INAUDIBLE)...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Very significant.\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: -- in the polls is the number of people who say they're Republican goes down. So we're -- so we have a situation where Trump's numbers may be going down among Independents and among Democrats particularly. But he does -- the Republican -- people who say they're Republican is going down.\u000a\u000aSo his base of support may be shrinking, even though Republicans say they still support him.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And Kristen, after the president's press conference Tuesday, you Tweeted, as well, saying, "I've stayed in the party because I figured staying and fighting for it was better than leaving. But the lord is testing me."\u000a\u000a(LAUGHTER)\u000a\u000a(CROSSTALK)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- this is why we -- where's -- where's your head (INAUDIBLE)...\u000a\u000aKRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: There was...\u000a\u000a(CROSSTALK)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- party now?\u000a\u000aSOLTIS ANDERSON: Involved in that Tweet, as well.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Yes, I know.\u000a\u000a(CROSSTALK)\u000a\u000aSOLTIS ANDERSON: No, I think what's very frustrating is that for Republicans who are here in Washington, it felt like very clear and very obvious that what the president said was wrong. There were not very fine people at this rally. And it was sort of unambiguous what you would want to say in that moment.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, as that poll just showed, that's actually not where a majority of Republican voters are, that when the RNC puts out a statement saying that the president's statement was absolutely in the right, when President Trump and his advisers defend what he had to say, that's where most Republicans are.\u000a\u000aAnd I think over the last couple of months, the leadership of Donald Trump has really sort of brought to life some views in the Republican Party that may have always been there, but now we have a leader putting voice to them.\u000a\u000aAnd I think it's creating a lot of tension for many of these Republicans in Washington, who feel the need to say this is wrong and yet their voters back home feel very differently.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: So I want to go back to this again.\u000a\u000aSo where does this go, Dan?\u000a\u000aYou say it's the worst week in Washington for President Trump.\u000a\u000aI think we've said that a lot.\u000a\u000aDAN BALZ, "THE WASHINGTON POST":\u000a\u000aWe have said that a lot. And...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: So what...\u000a\u000aBALZ: And I think the truth...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- what...\u000a\u000aBALZ: -- and I think what I'm...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- is it a turning point?\u000a\u000aBALZ: -- and I think what I'm going to say we've also said a lot.\u000a\u000aI don't think we know. I mean I spent the week trying to reach various Republican lawmakers, strategists, leaders, etc. To get them to talk about that very question, where do you go from here?\u000a\u000aNot just what do you think about what the president said on Tuesday, but what's next?\u000a\u000aWhat's next in the relationship?\u000a\u000aI found very few people who wanted to talk under any condition, you know, on the record, off the record, background. People are frustrated with Donald Trump. But they also recognize they can't...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Exactly what Kristen was saying, right?\u000a\u000aBALZ: -- they cannot go and blow up the -- what I would call the Trump-GOP coalition because they're different. They're an amalgam.\u000a\u000aSo that's the bind that the party is in right now, or party leaders.\u000a\u000aALEX CASTELLANOS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Resentful dependency. Resentful dependency is when you have no choice -- gee, I've got to stick with the cable company, they're the only one. Boy, they treat me lousy and I'm really frustrated and I hate it.\u000a\u000aTrump supporters have to stick with Donald Trump because the Democrats have not changed. It's still Nancy Pelosi who's the alternative?\u000a\u000aReally?\u000a\u000aA limp Republican Party that's indistinguishable from Democrats.\u000a\u000aTrump is their only finger in the dike stopping Washington from flooding them and overpowering them. So they stick with their president.\u000a\u000aBut on a different here, what I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election.\u000a\u000aNo.\u000a\u000aWhite working class America, death rates among white men, they're up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said no wonder they're resentful.\u000a\u000aAnd the Democrats, as opposed to looking in the mirror and saying the Washington establishment failed white working America, no, they're painting us all as Nazis. That's why we voted for Trump.\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: I'd want to address what changed this week.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: All right...\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: And I would say it's not just the Republicans -- he's not the president of the Republican America, he's president of America overall. The presidency has a lot of soft power. You go to funerals. You unify the nation.\u000a\u000aThink about how Obama spoke about Charleston, how Obama spoke about Dallas last year. Think about this week. Business leaders don't want to be around him. Kennedy Center award winners don't want to be near him.\u000a\u000aThe family of someone who died this week does not want to take his call.\u000a\u000aSo the idea that this has not changed the presidency is...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: There are Evangelical leaders...\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: Evangelical leaders...\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: -- that are hanging in there except for one...\u000a\u000aBACON, JR.: -- you know, yes.\u000a\u000a(CROSSTALK)\u000a\u000aCASTELLANOS: Change.\u000a\u000aSOLTIS ANDERSON: But two of those three groups -- so America's CEOs, corporate America and a bunch of celebrities, if you are a Trump supporter, you look at that and you say well, OK, a bunch of celebrities don't want to hang out with Trump, the media doesn't like Trump, the Democrats don't like Trump, a bunch of billionaires on Wall Street don't like Trump. But that's OK because Trump is with me.\u000a\u000aAnd he has the benefit of having a lot of very unpopular enemies, as well. And by picking fights with the media, with Democrats, he is able to get his supporters, even in moments like this, where what he said was certainly not the best, they go but you know what, he's still speaking up for people like me.\u000a\u000aCASTELLANOS: But this president is giving his supporters political Viagra every four hours. He's wearing them out. He is at -- he is never giving them a rest. And they can't remain this intense and aroused forever.\u000a\u000aHis supporters -- he needs to give his supporters a break. He's having -- they're having to defend him constantly. And eventually, they get frustrated. That resentment is building up in the pressure cooker. If there is ever an alternative, it could collapse like that.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: But is that really ever going to change? We saw this week Steve Bannon leaving. You said -- Dan, you wrote that Bannon is firing simultaneously changes everything and nothing.\u000a\u000aWe saw certainly John Kelly trying to rein him in, I'm sure. And the tweets were there and the language was there. You saw the expression on John Kelly's face as he was giving that press conference.\u000a\u000aSo, changes nothing, changes everything. What about inside the White House right now?\u000a\u000aBALZ: Inside the White House will not change demonstrably because of Donald Trump. You know, General Kelly has made clear he's able to manage down, which is to say he's able to manage the staff in an effective way. He's setting some boundaries. And I think Steve Bannon's departure is one big symbol of that.\u000a\u000aBut managing up, which is the challenge of any White House chief of staff, is enormously difficult. He's been in there a few weeks. The tweets have not slowed down. The off message statements this week, were, the biggest that he's had. So, that's the challenge for General Kelly.\u000a\u000aCertainly, Bannon's departure removes in a sense an irritant inside the White House, because he is a grenade-thrower. He is a bomb-thrower. And has a world view that is different from most of the people who are still in there.\u000a\u000aBut Donald Trump holds many of those same views and held some of those same views long before he was tied closely with Steve Bannon. So, unless the president changes a lot of that is not going to change.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And what about Steve Bannon on the outside at -- back at Breitbart? You have heard sort of what he was talking about this morning and waging war on the opponents, basically. How do you see that playing out? BACON: I think it depends on what Donald Trump does next. What I think Bannon is hinting as if Donald Trump moves to the center, says no more wall, says we're not going to have the Muslim ban. If Donald Trump -- if the sort of Kelly and McMaster and other advisers sort of move Donald Trump, I think Breitbart is saying, and Ann Coulter, people like that are going to say, we're going fight, we're going to stand up for the Trump from the campaign.\u000a\u000aSo, I think this could be another fight between the establishment in the White House versus the people outside of it who used to be in the White House. That's where it could go.\u000a\u000aBut like Dan said, I'm not sure Donald Trump is going to change very much, because Donald Trump has been saying the same things for two decades on many of these issues.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Kristie.\u000a\u000aANDERSON: I think it's going to depend a lot on who specifically, and I mean individuals, the Bannon machine goes after.\u000a\u000aSo, if the Bannon machine turns its fire on congress, goes after Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, that will be entirely predictable. That's sort of what they've been doing. If they do it even more vigorously now, it wouldn't surprise me.\u000a\u000aBut there are individuals like Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, who have been notable for being sort of voices in Trump's ear, pushing him in a more moderate direction.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: It's really now just the family, the generals, and some Wall Street executives.\u000a\u000aANDERSON: And I imagine if the Bannon machine begins going after family, going after people like Ivanka and Jared, that is when I think a Trump-Breitbart war could happen and get very ugly.\u000a\u000aRADDTAZ: And just very quickly, Alex, we have about 10 seconds.\u000a\u000aCASTELLANOS: Oh, I think Bannon is going to finds out it's much tougher to be on the outside. What is as powerful as the American presidency? Nothing. Certainly not Breitbart. I think he'll be diminished.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: OK. Thanks very much for joining us.\u000a\u000aComing up, I traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where the simmering debate over Confederate statues may soon boil over. That conversation, up next.\u000a\u000a(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Up next, my conversation on how the nation can heal after the protests and violence in Charlottesville. We'll be right back.\u000a\u000a(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u000a\u000a(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aBILL GALLASCH, PRESIDENT, MONUMENT AVENUE PRESERVATION SOCIETY: I love the city of Richmond. And I want to see us grow.\u000a\u000aWe were the capital. You can't erase that. I mean we had, you know, five dreadful years of slaughter on both sides and we were the capital of the South.\u000a\u000aSo what are we going to do, just wipe Washington and say it never existed?\u000a\u000aNo, it existed. But let's learn from it and don't repeat ourselves.\u000a\u000a(END VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: That was Bill Gallasch, president of Richmond, Virginia's Monument Avenue Preservation Society. The city's Confederate statues are being hotly debated in the aftermath of the events in nearby Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aSo I traveled to the former capital of the Confederacy and spoke with Charlottesville Councilwoman Kristin Szakos, who first raised taking down her city's civil war monuments.\u000a\u000aRichmond mayor, Levar Stoney, who says his city's statues should go. And Christy Coleman, the CEO of The American Civil War Museum.\u000a\u000aThat's where we gathered for our conversation.\u000a\u000aAnd we started with the events in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000a(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u000a\u000aCOUNCILWOMAN KRISTIN SZAKOS (D), CHARLOTTESVILLE: It was an armed invasion of our city. It was horrifying.\u000a\u000a(VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aSZAKOS: From the march through UVA to about 500 fascists and Nazis and white supremacists and white nationalists with AK-47s and clubs and knives, we could tell it was a terrible event from the very start.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And Mayor, your reaction, when you saw those people carrying torches?\u000a\u000aMAYOR LEVAR STONEY (D), RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: It just made my heart sink to see that sort of gathering of hate and division and intolerance. You know, to me, it was akin to a Klan rally without the hoods. As a millennial, that's something we, as millennials, we just haven't seen. Normally, you see that on black and white film from, you know, the civil rights movement.\u000a\u000aBut to see that as clear as day, only 60 miles away from your city in your state, that you love so much, it made my heart sink.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And Christy, you are affiliated with this museum, with the history.\u000a\u000aWhat was your reaction? CHRISTY COLEMAN, CEO, THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR MUSEUM: I realized that an important flashpoint had been reached. We go through these cycles whenever there is forward progression in a social movement and social expansion of civil rights, there is always a very violent and very quick and very hot push-back on that.\u000a\u000a(VIDEO CLIP)\u000a\u000aCOLEMAN: This is how the cycle works. This is what happens when we turn history into nostalgia.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Tell me a little bit more of what you mean about that, turning history into nostalgia?\u000a\u000aCOLEMAN: There are people who really need to say, you know, this is who we are and these are our heroes and these -- we honor these people because they were good and they were noble and they were righteous and we don't want to look at the other complexities of these individuals.\u000a\u000aAnd that's really about nostalgia. That's not about the real push and pull that is always a part of the history dynamic.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ (voice-over): It seemed like Richmond had been able to accommodate the various sides. On one of its main streets, Monument Avenue, statues of five Civil War leaders loom over the city prominently.\u000a\u000aBut with the events in Charlottesville, even this former capital of the Confederacy is rethinking how its history should be displayed.\u000a\u000a(on camera): So talk a bit about those monuments.\u000a\u000aWhat do you do now?\u000a\u000aSTONEY: I've requested that they actually provide context to the monuments. Explain who these individuals were or why they got -- how they got there and why they were put there. And I thought these would be tools to teach and enlighten.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, what happened Saturday, we've seen that these are now rallying points for people to harbor, you know, hate and division and intolerance. And those are not the values of this city.\u000a\u000aI'm offended by them. I think about my grandmother, who grew up in the segregated South, in the deep South, in the low country of South Carolina, 1923. She would be offended by those things.\u000a\u000aAnd I want to be on her side. I want to be on the side of right.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Is there any way to view those monuments that's not viewed as racist?\u000a\u000aCOLEMAN: I mean, well, clearly, they are, because there are people who don't view them as racist. They view them as symbols of virtue. They view them as a memorial to a sacrifice that people made for their homes. I mean clearly that's a part of the narrative.\u000a\u000aThey do tell us a lot of interesting stories if we're willing to hear them. Nobody is talking about being politically correct. Nobody is talking about being -- oh, what's the other one I hear, you know, you're being revisionist and -- no, no, no, no, no.\u000a\u000aHistory is always a process of new questions. Every generation asks a new question. And as scholars, we go back and look at what the historical record left us to try to answer them.\u000a\u000aAnd we would be irresponsible if, with these new questions, that we did not go back and say hey, now we understand this thing in a bigger way.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: You heard Donald Trump compare Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee to Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.\u000a\u000aTRUMP: This week, it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u000a\u000aMAYOR LEVAR STONEY, RICHMOND, VA: I don't believe there's a comparison at all. Washington and Jefferson were founders, you know, part of our Founding Fathers. They did not take up arms against the United States of America.\u000a\u000aHere, we do celebrate -- I don't think any other city out there, any other country in the world celebrates another army taking up arms against its actual country. Except here. Here in the south. And that's why they're different to me.\u000a\u000aKRISTIN SZAKOS, CHARLOTTESVILL CITY COUNCIL: When we have the statues of Washington and Jefferson, they're portrayed doing things like being the father of our country, or writing the Declaration of Independence, or being president. Whereas these Confederate statues, they're in full army regalia, fighting a war against the United States for the perpetuation of slavery. So it's -- that's what they're being celebrated for.\u000a\u000aRADDAZT: The country is worried about this. So what do you think going forward?\u000a\u000aSTONEY: Here's the thing, we -- I do believe that we need the take a moment the breathe. Chill out a little bit. And we're going get that time. And once we chill out and breathe, we're going to get back to the discussion in a civil manner and we're going to work on finding a resolution to this.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: And how do you do that, particularly when you have a president who says those monuments are beautiful?\u000a\u000aSTONEY: I appreciate the president's opinion. But here in the City of Richmond, I don't think that frankly matters. He doesn't live here. We live here. And so we'll be the individuals who will choose our destiny.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Those people who say this is our heritage. These are our people. They fought, and whether they fought for a side that you may not think is a good side, they're still our people. How do you convince them?\u000a\u000aCOLEMAN: It's really trying to reconcile for communities and help communities come to understand this really interesting dance between what history really is -- which is all of this messy -- the notion of heritage, and the notion of memory. And how they -- how they play out in public life.\u000a\u000aSTONEY: There are always going to be people on opposite sides who are just going to frankly disagree. I think here in Richmond, we like to think we've fully healed from our difficult and unique past. But I think what we're seeing is that we haven't. You know, it's like putting a cast on a broken arm and not -- it not ever fully healing. And that is the case. But you know what? Just like Charlottesville, Richmond is resilient.\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Is this something that scars your city? Makes your city a better city?\u000a\u000aSZAKOS: We are the town of Thomas Jefferson, who talked about all men are created equal. And we believe that. I have to say that I've been really proud of my city, the way that we've kind of taken this hit and tried to come together. We're still in the process and it's going to take a long time. It's a traumatic thing.\u000a\u000aSTONEY: You know what, things will get better. They always do. And so I try not the despair. Despite what President Trump may say or do, I know and have faith, and that's whey you get into this work, that things will get better.\u000a\u000a(END VIDEOTAPE)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: Have faith that things will get better. Our thanks again to the Mayor Levar Stoney, Kristin Szakos, and Christy Coleman. The American Civil War Museum is certainly a museum worth a visit.\u000a\u000aI'll be right back with a closing thought on this week's events.\u000a\u000a(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u000a\u000aRADDATZ: As we end this week of political and domestic turmoil, a few thoughts. I watched this all of this unfold from thousands of miles away in South Korea with the U.S. military covering what is is surely the president's biggest foreign policy challenge. The very same day President Trump was defiantly defending his Charlottesville response by saying there were very fine people on both sides, even among those white supremacists and neo-Nazis, I was flying in the backseat of an F-16 near the North Korean border where thousands of American service members stand ready to give their lives to defend the U.S. and its allies.\u000a\u000aAnd it would be Donald Trump, the commander-in-chief, whose picture hangs in every base at home and abroad, who would send them to war with just a few words. That underscores an obvious truth, our service members listen closely to what the president says. So, it was no surprise to me that in a rare foray into domestic issues, the heads of the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and National Guard all released definitive statements condemning the racism, extremism, and hatred on display in Charlottesville.\u000a\u000aThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford echoed his service chiefs, saying there is no place, no place for racism and bigotry in the U.S. military or in the United States as a whole.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. military makes that clear every day. Strict regulations guarantee that any support for supremacist groups means you can be thrown out of the military. That's because the strength of the military isn't defined by weapons, ships, or tanks, it's defined by the people who serve. And those Americans who do so are defined by their diversity.\u000a\u000aOf all the institutions in our country, our volunteer military is the most diverse, the most representative, and provides the the most opportunities for all Americans. What they see and hear from their president, from their own country, about whether they are valued members of the society matters. I'm not talking about the pleasantries of thank you for your service.\u000a\u000aSo when those service members from all backgrounds return home and take off the uniform, there should be no confusion over whether every one of them is respected and valued. And that there's no place for groups that fuel bigotry and hate towards them or for individuals or leaders who condone it.\u000a\u000aAnd that's all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out World News Tonight. And have a great day.\u000a\u000aEND

aVMonday night on \u201cCNN Tonight,\u201d while analyzing President Donald Trump\u2018s new Afghanistan strategy calling for a troop increase, network host Fareed Zakaria asked where was Steve Bannon \u201cwhen you need him?\u201d\u000a\u000aPartial transcript as follows:\u000a\u000aLEMON: You think his approach was right? You think it\u2019s the only viable approach?\u000a\u000aZAKARIA: No, I think this was a moment\u2013\u2013this was a real lost opportunity. I actually feel like, where is Steve Bannon when you need him? This was an opportunity to really have a re-think, to sit back and ask fundamentally, what can we do? Wes Clark I think was closest to the truth when he said the fundamental challenge is actually diplomatic. In any one of these wars when you\u2019re the country that\u2019s 8,000 miles away, the locals know one day you\u2019re going to go home. So the question is, how do you construct some kind of political settlement that will last when you leave?\u000a\u000aAnd that means getting the Pakistanis involved; the Indians involved but also the Russians, also the Iranians who we don\u2019t talk to. Unless they\u2019re all buying in\u2014right now you have a situation where none of them are buying into the U.S. war\u2014they\u2019re all undermining it in various ways, except for the Indians really. And we\u2019re surprised it\u2019s not working. We don\u2019t have any really local traction. What you need, it seems to me, is a regional diplomatic effort, not 4,000 more troops. What will 4,000 American troops do that 140,000 couldn\u2019t do five years ago?

aVA new McClatchy report has revealed that current White House staffers including John Kelly, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner are pushing the President to continue with amnesty for illegal immigrants in exchange for border wall funding as well as curbs on illegal immigration and the online \u2018E-Verify\u2019 system.\u000a\u000aIf the President accedes, this may be his \u2018Merkel moment\u2019 \u2014 reflective of the German chancellor who compromised on her nation\u2019s borders and rule of law with her now infamous (and subsequently dropped) \u2018We Can Do It\u2019 call to let millions of migrants into Europe.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aShe didn\u2019t just let them in, her policy encouraged them. One of the greatest \u2018pull factors\u2019 in Europe\u2019s migrant crisis was the German leader\u2019s abdication of her duties towards her nation. From failing to consult the German parliament, to claiming that a mass of economic migrants were in fact \u201cSyrian refugees\u201d fit for high-skilled labour, Merkel irrevocably changed the face of her nation in one fell swoop; something candidate Trump seemed to understand.\u000a\u000aFar from being the doctors, nurses, or engineers she was claiming to open her arms to, employment and skill sets amongst recent migrants is devastatingly poor.\u000a\u000aIn July, the German Federal Employment Agency admitted that 74 per cent of new migrants had no qualifications, and would likely only be able to do menial labour jobs.\u000a\u000aJust 54 of those recently arrived found jobs with top firms in the country, with 50 of those going to the German post office. That\u2019s not 54 per cent. That\u2019s 54 people.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not like the appetite is there, and the jobs simply aren\u2019t.\u000a\u000aGermany has a history \u2014 over five decades long \u2014 with Turkish inward migration. I use this constituency to give Merkel the benefit of the doubt \u2014 no first wave or first generation of migrants, despite her lofty promises, have ever got steady jobs that quickly, nor have they integrated immediately. So let\u2019s look at Germany\u2019s Turkish population, those who have been in the country for over half a century.\u000a\u000aFigures published in July 2017 revealed that almost every second Turk of working age in the nation is \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d. The major German newspaper Die Welt added in its report on the matter: \u201cThe vast majority of the [Turks who are] economically inactive declare that \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 they are not interested in a job.\u201d\u000a\u000aJust this week it became clear that Turkey\u2019s President Recip Erdogan was able to influence millions of voters across Germany, especially with the country\u2019s federal elections on the horizon.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to a Turkish News Agency last week, Erdogan insisted: \u201cI would say to all compatriots in Germany, do not support [the Christian Democrats]\u2026 Not the Christian Democrats, not the SPD [Social Democrats], not the Greens. They are all enemies of Turkey.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe decision President Trump has to make vis-a-vis DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 is not a direct parallel. Firstly, obviously, this is about children who have entered the country illegally. Secondly, there are no immediate low-skilled job or electoral implications.\u000a\u000aBut there are several parallels, the first being the undermining of the rule of law.\u000a\u000aEven the most liberal Western leader in the world today, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 discouraged illegal immigration into his country, stating: \u201cIf I could directly speak to people seeking asylum, I\u2019d like to remind them there\u2019s no advantage [to crossing into Canada illegally]\u2026 Our rules, our principles and our laws apply to everyone.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat DACA does is nullify such principles, the same as which President Trump made during his political campaign, pre-November 2016.\u000a\u000aIn a Phoenix speech in August 2016 \u2014 almost exactly a year ago from his Phoenix speech of today \u2014 candidate Trump stated unequivocally: \u201cWe will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants\u2026 In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement \u2014 and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe went on: \u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation \u2014 that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe press release on last year\u2019s speech \u2014 like all pre-2017 content \u2014 has been removed from the official Donald J. Trump campaign website.\u000a\u000aThe second parallel to be aware of is the aforementioned \u201cpull factor\u201d.\u000a\u000aIn 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) admitted of the Obama-era amnesty policies:\u000a\u000aMigration pull factors include reunification with family members already in the United States and successful migration attempts; that is, most (98 percent) OTM UCs are issued a Notice to Appear and not immediately removed from the United States. Last year, only 1,700 UCs were repatriated to their home countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe report also stated:\u000a\u000aHSI-Intel assesses with high confidence that reunification with family members already in the United States continues to be a pull factor for UCs from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\u000a\u000aFurthermore, while they noted \u201cNo single factor causes OTM UC migration to the United States\u201d, they did admit: \u201cseveral factors combine to cause this, including poor economies and violence in home countries, potential employment opportunities in the United States, family reunification, and success at not being immediately repatriated drive OTM UC migration to the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven the most ardent of establishment European politicians has admitted similar.\u000a\u000aDonald Tusk, president of the European Council, said in 2015 that \u201cThe exceptionally easy access to Europe is one of the main pull factors\u201d.\u000a\u000aWith a renewed pull factor \u2014 as the DHS report stated \u2014 in the form of \u201csuccess at not being immediately repatriated\u201d, we can expect border crossing attempts to rise if the Trump administration fails to rescind DACA.\u000a\u000aIn a sense, the latter part of this year and the West Wing\u2019s approach to DACA therefore represents a Merkel moment for President Trump.\u000a\u000aGiven his propensity to slam the German Chancellor on immigration, but at the same time laud her as his favorite world leader, the President\u2019s electoral base would to well to place increased scrutiny on this policy position.\u000a\u000aRaheem Kassam is the Breitbart London editor in chief and author of No Go Zones: How Sharia Law is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You

aVGetty Image\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was already in hot water for his somewhat supportive response to President Donald Trump\u2019s bonkers comments on Charlottesville when his wife\u2019s Instagram rant went viral on Tuesday. Louise Linton, the Scottish actress and model, has since apologized for raving against one user\u2019s comment critical of her apparent use of a federal government plane to boast about the various clothing brands she was wearing in a published photo. Now that Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is investigating the pair\u2019s further use of the plane, however, she may have to apologize again.\u000a\u000aThe nonprofit government watchdog has requested \u201ccopies of all records concerning authorization for and the costs\u201d related to Mnuchin and Linton\u2019s use of the plane on Monday, August 21st. They specifically want \u201ccopies of all records concerning authorization for and the costs of Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s use of a government plane for any purpose since his appointment as Treasury Secretary.\u201d Why? Because according to a throwaway line in a Courier-Journal article about Mnuchin\u2019s visit, he and Linton later traveled to Fort Knox \u201cto tour the bullion reserve at the Army post and view the eclipse.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhether the Courier-Journal line about Mnuchin and Linton wanting to view the eclipse came from an official comment or something said in passing remains to be seen. Either way, CREW wants to know if they used the government plane in order to see the rare cosmic event. \u201cThe requested records would shed light on the justification for Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s use of a government plane, rather than a commercial flight, for a trip that seems to have been planned around the solar eclipse and to enable the Secretary to secure a viewpoint in the path of the eclipse\u2019s totality.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt a time of expected deep cuts to the federal budget,\u201d CREW\u2019s statement continued, \u201cthe taxpayers have a significant interest in learning the extent to which Secretary Mnuchin has used government planes for travel in lieu of commercial planes, and the justification for that use.\u201d As of this writing, neither Mnuchin nor Linton have issued official responses to the records requests. And while Linton\u2019s social media accounts remain locked following her Instagram rant, Mnuchin did tweet about his visit to Fort Knox on Monday. He did not, however, mention the solar eclipse.\u000a\u000a(Via CREW and Courier-Journal)

aVRACINE, Wis. \u2014 For all its power and prestige, the speaker of the House is one of the most thankless jobs in Washington \u2014 just ask John Boehner. Now, with Congress barreling toward major fiscal fights this fall, Paul Ryan is about to get a taste of the Boehner treatment \u2014 and then some.\u000a\u000aConsider what's on the immediate horizon for the GOP wunderkind: President Donald Trump is ready to shut down the government over his border wall with Mexico. Breitbart has all but declared a renewed, Steve Bannon-led war on GOP leaders, with Ryan in its cross hairs. And conservative lawmakers are exhorting the speaker to play hardball on raising the debt ceiling \u2014 even as the White House demands a no-strings-attached increase to calm nervous creditors.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"Conservatives aren\u2019t going to roll over when it comes to the debt ceiling,\u201d said Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) in a Tuesday interview. \u201cI can tell you: It\u2019s going to be a battle.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked about Ryan\u2019s leadership on such matters, Walker added: \u201cI would like to see his genius in policy manifest itself\u2026 Behind closed doors, there are strong conversations when it comes to holding the line for the will of the bulk of the conference. And I would like to see some strength in that area.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Ryan reluctantly took the reins of the House Republican Conference in late 2015, he went out of his way to say he was only heeding the call of duty and didn't really want it. Two years later, he faces the most treacherous stretch of his speakership as September showdowns over the budget and debt ceiling approach.\u000a\u000aLike Boehner, Ryan will be forced to mediate the long-running hostilities in his conference \u2014 between the always-potent Freedom Caucus and a newly-empowered faction of centrists. Only this time, Ryan also has a demanding and unpredictable president thrown into the mix, too.\u000a\u000aTrump isn't making it easy. On Thursday he attacked Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for rejecting his proposed strategy of pairing a debt ceiling increase, a toxic vote for Republicans, with a popular veterans bill to garner more support.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aGOP leaders rejected the approach because they ran out of time before recess and worried some Republicans would fume that they got arm-twisted into voting for the debt bill they'd otherwise oppose but for the vets provision.\u000a\u000aTrump didn't care about those sensitivities, tweeting Thursday: \u201cI requested that Mitch M & Paul R tie the Debt Ceiling legislation into the popular V.A. Bill (which just passed) for easy approval.... They didn't do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval. Could have been so easy-now a mess!\u201d\u000a\u000aThat slight came just days after Trump said he'd be willing to shut down the government in order to secure funding for his border wall \u2014 a strategy that could backfire on the Republican congressional majority in next year's midterms. And as if that's wasn't enough stress, Ryan will almost certainly be forced to rely on Democrats for the fall\u2019s big fiscal votes \u2014 a move that was eventually Boehner\u2019s undoing.\u000a\u000aNo one is saying Ryan's job is in jeopardy. But the way he handles all these situations could well determine his standing and popularity within the GOP.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, frustration is mounting among Republican voters that Congress failed to deliver on campaign promises like repealing Obamacare. While Ryan points out that the House passed legislation and it was the Senate that came up short, the public isn't necessarily interested in that distinction.\u000a\u000aNeither, it seems, are Trump and his allies. In fact, the president has shown he has no compunction about blaming Republicans in Congress for not enacting his agenda. And while Bannon engaged politely with Ryan and GOP leaders in the White House, he\u2019s made clear that he plans to pound them relentlessly from his new perch atop Breitbart.\u000a\u000a"You can see the emerging theme from Trump world is that Trump doesn\u2019t fail; Trump has been betrayed," said longtime Ryan acquaintance Charlie Sykes, a prominent conservative commentator based in Wisconsin. "They\u2019re going to line up the scapegoats... No matter how much [Ryan] appeases Trump, it won\u2019t take long for Trump for turn on him."\u000a\u000aMost of Trump's ire has lately centered on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in retribution for failing to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare. But the Trump-Ryan marriage has always been one more of convenience than true love, so many are wondering how much longer it will last.\u000a\u000aHere in Ryan\u2019s southeast Wisconsin district, longtime Ryan supporters worry their congressman will be crippled from all the impossible demands and pressures. Marlene Lamberton, a Ryan constituent and retired manufacturing employee from Caledonia, Wis., said this week that Ryan is being \u201cforced to do many unpopular things\u201d and \u201cmake a lot of compromises" because his conference is so divided.\u000a\u000a\u201cBeing speaker of the House has become a setback\u2026 It\u2019s basically ruined his career for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Paul Ryan is a good person. I think he\u2019s one of the most honest politicians I\u2019ve ever known and heard. But I think he is compromising his values a little.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Ryan still enjoys the support of most of his conference. Rep. Tom Rooney, a deputy whip on the leadership team, said the conference is \u201clucky to have Paul Ryan as our speaker.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked whether his feelings would change if Ryan pushed a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling through the House, an idea he abhors, the Florida Republican said it would not: \u201cI thank God every day that he\u2019s agreed to do this job\u2026 If anybody ever said: \u2018Oh, we\u2019d be in a better place if only Paul Ryan wasn\u2019t our speaker,\u2019 they\u2019d be completely 100 percent wrong.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose feelings are about to be put to the test, however. Conservative lawmakers in the Freedom Caucus and Republican Study Committee have vowed to oppose a debt ceiling increase that doesn\u2019t include spending cuts. In an email to Republicans last week, the RSC reiterated that stance and solicited ideas for mandatory savings that could get the group to \u201cyes.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Democrats would block such a bill in the Senate, and the White House has asked for borrowing-authority legislation without policy strings. So Ryan \u2014 a conservative at heart who would support cuts in theory \u2014 will be forced to put his convictions aside and bring the vote to the floor.\u000a\u000aFurther escalating tensions with his conservative conference, Congress is expected to raise strict spending caps this fall. If those are not offset by cuts, Ryan could again find himself in hot water with his right flank.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe should not lift spending caps, and any increase in the debt ceiling must be coupled with major reforms to reduce spending,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cIf Republicans push a clean debt ceiling increase and higher spending levels, then our party should not pretend it cares about fiscal responsibility.\u201d\u000a\u000aRyan, as he often does, is trying to tune out the drama and focus on his extensive to-do list. The speaker spent Wednesday and Thursday selling tax reform \u2014 Hill Republicans\u2019 greatest shot at redemption \u2014 to Pacific Northwest businesses. Trump, by contrast, barely mentioned it during a nationally televised Arizona rally Tuesday.\u000a\u000aRyan allies are also hoping the White House takes note of what the speaker has done to advance Trump's agenda. Besides passing the health care repeal bill, Ryan agreed to shelve a central pillar of his tax reform blueprint, opposed by Trump, for the sake of advancing a plan.\u000a\u000aFor now, Trump's attention is on his wall.\u000a\u000aDuring the Tuesday night rally, Trump vowed: \u201cIf we have to close down our government, we\u2019re building that wall.\u201d Congressional Republicans worry, however, that the public will make them pay in the next election if the government closes. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican took a beating when the government shuttered in 1995, even though a Democrat, Bill Clinton, was president.\u000a\u000aIn the House, Ryan has already ushered through a bill that would make a down payment on Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise. The problem, as with the debt ceiling, is that it will never pass muster in the 60-vote-threshold Senate.\u000a\u000aShould wall funding fall through, it will have less to do with Ryan\u2019s actions than those of the upper chamber. But that doesn\u2019t mean Ryan won\u2019t be blamed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe American people are holding the House \u2014 specifically Speaker Ryan \u2014 even more accountable than Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Walker, who \u2014 despite his differences with the speaker \u2014 believes Ryan is the best man for the job. \u201cThe House can say, \u2018We did our job,\u2019 but in the eyes of the American people, the speaker is the primary figure that makes Congress either efficient or inefficient."\u000a\u000a"Is it fair?" He added. "No.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVThe move to drop Kushner Companies, the family real estate company of Jared Kushner (pictured), came amid widespread outrage over Trump's response to protests in Charlottesville. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo. New York PR maven Risa Heller drops Kushner Cos.\u000a\u000aCrisis management consultant Risa Heller has dropped Kushner Cos., the family real estate company of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a client, according to two sources familiar with the arrangement.\u000a\u000aHeller dropped the client earlier this week after representing the company for just over a year and a half.

aVECB Communications Director Christine Graeff and ECB President Mario Draghi attend a press conference in Washington, D.C. | Pete Marovich/EPA ECB\u2019s (non)communication strategy keeps investors in the dark Limiting debate is an approach ECB Communications Director Christine Graeff shares with her boss, Mario Draghi.\u000a\u000aFRANKFURT \u2014 A group of German journalists watched in disbelief as Christine Graeff rushed to the microphone.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis will close the press conference,\u201d said Graeff, the European Central Bank\u2019s communications director, as its president, Mario Draghi, readied to leave. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was March, when rising price pressures across the eurozone would have guaranteed some critical questions from the inflation-obsessed Germans. But not one of those German reporters got to ask a question.\u000a\u000aWhether deliberate or an oversight, the abrupt ending was seen by many in attendance as typical for Graeff. Since starting in 2013, the 44-year-old daughter of German and French parents has deployed a tight-fisted control of information.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course, they denied that [freezing out the Germans] was intentional,\u201d said one journalist who didn\u2019t get an opportunity to ask a question. \u201cThat is not very convincing. And if it was, it is amazingly incompetent.\u201d Even people working for the bank were surprised by the move, the journalist added.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ECB seems to have given up trying to reach the general public\u201d \u2014 Holger Steltzner\u000a\u000aJournalists covering the ECB were reluctant to speak on the record about its communication strategy, fearing that doing so would make it more difficult to secure important interviews or information.\u000a\u000aThe European Central Bank declined to comment for this article.\u000a\u000aIt was not only this press conference that left questions unanswered. While press conferences traditionally last an hour, Graeff ended every single one of them this year earlier than that. For those who don\u2019t get a question in, the chance to make up for it elsewhere is close to zero. Draghi gave not a single sit-down interview this year, and he rarely speaks to journalists on the sidelines of conferences or elsewhere.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ECB seems to have given up trying to reach the general public,\u201d said Holger Steltzner, publisher of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, one of Germany\u2019s leading broadsheets.\u000a\u000aWink-wink\u000a\u000aUnder Graeff, the bank\u2019s communication\u2019s department has done much to propel itself into the 21st century, giving ECB watchers a better chance to understand its decisions by publishing minutes of policy meetings and executive board members\u2019 diaries about three months after the fact. Graeff and her team have also organized more background briefings, at which officials have the chance to explain their thinking freely to journalists, without every word being reported.\u000a\u000aGraeff\u2019s approach to minutes diverges from the past, when journalists tracking the ECB watched with envy their colleagues in the United States, where the Federal Reserve has for years published minutes of policy discussions. However, fewer follow-up questions are now allowed at press conferences.\u000a\u000aLike Draghi, Graeff spends little time in the ECB office in Frankfurt, making it hard for ECB-watchers seeking guidance to get a hold of her, a number of journalists confirmed. While Draghi is more of a lone intellectual limiting his contacts to a tight-knit group of trusted advisers, Graeff maintains a busy schedule traveling and networking.\u000a\u000aWhen she is in town, she does all the charming that Draghi may not get around to. Graeff \u2014 who once wrote a European guide to corporate kissing \u2014 winks at nearly everyone she meets, a signature gesture that has taken aback many a colleague at the conservative ECB.\u000a\u000aBut when it comes to exposing Draghi to questions from the media, Graeff is suddenly far more reserved.\u000a\u000aShortly after she started at the ECB in 2013, fresh from the communications consultancy Brunswick, Graeff asked some reporters to submit questions ahead of the regular monetary policy press conference, said two veteran journalists covering the ECB at the time. Though the journalists refused to play ball, it has left them wary of attempts to control the public debate.\u000a\u000aJournalists seen as critical of the ECB complain about having a particularly hard time getting access. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for instance said their main ECB-watcher has not had any invitations to key ECB background briefings. The ECB declined to comment on which, if any, mechanisms it has in place to ensure equal access of key media covering the ECB.\u000a\u000a\u2018Whatever it takes\u2019\u000a\u000aLimiting provocative debate is an approach Graeff shares with her boss. According to officials at the bank, Draghi has little time for open discussion.\u000a\u000a\u201cDraghi prefers to have one-on-one meetings, keeping others in the dark of what has been discussed,\u201d one central bank official said, describing his strategy as a soft form of divide and conquer.\u000a\u000aInternally, where Draghi has described his secretive style as an attempt to prevent the bank\u2019s frequent leaks, the bank president\u2019s go-it-alone attitude draws both admiration and scorn.\u000a\u000aThe Italian will forever be admired for his \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech, a communication miracle widely credited with shoring up the eurozone in the dark days of the debt crisis in 2012. Those three magic words came as a complete surprise to his colleagues on the bank\u2019s governing council, but they quickly rallied behind them, helping Draghi provide a defensive shield for members of the eurozone under speculative attacks.\u000a\u000aThree years and \u20ac2 trillion later, the national governors are no better informed about Draghi\u2019s thoughts about the best policy course ahead.\u000a\u000aDraghi made a similar move when he addressed the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in 2014. Just before he took the podium, Draghi scribbled in a reference in his speech to a set of economic statistics that indicated inflation across the eurozone was headed for a lasting decline. The remark put the ECB on track for a large-scale asset purchase program that started six months later.\u000a\u000aThis time around, not all policymakers were enthused. \u201cMario is more secretive \u2026 and less collegial,\u201d one ECB insider complained to Reuters at the time. \u201cThe national governors [of the eurozone\u2019s central banks] sometimes feel kept in the dark, out of the loop.\u201d\u000a\u000aThree years and \u20ac2 trillion later, the national governors are no better informed about Draghi\u2019s thoughts about the best policy course ahead. \u201cThe exit [from ultra accommodative monetary policy measures] has not been on the meeting agendas, and we have not talked about it,\u201d an official from a national central bank told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t just investors but also fellow policymakers who were spooked when Draghi used the ECB\u2019s annual flagship conference in Sintra, Portugal, to shift his rhetoric, sparking expectations that the ECB would soon adjust it policies.\u000a\u000aThis time, the markets did not quite react the way Draghi wanted as they perceived the message as much more hawkish than he intended, and ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio stepped in the next day, trying to explain to markets what his boss really meant.\u000a\u000aStep-by-Step\u000a\u000aDraghi\u2019s penchant for surprise might have been an asset when he was battling low inflation and trying to keep the eurozone from falling apart \u2014 especially if the alternative was weeks of delay as he sought consensus on the council as the situation threatened to spiral out of control.\u000a\u000aBut now that the situation has stabilized, his approach could turn into a liability when it comes to withdrawing support measures, as markets react wildly to unexpected news, harming the recovery.\u000a\u000a\u201cSurprises can be good when you want to elicit a major market reaction, such as when you want to end a financial panic as Draghi did in July 2012,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a Hamburg-based private bank. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to elicit a major market reaction, it is better to proceed calmly, step by step, with communication always ahead of the actual policy steps.\u201d\u000a\u000aDraghi seems to think that he should be the sole source of early guidance. Possibly worried about investor jitters on perceived differences between policymakers, Draghi earlier this year warned his executive board against publicly discussing future policies, according to a bank official. The move was begrudgingly received and adhered to halfheartedly at best.\u000a\u000aWhatever its economic merits, the Draghi and Graeff media strategy has not resonated with the general public. That may be in part because ECB executive board members tend to speak more to expert media outlets rather than mainstream media.\u000a\u000aIn the recent years, most board member interviews have gone to financial news providers Bloomberg and CNBC, as well as Germany\u2019s Boersen-Zeitung, which markets itself by its narrow focus on \u201cpure\u201d financial news.\u000a\u000aNot reaching out to eurozone citizens is reflected in their lack of trust in the central bank. Even as people in the eurozone have rediscovered their love for the common currency, with public support for the euro hitting a 12-year high this year, just 37 percent of the population trusts the bank, according to the European Union\u2019s most recent Eurobarometer opinion poll. Some 49 percent do not.\u000a\u000aIf the ECB leaves the public in the dark, investors are wandering in a fog with little idea where the path ahead leads.\u000a\u000aWhat is needed to master the momentous challenge ahead, though, is a clearly spelled out and longer-term exit strategy for all to understand that is backed by the council.\u000a\u000a\u201cCommunicating an optimal exit plan would be a good place to start,\u201d BNP Paribas economist Richard Barwell said. The chief advantage of publishing that plan is that it would force the council to discuss and agree it beforehand.\u201d\u000a\u000aDraghi has two key upcoming speaking engagements, one during the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium from August 24-26 and the other when he holds his regular press conference in Frankfurt in September.\u000a\u000aHe could say anything \u2014 or nothing at all.

aVTina Fey tore into President Trump, white supremacists and a sheet cake on a special "Weekend Update." The comedian joined hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che to talk about the white nationalist rally that unfolded in Charlottesville at her alma mater, University of Virginia, last Friday and slammed Mr. Trump while digging into a sheet cake.\u000a\u000aFey, who graduated in 1992, said, "I graduated a virgin and I still liked it ... So it broke my heart to see these evil forces descend upon Charlottesville."\u000a\u000aFey took a fork and angrily stabbed a piece of cake, shoveling messy bites into her mouth while saying, "[Mr. Trump] condemns violence 'on many sides' ... 'Many sides,' Colin, and I'm feeling sick because I saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and I wasn't confused. No, Colin, neo-Nazis are always bad."\u000a\u000aFey then talked about how there are nine more alt-right rallies planned around the nation, including in New York, and she cracked, "Part of me hopes these neo-Nazis try it in New York City. I hope they try it and get the ham kicked out of them by a bunch of drag queens."\u000a\u000aBut why cake? Fey said it's a good alternative to getting violent. "You support maybe a Jewish-run bakery or an African-American-run bakery, order a cake with an American flag on it and then, um, just eat it," she explained. She also claimed that "sheet-caking" is a grassroots movement.\u000a\u000a"Most women I know have been doing it once a week since the election," she said. Che joined Fey in sheet-caking as well.\u000a\u000aFey also slammed Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and offered up a variation on sheet-caking that involves grilled cheese.

aVPARIS \u2014 When he was running for French president, Emmanuel Macron always proclaimed that he would govern \u201cover the long term,\u201d ignore the short-term \u201cnoise\u201d of real-time news and commentary, and not pay much attention to volatile popularity polls.\u000a\u000aMacron and his aides also insisted that he wouldn\u2019t want to be judged on his first 100 days.\u000a\u000aIt turns out that, at least, was a good idea.\u000a\u000aMacron reaches that early landmark on Monday having made a splash on the world stage but having also racked up a series of missteps and blunders at home. And the parliament dominated by inexperienced MPs from the party he created just last year has been criticized for an amateurish approach to legislating.\u000a\u000aAs a result, and after a series of summer faux pas, the polls that the president professes not to consult now show he has a lower approval rating than even his unpopular predecessor François Hollande at the same stage in his presidency. Not since Jacques Chirac in 2002 has a new president sunk so fast in such surveys.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s defenders point out that he is still on a learning curve \u2014 and that he has shown he can be a fast learner. \u201cYou aren\u2019t born president, you grow into the job. Look at the mistakes Barack Obama and Angela Merkel made when they started out,\u201d said former MEP and Green party leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit in a recent interview.\u000a\u000aThe pessimists, on the other hand, fear that Macron\u2019s own style of governing is at fault. They wonder whether the young president, who promised to change the nation, will be able to change himself. And they are warning of more trouble ahead once the government starts implementing the reforms the president pledged during his campaign \u2014 a process that hasn\u2019t really begun in earnest yet.\u000a\u000aStrategy session\u000a\u000aFeeling that his first steps as president left something to be desired, Macron convened a special strategy meeting of his closest political allies at the Elysée palace at the end of July.\u000a\u000aSome aides, a few Cabinet members who were early supporters of Macron\u2019s presidential bid, a couple of parliamentary bigwigs and officials of the president\u2019s La République en Marche (LREM) party were invited to the powwow. Macron wanted to correct his course after what looked like two months of chaotic on-the-job training.\u000a\u000aThe government had been taken by surprise by hostile reaction to what it thought were modest cuts in housing benefits. The armed forces\u2019 chief of staff \u2014 France\u2019s top military officer \u2014 had resigned over cuts to the defense budget. Macron himself had seemed at odds with his own prime minister, Edouard Philippe, and called off some of the measures announced by the PM in his maiden speech to parliament in early July. Meanwhile, Labor Minister Muriel Pénicaud, tasked with steering through Macron\u2019s signature labor market reform in the fall, was caught up in an ethics probe.\u000a\u000aBut even the organization of that meeting looked like a blunder. As it started, Macron complained that Philippe \u2014 the former conservative MP who had been the new president\u2019s surprise choice to head the Cabinet \u2014 hadn\u2019t been invited, and ordered that he should be present at such gatherings in future.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, we are beginners, and we\u2019ve made beginners\u2019 mistakes, but look at the laws we passed\u201d \u2014 Gilles Le Gendre, vice president of LREM in parliament\u000a\u000aAs often happens with governments going through a bad patch, participants mostly blamed their woes on \u201cpoor communication,\u201d according to a meeting participant.\u000a\u000aOthers concur with that analysis. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that with so little opposition to speak of in parliament, the focus would be on us,\u201d Gilles Le Gendre, a Paris MP and the vice president of the LREM group in parliament, told POLITICO.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, we are beginners, and we\u2019ve made beginners\u2019 mistakes, but look at the laws we passed,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aDuring their opening, extraordinary summer session, MPs notably voted through laws intended to clean up the political system and giving the government wide powers to reform the labor market.\u000a\u000aAs for the Cabinet, Le Gendre added, \u201cyes, there were small blunders, but it comes with the territory\u201d of a radical change of the guard in French politics after the spring\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections.\u000a\u000aBut some in the government say there are more serious problems at work.\u000a\u000aBoth in substance and in style, in domestic as well as foreign policy, the 39-year-old Macron has so far failed to convince the French that the qualities that got him elected against all odds on May 7 are helping him to govern effectively.\u000a\u000aSecond-guessing\u000a\u000aMacron is said to have been irritated by the government\u2019s blunders, but some point out that his own presidential style is at fault. And that it doesn\u2019t help when the president second-guesses his ministers and admonishes them for decisions that prove unpopular \u2014 even though he had sanctioned them in the first place.\u000a\u000aBoth the housing benefit snafu and the quarrel over the military budget stemmed from the government\u2019s choice to do everything to bring France\u2019s budget deficit under the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP, after an audit revealed that the previous Socialist government had been rather over-optimistic on the state of public finances.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Macron] could have gone to Brussels and pleaded that it was not his deficit but Hollande\u2019s. Instead, he made the bad strategic choice. Once you make a bad strategic choice, you can\u2019t have good policy decisions,\u201d railed a finance ministry official who has served under both socialist and conservative governments.\u000a\u000aSome, however, say the government\u2019s decision was more about sending a signal than pure economic policy. \u201cIt was important for France\u2019s international credibility to show it is keen on reducing deficits, and doing that through spending cuts,\u201d said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief investment strategist at Blackrock, a big U.S. investment fund.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust as he starts talking, he will also have to start acting \u2026 That will take more than carefully staged virile handshakes\u201d \u2014 A government official\u000a\u000aAnd the eurozone recovery meant the cuts \u201cwon\u2019t hurt the economy much,\u201d Mateos y Lago added.\u000a\u000aLe Gendre, the MP, argued the cuts were \u201cindiscriminate and a bit brutal\u201d because you can\u2019t be subtle so late in the financial year.\u000a\u000aMaking a priority of cutting the deficit led Philippe to announce on July 4 that the government would have to postpone promised tax reforms, such as deep cuts in wealth tax or the gradual repeal of a broad real estate tax. Faced with public uproar, Macron promptly put both reforms back on this year\u2019s agenda \u2014 even though the French lower house had approved Philippe\u2019s program in a vote six days earlier.\u000a\u000aThat illustrated to some the limits of Macron\u2019s chosen governing style \u2014 the so-called \u201cJupiter\u201d approach, named after the supreme god of Roman mythology, with a distant president focused on foreign affairs and long-term big issues, not the intricacies of policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you pretend to let the Cabinet make policy and don\u2019t take care of things upstream, you end up second-guessing your prime minister and your ministers, which chips away at their credibility,\u201d acknowledged a government aide who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media.\u000a\u000aForeign forays\u000a\u000aIn the international arena, by contrast, Macron\u2019s first steps left French diplomats elated at the new president\u2019s capacity to restore the country\u2019s diplomatic prestige.\u000a\u000aWithin Europe, Macron\u2019s pledges to implement serious economic reforms made it possible for France to talk with Germany with some credibility. Beyond Europe, it just took a virile handshake with U.S. President Donald Trump and a testy lunch with Vladimir Putin to show that France was back in the game.\u000a\u000aOr so it seemed. \u201cAfter all, 40 percent of diplomacy is theater, and we have a president who understands that perfectly well,\u201d said an admiring French diplomat who served as an ambassador in more than one European capital.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf course,\u201d he added, \u201cfor now we\u2019re still waiting for the other 60 percent.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven though they took pride in the president\u2019s style, French diplomats noted that he still has things to learn on substance.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s eagerness to emphasize his differences with his predecessors has led him to make odd pronouncements. He said in June that he wanted to \u201cbreak with 10 years of imported neo-conservatism\u201d in French foreign policy but, in reality, his stance is broadly in keeping with France\u2019s long-term approach to both Europe and the wider world.\u000a\u000aContrary to his Jupiterian pledge, Macron has now decided he needs to be more involved in day-to-day decisions.\u000a\u000aAfter humiliating his prime minister, taking his ministers to task for their blunders, and calling for better policies, he has now embarked on a tighter centralization of decisions at the Elysée palace.\u000a\u000aHis presidency so far has been one of images more than words, and words more than deeds. Pictures and video clips of the president outnumber his speeches, his press interviews have been almost non-existent, and his main actions so far have often been to contradict his own Cabinet.\u000a\u000aHe will start to become more visibly involved in the business of governing in September by \u201cspeaking\u201d to the nation, said an aide \u2014 whether through a speech, a media interview or a press conference is unclear. That\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t done seriously ever since he was elected, save for a few careful soundbites during photo opportunities.\u000a\u000a\u201cJust as he starts talking, he will also have to start acting,\u201d a government official noted. \u201cThat will take more than carefully staged virile handshakes.\u201d\u000a\u000aView a timeline of key moments from Macron\u2019s first 100 days here.

aVUS President Donald Trump | Pete Marovich - Pool/Getty Images Trump signs transgender military ban The directive reinstates a prohibition of transgender service members lifted last year.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump on Friday signed a directive reinstating a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military, although it defers to the Pentagon on whether to remove those now in uniform and leaves open the door for it to seek changes.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s directive, issued to the Defense and Homeland Security Departments, reinstates a prohibition of transgender service members lifted last year, putting a formal stamp on a politically divisive change in military personnel policy that Trump first announced last month.\u000a\u000aIt also bars funding to pay for gender-reassignment surgeries except when \u201cnecessary to protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe guidance gives Defense Secretary Jim Mattis until Feb. 21, 2018, to submit a plan for implementing the new policy. It also leaves decision of whether to remove current troops to Mattis.\u000a\u000aThe White House memo also leaves the door open for further changes in the transgender policy, stating that Mattis may advise him on changes.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may advise me at any time, in writing, that a change to this policy is warranted,\u201d the memo states.\u000a\u000aThen-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced in June 2016 the ban on transgender troops would be lifted. Mattis, however, delayed implementation of the policy for new recruits by six months to allow for further study.\u000a\u000aTrump first revealed he would reverse the policy in a series of tweets on July 26, announcing transgender individuals would not be allowed \u201cto serve in any capacity\u201d in the military.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s announcement last month on Twitter that he planned to reverse the Obama policy was hailed by some conservatives who argue that the military has become a social experiment.\u000a\u000aBut it also drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans, who argue the policy shift is discriminatory and would disrupt military readiness.\u000a\u000aPentagon spokeswoman Dana White Friday confirmed in a statement that the department had received the guidance but provided no further details.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Department of Defense has received formal guidance from the White House in reference to transgender personnel serving in the military,\u201d White said. \u201cMore information will be forth coming.\u201d\u000a\u000aExperts predict that implementation of the ban will prove a lethal thicket and predict a series of court challenges that will likely delay the policy.

aVMonsanto displays its weedkiller Roundup in its headquarters in Saint Louis | Brent Stirton/Getty Images Monsanto attempts takedown of agency linking its weedkiller to cancer Debate focuses on whether scientists failed to consider German studies on the safety of glyphosate.\u000a\u000aMonsanto is on the attack.\u000a\u000aIn its fight to keep its blockbuster weedkiller glyphosate on the European market, the American agrichemical giant has spent the last six months fighting accusations that it suppressed negative findings or even ghostwrote key research about whether the herbicide causes cancer.\u000a\u000aNow the company is opening a new front with evidence it says debunks the only appraisal by a major world body to label glyphosate as carcinogenic.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO analyzed hundreds of previously undisclosed documents from a high-profile court case in San Francisco and conducted interviews with numerous scientific experts to tell the tale of the intense battle between Monsanto and scientists over the controversial finding. Monsanto gave POLITICO exclusive access to the court documents.\u000a\u000aThe global pesticides powerhouse is questioning the findings of scientists who worked for the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In 2015, the agency made glyphosate one of Europe\u2019s most toxic political issues when it concluded the weedkiller \u201cis probably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was a hammer blow to Missouri-based Monsanto, whose blockbuster product Roundup, a favorite among farmers and gardeners, is based on the herbicide. It also whipped up an intense EU-wide debate over whether farmers should be allowed to continue utilizing a product they have used for more than four decades and that they say is vital to preserve yields of common crops from carrots to barley.\u000a\u000aScientists and contributors to the IARC review say the company\u2019s claims are part of an industry-led witch hunt against the only scientific body to question glyphosate\u2019s safety.\u000a\u000aIARC\u2019s findings were later dismissed by two EU bodies \u2014 the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority \u2014 but remain a significant reference point in the debate surrounding the pesticide\u2019s health risks.\u000a\u000aIn Europe at least, the battle over glyphosate appears to be entering the endgame. The EU is soon expected to make a final ruling on whether to reapprove the chemical\u2019s license for 10 years, and momentum is building in favor of doing so. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her agriculture minister, Christian Schmidt, have thrown their weight behind the weedkiller. Failure to continue selling glyphosate in Europe beyond the end of the year would cut into a sizeable chunk of Monsanto\u2019s pesticides business, which earns it billions of dollars every year across the globe.\u000a\u000aMonsanto wants to seize on the pendulum swing spearheaded by Germany by undermining how IARC reached its original decision. To do so, the company zeroed in on testimony found in a sworn deposition from Charles William Jameson, a world-renowned scientist who specialized in animal studies at IARC. The deposition reveals, Monsanto says, that IARC unfairly disregarded two important pieces of research from Germany that suggested the herbicide was safe.\u000a\u000aScientists and contributors to the IARC review say the company\u2019s claims are part of an industry-led witch hunt against the only scientific body to question glyphosate\u2019s safety.\u000a\u000aJourney to Lyon\u000a\u000aJameson arrived at IARC\u2019s offices in Lyon, France, on March 3, 2015, to begin a week of closed-door talks evaluating the carcinogenicity of glyphosate. The now-retired scientist from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in the U.S. was in charge of deciding whether the available scientific evidence in the public domain proved the herbicide could cause cancer in humans.\u000a\u000aThe decision to evaluate glyphosate\u2019s safety was made in 2014 after an international advisory group of senior scientists and government officials recommended dozens of pesticides, including glyphosate, for evaluation.\u000a\u000aLittle did Jameson know, however, when he sat down alongside the IARC working group\u2019s 17 other scientific experts, that he did not possess the full picture, he said in the deposition. Ten days after Jameson arrived, the IARC said glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe undisclosed court documents seen by POLITICO that are now at the heart of a legal case against Monsanto in California raise questions about whether the IARC properly considered two pieces of scientific work from Germany. Lymphoma patients, who say their condition was caused by glyphosate, brought the case after seeing ads for a free evaluation of their illnesses from several U.S. law firms.\u000a\u000aThe proceedings, which began in 2016, snowballed into a broader investigation into whether glyphosate is harmful. Later this year, Judge Vince Chhabria of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California will issue an unusual verdict on whether decades of scientific evidence support a direct link between glyphosate and cancer. A hearing on the case is scheduled for next week.\u000a\u000aEarly in the case, Monsanto came out looking worse than ever: Court documents released by the judge implied that company executives attempted to suppress information about the potential dangers of its Roundup herbicide. In at least one case, they seemed to have \u201cghostwritten\u201d research on glyphosate then hired academics to put their names to a peer-reviewed publication.\u000a\u000aThen, in May, Jameson was questioned by lawyers representing Monsanto. Jameson is a paid expert witness on behalf of the lymphoma patients. He told them he hadn\u2019t received key data that would have contributed more deeply to IARC\u2019s assessment of glyphosate.\u000a\u000aMonsanto sensed an opportunity to seize the narrative.\u000a\u000aHidden details?\u000a\u000aThe first alleged omission raising concerns over IARC\u2019s decision concerns data from Germany\u2019s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). It concluded glyphosate was not carcinogenic in 2015. In a May 3 deposition, Jameson said he neither received nor consulted any data from BfR, although it was sent to IARC on February 3, 2015, a full month before its assessment began in Lyon, France.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen an organization such as IARC is given authority, with that comes a responsibility \u2026 to be objective, transparent, thorough and fair\u201d \u2014 Scott Partridge\u000a\u000aThe second questionable omission is a peer-reviewed study by the German scientist Helmut Greim drawing on tumor data from 14 carcinogenicity studies on rats. Jameson\u2019s deposition, as well as email correspondence between Monsanto and IARC, reveal that Jameson was never sent Greim\u2019s study until the very last moment even though IARC had it a month before making its assessment. Greim\u2019s work was sponsored by Monsanto.\u000a\u000aPresented with evidence by Monsanto\u2019s lawyers showing that two of his colleagues at IARC \u2014 Kate Guyton, the officer responsible for IARC\u2019s monographs section, and Ivan Rusyn, a member of the IARC working group \u2014 received the full set of data from Greim\u2019s peer-reviewed study on February 3, 2015, but had not sent it to him, Jameson replied while giving sworn testimony in a deposition: \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d\u000a\u000aJameson told lawyers he saw the Greim study only a day before the IARC meeting in a subgroup chair meeting, which prepared IARC\u2019s assessment. Had IARC been able to analyze the contents of the study properly, he said, it could have altered the agency\u2019s final conclusions as he was in charge of the IARC team tasked with analyzing animal tests.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a lot of discussion around the table about if this publication should be even looked at, because it was not received in the time identified in the announcement for submission of data that IARC had for this particular monograph meeting,\u201d Jameson said in the deposition. The deadline to submit data to IARC was February 3, 2015.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for IARC denied to POLITICO that data was withheld from Jameson and said that all public data it receives is distributed \u201cvia shared electronic resources, to which the entire Working Group has simultaneous access.\u201d\u000a\u000aJameson also said that the amount of data received from the Greim study was so \u201coverwhelming\u201d it would not have been possible to do a full review during the meeting in Lyon.\u000a\u000aIARC said the Greim study was summarized as part of the overall assessment on glyphosate, though it declined to answer questions about why the raw data used in the study were not fully analyzed, which Monsanto has described as an important omission.\u000a\u000aThe revelations add to questions about IARC\u2019s decision after Reuters revealed in June that Aaron Blair, who chaired IARC\u2019s working group on glyphosate, had seen unpublished but acclaimed research finding no evidence of a link between glyphosate and cancer but chose not to include the findings in IARC\u2019s review. That research was carried out by the Agricultural Health Study, which is funded by the U.S. government\u2019s National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\u000a\u000a\u2018IARC \u2026 violated responsibilities\u2019\u000a\u000aTo the experts at Monsanto, the handling of the German evidence is a clear sign IARC made mistakes. Scott Partridge, Monsanto\u2019s vice president of strategy, said in a recent interview with POLITICO that IARC needed an external investigation into its workings to understand whether its assessment on glyphosate was structurally sound.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen an organization such as IARC is given authority, with that comes a responsibility \u2026 to be objective, transparent, thorough and fair,\u201d he said. \u201cIARC has violated each and every one of those responsibilities and that should be troubling to anyone who is interested in preserving sound science.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAt least in this instance, their process was corrupted apparently with individuals who have an agenda,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aOne official at IARC who did receive the raw data from the Greim study was Rusyn, a scientist based in the U.S. who runs a laboratory that tries to understand why chemicals cause cancer in rodents. In a February 27, 2015, email, IARC\u2019s Guyton asked Rusyn whether he would like to include the Greim data in IARC\u2019s glyphosate review.\u000a\u000aRusyn replied by casting doubt on the relevance of the Greim study.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an interesting polemical piece,\u201d he said in a reply email. \u201cIt does not surprise me that when under pressure the industry can \u2018muster\u2019 a relevant publication that goes from submission to acceptance in as little as 7 weeks,\u201d he added, appearing to draw links between the publication of the study and the interests of Monsanto.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am confident that the IARC monograph will be much more comprehensive and balanced,\u201d he noted at the time.\u000a\u000aRusyn told Guyton to pass on \u201cfacts\u201d from the Greim study to IARC\u2019s sub-group 3, which Jameson chaired. Jameson never received the information, according to his deposition.\u000a\u000aRusyn declined to comment directly on Jameson\u2019s comments in the deposition.\u000a\u000aQuestioning the data\u000a\u000aRusyn said that the Greim study \u201cfell in a pretty wide gray zone\u201d as it lacked data on matters such as statistical methods, choice of doses, body-weight gain and survival data of rats.\u000a\u000aGreim, who conducted the 2015 study on glyphosate, said in an interview that it would have been useful for IARC to fully analyze the data in his study.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the light of the conclusions of other institutions which are known and do their work in a proper way and came to a negative result, I can only say that I at least don\u2019t understand why IARC came to a positive result and says it is carcinogenic,\u201d Greim said. \u201cTo be modest, to be polite \u2026 from my point of view they [IARC] made a mistake.\u201d\u000a\u000aOthers, however, say IARC\u2019s decision not to perform a deep analysis of the data was justified due to wider questions about the methodology underpinning the scientific studies that went into the Greim study.\u000a\u000a\u201cIARC only looks at studies of quality and sorts out all studies that are deemed not reliable, at least to a certain degree\u201d \u2014 Anton Safer\u000a\u000a\u201cIARC only looks at studies of quality and sorts out all studies that are deemed not reliable, at least to a certain degree,\u201d said Anton Safer, an independent scientist at the University of Heidelberg who has done extensive research into the standards attached to industry-funded scientific studies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe claim from industry is that \u2018we are perfect and we are working to good laboratory practices,'\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that there are violations which could lead to major questions arising of the studies used by industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aUPDATED: This article was updated to clarify the type of case brought by the plaintiffs against Monsanto.

aVSays that in the Philippines more than a century ago, Gen. John Pershing "took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs\u2019 blood," and shot 49 Muslim rebels. "The 50th person, he said, \u2018You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.\u2019 And for 25 years, there wasn\u2019t a problem."\u000a\u000aRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing.\u000a\u000aDuring a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War.\u000a\u000aHelp PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate.\u000a\u000aAfter taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department.\u000a\u000aAfter the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies.\u000a\u000a"They were having terrorism problems, just like we do," Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. "And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs\u2019 blood \u2014 you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs\u2019 blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn\u2019t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn\u2019t a problem."\u000a\u000aAfter Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a "legend."\u000a\u000aWe decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump\u2019s takeaway is wrong-headed. We\u2019ll take a look at those two concerns separately below.\u000a\u000aDid it happen?\u000a\u000aThe idea that pig\u2019s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades.\u000a\u000aFor instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin "to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers," Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently.\u000a\u000aSnopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005.\u000a\u000aBut the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines.\u000a\u000a"Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal," according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal.\u000a\u000aHowever, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.)\u000a\u000aOther historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least.\u000a\u000a"This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited," said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. "I am amazed it is still making the rounds."\u000a\u000aChristopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that "I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character."\u000a\u000aIndeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to "pacifying" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors.\u000a\u000a"He did a lot of what we would call \u2018winning hearts and minds\u2019 and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn\u2019t negotiate with him. He wasn\u2019t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply."\u000a\u000aAnother wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It\u2019s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions.\u000a\u000a"The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims," Janda said. "This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism."\u000a\u000aFacts aside, Trump\u2019s larger point is wrong\u000a\u000aTo many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing\u2019s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified "terrorists" is actually the bigger problem with Trump\u2019s parable.\u000a\u000a"Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense," said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region "remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present."\u000a\u000aSilbey of Cornell agreed. "Where Trump\u2019s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked," he said. "The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that\u2019s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig\u2019s blood isn\u2019t -- and wasn\u2019t -- some magical method of ending terrorism."\u000a\u000aIf anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump\u2019s narrative.\u000a\u000a"The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied," Janda said. "It\u2019s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies."\u000a\u000aOur ruling\u000a\u000aOf the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact.\u000a\u000aPerhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump\u2019s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump\u2019s claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire.\u000a\u000aUPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents "were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins."\u000a\u000aIn a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: "Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics."\u000a\u000aWhile these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, they do not support the claim Trump made. There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig\u2019s blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today.\u000a\u000aWhen we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion. Our rating remains Pants on Fire.

aVThe EU objects to what it sees as UK attempts to link the Northern Ireland issue to negotiations on future trade | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images EU to UK: Don\u2019t use Northern Ireland as bargaining chip in Brexit talks The EU objects to what it sees as UK attempts to link Northern Ireland issue to negotiations on future trade.\u000a\u000aThe EU warned British negotiators arriving in Brussels next week for the third round of Brexit talks that they should not use the Northern Ireland peace process as a \u201cbargaining chip\u201d to try to speed up Brexit talks.\u000a\u000aBoth the EU and the U.K. have underlined their commitment to the peace process, but there are concerns in Brussels that London is attempting to tie the future state of the Good Friday Agreement to talks on what the U.K.\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU will look like.\u000a\u000aReferring to a position paper on the Northern Irish border published last week by the British government, a senior EU official, who briefed reporters in Brussels Friday, objected to London linking the issue to negotiations on future trade. \u201cWe are a bit concerned by the combination in the U.K. paper between the preservation of the peace process and the future of the EU-U.K. trade relationship,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt is very important that the peace process does not become a bargaining chip in these negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Britain, a spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the U.K. position paper on Northern Ireland \u201cputs protecting the Good Friday Agreement at the heart of our approach.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThat includes a proposal that the U.K. and EU should agree upfront on the crucial importance of avoiding a hard border for the peace process in Northern Ireland,\u201d said the DExEU spokesman.\u000a\u000aA DExEU official added: \u201cThis type of language suggests they don\u2019t properly understand the sensitivities or appreciate the human costs behind the hard-won progress in Northern Ireland.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not some sort of game with bargaining chips. The third round of negotiations begin next week and we enter those discussions ready to make progress.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K. has been pushing for the Brexit talks to move on to the country\u2019s future relationship with the EU, including trade and customs arrangements. But the EU has said it will only do so once the negotiations on Britain\u2019s financial obligations, the rights of EU citizens residing in the U.K. and how to manage the Irish border after the split have made \u201csufficient progress.\u201d A decision on whether they have done so will be made in October at a summit of EU leaders.\u000a\u000aThe official said the EU\u2019s negotiating team, headed by Michel Barnier, would like Britain to come forward with a concrete methodology for calculating its financial obligations to reassure all the remaining 27 EU members.\u000a\u000aBarnier \u201cwould be comfortable recommending sufficient progress\u201d has been made if there is \u201ca methodology sufficiently detailed\u201d to calculate the EU\u2019s exit bill, the official said, including some sort of legal analysis.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are indeed not looking at a number now, but we need to have these guarantees that the commitments to which the U.K. is a member will be honored,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aBritish negotiators have said they intend to present their views on the EU\u2019s position orally next week, and that discussions on the financial settlement will focus on the U.K.\u2019s involvement in the European Investment Bank and EU development funding.\u000a\u000aA second senior EU official, who also briefed reporters, said if Britain leaves issues surrounding the financial settlement to the end of the talks \u201cyou increase the risk of failure rather than manage it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAn official familiar with the U.K.\u2019s position said of the EU\u2019s proposals on the Brexit bill: \u201cWe didn\u2019t find it a convincing case. Hugely unconvincing. We will go through all relevant legal provisions. They need to understand where we\u2019re coming from. We will not be producing any numbers.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe official said the U.K. did not intend to produce a methodology for the bill. \u201cIn an ideal world they want to salami-slice us, step by step by step. And on you go, up and up, and there is the bill. That is not going to happen and we are not going to play that game.\u201d\u000a\u000aNext week\u2019s session will include citizens\u2019 rights, judicial and police cooperation and the U.K.\u2019s plans to leave the nuclear energy agreement Euratom.\u000a\u000aWhile it is hoped talks will \u201cclarify\u201d positions between EU and U.K. sides, \u201cit is a very big gap,\u201d the first EU official said.\u000a\u000aResponding to questions over whether bank holidays had interfered with the schedule of talks, the official said: \u201cWe have not yet encountered a situation when lack of time will prevent us from advancing [discussions]. So far, it has been a lack of substance.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis article has been updated with a response from the U.K. government.\u000a\u000aAnnabelle Dickson contributed to this article.

aVIn a resignation letter, Sebastian Gorka cited "forces" that do not support President Trump's "MAGA promise" as being ascendant in the White House. White House aide Sebastian Gorka ousted from post\u000a\u000aSebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to the president who was closely aligned with former chief strategist Steve Bannon, was ousted from the White House, officials said Friday.\u000a\u000aIn a resignation letter, published Friday night by The Federalist and confirmed by POLITICO, Gorka cited \u201cforces\u201d that do not support President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMAGA promise\u201d as those that drove him out of the White House.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut a White House official indicated in a statement that Gorka had been forced out: "Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House," the official said.\u000a\u000aIn the resignation letter, Gorka wrote: \u201cRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months,\u201d Gorka wrote.\u000a\u000aA second White House aide said Gorka's departure was a continuation of new White House chief of staff John Kelly's effort to shape president's staff. "Questions remain," the aide said, about whether Sebastian Gorka's wife, Katie Gorka, an official at the Department of Homeland Security, would stay on after her husband's White House departure.\u000a\u000aGorka's departure came one week to the day after Bannon was fired from his White House position.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Gorka, a White House official said, disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to dispatch more American troops to Afghanistan, a tortured decision the president outlined in his first national security address, on Tuesday night.\u000a\u000aIn his resignation letter, Gorka wrote that \u201cthe fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe news of Gorka\u2019s departure was greeted with resignation by Trump loyalists, who believe the president has handed over too much power to military officers and former generals \u2014 including his new chief of staff, John Kelly, and national security adviser H.R. McMaster \u2014 and is losing any connection to the base that elected him.\u000a\u000a\u201cI guess that means the seven-day-in-May crowd is making steady progress and trying to convert the Trump administration to George Soros-style globalism,\u201d said political operative Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser and confidant. \u201cThe decision over Afghanistan was very disappointing. I\u2019m sorry that Gorka is leaving. He\u2019s one of the few people who actually voted for Trump and understands Trump\u2019s worldview.\u201d\u000a\u000aStone, who helped Trump think through his presidential bid, warned that while he is not yet throwing in the towel on the Trump presidency, \u201cI can find another candidate for 2020 who can win the primary, believe me.\u201d\u000a\u000aGorka was closely aligned with Bannon, and often attended meetings as Bannon\u2019s surrogate and worked with his former Breitbart colleague in his West Wing office.\u000a\u000aInternally, Bannon was his biggest defender against skeptics who accused him of holding anti-Semitic views and playing up his intellectual status by insisting on going by \u201cDr. Sebastian Gorka.\u201d But he was not seen as a power player in the administration other than as an effective television surrogate. That role endeared him to Trump but made him thin-skinned about the media that covered him: He often blocked mainstream-media journalists from following him on Twitter.\u000a\u000aIt was not clear whether Gorka, like Bannon, would return to Breitbart News, where he previously served as national security editor.\u000a\u000aEliana Johnson and Tim Starks contributed to this report.\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVBritish Prime Minister Theresa May walked a tightrope between undermining Brexit negotiations and turning off Brexit hardliners in her own party | Jack Taylor/AFP via Getty Images Theresa May\u2019s not-so-red line on the European Court Judging by Brexiteers\u2019 relaxed response, the prime minister found a way to \u2018take back control\u2019 while allowing for some ECJ influence.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 It was the Brexit red line that wasn\u2019t so red after all.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s latest hotly anticipated Brexit position paper clarifies that while the Brits will indeed leave the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the mantra of \u201ctaking control of our laws\u201d does not mean a refusal to let the Luxembourg court influence British law via, say, legal precedent, or the dispute resolution mechanism that will be needed to govern a new trading relationship.\u000a\u000aIf a Brexit deal was ever going to be remotely possible, this was something the U.K. had to make clear.\u000a\u000aIn doing so, Prime Minister Theresa May risked a political showdown with Brexit hard-liners in her own party, many of whom put sovereignty above all else. On the day, she emerged unscathed.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe clear principle is one I am very happy with and then we are trying to look at the details,\u201d Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent supporter of Brexit and a sovereignty hawk, told POLITICO. \u201cThe ECJ goes from being the supreme court of the United Kingdom to being [just] another foreign court and that is a really important change.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe government\u2019s domestic critics from the \u201csoft Brexit\u201d camp were also happy, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats hailing it as a \u201cclimbdown\u201d that would help build a fruitful trading relationship.\u000a\u000aDespite May\u2019s attempts to give the impression that nothing has changed, her government\u2019s position has shifted. The position paper also acknowledged that an interim legal arrangement would be required, and did not rule out the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ for the duration.\u000a\u000aKey word: Direct\u000a\u000aThe cautious welcome for the position paper among hard Brexit Tories was, according to one senior Conservative MP, a consequence of many of them not really understanding what they were asking for with the ECJ red line.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe paper is, at long last, an admission of what has been concealed for 12 months \u2014 which is that the European Union is going to continue to have a profound influence over our laws,\u201d said the MP, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe problem is, a lot of people don\u2019t really understand what the ECJ does \u2026 This has always been the key problem, so as a consequence people keep on saying: \u2018We must escape the jurisdiction of the ECJ!\u2019 \u2014 what they actually mean by that is direct effect [of ECJ law].\u201d\u000a\u000aA shift in government rhetoric in recent months has seen that caveat \u2014 \u201cdirect\u201d jurisdiction \u2014 added to pronouncements on cutting ties with the ECJ.\u000a\u000aBut David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, told POLITICO there had not \u201cin any way at all\u201d been a climbdown. Like fellow Brexiteers, he had a relaxed response to the position paper.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that the U.K. will not be subject to ECJ jurisdiction once we\u2019ve left the EU. But we are neighbors, we are going to be \u2014 hopefully \u2014 partners and we\u2019re going to have to have some means of ensuring uniformity,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe Brexiteers\u2019 responses suggest a degree of coordination and an inclination to help the government rather than cause May a headache.\u000a\u000aTory MPs have been taking their cues from members of the government who backed the Leave campaign. Justice Minister Dominic Raab struck an emollient tone, criticizing \u201cjingoistic\u201d attacks on \u201cforeign courts and foreign judges\u201d in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program on Wednesday. He added that the U.K. would want to keep \u201chalf an eye\u201d on European law after Brexit.\u000a\u000aHis interview won praise on a WhatsApp group of pro-Brexit MPs in the European Research Group, according to one of its members.\u000a\u000aMultiple choice\u000a\u000aWhat the position paper did not make clear was precisely what the U.K. wants in its future relationship. Instead, it set out a range of precedents of international deals \u201cwhere the EU has reached agreements with third countries which provide for a close cooperative relationship without the Court of Justice of the European Union [CJEU] having direct jurisdiction over those countries.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn terms of a dispute resolution mechanism, there was a dizzying array of precedents, from the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) court, which must \u201cpay due account\u201d to ECJ decisions; the \u201cJoint Committee\u201d that resolves disputes within the European Economic Area trade agreement; monitoring arrangements like those that ensure non-EU Schengen members Norway and Iceland regularly review EU case law; and finally, arbitration panels that can refer disputes to the ECJ, which is the arrangement between Moldova and the EU.\u000a\u000aOn the enforcement of legal agreements, U.K. officials had condemned the EU\u2019s \u201cjudicial imperialism\u201d at the last round of Brexit talks, in the face of the European Commission\u2019s insistence that it should be the ECJ that enforces the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s position is that EU citizens and businesses in the U.K. will have recourse to British courts, which ministers insist will enforce the terms of any Brexit agreement just as stringently as the ECJ would be expected to within the EU.\u000a\u000a\u2018Worst of all worlds\u2019\u000a\u000aNone of the precedents set out is an exact model for what the U.K. wants, officials said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe purpose of our paper is to show that we have thought about what [a dispute resolution mechanism] might be,\u201d May told Sky News during a visit to a factory in Surrey. \u201cWe\u2019ll now obviously go into negotiations with the European Commission to discuss what is the best way forward.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut the very act of including such precedents represents a recognition that to achieve the free-trade arrangement it wants, the U.K. will have to pay close attention to ECJ rulings that govern the rules of the single market.\u000a\u000aTaking into account last week\u2019s position papers on customs and Northern Ireland, both of which presented suggestions for close alignment with EU rules and emphasized the importance of a transition, the government\u2019s overall Brexit stance now looks far softer than it did prior to June\u2019s general election.\u000a\u000aAdvocates of a soft Brexit questioned whether it would not have been more straightforward simply to propose staying in the single market.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric. Even if we leave the single market, European judges will still have considerable power over decisions made in the U.K.,\u201d said the Labour peer and former Cabinet minister Andrew Adonis, speaking on behalf of the pro-EU, cross-party Open Britain group.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would make far more sense for the government to negotiate continued membership of the customs union and single market. Otherwise, we get the worst of all worlds \u2014 a worse deal on trade and jobs than now, yet no extra control over anything for real.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s tech industry put up a brave front in the wake of the Brexit vote, claiming the country\u2019s startups and venture capitalists are still open for business.\u000a\u000aBut for British venture capital firms \u2014 still the deepest pool of money in Europe dedicated solely to investing in tech companies \u2014 the prospect of Brexit is already hitting them directly in the wallet.\u000a\u000aSince the country gave notice it was leaving the European Union in March, a growing list of British venture capital funds has been told they will not receive financial support from the European Investment Fund, an EU agency that provides almost half of the money for the region\u2019s venture capital industry, according to several fund managers who held discussions with the body. Some of the investors spoke on the condition of anonymity because their conversations with the fund were private.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pullback of the EIF puts the U.K. at a structural disadvantage compared to other European countries,\u201d said Fred Destin, a London-based venture capitalist who previously worked for Accel, one of the city\u2019s largest venture houses, and is now raising his own fund but has not approached the agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe EIF is such a strategic partner,\u201d he added. \u201cThe U.K. government needs to take action.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe British government\u2019s efforts to fill this gap in funding \u2014 worth, collectively, hundreds of millions of euros \u2014 have been slow to emerge, including plans announced earlier this month to create a new tech investment fund that, so far, have been short on details.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were continuing the process with the EIF until Article 50 was triggered, but then they stopped the talks\u201d \u2014 Simon Murdoch, partner at Episode1 Ventures\u000a\u000aThis likely shortfall in new financial backing, many in Britain\u2019s tech community claim, raises concerns about how the country will maintain its spot as first among equals within Europe\u2019s tech industry as counterparts in France, Germany and elsewhere court startups and entrepreneurs into leaving London and other British cities.\u000a\u000aIt also comes as tech founders and venture capitalists are already grumbling that the steady flow of developers and engineers, often from other European countries, is slowing, while others fret about the financial uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s pending departure from the world\u2019s largest trading bloc.\u000a\u000aTap turned off\u000a\u000aThe EU agency, whose remit is to promote economic development across the region and whose largest investors include the European Commission and European Investment Bank, rejected suggestions it has stopped financing British venture capital, though it admitted there has been a slowdown.\u000a\u000aWhile little-known outside tech circles, the Luxembourg-based fund remains the largest backer of European venture capital, often providing up to 40 percent of funds\u2019 total investments, equal to billions of euros each year. It has invested in many of the region\u2019s largest venture houses, including Atomico and Lakestar, that have backed some of Europe\u2019s best-known startups \u2014 like Spotify, the music-streaming service and Supercell, the Finnish gaming company behind the \u201cClash of Clans\u201d franchise.\u000a\u000aIn Britain, for instance, the European Investment Fund forked out \u20ac2.3 billion between 2011 and 2015 to support 144 local venture and private equity funds, or roughly one-third of overall investment for the sector, according to the latest figures available from the agency. The EIF does not break out how much was earmarked specifically for local venture funds.\u000a\u000aDavid Yormesor, a spokesman for the European Investment Fund, said that due diligence on potential British investments \u201cnow needs to be more thorough,\u201d adding that it had to \u201ctake into account a wider range of factors.\u201d He declined to comment on what those factors could be.\u000a\u000aYet records of discussions reviewed by POLITICO between the EU agency and several tech investors \u2014 some of whom had been in talks for more than a year \u2014 show that in reality, the tap for European funding already has been turned off.\u000a\u000aAmong the British venture capital funds recently rebuffed by the European Investment Fund: Hoxton Ventures, Seedcamp and Episode1 Ventures, early investors in some of the country\u2019s best-known startups like Deliveroo, the food-delivery service, and Transferwise, the foreign exchange startup.\u000a\u000aThese rejections began soon after Britain triggered Article 50 in late March, setting the clock ticking on the country\u2019s departure from the 28-member bloc.\u000a\u000aOver a series of often uncomfortable phones calls, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, officials from the European Investment Fund told the British venture capitalists that any new investments \u2014 valued at tens of millions of euros, combined \u2014 were postponed indefinitely.\u000a\u000aThe officials added that the EU agency lacked approval \u2014 or any guidance \u2014 from the European Investment Bank and European Commission over whether it could continue supporting tech funds focused on Britain.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were continuing the process with the EIF until Article 50 was triggered, but then they stopped the talks,\u201d said Simon Murdoch, a partner at Episode1 Ventures, which is raising a new fund of up to £60 million. \u201cThe strong suspicion was that it was related to Brexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter the Brexit referendum vote last summer, the European Investment Fund told funds that at least two-thirds of future investments must be made within the EU \u2014 already a difficult target for British funds focused mainly on the local tech sector.\u000a\u000aNow, any new investments by the agency in Britain remain unlikely, though the British government and the European Investment Bank are trying to negotiate a compromise.\u000a\u000aBritain struggles to fill void\u000a\u000aWith EU money increasingly off the table, the British government is trying to fill the void, though its efforts have met with a subdued welcome from some venture capitalists.\u000a\u000aChancellor Philip Hammond announced last year that the British Business Bank, a state-backed agency, would offer £400 million in new support for the country\u2019s venture capitalists. And in June, he added that the British financial institution would also provide up to half of the investments in any new fund, compared to the previous maximum of one-third of new capital.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe British Business Bank is already an important player for the whole ecosystem,\u201d said Eileen Burbidge, a partner at Passion Capital, which has received financial backing from the British bank.\u000a\u000aIn another effort to calm nerves, the British government also proposed the creation of a new investment fund on August 1 that would mirror the structure of the European Investment Fund, another sign of the pullback by the EU agency.\u000a\u000aMore details on the fund will be published after a two-month consultation ending in October. But officials are expected to channel any new investments for the country\u2019s tech sector through the existing British Business Bank, and they stress that the aim is to help British funds compete globally.\u000a\u000aBut people in the venture capital industry question if the state-backed financial institution has the resources, skills and manpower to take on an expanded role, as well as whether Britain can ever fully replicate the financial support offered by the European Investment Fund.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost U.K. funds don\u2019t just invest in the U.K. We can\u2019t restrict ourselves to just one country\u201d \u2014 Sean Seton-Rogers, partner at PROFounders Capital\u000a\u000aTypically, according to fund managers, the British Business Bank has required funds to invest primarily within the United Kingdom. But while many venture capital funds are headquartered in London, they have often invested across the European Union and further afield.\u000a\u000aThat has raised concerns that any attempt by the British government to plug the gap left by the EU agency will inevitably be hamstrung, as local venture funds may lack the ability to compete for global deals with European and international rivals.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost U.K. funds don\u2019t just invest in the U.K.,\u201d said Sean Seton-Rogers, a partner at PROFounders Capital, which has received backing from the European Investment Fund. \u201cWe can\u2019t restrict ourselves to just one country.\u201d

aVLONDON \u2014 It\u2019s time we gave the Italian military some respect.\u000a\u000aOn the face of it, Italy is a woeful member of NATO, spending just 1.11 percent of GDP on defense \u2014 far below the alliance\u2019s 2 percent benchmark. Only seven NATO countries spend less. But take a close look at the country\u2019s contribution to European security and a rather different picture emerges.\u000a\u000aBetween January and June of this year, Italy\u2019s coast guard rescued 21,540 migrants from 188 vessels, while the Italian navy brought 3,344 migrants to safety and its financial police, the Guardia di Finanza, saved nearly 400.\u000a\u000aAdd to that Italian troops serving on NATO and U.N. missions in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, as well as the country\u2019s participation in Operation Sophia, an EU naval mission that has rescued 5,676 migrants since the beginning of the year, and it becomes clear that Italy has become Europe\u2019s policeman.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, you can measure defense spending, but it can\u2019t be the only metric,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, an Italian former ambassador to NATO. \u201cIn providing security, deployability and operations matter more than budgets.\u201d\u000a\u000aItaly\u2019s coast guard conducts migrant rescue missions that often take its vessels far beyond waters normally considered coast guard territory. So does the Italian navy, even though search and rescue are not part of a navy\u2019s normal tasks. The Guardia di Finanza\u2019s mission is to intercept smugglers of drugs and money, not save asylum seekers.\u000a\u000aBut with people-smugglers callously overfilling their leaky vessels with people desperate to reach Italy, and with the Libyan government only now starting to assist, it would be unethical to do nothing. So the Italian armed forces rescue the migrants.\u000a\u000aIn the waters of the Mediterranean, human decency gives the Italians little choice. But their troops participate in many other missions from which Italy could reasonably ask to be excused. According to figures assembled by the Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI), a Rome-based think tank, last year a total of 6,092 Italian troops served on international missions in the Middle East, the Mediterranean, the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan. Some 600 Italians serve in Kosovo; another 1,100 in Lebanon. Italian troops are stationed in Libya and Somalia, too.\u000a\u000aCounting Italian officers embedded with other countries\u2019 armed forces, the figure exceeds 7,000. This year, another 140 Italians deployed to Latvia as part of NATO\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence initiative. With deployment rotations \u2014 each foreign deployment position is typically filled by four service members in rotation \u2014 that means more than 28,000 Italian troops are involved in international operations.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday\u2019s situation is more complicated than war or peace,\u201d said a high-ranking official in the Italian Ministry of Defense. \u201cWe\u2019re stabilizing an entire region.\u201d\u000a\u000aLast year, the international missions cost the Italian government more than \u20ac1 billion, according to IAI. And that doesn\u2019t count the cost of the navy, coast guard and Guardia di Finanza search and rescue missions.\u000a\u000aBut here\u2019s the paradox: all of these efforts don\u2019t show up in NATO statistics. As a result, a country such as Greece looks like a star member of the alliance thanks to its annual defense expenditure of 2.4 percent of GDP. Though Greece rescues migrants off its coasts, it is not participating in any current EU or NATO military missions.\u000a\u000aNATO\u2019s statistics measure how much a member spends on defense, how much is spent in personnel and how much on equipment. But they don\u2019t show how much a country spends on NATO-related activities.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn addition, some countries put everything they can into the defense budget in order to approach the 2 percent target,\u201d said Stefanini. \u201cBut Italy doesn\u2019t; in fact, it plays down what it does in defense for domestic policy reasons.\u201d A large part of the Italian electorate supports the political left and would be unhappy with increased defense spending.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s high time Italy\u2019s allies \u2014 particularly in the EU \u2014 recognize the country\u2019s contributions to regional security.\u000a\u000aMany countries are, in fact, getting away with doing close to nothing to shore up Europe\u2019s south in the knowledge that the Italians will take care of it\u000a\u000aTo be sure, it is in Italy\u2019s interest to stabilize not only the waters surrounding it but the countries too: another exodus of Kosovars would be difficult to handle, not to mention an even larger influx of asylum seekers travelling via Libya. Lebanon faces a potentially explosive situation involving, among other things, spillover from Syria.\u000a\u000aBut the issues to which Italy devotes manpower and resources \u2014 stability in the Middle East, the Balkans and Africa \u2014 have implications that spread far beyond the country\u2019s borders. And migration in particular has EU-wide consequences as few of those crossing the Mediterranean do so intending to stay in Italy.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make allies aware of the threats coming from the southern flank,\u201d said the Ministry of Defense official. \u201cThese threats are moving towards all of Europe.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNo country can guarantee European security alone,\u201d the official added.\u000a\u000aFrontex, the EU\u2019s external border agency, does conduct migrant response operations in the Mediterranean, and NATO\u2019s Sea Guardian mission polices the sea. But so far most of Italy\u2019s allies have been content to leave the country to bear the bulk of the southern flank responsibilities \u2014 and the costs of doing so.\u000a\u000aMany countries are, in fact, getting away with doing close to nothing to shore up Europe\u2019s south in the knowledge that the Italians will take care of it.\u000a\u000aElisabeth Braw is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

aVMADRID \u2014 The terrorist attack in Barcelona resulted in unusual scenes of unity between the Spanish government and the regional executive of Catalonia.\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s see how long it lasts.\u000a\u000aAfter jihadists caused carnage on Barcelona\u2019s famous Las Ramblas and in the coastal town of Cambrils \u2014 the death toll now stands at 15 \u2014 Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalan President Carles Puigdemont appeared together three times to pay tribute to the victims and coordinate security operations.\u000a\u000aThe two leaders are normally at loggerheads over Catalan plans to hold an independence referendum on October 1 \u2014 a vote that Rajoy has vowed to prevent by all legal means necessary. But they have been at pains to stress unity and cooperation when it comes to fighting terror. No top official on either side has explicitly used the attacks to make political gains, be they pro-independence or pro-unity.\u000a\u000aYet there are subtle differences between Rajoy and Puigdemont\u2019s public pronouncements, reflecting underlying tensions. In his first appearance after the attacks, the Spanish PM spoke of the \u201cpain of the Spanish nation\u201d and didn\u2019t mention Catalonia once. Puigdemont didn\u2019t mention Spain once in his public remarks and repeatedly referred to Catalonia as a country.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish government has emphasized the importance of national security and intelligence services in managing the crisis \u2014 and played up the role of the national court judge leading the investigation. The Catalan cabinet, on the other hand, has singled out the work of the regional police \u2014 the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra \u2014 who dealt with the attacks on the ground and partly frustrated the strike in Cambrils.\u000a\u000aFrictions have also surfaced in the public communications of both governments, the most obvious being on Saturday when Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said the terrorist cell was \u201cpractically \u2026 totally dismantled,\u201d only to be contradicted just minutes later by a spokesman for the Catalan regional police, Albert Oliva. \u201cIt will be us who conclude the final result of the investigation when we consider that the cell is totally dismantled,\u201d Oliva said.\u000a\u000aA member of Rajoy\u2019s cabinet said cooperation between both sides had been \u201cgood.\u201d Yet an adviser to Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras described it as \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cbasic,\u201d pointing out that Rajoy didn\u2019t show up in Barcelona until very late on the day of the attack.\u000a\u000aOpposing views\u000a\u000aOfficials from both sides appear to have drawn different, and opposite, lessons from the attacks.\u000a\u000aWhereas Rajoy\u2019s cabinet member said a terror strike such as this should change political \u201cpriorities,\u201d referring to the Catalan government\u2019s push for secession, the Catalan official said local authorities have proven they can stand up to such a challenge on their own.\u000a\u000aFerran Casas, of digital newspaper Nació Digital, said politicians are holding back from criticizing each other because they\u2019re afraid doing so \u201cmay take its toll\u201d politically after such a tragedy.\u000a\u000aPau Marí-Klose, a sociology professor at Zaragoza University, added that \u201cfrontline politicians\u201d in Spain have learnt the lesson of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which left 192 dead. The conservative government of the time, led by José María Aznar, attempted to link the carnage to domestic Basque terrorism. The strategy backfired and his successor, Rajoy, was beaten by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of the Socialists in an election three days after the attack.\u000a\u000aYet Mari-Klose is skeptical the apparent truce between unionist and independence supporters, and the governments of Madrid and Barcelona, can last much longer. He said the attitude of lower-ranked politicians and media commentators over the past few days has convinced him the tragedy will \u201cbe used brutally in the coming weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Friday, the day after the attacks, op-eds in Spain\u2019s biggest newspapers, El País and El Mundo, called for the Catalan government to abandon its push for secession and focus instead on the security of its citizens.\u000a\u000aPuigdemont responded in a radio interview, saying it was \u201cmiserable\u201d to link terror and the independence process, adding that his government\u2019s priority was to attend to the victims and catch the perpetrators.\u000a\u000aSome unionist commentators and politicians have chastised Catalan officials for giving their press conferences in Catalan instead of Spanish, and many more denounced Catalan Interior Minister Joaquim Forn for differentiating between Catalan and Spanish citizens when adding up the victims of the attack in a TV interview.\u000a\u000aPR victories\u000a\u000aOn the independence side, Puigdemont\u2019s chief press officer, Pere Martí, portrayed the meeting between the German and French foreign ministers \u2014 who flew in after the attack \u2014 with their Catalan counterpart Raül Romeva as a public relations victory. \u201cThey said that we wouldn\u2019t have international relations. That no one would receive us,\u201d Martí tweeted. He later deleted the message.\u000a\u000aInternational media have also come under fire. The international communications director of the Catalan government, Joan Maria Piqué, rebuked British newspaper the Telegraph for running a cartoon depicting a bull stopping a van, in reference to the attack in Barcelona. \u201cThis is Catalonia and bullfighting is forbidden in this country.

Barcelona didn\u2019t have such protections in place in Las Ramblas.\u000a\u000aFinally, the investigation has shown weaknesses in the security apparatus that may be exploited by both sides, such as the criminal record of the imam who alleged masterminded the plot \u2014 which Catalan authorities said they weren\u2019t aware of \u2014 and the time it took to link an explosion at a house in the village of Alcanar \u2014 where more than 100 gas tanks were found \u2014 and a terror cell.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens in the coming hours,\u201d said Mari-Klose. \u201cThere\u2019s an attempt [by politicians] to avoid losing control of the whole thing, but I doubt that this can be done in a moment of such tension between both governments.\u201d

Get The Finance 202 delivered to your inbox.\u000a\u000aThe flap over Louise Linton\u2019s \u201clet them eat cake\u201d moment on Instagram could make it even harder for her husband, and the administration in which he serves, to overhaul the tax code this fall. That may sound far-fetched. Bear with me a moment.\u000a\u000aFirst, to review:\u000a\u000aLinton set off a firestorm Monday when she posted a shot of herself stepping off a government plane in Kentucky ahead of her husband, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The photo showed her draped in luxury brands, which she proceeded to name in a caption and tag in the image. Since Linton\u2019s account was public, a stranger \u2014 an Oregon mother of three named Jennifer Miller \u2013 was able to comment on the post, writing, \u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway.\u201d Linton turned what was already likely a PR headache into a full-blown migraine by snapping back:\u000a\u000a\u201cAww!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You\u2019re adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment\u2026 Go chill out and watch the new game of thrones. It\u2019s fab!\u201d\u000a\u000aScreen grabs of the post \u2014 both the image and Linton\u2019s insult-laced rant \u2014 quickly went viral. By Tuesday afternoon, the episode was getting attention from talking heads on cable, and Linton issued a terse apology through a publicist: \u201cI apologize for my post on social media yesterday as well as my response. It was inappropriate and highly insensitive.\u201d\u000a\u000a(See an image of Linton's original posts here, and read The Post\u2019s Damian Paletta recap here.)\u000a\u000aCriticism continued to roll in:\u000a\u000aHere was National Journal's Ron Brownstein:\u000a\u000aIsn't this howTrump supporters say Dems act toward mid-America?

As in Marie Antoinette "let them eat cake". https://t.co/wJGQmlWQzU \u2014 Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) August 22, 2017\u000a\u000aIt is of course possible the incident will blow away, the news equivalent of a midafternoon August thunderstorm. It could also become something more. Already, controversy over Linton\u2019s display overwhelmed the trip\u2019s purpose, which was for Mnuchin to join Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in talking up a tax code rewrite.\u000a\u000aAt their appearance in Louisville, Mnuchin made some news by suggesting that President Trump could preserve for some alternative investment managers the carried interest loophole he railed against on the campaign trail. Hedge fund managers will still get pinched, Mnuchin said. But venture capitalists, private equity investors and others could get a pass: \u201cWhat we are focused on is there are many other types of funds that do create jobs and we want to make sure we don\u2019t discourage investment,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe origin story of the proposal to close that loophole demonstrates how the Linton episode could reshape the current tax debate. Back on June 13, 2007, a front-page Wall Street Journal story examined the rise of private-equity kingpin Steve Schwarzman, CEO of the Blackstone Group, and chronicled the over-the-top opulence of his lifestyle:\u000a\u000aOnce, while sunning by the pool at his 11,000-square-foot home in Palm Beach, Fla., he complained to Jean-Pierre Zeugin, his executive chef and estate manager, that an employee wasn't wearing the proper black shoes with his uniform, according to Mr. Zeugin, who says he has great admiration for his boss. Mr. Schwarzman explains that he found the squeak of the rubber soles distracting. He expects lunches consisting of cold soup, a cold entree such as lobster salad or fresh grilled tuna on salad, followed by dessert, Mr. Zeugin says. He eats the three-course meal within 15 minutes, the chef says. Mr. Zeugin says he often spends $3,000 for a weekend of food for Mr. Schwarzman and his wife, including stone crabs that cost $400, or $40 per claw.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump listens to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman. (Jabin Botsford/Washington Post)\u000a\u000aThe piece ignited a firestorm of its own \u2014 reaching well beyond Wall Street. Here\u2019s James B. Stewart in a 2008 New Yorker article on how Schwarzman became his industry\u2019s \u201cdesignated villain\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe day after the Journal story appeared, Senators Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley proposed legislation that would subject private-equity partnerships like Blackstone, whose earnings had been taxed at the lower rate of \u201cpassive income,\u201d to ordinary corporate income taxes. In the House, Charles Rangel proposed that carried interest be taxed at the ordinary income rate rather than at the lower capital-gains rate. The measure would effectively increase Blackstone\u2019s tax rate from fifteen per cent to thirty-five per cent, seriously eroding its profitability, and, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would generate an extra twenty-six billion dollars over the next ten years.\u000a\u000aThe proposal became known as the Blackstone Bill. It still hasn\u2019t passed \u2014 a testament both to the efficacy of the industry\u2019s lobbying campaign against it and the broader dysfunction that\u2019s presided over tax policy for the last decade. But the fact that it\u2019s also become a token for inequities in the code benefiting a stratospherically wealthy class of financiers like Mnuchin himself points to the power of an anecdote to cut through the wonkiness of the tax debate.\u000a\u000aCandidate Trump signaled that closing the loophole was critical to restoring fairness to the system: \u201cThe rich will pay their fair share\u201d he said in a speech in Detroit last August, adding he would \u201celiminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and for people like me, but unfair to American workers.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Journal piece launched ten years of debate over the tax treatment of carried interest. It was illustrated by no more than some vividly related details and a stipple portrait of Schwarzman.\u000a\u000aIn that context, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the Linton episode\u2019s power to galvanize.\u000a\u000aHere, in two Instagram posts, is a senior administration official's spouse stepping off a taxpayer-funded plane, swathed head to toe in pricey couture, bragging about it, and snarking to somebody who pointed out the distastefulness of the scene by making fun of her for not being rich. And her husband, co-architect of a tax policy the administration promises will benefit lower and middle-income workers, represents what Democrats believe is an Achilles heel for Trump with his own base.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTrump and Mnuchin. (Pete Marovich/Bloomberg)\u000a\u000a\u201cI can tell you from research I\u2019ve seen one of the few things even the most ardent Trump supporters don\u2019t like is when they learn that Wall Street bankers are actually running his economic policy,\u201d Democratic strategist Paul Begala said Tuesday on CNN in a discussion of the flap. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things that decouples those Trump supporters from him. It\u2019s the notion that Wall Street, which he attacked on the campaign, is in charge\u2026 This could teach them that. They could focus on this because it\u2019s such a pop culture story.\u201d\u000a\u000aCongressional Democrats don\u2019t appear to have any imminent plans to tag the Trump administration\u2019s forthcoming tax strategy as, say, the "Louise Linton Let Them Eat Cake Plan." But the episode was the subject of plenty of chatter on Tuesday. And one senior Hill aide told me it crossed a key early threshold: A nonpolitical relative asked him about it unbidden.\u000a\u000aDetails of the tax strategy the administration is supposedly forging with a small group of congressional Republican negotiators remain murky. But an analysis of the outline the administration released in April found that proposal would be \u201chighly regressive.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found 40 percent of the plan\u2019s benefits would accrue to the top 1 percent, while those in the top 0.1 percent would see their after-tax income spike by an average of $1.4 million.\u000a\u000aAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. (AP/Alex Brandon)\u000a\u000aThe White House is selling its overhaul as a benefit to middle-class families that will also encourage companies to keep jobs here. And it plans to press the point by deploying Cabinet secretaries to argue for various pieces of its plan. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, for example, will help make the case for repeal of the estate tax.\u000a\u000a\u201cSecretary Perdue believes that reform of the tax code is long overdue, particularly as it impacts the agriculture sector of the economy, and he wholeheartedly supports President Trump\u2019s efforts,\u201d a department spokesman emails me. \u201cThe estate tax is an egregious example of punitive taxation. It places a levy on the inevitable and natural occurrence of death and imperils family farms, which may have to be broken up or sold off to satisfy the tax collector.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut that claim is undercut by a piece of research from the Agriculture Department\u2019s economic research arm. A March study found that last year, only 0.42 percent of farms faced any estate tax liability. And estates of small farms paid an average effective rate of only 11 percent.\u000a\u000aThe tax debate is heating up at a treacherous moment for Republicans. Trump turned in a bizarre performance at a Tuesday night rally in Phoenix during which he threatened among other things to shut down the government he leads if lawmakers don\u2019t fund his border wall. And he also blamed reporters for the criticism he\u2019s received from both inside and outside his party over his disastrous response to the Charlottesville tragedy.\u000a\u000aThe fallout from the racism-fueled violence in Virginia and the president\u2019s equivocation in the wake of it continues to reverberate. Mnuchin was compelled to issue a formal response after 300 of his Yale classmates called for him to resign in protest. And the stock market was rattled last week by rumors that Mnuchin\u2019s tax reforming co-captain, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, was primed to quit.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSteve Bannon. (Jabin Botsford/Washington Post)\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s relationship with McConnell has reached a breaking point, according to a new New York Times bombshell. Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin report that ties between the pair have \u201cdisintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmid the chaos, the long-deferred Republican dream of rewriting the tax code, and the sense of shared mission it engenders, may be the last hope keeping the party\u2019s ruling class from flying apart. But the Charlottesville mess also sped up the firing of Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist and the minder of his populist mandate. Bannon had been pushing for Trump to back a soak-the-rich tax plan that would jack up the top rate on upper-income earners to pay for deep cuts for everybody else. The approach was never going anywhere, facing objections from both inside the administration and leading congressional Republican tax-writers.\u000a\u000aBut as long as Bannon was inside the West Wing, his attempts to sabotage Mnuchin, Cohn and the rest of the so-called globalist ilk he reviles could be held in some relative check. Now back at the helm of Breitbart, he\u2019s free to savage those figures and attempt to rally a core piece of Trump\u2019s constituency against their agenda. On Tuesday afternoon, a headline appeared on the site: \u201cMnuchin\u2019s Wife Fights in Instagram Comments over High Fashion, Govt.

Yalman Onaran reports: "JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley would benefit most from changes to post-crisis banking rules proposed by Donald Trump\u2019s administration, with pretax profit jumping 22 percent, according to estimates by Bloomberg based on discussions with analysts and the banks\u2019 own disclosures. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. would have the smallest percentage increase, about 16 percent...Of the changes proposed in June by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the one that would probably have biggest impact on profit is allowing banks to buy U.S. government bonds entirely with borrowed money. Three others could also boost income: counting municipal bonds as liquid, or easy-to-sell, assets; requiring less debt that won\u2019t have to be paid back if a bank fails; and making it easier to comply with post-crisis rules."\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, U.S. banks are already doing fine.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000a\u2014 Congressional Republicans are eyeing a controversial budget maneuver that would allow them to cut an additional $450 billion in taxes without paying for it. Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur: "Under the proposal, the GOP would not account for things like expiring tax breaks when gauging the budgetary impact of tax legislation -- giving tax writers more room for cuts. Senate budget and tax panels are discussing the move to a 'current policy' baseline -- instead of the standard \u201ccurrent law\u201d baseline -- said the people who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The chief House tax writer, Kevin Brady, also signaled openness to the approach last month, saying it would lead to deeper tax cuts. The switch would risk a backlash from Democrats and deficit hawks."\u000a\u000a\u2014 House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) is downplaying the prospect of using any revenue from a tax overhaul to fund new infrastructure projects. David Sherfinski of the Washington Times: Mr. Brady described the idea of using some $2.5 trillion companies now have parked overseas as a vehicle for a big infrastructure investment as a \u201csatellite\u201d hovering around tax reform. 'I\u2019ll tell you up front: I use the revenue from those to lower tax rates on every business in America,' Mr. Brady said at an event hosted by UPS in Louisville, Kentucky.

aV\u201cInnovation\u201d is one of those Washington priorities, like \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201cthe children,\u201d that politicians in both parties tend to describe as investments rather than spending. Even as budget wars have raged on Capitol Hill, there\u2019s been a fairly broad consensus that funding research and development is vital to American competitiveness. The Beltway seems to churn out an inexhaustible supply of bipartisan reports proclaiming that bigger government investments in science and technology today will pay economic dividends for taxpayers down the road.\u000a\u000aThis week has been \u201ctech week\u201d at the White House, and President Trump has jumped onto the rhetorical bandwagon, hailing the glories of innovation. \u201cMy administration is embracing a new spirit of innovation that will make life better for all Americans,\u201d he told a group of technology leaders gathered in the Oval Office on Monday; he doubled down Thursday, promising another group of new-economy executives that his government would \u201chelp unleash technological breakthroughs that will transform our lives.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump\u2019s 2018 budget goes the opposite direction: It proposes the deepest cuts in innovation investments that any administration has ever proposed.\u000a\u000aNot only does the Trump budget slash climate science and clean energy research beloved by Trump\u2019s critics, it whacks advanced manufacturing programs and fossil energy research catering to Trump\u2019s supporters, as well as basic science and medical research beloved by almost everyone. It\u2019s a powerful rejection of the innovation-industrial complex, and even though Congress is likely to ignore most of it, a similarly powerful reflection of Trump\u2019s political war on Washington elites.\u000a\u000aOverall, Trump\u2019s budget cuts research and development spending by about 5 percent from current levels, but that figure includes hefty increases for late-stage weapons development at the Pentagon. It would roll back non-defense R&D by an unprecedented 19 percent, taking the axe to the popular as well as the obscure. The National Institutes of Health would absorb a 21.5 percent hit, including major cuts in research on aging, cancer, infectious disease, mental health, and drug abuse; NIH grant programs would have their stingiest award rates since 1970. There would be even harsher cuts for the Agricultural Research Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NASA\u2019s education funding, NOAA\u2019s ocean research, and EPA\u2019s science office.\u000a\u000aThe Trump blueprint would also eliminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which oversees studies of which medical treatments actually work; the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s monitoring programs for volcanoes, earthquakes and the climate; and a popular Manufacturing Extension Partnership that provided technical assistance for more than 25,000 companies last year. And it would wipe out ARPA-E, the most futuristic agency in Washington, a cutting-edge incubator for energy research modeled on the high-tech Pentagon unit that pioneered GPS and the Internet.\u000a\u000aTrump aides believe some federal investments in R&D have been duplicative or ineffective, while others ought to be handled by the private sector. And they\u2019re still proposing $150 billion in R&D funding, which is considerably more than zero. But their main argument for spending less on innovation is simply that America can\u2019t afford to spend more. Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, is an ardent limited-government conservative, and the budget he crafted for Trump reflects his belief that Washington spends way too much of your money. Trump made it clear his top budget priorities are strengthening the military and securing the border, while somehow reducing deficits without raising taxes or cutting Medicare or Social Security for the elderly. Mulvaney had to shrink something\u2014really, just about everything else\u2014to try to check all those boxes.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe wanted more for defense and the border, so we had to offset those increases somewhere,\u201d one senior budget official explained. \u201cWe\u2019re still making a big commitment to R&D. It\u2019s just less than other administrations might make.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn fact, even within Trump\u2019s top government priorities, like the military and the border, innovation is getting a haircut. The American Association for the Advancement of Science calculated that Trump\u2019s budget would squeeze the Pentagon\u2019s science and technology spending by 5 percent, including an 18 percent cut for its \u201cmanufacturing innovation institutes.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s science and technology budget would shrink by 20 percent, limiting research into cybersecurity, bioweapons defense, and border technologies.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a political logic to Trump\u2019s innovation policy heresies. Two thirds of R&D spending goes to blue states, and most of it tends to cluster in large cities and college towns rather than farm country or the Rust Belt, one reason these issues have more resonance for cosmopolitan technocrats than for Trump voters. President Obama talked about them incessantly, clamoring for aggressive investments in innovation to help America \u201cwin the future,\u201d but Trump has attacked just about everything Obama was for, from health care reform to the Paris climate agreement. On the campaign trail, he never emphasized winning the future, just winning, and he never proposed any new innovation policies of note.\u000a\u000aTrump did create a White House Office of American Innovation led by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and at his meeting with tech leaders he vowed that the office would help upgrade the federal government\u2019s balky technology. But he did not suggest that it would help promote innovation in the private sector; he suggested that was the private sector\u2019s job. In fact, one of the office\u2019s main tasks will be shrinking and reorganizing the government, reflecting the belief of Mulvaney and other movement conservatives in the administration that the best thing government can do to spur innovation is to get out of the way of innovative businesses. In fact, during last year\u2019s crisis over the Zika virus, as public health experts were racing to study its link to birth defects, Mulvaney asked a provocative question on Facebook: \u201cDo we really need government-funded research at all?\u201d\u000a\u000aHistorically, though, the U.S. government has played a vital role in seeding and developing technological advances ranging from supercomputing to hydraulic fracking, advanced prosthetics to lactose-free milk, LED lighting to MRI testing. The Trump budget represents an abrupt departure from this tradition, at a time when federal expenditures on R&D have already drooped to their lowest level as a share of the economy since the Russians launched Sputnik. This has innovation experts scratching their heads, since Trump\u2019s entire budget depends on yet another departure from budget tradition, a blithe assumption of 3 percent annual growth. Mark Muro, policy director at the Brookings Institution\u2019s metropolitan studies program, says that with America\u2019s workforce shrinking, the clearest pathways to that kind of robust growth would be more immigration and more innovation\u2014and Trump has made it clear he doesn\u2019t want more immigration. But he doesn\u2019t seem to think Uncle Sam can help make innovation happen, either.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no conception in this budget of any positive role for government,\u201d Muro says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally out of step with everything we know about the innovation economy. I guess you could say that\u2019s an innovation.\u201d\u000a\u000aOBAMA FIRST UNVEILED his innovation agenda in a November 2007 speech at Google headquarters, calling for major investments in clean energy, digital technology, medical research, and basic science\u2014as well as education reform, job training, and infrastructure, which he also categorized as innovation spending. Two years later, he was elected president during an economic meltdown, and quickly tucked a remarkable amount of that egghead agenda into his $800 billion stimulus bill, using public dollars to jump-start private industries that felt like the future.\u000a\u000aFor example, the stimulus poured billions of dollars into solar power, and while the highest-profile result was a busted loan to a manufacturer called Solyndra, other stimulus projects have helped increase U.S. solar generation by more than 3000 percent since 2009. Similarly, the stimulus financed an entirely new domestic battery industry for electric vehicles, as well as a $465 million loan to rescue a failing automaker called Tesla; more than 400,000 EV\u2019s have been sold in America since 2009, and Tesla is now the most valuable U.S. car company. Overall, the stimulus sparked the largest federal investment in innovation since the moon mission, including record funding for a smarter electric grid, factories producing clean energy components, digital health records, NIH research, and an out-of-the-box grant competition called TIGER for innovative transportation projects.\u000a\u000aObama kept banging the drum for innovation throughout his presidency, repeatedly calling on America to \u201cout-educate, out-innovate, and out-compete the rest of the world.\u201d On October 21, 2015\u2014also known as Back to the Future Day, because that\u2019s the day Marty McFly time-traveled to in his cinematic DeLorean\u2014Obama unveiled an ambitious agenda for future investments in growth areas like precision medicine, brain science, artificial intelligence, and educational technology. But the huge bump in innovation funding through the stimulus turned out to be a one-time bump. The Republicans who took back the House in 2011 consistently rejected Obama\u2019s requests for more money, so federal R&D expenditures have stagnated, dipping to about half their 1980s levels as a share of GDP.\u000a\u000aNow Trump is proposing to gut them, sending an unmistakable message about his priorities. He\u2019s not interested in helping the geeks who carried signs poking fun of him at the March for Science.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody has ever proposed cuts of this scale,\u201d says Matt Hourihan, who oversees R&D policy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cNobody has ever drawn this narrow a boundary around what government should be doing with basic science. It\u2019s really a clean break with a bipartisan consensus.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump budget would kill the loan program for fuel-efficient automakers that saved Tesla, as well as similar loans for \u201cinnovative technologies\u201d in the green energy world. It would also kill TIGER, even though Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, told Congress she would push to boost the program\u2019s funding because it was working so well, and the AHRQ, even though its comparative effectiveness studies help save lives (by highlighting safety measures like a checklist that reduced central line infections in hospitals) and taxpayer dollars (by exposing wasteful and ineffective surgeries, drugs, and medical devices). It would cut the Energy Department\u2019s clean energy program by more than two thirds, and fossil energy by half. If you include education, job training and infrastructure in your innovation bucket, Trump\u2019s budget cuts all of them as well, although he has promised a still-unspecified $1 trillion infrastructure program outside his budget.\u000a\u000aAs for R&D, the senior budget official told me the administration wants to shift the government focus from applied research towards early-stage experimentation that private firms tend to avoid, partly because they tend to focus on short-term earnings, partly because they worry that their competitors will end up reaping the benefits of their expensive research. But that doesn\u2019t explain why the Trump wants to dismantle ARPA-E, which finances disruptive energy technologies in their earliest stages. Since 2009, its grant recipients have gone on to raise more than $1 billion in private capital, for ideas ranging from easier-to-make silicon wafers for solar panels to laser-operated drill bits for oil wells. Bill Gates and other business leaders have described ARPA-E as a model for what government ought to be doing to help America compete in the 21st century \u201cLook, we had to make some tough choices,\u201d the official explained. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have national labs.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump budget also calls for a 70 percent cut in an Obama program called Manufacturing USA, which has partnered with industry and academia to finance early-stage research into growth areas like robotics, photonics, 3-D printing and lightweight materials at \u201chubs\u201d in cities like Detroit, Knoxville, and Youngstown. And it would shut down the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a $120-million-a-year program with offices providing technical assistance to small and medium-sized manufacturers in all 50 states. Atkinson said that Canada invests ten times as much in similar programs as a share of its GDP, while Germany invests 20 times as much and Japan 40 times as much\u2014and they\u2019ve lost less of their manufacturing base.\u000a\u000a\u201cI thought reviving U.S. manufacturing was going to make America great again,\u201d says Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \u201cThese programs are already terribly underfunded, and they\u2019re serving Trump\u2019s voters. But this administration is under the ideological delusion that the government is always the problem. No other country acts like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdministration officials point out federal programs with noble goals and unobjectionable-sounding names are not necessarily effective, and they\u2019ve got a point. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership\u2019s offices in all 50 states, including states without much manufacturing, is hidden-in-plain-sight evidence that political considerations often drive funding decisions. It may seem odd that Trump wants to get rid of the Economic Development Administration, when he talks so much about economic development, and when the EDA specifically focuses on the depressed rural regions and smaller cities where so many Trump voters live. But a Government Accountability Office report found that every one of the agency\u2019s 80 programs overlapped with some other federal program.\u000a\u000aAndy Roth, a lobbyist at the conservative Club for Growth, said Trump and Mulvaney deserve credit for taking on the sacred cow of \u201cinvestment in innovation,\u201d because it\u2019s really just a euphemism for corporate welfare. Roth argued that when government helps a company or an industry with basic research or applied research or anything else, it\u2019s picking winners and losers, substituting the judgment of politicians and bureaucrats for the genius of the free market. Roth said the government should protect businesses from high taxes and intrusive regulations, but should otherwise leave innovation to the innovators in the private sector.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the government should be in the innovation business,\u201d Roth said. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that the Trump administration is getting rid of some of these programs, because there are a lot of stinkers out there.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut innovation experts say there\u2019s voluminous evidence that the long-term benefits of these investments far outweigh the costs, and that cutting them is like eating seed corn. Atkinson estimates that Trump\u2019s cuts would reduce GDP by $139 billion by 2027. And some programs the administration portrayed as stinkers don\u2019t really sound so awful. For example, the budget proposed to save $1.16 billion a year by axing the \u201c21st Century Community Learning Centers\u201d after-school program for needy children, declaring \u201cperformance data demonstrates the program is not achieving its goals.\u201d It cites evidence that \u201cstudent improvement in academic grades was limited, with states reporting higher math or English grades for less than half of regular program participants.\u201d But a program that helped nearly half its participants improve their grades sounds quite successful. On standardized tests, according to the budget, \u201cless than 20 percent of participants improved from \u2018not proficient\u2019 to \u2018proficient\u2019 or above.\u201d Again, that\u2019s real improvement. Maybe it\u2019s not enough improvement for $1.16 billion a year, but it\u2019s pretty weak evidence of a boondoggle.\u000a\u000aRepublicans in Congress have already made it clear that much of Trump\u2019s funding attack on innovation is dead on arrival. They won\u2019t eliminate ARPA-E or TIGER. They won\u2019t slash medical research at NIH or shred science at EPA. But advocates worry about the death of Washington\u2019s innovation consensus. In the past, even though lawmakers didn\u2019t always back up their R&D rhetoric with R&D funding, science and technology were treated like motherhood and apple pie, a kind of no-fly zone in the thick of Capitol Hill\u2019s partisan bombardments. But in Trump\u2019s Washington, norms cease to be norms, and anything can come under attack.\u000a\u000a\u201cGovernment support for innovation is an American success story, and one of the few places of American consensus,\u201d Muro says. \u201cAt least it used to be.\u201d

aVNearly a year on from the referendum that began the U.K. on its journey to the EU exit door, the formal negotiations on the terms of Britain\u2019s departure are due to start Monday morning.\u000a\u000aThe talks will begin \u2014 as the EU27 have demanded \u2014 with discussions about citizens\u2019 rights, the Irish border and the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations (the so-called Brexit bill).

By 2016, he had gotten used to his place on the backbenches \u2014 a Tory freethinker and Brexiteer, though not of the head-banging variety. But in a textbook example of how that old wheel can turn, Cameron\u2019s post-referendum demise paved the way for Davis to return to government in the pivotal Brexit secretary role. Underestimated in Brussels but highly-rated by Theresa May, Davis, at 68-years-old, may view Brexit as his last great task in government (though he\u2019s now rumored to fancy a tilt at the top job again). Having argued for it for so long, he has a burning desire to get it right.\u000a\u000aOliver Robbins\u000a\u000aPosition: Prime Minister\u2019s EU adviser, Permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Whitehall wunderkind turned Brexit supremo\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Kicked out of a parliamentary committee hearing for presenting \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d evidence\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aTheresa May\u2019s Brexit sherpa, Robbins has been the U.K.\u2019s central figure behind closed doors ever since he was appointed by David Cameron as personal adviser on the EU in the days immediately after the June 2016 referendum.

Despite his tall and imposing frame, colleagues describe him as a likeable chap, and he has been well-received by his counterparts in Brussels, with whom he has had regular contact in the run-up to negotiations. Having held senior office in the governments of Blair, Brown, Cameron and May, he is the ultimate Brexit \u201cgrown-up.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhilip Rycroft\u000a\u000aPosition: Second permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU)\u000a\u000aReal position: Keeping the United Kingdom together through Brexit\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making transition from working with Europhile Nick Clegg, to delivering Brexit\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 6/10\u000a\u000aOlly Robbins\u2019 right-hand man, responsible for managing the department\u2019s overall policy and legislative program with Robbins expected to spend much of his time in detailed negotiations.

Barrow took over as the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the EU after the dramatic resignation of the much liked and respected Ivan Rogers in January. The heavily-whiskered Barrow proved a much more manageable lead at the U.K.\u2019s permanent representation, keeping a low profile that will have suited Downing Street just fine, after Rogers\u2019 valedictory diatribe about \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d caused red faces in London. Previously the U.K\u2019.s man in Moscow, where he was a similarly low-key figure, Barrow is a Foreign Office man through and through. Having ably dispatched Theresa May\u2019s Article 50 letter on March 29, he is now expected to play the facilitator in the Brexit talks. However, he is not rated in Brussels, drawing unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, and is not seen as having much influence in No. 10.\u000a\u000aAlex Ellis\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aReal position: International man of mystery\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Debuting at the Foreign Office as part of the team that supported political transition in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aThe effervescent Ellis is a popular man at DExEU, where he is one of two director generals, said to take enjoyment in slipping Brexit soundbites into everyday conversation (\u201cAs a demonstration of our new deep and special partnership \u2026 would you like a cup of tea?\u201d).

He is officially a top EU civil servant \u2014 a director general in the European Commission \u2014 but Barnier is at heart a politician, meaning it will be very hard for the British team to put one over on him. The center-right pro-Europe Gaullist was elected as a MP in the 1970s. He held several top ministerial positions in France and was twice France\u2019s European commissioner: for regional policy and a decade later for the internal market and financial services. He knows Brussels and the main capitals intimately and has a reputation as a tough negotiator with a clear vision of where his powers and limits are. Some argue that Barnier is more powerful than many commissioners, but he operates within tight guidelines set by the European Council and approved by member countries and so has little room to maneuver.\u000a\u000aSabine Weyand\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: European deputy chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Staying on top of the details\u000a\u000aCareer highlight\u005clowlight: Deputy director general in the Commission\u2019s directorate general for trade.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aWeyand\u2019s experience as deputy at the Commission\u2019s powerful trade policy department will be invaluable in the later stages of the negotiations \u2014 plus her skills nicely complement Barnier\u2019s.

In the official organigram of Barnier\u2019s Brexit taskforce, Weyand has direct oversight of the top staffers in charge of detailed aspects of the talks, from aviation to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill, meaning she will have to be across vast swathes of the detail. The word in Brussels is that Weyand\u2019s real job is to act as an envoy to Martin Selmayr, the Commission president\u2019s chief of staff, so that he can keep an eye on proceedings.

aV\u201cYou know, I just have to concern myself with my own campaign and my day job of being a senator,\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake said when pressed about his relationship with President Donald Trump. | Michael Reynolds/Pool/Getty Images Flake says Trump 'inviting' 2020 primary challenge\u000a\u000aSen. Jeff Flake, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, said Wednesday that the president might be inviting a primary challenge in 2020 \u2014 though the Arizona Republican struck a more conciliatory tone toward the leader of his political party a day later.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that the way that \u2014 the direction he\u2019s headed right now, just kind of drilling down on the base rather than trying to expand the base \u2014 I think he\u2019s inviting one," Flake told Georgia Public Broadcasting on Wednesday when he was asked if Trump would face a Republican primary challenger in 2020.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe interview was highlighted by CNN on Thursday. Flake and Trump have long been at odds, with the Arizona lawmaker recently penning a book heavily critical of the president called "Conscience of a Conservative," and Trump openly praising a Republican who is challenging Flake for his Senate seat.\u000a\u000aFlake took a friendlier tone toward Trump in interviews Thursday, even inviting the president to look at portions of the Arizona-Mexico border together.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was glad that the president came to Arizona, in particular his visit down to Yuma on the border,\u201d Flake said on Fox News about Trump\u2019s visit to his state earlier this week. \u201cI think the president and all of us share the same goal to have a secure border. And what we need to do is say: What does that mean?\u201d\u000a\u000aFlake said he would always challenge a president who he believes is wrong, saying that includes disagreeing with Trump\u2019s latest threat to shut down the government for the sake of building a border wall, since it would not save money in the long run.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump avoided bashing Flake by name during a rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night \u2014 instead saying \u201cnobody knows who the hell he is\u201d \u2014 the president did not hold back on Twitter.\u000a\u000a\u201cPhoenix crowd last night was amazing \u2014 a packed house,\u201d Trump tweeted the morning after his rally. \u201cI love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd prior to taking the stage at the rally, Trump privately met with potential challengers for Flake's Senate seat, calling him "the flake" during the huddle.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

He's toxic!"\u000a\u000aBut Flake downplayed the feud on Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, I just have to concern myself with my own campaign and my day job of being a senator,\u201d Flake said when pressed about his relationship with Trump. \u201cSo what the president does, that\u2019s his prerogative.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVNEW YORK\u2014Donald Trump has developed a sudden, surprising reverence for the past. \u201cSad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\u201d he wrote on Twitter last week. These tributes to the Confederacy \u201cwill be greatly missed,\u201d he added. While this opinion meshed, perhaps, with his checkered record on race, his defense of aged statuary seemed to clash with Trump\u2019s long-standing indifference to all things historical.\u000a\u000aTrump, according to those who know him best, is not a man given to backward looks\u2014\u201cthe most present human being I ever met,\u201d in the words of an intimate. Traditionally, Trump has seen the past as something to be either razed or twisted for expedience. He once ordered the destruction of a pair of unique friezes to make way for Trump Tower after he reportedly had pledged to donate them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Over the years, he has not so much read history as raided it, cherry-picking discredited scraps to wield as rhetorical cudgels.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump has about as much interest in history as he does in literature and philosophy,\u201d biographer Tim O\u2019Brien told me recently. \u201cWhich is to say almost nonexistent.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump did not arrive at this worldview entirely on his own. It turns out there are historical roots to the president\u2019s problematic relationship with history. As with so much of his antagonistic style, it is a trait he picked up from one of the most influential men in his life\u2014his father. Decades before Donald Trump would irk and flout the prim preservationists of Manhattan, Fred Trump waged his own come-one-come-all assault on an old, beloved bit of the city\u2019s cultural topography.\u000a\u000aThe elder Trump was a domineering, politically connected developer who was used to getting what he wanted, and the sordid saga of how he reacted one time when he didn\u2019t is highlighted in a display in the open-air exhibition hall of the Coney Island History Project. On Saturday, at the base of the Wonder Wheel and surrounded by the jangly sounds of hucksters\u2019 carnival games, I read the organization\u2019s account. For the small group dedicated to collecting and telling the rich history of this neighborhood at the southern tip of Brooklyn long known for its boardwalk and amusement areas, what Fred Trump did in the fall of 1966 clearly still feels like a fresh wound.\u000a\u000aSteeplechase Park, with its painted mechanical horses, gondola ride, parachute jump and arcade games, had been a Coney Island linchpin since 1897. But business was down. Its owners wanted out. They didn\u2019t open in 1965 and instead sold the property to Trump for $2.5 million. Trump wanted to erect a \u201cmodern, Miami Beach-type high-rise apartment development,\u201d but he encountered intense local pushback and ultimately was denied the necessary zoning change. \u201cHe could not overcome New Yorkers\u2019 abiding nostalgia for the Coney Island that was,\u201d Gwenda Blair wrote in her 2000 book, The Trumps: Three Generations That Built an Empire. The past had gotten in his way.\u000a\u000aSpurned and sour about it, Fred Trump got his revenge by staging an almost adolescent spectacle, sending formal invitations to reporters and VIPs to join him in \u201cmarking\u201d the \u201cdemolition of Steeplechase Park\u201d and to \u201crecord the end of a nostalgic era in Coney Island history.\u201d On a rainy September 21, 1966, as models in bikinis posed for pictures in the oversized shovel of a bulldozer, a grinning Trump held an ax and prodded his guests to whip bricks through the signature stained glass \u201cfunny face\u201d on the façade of the park\u2019s pavilion. The headline in the New York Times: \u201c6 Bikinied Beauties Attend Demolishing Of Coney Landmark.\u201d There\u2019s no indication Trump\u2019s ambitious middle son was present\u2014that fall was his first semester at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School after transferring from Fordham in the Bronx. After the party, though, Fred Trump had the rest of the site leveled, ensuring it couldn\u2019t be granted status as a historic landmark. In the end, Trump never got the zoning change he sought, building nothing\u2014but nonetheless pocketing more than $1 million in profit when he sold the land to the city.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis sad event,\u201d Charles Denson, the executive director of the Coney Island History Project, wrote in conjunction with the exhibition\u2019s debut last summer, \u201cwas a vindictive and shameful act by a grown man behaving like a juvenile delinquent. It wasn\u2019t business\u2014it was personal. The desecration of an icon and the breaking of glass as public spectacle revealed a twisted personality that was unusual for even the most hard-bitten developers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s almost the equivalent of ISIS tearing down religious icons, because the Steeplechase face was so iconic and really represented Coney Island,\u201d Denson told me Saturday.\u000a\u000a\u201cHorrifying,\u201d he called what Fred Trump did.\u000a\u000a\u201cBarbaric,\u201d said Tricia Vita, the administrative director of the History Project.\u000a\u000aIt wasn\u2019t even the first time Fred Trump had been instrumental in the obliteration of a culturally resonant Coney Island structure. In 1954, after the city seized the Luna Park area for the purposes of urban renewal and kicked it to Trump, he and his workers quickly rid the plot of the neighborhood\u2019s oldest roller coaster. \u201cThey demolished the coaster like it was made of toothpicks, and we couldn\u2019t salvage anything,\u201d a member of the family of the previous owners told Denson for his book called Wild Ride! \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let you in there. They just went in with chains and cables, lassoed the top, tied it to a bulldozer, and pulled the son of a gun down. They wrecked everything.\u201d\u000a\u000aReading these recollections, and lingering inside the Coney Island History Project on a hot, sunny, summer afternoon seven months into the first White House term of Fred Trump\u2019s son, it was hard not to think of the friezes on the handsome front of the Bonwit Teller building. In 1980, nine miles north, in midtown Manhattan, the then-33-year-old Trump scion greenlighted the demolition of the pair of Art Deco bas-relief structures Met staffers were expecting to receive. In a brief preview of what was to come, it was Trump\u2019s first scandal of sorts that was all his own, instead of shared with his father, a few-days dust-up in the newspapers that ultimately did little but fan his fledgling fame. At the time, Trump couldn\u2019t fathom why the fate of tired items was a big deal. \u201cDonald seemed genuinely befuddled by the fuss,\u201d Trump Tower architect Alan Lapidus told Blair for her biography. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t stand anything from before,\u201d Der Scutt, another architect on the project, wrote in his diary, according to Blair\u2019s reporting. \u201cHe wants his own clean image \u2026\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThey weren\u2019t even sculptures,\u201d Trump told Graydon Carter four years later for a 1984 profile for GQ. \u201cThey were stones with some engraving on them. They were nothing. Just junk.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOld, bad; new, good,\u201d Blair said last week. \u201cThat was really how he looked at everything.\u201d\u000a\u000aActually, when Blair approached Trump while she was working on her book\u2014it was not only a biography of Donald Trump but a history of his family on this side of the Atlantic Ocean\u2014he was puzzled, she recalled. \u201cWhen I told him that I wanted to do a historic look at the family, looking at these three generations who had been here,\u201d she said, \u201che just looked sort of \u2026 Huh? Why would you do that?\u201d\u000a\u000aIn spite of his relatively recent assertion that he\u2019s \u201ca big history fan,\u201d Trump\u2019s far from a historian.\u000a\u000aThe Art of the Deal, published in 1987, the foundational document of the created character that is now the most important person on the planet, is a \u201cbest-selling, non-fiction work of fiction,\u201d as O\u2019Brien, the biographer, put it in his 2005 book, TrumpNation.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a propagandist,\u201d O\u2019Brien told me. \u201cHe\u2019s a mythologist.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter he bought Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump liked to tell people a young Walt Disney painted the nursery rhyme-themed tiles in a room in the children\u2019s suite. The butler that doubles as house historian would roll his eyes in a reminder that this was untrue. Trump\u2019s response: \u201cWho cares?\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe makes up the past to suit his need,\u201d a former business associate told me, requesting anonymity to speak candidly about Trump\u2019s loose, abusive relationship with historical reality. At his club in Northern Virginia, for instance, a plaque between golf holes commemorates a Civil War battle that never happened. When confronted in 2015 by a reporter from the Times with the fact that local historians refuted his whole-cloth non-history, Trump sniffed, questioning the concept of academic integrity. \u201cHow would they know that?\u201d he said. \u201cWere they there?\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat history is good for, Trump has said many times, is to learn from it. \u201cIf history teaches us anything,\u201d he tweeted in 2012, it\u2019s that strong nations require strong leaders \u2026.\u201d In 2013, he tweeted a quote from Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s first inaugural address: \u201cHistory does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.\u201d Not too long after that, he met with Michael D\u2019Antonio for an interview for the biography called The Truth About Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think too much about the past\u2014other than to learn,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey only thing I like about the past is to learn from it, because if you make a mistake, you want to learn from it. Now, I\u2019d much rather learn from other people making mistakes.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump told D\u2019Antonio he reads \u201ca lot.\u201d\u000a\u000aLike what?\u000a\u000a\u201cWell,\u201d Trump said, \u201cwhen I say I read a lot, I\u2019m talking about current reading of the press and the media.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough he included in his 2009 book Think Like a Champion an addendum labeled \u201crecommended reading\u201d\u2014among the selections were Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s works about Abraham Lincoln and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt as well as one of William Manchester\u2019s volumes on Winston Churchill\u2014Trump confirmed in 2016 to Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher of the Washington Post that he doesn\u2019t read biographies of presidents. He doesn\u2019t have time, he explained.\u000a\u000aOn the campaign trail, Trump trafficked in history ranging from transparently facile to dangerously dubious. In his promise to potential voters to eliminate ISIS, he talked frequently in speeches and at rallies of \u201cmedieval times.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot since medieval times have you read about heads being chopped off, people being murdered and killed to the extent that they\u2019re being murdered and killed now,\u201d he told the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association on January 19, 2016, in Altoona, Iowa. \u201cWhen I would go and read and study history\u2014I always loved history, for some reason\u2014and you\u2019d read about medieval times. This is medieval times. We\u2019re in medieval times.\u201d\u000a\u000aA month later, in North Charleston, South Carolina, he relayed a tale of General \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Pershing and the strategic, anti-terrorist use of 50 bullets dipped in pig\u2019s blood. \u201cThis story is a fabrication,\u201d Texas A&M historian Brian McAllister Linn said to PolitiFact, which dinged Trump with a \u201cPants on Fire\u201d lie. No matter: \u201cThis is something you can read in the history books,\u201d Trump said to the people who had gathered on February 19, 2016, at the North Charleston Convention Center. \u201cNot a lot of history books\u2014because they don\u2019t like teaching this.\u201d He transitioned from there to his contention that the early 21st century is akin to medieval times. \u201cMedieval times!\u201d he said. \u201cI read\u2014I loved history when I was in high school. And I\u2019d read about medieval times. Boom! Boom! Chop off heads!\u201d From behind his Low Country lectern, he swiped the air with his right hand, mimicking the brutality of decapitation.\u000a\u000aAs president, he has made a series of statements that have unsettled historians as well as lay citizens who paid attention in middle-school social studies. In February, he said something that suggested that he was unaware that Frederick Douglass, the noted abolitionist, had been dead for more than a century. In March, he wondered out loud if most people knew that Lincoln was a Republican. \u201cRight?\u201d he said. \u201cDoes anyone know?\u201d In May, he asked in a radio interview with a conservative writer about the cause of the Civil War in a manner historians considered ignorant at best and sinister at worst. \u201cThe Civil War, if you think about it, why?\u201d Trump said.\u000a\u000a\u201cTrump,\u201d Times columnist Roger Cohen wrote last month, \u201cis an ahistorical president at a time of historical geostrategic shifts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is someone who clearly hasn\u2019t studied history,\u201d D\u2019Antonio, the biographer, said last week on CNN. When we talked a couple days later, he said, \u201cI doubt that he\u2019s read any work of history since high school.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the wake of his tweets about the monuments of Confederate generals, I called Blair. \u201cThe idea of his reverence of history,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be risible if it weren\u2019t so disturbing.\u201d\u000a\u000aA little more than five hours after the tweets about the statues, Trump tweeted about Pershing, re-invoking the PolitiFact-ed scenario about bullets and pig\u2019s blood. \u201cStudy what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,\u201d Trump typed last week in response to the van attack in Barcelona. \u201cThere was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!\u201d\u000a\u000aIn prior iterations of this falsehood, he had put the number of years at 25, or 42.\u000a\u000aTrump, said Denson, the boss of the Coney Island History Project, is just like his father. \u201cThey have no respect for history, whatsoever,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cNo respect for anything but themselves, really.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.

I very much look forward to doing that every day.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe website of the new government affairs and political consulting firm, called Avenue Strategies, advertised Lewandowski\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s close ties to Trump and even their office's physical proximity to the White House, at 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue (the same building that currently houses Trump's transition team).\u000a\u000aBennett told POLITICO the firm will work for any cause but not for foreign governments.\u000a\u000a"A lot of people have reached out to us, corporate clients, trade associations, individuals \u2014 we\u2019re not going to limit ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be providing strategic counsel most, explaining the White House to people. There are a tremendous number of people in Washington who don't know how the president-elect works."\u000a\u000aLewandowski and Bennett are joining a rush of Trump associates making moves to cash in on their ties to the new administration. Bill Smith, Vice President-elect Mike Pence's former chief of staff in Congress and the governor's office, recently started lobbying at the federal level through his friend Terry Allen's firm, Fidelis Government Relations. David Schwartz, a New York lawyer whose Gotham Government Relations & Communications has worked with Trump in the past, also announced plans to open a Washington office. Rudy Giuliani is also staying in the private sector, where he has built a lucrative consulting business.\u000a\u000aThe gold rush appears to erode Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp," but even the president-elect apparently is backing away from that slogan, according to adviser Newt Gingrich. "I'm told he now just disclaims that,\u201d Gingrich said in an interview with NPR. \u201cHe now says it was cute, but he doesn't want to use it anymore.\u201d\u000a\u000aLewandowski himself has railed against lobbyists and consultants to colleagues on the Trump campaign, at one point advocating the idea of a \u201cblacklist\u201d of consultants who opposed Trump and who he hinted would be barred from lucrative political work under Trump.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Lewandowski said his firm didn't conflict with Trump's message, suggesting that "drain the swamp" referred to bureaucracy, not people profiting on government contacts. (In fact, all five points of Trump's plan to "drain the swamp" involved lobbying, and none involved bureaucracy.)\u000a\u000a"The message he has talked about is bureaucracy that has ran amok is a problem," he said. "I think most companies would prefer to have a fast 'no' than a long 'maybe.' We are going to help companies get a faster answer."\u000a\u000aBennett and Lewandowski both said on Wednesday that Trump and his team were informed ahead of time of their plans to launch a firm.\u000a\u000a"They all knew what we were doing," Bennett said. "The president knew, and all of his top people knew. It is what it is."\u000a\u000aHe added that the firm will begin taking clients in the new year, and pledged that he and Lewandowski will not be \u201cyour standard lobbyists.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are going to help Trump advance his issues. If you're adamantly opposed to his policies, you shouldn't hire us,\u201d Bennett said.\u000a\u000aWhile Bennett said he has never been registered before as a lobbyist, Lewandowski was previously a registered lobbyist between 2005 and 2011, with clients including Passport Systems and Borrego Solar.\u000a\u000aLewandowski did not commit to registering as a lobbyist.\u000a\u000a"I've never said I'm going to be a registered lobbyist," he said. "What we're going to do is make sure individuals who want to support Trump's agenda will have the opportunity to do that."\u000a\u000aBennett served as Ben Carson\u2019s campaign manager and later as an informal senior adviser to Trump, although they had parted ways by late summer. He and Lewandowski first met two decades ago.\u000a\u000a"Corey knows everyone in that world,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI'm more closely tied to the first part."\u000a\u000aPeople professing ties to the new guard are threatening to turn the Washington power structure upside down and supplant longtime K Street titans. But it remains to be seen how much business they will poach from established firms considering how much the influence economy revolves around Congress.\u000a\u000aLewandowski's statement made it sound like the firm's purpose was to help advance Trump's agenda: "It is necessary to have strong, organized outside groups who can help ensure the president-elect's agenda is achieved. My goal is to make sure the priorities of the Trump administration become a reality."\u000a\u000aBut the firm's website makes clear it's in business for its clients: "Our firm provides client-tailored strategy and guidance carefully designed to help our clients navigate our government."\u000a\u000aLewandowski had openly jockeyed for a top job in Trump\u2019s White House, at one point telling people that he wanted to be chief of staff. But a number of Trump\u2019s close allies objected to the prospect of hiring Lewandowski for an influential job, citing his penchant for bitter infighting and allegations of aggressive behavior.\u000a\u000aHis firing in June followed clashes with Reince Priebus, now Trump\u2019s chief of staff, and Kushner, who continues to play an influential role in the transition.\u000a\u000aOpening the firm was his \u201cfallback plan,\u201d said an associate who worked with Lewandowski during the campaign. \u201cHe needs to make money,\u201d the associate said.\u000a\u000aThe associate argued that Lewandowski\u2019s earning potential would have been much greater had he worked in the Trump White House for even a short time before starting the firm, though Trump\u2019s ethics plan would have barred Lewandowski from lobbying for five years.\u000a\u000a"If anybody thought I was the type of person who was going to become a government bureaucrat, they don't know me or what I've done in the past 20 years," Lewandowski said.\u000a\u000aHe also said, "I told them that I was going to start a small business today after they gave me an offer of several jobs."\u000a\u000aLewandowski, who lives in Windham, New Hampshire, with his wife and their four young children, started looking for a place in Washington a couple weeks after Election Day, according to the associate. Bennett said Lewandowski will move to Washington.\u000a\u000aDuring the campaign, Lewandowski shopped a book proposal, at one point getting a $1.2-million offer from HarperCollins to write a book about his time running the campaign. But after Lewandowski\u2019s June firing, the publisher backed away from the deal amid concerns about Lewandowski\u2019s nondisclosure agreement, as POLITICO revealed.\u000a\u000aLewandowski did sign a deal reportedly in the six-figures to serve as an on-air political analyst for CNN. The network was criticized for hiring Lewandowski while he continued to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in severance payments from the Trump campaign through September.\u000a\u000aLewandowski resigned from the network after Election Day, ostensibly to join the Trump administration. His decision to start a firm and not pursue employment in the government could free him to become a paid television commentator again.\u000a\u000aLewandowski follows other so-called Trump originals who have been passed over for administration jobs despite their loyalty to the president-elect. Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have also been frozen out. The resolution of Lewandowski\u2019s role helps clear the way for more senior West Wing staff announcements to be announced soon.\u000a\u000a"If you look at a value proposition, that is what I bring," Lewandowski said. "It is defined in one word: Loyalty."\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVJust one week ago, Steve Bannon left his post as President Donald Trump's chief strategist. He's been busy ever since. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Media Bannon\u2019s back: A week in Breitbart headlines\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been one week since Steve Bannon was ousted from his post as President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist and returned to his perch as executive chairman of Breitbart News, where he pledged to \u201ccrush the opposition.\u201d\u000a\u000aPOLITICO monitored the right-wing website\u2019s home page this week to see whether Bannon was making good on his promise. We found that the site heartily mocked West Wing aides that Bannon had clashed with \u2013 including Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner and national security adviser H.R. McMaster \u2013 as well as Republican congressional leaders who have long been a target of Breitbart\u2019s ire. The site also didn\u2019t spare the president on his plans for the war in Afghanistan and his administration\u2019s immigration policy.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s a look at some of Breitbart\u2019s top headlines from the week.\u000a\u000aHitting White House aides\u000a\u000aPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\u000a\u000aBreitbart took aim at several of the president\u2019s top aides in the White House, particularly Kushner and economic adviser Gary Cohn. The site mocked Kushner\u2019s trip to the Middle East and took offense to an interview Cohn gave, criticizing Trump\u2019s response to the recent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. (Bannon reportedly does not get along with either of them.)\u000a\u000aTweaking Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell\u000a\u000aPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\u000a\u000aThe leaders of the Republican Party were roundly criticized by Breitbart, as they often are. The site highlighted Trump\u2019s comments blaming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan for the state of negotiations around raising the debt ceiling prominently on the home page, and hit McConnell for his poor approval rating in a recent poll.\u000a\u000aQuestioning Trump\u2019s Afghanistan strategy \u2014 and H.R. McMaster\u2019s influence\u000a\u000aEvan Vucci/AP\u000a\u000aBreitbart was uncharacteristically critical of Trump on Monday after he delivered a foreign policy address announcing a troop surge in Afghanistan, a move Bannon reportedly opposed. But the site made a point to spin the decision as the result of bad advice from McMaster, who tangled with Bannon during his time at the White House.\u000a\u000aCovering Confederate monuments\u000a\u000aSteve Helber/AP\u000a\u000aBreitbart was eager to cover the debate on what to do about the remaining Confederate monuments around the country and the growing movement to remove them in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville (the site dubbed it \u201cmadness\u201d).\u000a\u000aBannon recently told The New York Times that he wants Democrats to talk more about the issue because he thinks it\u2019s good politically for Trump: \u201cThe race-identity politics of the left wants to say it\u2019s all racist,\u201d he said. \u201cJust give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can\u2019t get enough of it.\u201d\u000a\u000aCalling for the wall and immigration restriction\u000a\u000aGuillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Image\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s ongoing debate in the White House about what to do on immigration, and Trump continues to demand money for his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border (at a rally on Tuesday, he threatened to shut down the government if he didn\u2019t get it). Breitbart was apoplectic about reports that some White House aides are \u201cchoking out\u201d at Trump\u2019s \u201cwinning populist agenda\u201d by opposing the border wall.\u000a\u000aCheering Trump\u2019s Phoenix rally\u000a\u000aRick Scuteri/AP\u000a\u000aBreitbart\u2019s home page drew plenty of attention to Trump\u2019s combative, freewheeling rally speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday, cheering the president\u2019s attacks on the media for its \u201clies\u201d and complaining about protesters. It also gave Kelli Ward, a right-wing primary challenger to Sen. Jeff Flake, a shout-out.\u000a\u000aAuthors:\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Breitbart News\u000a\u000aStephen Bannon

aVLike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims, the inscription was evidently not fact-checked.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,\u201d said Richard Gillespie, the executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, a historical preservation and education group devoted to an 1,800-square-mile section of the Northern Virginia Piedmont, including the Lowes Island site.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only thing that was remotely close to that,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said, was 11 miles up the river at the Battle of Ball\u2019s Bluff in 1861, a rout of Union forces in which several hundred were killed. \u201cThe River of Blood?\u201d he added. \u201cNope, not there.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Gillespie\u2019s contradiction of the plaque\u2019s account was seconded by Alana Blumenthal, the curator of the Loudoun Museum in nearby Leesburg. (A third local expert, who said he had written to Mr. Trump\u2019s company about the inscription\u2019s falsehoods and offered to provide historically valid replacement text, insisted on anonymity because he did not want to cross the Trump Organization by disclosing a private exchange.)\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aIn a phone interview, Mr. Trump called himself a \u201ca big history fan\u201d but deflected, played down and then simply disputed the local historians\u2019 assertions of historical fact.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat was a prime site for river crossings,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot \u2014 a lot of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe club does indeed lie a stone\u2019s throw from Rowser\u2019s Ford, where, as an official historical marker notes, Gen.

But he said he did not remember their names.\u000a\u000aThen he said the historians had spoken not to him but to \u201cmy people.\u201d But he refused to identify any underlings who might still possess the historians\u2019 names.\u000a\u000a\u201cWrite your story the way you want to write it,\u201d Mr. Trump said finally, when pressed unsuccessfully for anything that could corroborate his claim. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to anybody. It doesn\u2019t make any difference. But many people were shot. It makes sense.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn its small way, the plaque bears out Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation for being preoccupied with grandeur, superlatives and his own name, but less so with verifiable facts, even when his audience is relatively small.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

aVEAGLE GROVE, Iowa\u2014On a cloud-swept landscape dotted with grain elevators, a meat producer called Prestage Farms is building a 700,000-square-foot processing plant. The gleaming new factory is both the great hope of Wright County, which voted by a 2-1 margin for Donald Trump, and the victim of one of Trump\u2019s first policy moves, his decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u000a\u000aFor much of industrial America, the TPP was a suspect deal, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some argue led to a massive offshoring of U.S. jobs to Mexico. But for the already struggling agricultural sector, the sprawling 12-nation TPP, covering 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy, was a lifeline. It was a chance to erase punishing tariffs that restricted the United States\u2014the onetime \u201cbreadbasket of the world\u201d\u2014from selling its meats, grains and dairy products to massive importers of foodstuffs such as Japan and Vietnam.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe decision to pull out of the trade deal has become a double hit on places like Eagle Grove. The promised bump of $10 billion in agricultural output over 15 years, based on estimates by the U.S. International Trade Commission, won\u2019t materialize. But Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the pact also cleared the way for rival exporters such as Australia, New Zealand and the European Union to negotiate even lower tariffs with importing nations, creating potentially greater competitive advantages over U.S. exports.\u000a\u000aA POLITICO analysis found that the 11 other TPP countries are now involved in a whopping 27 separate trade negotiations with each other, other major trading powers in the region like China and massive blocs like the EU. Those efforts range from exploratory conversations to deals already signed and awaiting ratification. Seven of the most significant deals for U.S. farmers were either launched or concluded in the five months since the United States withdrew from the TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, whose North Carolina-based family pork and poultry business made its huge investment in the plant near Eagle Grove in part to reap expected gains from the TPP. \u201cI don\u2019t guess I\u2019ve gone beyond the point of no return on the new plant, but we did already start digging our wells and started moving dirt.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe and other agricultural businesspeople and workers have reason for concern.\u000a\u000aContrasting sharply with Eagle Grove\u2019s sleepy main thoroughfares, Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya Crossing is considered to be one of the busiest intersections in the world. While slow and small, Iowa towns such as Eagle Grove help supply much of the pork Japan imports. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aOn July 6, the EU, which already exports as much pork to Japan as the United States does, announced political agreement on a new deal that would give European pork farmers an advantage of up to $2 per pound over U.S. exporters under certain circumstances\u2014a move which, if unchecked, is all but certain to create a widening gap between EU exports and those from the United States.\u000a\u000aEuropean wine producers, who sold more than $1 billion to Japan between 2014 and 2016, would also see a 15 percent tariff on exports to Japan disappear while U.S. exporters would continue to face that duty at the border. For other products, the deal essentially mirrors the rates negotiated under the TPP, which the United States has surrendered, giving the EU a clear advantage over U.S. farmers.\u000a\u000aThe EU\u2019s deal is all the more noteworthy because American farmers were relying on the TPP\u2014to which the EU was not a member\u2014to give them an advantage over European competitors. But in a further rebuke to the United States, Tokyo decided within a matter of weeks to offer the European nations virtually the same agricultural access to its market that United States trade officials had spent two excruciating years extracting through near-monthly meetings with their Japanese counterparts on the sidelines of the broader TPP negotiations; the United States is now left out.\u000a\u000aThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

Without the TPP, Australian ranchers eventually will enjoy a 19 percent tariff advantage over U.S. competitors. Australia is also prioritizing the conclusion of trade talks with Indonesia, the largest nation in Southeast Asia by gross domestic product.\u000a\u000aThe remaining 11 TPP countries have already met two times, with a third meeting planned, to move ahead with the revival of the deal without the United States. The so-called TPP-11 would be in direct response to Trump\u2019s trade policy. Economic forecasts already show projected gains for countries involved. Canada, according to one estimate, could permanently gain an annual market share of $412 million in beef and $111 million in pork sales to Japan by 2035, because lower tariffs would enable it to eclipse America\u2019s position in the market.\u000a\u000aAs China, which was never a part of the TPP, senses blood in the water, it is moving quickly to assert itself, rather than the United States, as the region\u2019s trade arbiter. China is aiming to close talks by the end of this year on its behemoth Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\u2014a trade agreement involving 15 other Asia-Pacific countries.\u000a\u000aNone of these deals are yet in effect. But already there are signs that competitors are gaining market share over U.S. producers in the post-TPP landscape, as Pacific nations take a closer look at alternatives to U.S. exporters.\u000a\u000aOver the first five months of 2017, U.S. exports to Japan of chilled pork, which is preferable to frozen meat, are up 2 percent over the previous year. But exports of chilled pork from Canada, a prime competitor, are up 19 percent. Likewise, in frozen pork, U.S. exports are up 28 percent. But exports from the EU, the leading competitor, are up 44 percent.\u000a\u000aJapan, which saw the TPP not only as a source of economic growth but a counterweight to China, is now taking the lead in salvaging the deal. Its goal is to have some sort of agreement between the 11 other countries in place for the annual summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in November. Trump is expected to attend, creating the awkward possibility that he will witness all the handshakes and back slaps as his fellow leaders congratulate themselves on a deal.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Trump once promised a slew of \u201cbeautiful\u201d deals to replace the TPP, but his administration has yet to lay out a detailed strategy. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told lawmakers that an analysis is underway to determine where it makes most sense to pursue negotiations.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Lighthizer, a trade attorney who pressured Japan to voluntarily restrain its steel exports when he was a trade official in the 1980s, said Tokyo should just go ahead and lower their tariffs without expecting anything in return.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think in the areas like beef and the others, they ought to be making some unilateral concessions, at least temporary concessions,\u201d he told lawmakers in June. \u201cAnd I don't quite understand why that doesn't happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aLighthizer said the administration still hopes to strike bilateral trade deals\u2014that is, separate agreements with individual countries\u2014but he conceded that "some of the TPP countries don't want to do bilaterals." The value of the TPP for many countries was that they could justify giving up protective tariffs in exchange for their own access to the markets of a wide pool of countries; many are unwilling to make such concessions for the smaller gains of a bilateral deal.\u000a\u000aLighthizer acknowledged that even Japan, at least for the time being, may not be interested in one-on-one negotiations with the U.S.\u000a\u000aLighthizer declined to comment for this report, and the White House directed questions to the Agriculture Department. But Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, which is more overtly pro-trade than other pockets of the administration, said in a statement that \u201cSecretary [Sonny] Perdue is committed to expanding our playing field for American agricultural exports,\u201d and has met with his counterparts in Canada, Mexico and China.\u000a\u000aMurtaugh cited administration gains in \u201cgetting beef into the Chinese market\u201d and securing access for American rice growers to China, \u201cthe largest rice market in the world.\u201d Both moves came out of Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, though they had been worked on intensively during the Obama administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt goes right along with the secretary\u2019s new motto for USDA, \u2018Do right and feed everyone,\u2019\u201d Murtaugh wrote.\u000a\u000aHe made no mention of efforts to fill in the gaps left by the country\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, which are more in Lighthizer\u2019s purview.\u000a\u000aThat leaves workers in 13,000-person Wright County, whose survival depends largely on agriculture, with relatively few signs of optimism. Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from the TPP has stoked uncertainty about U.S. trade policy and, more notably, the president\u2019s commitment to rural America.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe fooled a lot of people,\u201d said Sandy McGrath, mayor of Eagle Grove, who is not affiliated with any party and did not support Trump.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn Wright County, a trainload of corn can be in Mexico in three days, tens of thousands of hogs are being raised just for export to Japan and farmers routinely travel to far-flung places like Indonesia and the Philippines to market their goods.\u000a\u000aThis community roughly 100 miles north of Des Moines, checker boarded with corn and soybean fields and dotted with silos, may seem far from the raging debate over globalism sparked by Trump\u2019s presidency, but it\u2019s actually right at the center.\u000a\u000aSandy McGrath, the mayor of Eagle Grove, is shown at Rails Bar and Grill, which she owns and operates.

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe county\u2019s residents are grappling with life under a Trump presidency and all its unanswered questions: Will the president\u2019s next tweet about trade send commodity prices crashing? Will Trump ever follow through on his promise to create new opportunities through bilateral trade deals? And, even more pressing: Will the new plant that Prestage is building be able to hire a second shift of workers, helping families who have struggled through the recent agricultural downturn?\u000a\u000a\u201cI would not say I trust the president\u2019s judgment right now,\u201d said McGrath, a registered nurse who grew up on a nearby farm and owns one of the town\u2019s main watering holes\u2014Rails Bar and Grill, named for its proximity to the rail line that that carries cars loaded with grain and feed.\u000a\u000aEagle Grove\u2019s skyline is already punctuated by feed grain elevators and a soybean processing facility. Now it\u2019s further staking its future on Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant, roughly five miles south of town past the Dollar General, the Family Table restaurant and a Ford dealership.\u000a\u000aThe plant represents an opportunity not many Midwest towns the size of Eagle Grove are afforded given today's economic realities.\u000a\u000aMcGrath said the plant will bring much-needed jobs to the area, which has had a dwindling population for years. From its 1970 height of 4,489 people, the town suffered a 31 percent decline in population to 3,427 in 2016. Now Eagle Grove is expecting at least 200 of the 900 workers the plant will initially employ to find housing in the town. This would give a sorely needed boost to retailers and service providers, as well.\u000a\u000aBut the plant\u2019s success will depend largely on export opportunities. More than 26 percent of the pork produced in the U.S. in 2016 was exported to foreign markets. And more than $1.5 billion of the nearly $6 billion in U.S. pork exports in 2016 headed for Japan.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the time those investment decisions were made, the U.S. had never turned down a free trade opportunity,\u201d said Dermot Hayes, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University, referring to the Prestage plant and other pork-industry investments.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m scared to death,\u201d said Ron Prestage, referring to Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the TPP. The family-owned Prestage Farms is building a pork processing facility outside Eagle Grove that depends on a robust export market. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aHayes said the livestock industry had in its sights a future of expansion amid soaring export growth. After Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the TPP, \u201cthat has pretty much disappeared,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMost in the industry expected a coming boom from exports as a result of TPP, with continued strong sales made possible by NAFTA. Vietnam, another growing market where U.S. producers were set to expand sales of organ meat and other items not easily sold domestically, was prepared to eliminate its tariffs altogether under TPP. Now, the tariffs remain and Prestage\u2014and all of Eagle Grove\u2014are holding their breath.\u000a\u000aPrestage said his company\u2019s plant should be operational by the fall of 2018, but any move to add a second shift or expand production will largely depend on new trade opportunities.\u000a\u000aExuding gentle defiance, Prestage said even if he had known the TPP would fail, he still would have gone ahead with the plant. His family\u2019s business raises, mainly through contract growers, more than 1.5 million hogs in Iowa alone. Consolidation in the meatpacking industry has forced companies like Prestage to sell hogs to a few major players like Tyson Foods and JBS.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was time for there to be some modernization in the U.S. packing industry,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aWith future export opportunities in question, the success of the plant will now be tied to what business it can displace from less efficient and older processing facilities. It also will face competition. The Prestage plant is one of two new major pork processing plants being built in Iowa and one of five new facilities going up nationwide.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think that Trump is naïve enough to not recognize the value of trade deals to the U.S.,\u201d Prestage said in an interview at his Eagle Grove office, a nondescript former bank building on the town\u2019s main drag. \u201cI just think he has an unusual way of introducing what his policy is going to be.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI sure hope I\u2019m right about that,\u201d he added after a pause.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAsk anyone involved in the county\u2019s agriculture sector their thoughts on Trump as president and his stance on trade, and you get a carefully thought-out response. Like many of those in Trump\u2019s rural base, they are distrustful of the coastal elites who are blocking his agenda, even as they wish that he would alter his own abrasive style and think more about those who got him elected.\u000a\u000a\u201cI still believe what he is saying he is going to follow through on, but his management style isn\u2019t quite how at least people in the Midwest do things,\u201d said Stu Swanson, who farms corn, soybeans and pork outside Galt, a tiny hamlet near the center of the county.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a Midwest style and there\u2019s his style,\u201d he said from his living room, where the panorama from the windows is dotted by the white-roofed livestock barns in the distance.\u000a\u000aGround is prepared to host Prestage\u2019s 700,000-square-foot pork processing plant south of Eagle Grove, Iowa. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aSwanson acknowledged his own household is split over its support for Trump. Trump, he figured, would be the best positioned to tamp down the rising health care costs for his own family and his one farmhand that he believes to be connected to the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aBut on trade, Swanson was less sure where Trump drew the line between campaign-trail bluster and real action. There was, he thought, far too much at stake for his rural base to make any rash decisions. Then, three days after he was sworn in, Trump made good on a promise to drop U.S. support for TPP.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was disappointed Trump kind of broadly wiped out TPP before there was even a discussion,\u201d Swanson said.\u000a\u000aJerry Maier, a Wright County corn and soybean farmer who supported Trump, said he feels the same way.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re at the table and nothing happens, that\u2019s one thing. But if you aren\u2019t even at that table, that\u2019s frustrating,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe downward trend of commodity prices has been a lingering reality for the third-generation farmer who lives just outside Eagle Grove. The USDA\u2019s annual farm income report forecasts that net farm income will drop this year by 8.7 percent, compared with 2016. Incomes have been decreasing steadily since 2013 when they hit an all-time high of more than $120 billion. The forecast for this year projects net incomes down to little more than $62.3 billion.\u000a\u000aMaier, for one, has had to find new ways to earn extra income from grinding tree stumps to hauling gravel using trucks that usually carry grain. After a wet planting season this spring, he expects to once again barely break even on his crops.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are pretty resilient about making no money for a few years, but you gotta make money at some point,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMaier is as vigilant as any commodity trader, scrutinizing corn and soybean prices multiple times a day as alerts come in on the smartphone he carries on his belt.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s also aware that any extra margin on his crops, barring any unforeseen demand domestically, will largely depend on new overseas markets. He recently hosted a contingent of South Korean grain buyers on his farm and traveled to the Philippines and Indonesia last year to seek new contracts for Iowa farmers.\u000a\u000aIn April, when Trump was on the verge of withdrawing from NAFTA, Maier said he watched corn prices plummet in anticipation of the president\u2019s decision. Trump relented, at the request of Perdue, the agriculture secretary, who appealed to the president with colorful maps showing the president's base was largely concentrated in states that heavily rely on agriculture.\u000a\u000aUltimately, Trump agreed to renegotiations with Canada and Mexico instead. But Maier remains wary that, despite pledges by the administration to "do no harm" for agriculture, the mere act of reopening the deal with Canada and Mexico, the two largest destinations for U.S. agricultural exporters, could mess up what has been a very good thing for American farmers in the Midwest.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers are willing to open up NAFTA, but if we open up NAFTA, there's the risk of going backwards,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aWright County produces 800,000 hogs per year and is one of the top 20 pork-producing counties in the country. Put those pigs next to the more than 6.5 million egg-laying hens (the county is first in the nation in egg production) and that creates a huge demand for corn and soybean for feed.\u000a\u000aStu Swanson farms corn, soybeans and pork near Galt, Iowa. While Swanson sells most of his pork to local processors, he is still concerned how Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of TPP could impact neighbors and corporate producers. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aThe supply chain from field, to feed, to animal has created a massive livestock industry that doesn\u2019t always find demand among American consumers. The dimming of any new trade opportunities or the disruption of existing ones creates a ripple effect not only vertically along the direct farm value chain but horizontally into the economic welfare of the surrounding community.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the farmers have a bad year, we all have a bad year. If the farmers have a good year, we all have a good year,\u201d said Melia Hansen, a hair stylist on Eagle Grove\u2019s main street.\u000a\u000aSuccessfully growing a business in today\u2019s agricultural economy has become more reliant on trade as farmers consolidate and massively scale up their production to better compete. In 1940, the Agriculture Department census found that the average Iowa farm was 160 acres. By 2012, when the last census was conducted, the average acreage in Wright County was 464.\u000a\u000aThe success of the community as a whole is growing more reliant on the fortunes of fewer farmers growing even more grain and livestock.\u000a\u000a\u201cFarmers spend a quarter- to a half-million dollars on a combine,\u201d said Ethan Bubeck, who runs a local meat processing business in Eagle Grove that buys hogs from farmers who also sell to the major meat processors. \u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018American Gothic\u2019 picture of the guy with a pitchfork. This is big business.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe economic outlook for Wright County would certainly be a lot less hopeful without the Prestage plant, but there is broad recognition that trade will largely drive any future growth, said Bryce Davis, director of the county\u2019s economic development department.\u000a\u000aCustomers have their beauty needs taken care of at Reflections Salon, a renovated bank building along Broadway Street in Eagle Grove. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aAs commodities like corn and soybeans continue to languish, Davis excitedly talks about the export potential of \u201cvalue-added agriculture\u201d beyond pork production.\u000a\u000aAfter an earlier proposal to build Prestage\u2019s plant about 70 miles away near Mason City was turned down, Davis sent an unsolicited email to the company to see whether they\u2019d be interested in scoping out Wright County as a possible location.\u000a\u000aNow, fresh off the major coup of reeling in Prestage, the young, energetic economic development professional sees more opportunity in everything from aquaculture to getting more farmers to grow hops to harness the new global fervor for craft beer.\u000a\u000aHe dreams of a time when the county could become a seafood exporter 1,000 miles away from the closest ocean. The concept is already bringing success to nearby Webster City where a company called VeroBlue is expanding its operations for raising barramundi, a flaky white fish native to Australia. The company, which already farms fish in old pork production facilities, acquired the building that once housed the town\u2019s primary employer, an Electrolux washing machine factory that shut down in 2011 and relocated in Juárez, Mexico.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know we need these trade agreements in place to provide an opportunity for Iowa farmers to sell their products,\u201d Davis said.\u000a\u000aThe Obama administration, backed by a large cadre of free-trade Republicans, used that reality to grow support for the TPP among businesses and agricultural interests eager to grab a better foothold in a fast-growing area of the world where the U.S. has few formal trade deals.\u000a\u000aWorkers at Lewright Meats prepare hog products for sale at their Eagle Grove shop.

Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut through the slow churn of negotiations, the dazzlingly complex deal among 12 countries soon fell victim to time and circumstance. After more than five years of talks, bleary-eyed trade negotiators were finally able to close the deal at an Atlanta hotel on October 5, 2015. But the agreement quickly became mired in election politics. Labor unions and blue-collar voters declared it to be a successor to NAFTA, which was blamed for the loss of factories. And while the U.S. trade commission predicted the deal would be broadly beneficial to the overall economy, some areas including food and agriculture were predicted to score more gains than others.\u000a\u000aEven as supporters of the deal insisted it would put U.S. manufacturers on a stronger footing versus overseas competitors by enforcing higher labor and environmental standards, Trump and Bernie Sanders used anti-TPP fervor as a key plank of their campaign platforms, declaring that it would cost America jobs. Even Hillary Clinton, normally a supporter of freer trade, turned on the deal, saying she wanted to negotiate better terms.\u000a\u000aTrump escalated his rhetoric on trade after the primaries and Congress, which has final say on trade deals, shied away from bringing TPP up for a vote. After Trump\u2019s victory, the fate of the deal in the GOP-controlled Congress was all but sealed as Republican lawmakers put it aside to concentrate on tax reform and a bid to roll back Obamacare.\u000a\u000aOn his first full day in office, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing from the TPP, calling the action a \u201cgreat thing for the American worker.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country,\u201d Trump said during a campaign stop in Ohio. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, too. It\u2019s a harsh word: It\u2019s a rape of our country.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aBut even as Iowa was voting for Trump by 51 percent-42 percent, its farmers were looking to Asia as their savior.\u000a\u000aThroughout the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, an expanding middle class is demanding higher-quality protein\u2014causing enormous demand for meat. U.S. pork producers can find Asian buyers for just about everything cut out of a hog carcass\u2014from the highest-priced loin to the cheaper organ meats that are hard to sell to U.S. consumers.\u000a\u000aThe boom in Asia is so powerful that, even with the dim trade outlook stemming from its pullout from the TPP, U.S. pork exports continued to grow through April of this year. In the first four months of 2017, 27.5 percent of total U.S. pork production was exported, up from 24.4 percent last year. Exports to Japan in April were 5 percent higher than a year ago by volume and up 10 percent in value.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Meat Export Federation has pushed an aggressive marketing campaign for pork and beef, portraying American meats as premium products. In Japanese supermarkets, American pork is branded with a logo featuring Gochipo, a cute animated pig that sometimes even makes appearances in mascot form to encourage shoppers to buy premium, thick cuts of U.S.-produced pork.\u000a\u000aIn Japan, it\u2019s hard to promote products in a landscape cluttered with color. So the U.S. Meat Export Federation developed a lovable character, Gochipo, to serve as its ambassador for American pork. While domestic pork holds 51 percent of the market, the U.S. leads all import products at 15 percent, just ahead of Canada\u2019s 10 percent market share. USMEF regularly hosts pork tastings in grocery stores and offers special promotions in restaurants and malls throughout the Tokyo region. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBut it could soon just be a matter of time until consumers in those countries will choose a lower-cost product.\u000a\u000aGrowth in Canadian chilled-pork exports to Japan is already outpacing those of the United States, as buyers in Japan have already been looking to diversify their sources after a disease outbreak spiked prices in 2014 and a West Coast ports shutdown further roiled the market in 2015. If Canada clinches a deal with Japan through a revived TPP where it would gain a price advantage, little would stop Canadian pork from overtaking U.S. share of the market, which has already dipped from 70 percent in 2012 to 55 percent this year.\u000a\u000aThe EU, a major pork exporter, is also closing in on both the Japanese market and fast-growing Vietnam. Japan ended up offering the EU the same deal on pork it did to the United States under the TPP after the EU gave Tokyo favorable access for its cars. In Vietnam, frozen pork imported from the EU will be duty-free seven years after the deal with Brussels goes into force.\u000a\u000aHayes, of Iowa State University, is deeply worried about the threat these deals represent. \u201cInstead of getting those 200 million customers we may be, in fact, at a disadvantage in those markets because these are preferential trade agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not part of it, you are on the other side.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most immediate example of U.S. producers losing out is the case of Australian beef. In its lobbying drive on the TPP, the U.S. beef industry at one time even kept a website complete with a counter continuously ticking off the amount of sales to Japan it was losing to Australia. Now, Australia is speeding up the clock.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe count on a bigger market share,\u201d declared Michael Finucan, general manager for international markets for Meat and Livestock Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have a tariff advantage in that market for quite a number of years.\u201d\u000a\u000aAustralia's tariff advantage was boosted even more after Japan imposed an additional 11.5 percent tariff on imports of U.S. frozen beef on August 1. U.S. exports of the product had risen to a level of triggering a \u201csafeguard\u201d measure meant to protect domestic cattle producers. That tariff hike won't apply to Australia since it has a trade deal with Tokyo and wouldn't have applied to the United States if the TPP were in place.\u000a\u000aAustralian exports to Japan are expected to catch up with the United States, with Australia enjoying a tariff this year of 27.5 percent compared with the 50 percent the United States now faces with the safeguard in place. The TPP would have cut tariffs to 9 percent for both Australia and the United States.\u000a\u000aAfter years of drought, Australia\u2019s ranchers are rebuilding their herds. Although the scale of Australia\u2019s production may never match that of the United States, Finucan said there is increasing demand for the type of grass-fed beef Australia is best known for producing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the moment, there is a shift toward health as a lot of developed countries are in the same space,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are questioning the amount of marbling in beef and looking for a leaner product. It\u2019s obviously a place Australia can play well with our grass-fed beef.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aSitting comfortably on a couch overlooking the expanse of sea from the lobby of a beachfront hotel in Vina del Mar, Chile, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo has his gaze fixed across the Pacific.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s March 15 and, a few hours previously, the 11 current TPP countries were finally able to offer a unified response to Trump\u2019s announcement from January: Don\u2019t expect the trade agreement to fade away.\u000a\u000aThe meeting on Chile\u2019s coast represented a major turning point on trade for Asia-Pacific countries facing life in the Trump era. Not only did the remaining TPP countries reaffirm their commitment to retain the benefits of the deal, but Chile and its Latin American trade allies in the Pacific Alliance announced their own efforts to advance regional trade integration by pursuing trade deals with other countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe continue to engage with the world,\u201d Ciobo said matter-of-factly, while sipping a Coke.\u000a\u000aHe said his highest priority was completing negotiations for a trade deal with Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest country, where the United States has no agreement. Leaders from Australia and Indonesia agreed on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in July to reach a deal by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy job as Australia\u2019s trade and investment minister is to pursue Australia\u2019s national interests, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d Ciobo said, when asked whether Australia is actively seeking to take market share from the United States. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ll pursue our trade and investment agenda through multilateral, plurilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements.\u201d\u000a\u000aWorkers offload a shipment of pork from a Perry, Iowa processor as it arrives at a massive cold storage facility along the shipyards in Tokyo, Japan. | M.

Lighthizer, who once served as a deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed on May 11. The people tapped to serve in the agency\u2019s three deputy positions await confirmation, as does the administration\u2019s pick for chief agriculture negotiator.\u000a\u000aIowa\u2019s Republican Sen.

They made a major investment two years ago in a state-of-the-art livestock facility, knowing that the margin on soybeans and corn alone wouldn\u2019t provide a sustainable source of income to keep the farm, which has been in his family for more than 100 years.\u000a\u000aHis current contract has him raising hogs for the Japanese market. That involves feeding the animals a diet free from certain additives and following more restrictive guidelines on antibiotic use. He knows any profit he might get on futures contracts for any hogs raised for export will largely depend on whether the trading relationships tilt in favor of the United States.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe world is going find it wherever it\u2019s cheapest,\u201d said Woodley, who made clear he did not support Trump in the election.\u000a\u000aStability and predictability were two key principles for Woodley. So far, he doesn\u2019t see any of that coming out of the Trump administration when it comes to his trade policy and ability to strike new deals.\u000a\u000a\u201cCreating instability is not good business practice when there are fierce and competitive producers around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cStability and predictability are tremendous to me as I seek out business partnerships, so why would it be any different for any other country we work with?\u201d

aVA firm co-founded by Donald Trump\u2019s initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, quietly agreed to lobby for the oil company Citgo as the company, which is owned by the leftist government of Venezuela, was becoming increasingly embroiled in tensions involving the United States, Venezuela and Russia.\u000a\u000aOfficials with Lewandowski\u2019s firm, Avenue Strategies, confirmed that last month it formalized a $25,000-a-month lobbying contract with Citgo.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe officials initially told POLITICO that the firm had filed legally required paperwork revealing the contract to the U.S. government on Feb. 20. But Lewandowski\u2019s co-founder in the firm, fellow Trump campaign aide Barry Bennett, subsequently clarified that it \u201cwas just an origination date,\u201d and the firm was working to file the paperwork Wednesday.\u000a\u000aAs of Wednesday evening, that paperwork was not posted on the website of the Senate Office of Public Records, which processes and automatically posts such filings almost instantaneously.\u000a\u000aBennett said Avenue has yet to begin lobbying for Citgo and that \u201cit\u2019s not entirely clear\u201d on what issues it will lobby. He stressed, though, that he will be the only firm employee who registers to lobby on the contract, and that Lewandowski \u201cdoesn\u2019t really have a role\u201d in it.\u000a\u000aSources familiar with the contract say that Avenue Strategies was brought on by Citgo to help provide access to the Trump administration amid calls for the U.S. to seize the company\u2019s assets as a way to expand the impact of sanctions against Venezuela.\u000a\u000aBut the revelation of Avenue\u2019s previously unreported contract with Citgo comes at an awkward moment for the company, Lewandowski and the Trump White House.\u000a\u000aTrump ran on a promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interest influence in Washington, and the increasing attention on the lobbying firm co-founded soon after the election by Lewandowski, who remains a close Trump confidant, threatens to undermine the president\u2019s efforts to make the case he\u2019s fulfilling that promise.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the government-ethics watchdog group Public Citizen sent a letter to the Department of Justice and congressional lobbying oversight offices requesting investigations into whether Lewandowski was violating lobbying laws by not registering as a lobbyist, based on a POLITICO report about a newer company created by Avenue Strategies that appeared to be offering prospective clients meetings with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\u000a\u000aBennett called the letter a baseless and partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Bennett also acknowledged that Avenue Strategies on Wednesday dissolved the newer company, which was called Washington East West Political Strategies.\u000a\u000aThe company had distributed pitch materials to prospective Eastern European clients promising to arrange meetings with Trump, Pence and senior members of their administration, POLITICO revealed last week. Bennett said he and Lewandowski never saw the document, which he said was produced by Avenue\u2019s partners in the company, an Azerbaijani oil executive and an American political consultant who works extensively in Russia.\u000a\u000aThe document \u201cwas a violation of our understanding with them,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the headache.\u201d\u000a\u000aLewandowski issued a statement saying he had \u201cno affiliation or involvement\u201d and \u201cnever entered into any agreement with this firm.\u201d\u000a\u000aBennett clarified that \u201cAvenue Strategies owned the equity \u2014 and that is me and Corey \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have any role.\u201d Bennett didn\u2019t respond when asked whether Avenue had dissolved other firms it had created with other partners to prospect in the Middle East, Canada and Central America.\u000a\u000aConcerns about Lewandowski\u2019s adherence to lobbying rules and boasts of access also have taken hold inside the White House, said two people who have discussed Lewandowski\u2019s lobbying with administration officials.\u000a\u000aAnd Citgo, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, is under increasing scrutiny as the Trump administration takes a tougher line against the cash-strapped government of Venezuela, which has been accused of human rights abuses and drug trafficking.\u000a\u000aComplicating matters further, there are rising concerns that the Russian government-owned oil company Rosneft could be on the verge of taking control of Citgo. That\u2019s because Venezuela\u2019s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, took out a loan from Rosneft in December, offering as collateral 49.9 percent of Citgo\u2019s shares. International energy market analysts have predicted that the economic crisis in Venezuela could lead PDVSA to default on its debt, which would put Rosneft on the cusp of controlling three of the largest and most sophisticated refineries in the U.S., plus three major pipelines and dozens of fuel terminals.\u000a\u000aThe involvement of Russia is fraught for Trump\u2019s administration. The president\u2019s team is under scrutiny from law enforcement and congressional investigators examining Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, including by stealing and disseminating emails from allies of Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aA bipartisan group of senators wrote a letter last month to Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, linking the election hacking and Russia\u2019s alleged violations of arms control agreements with Rosneft\u2019s position in Citgo.\u000a\u000aThe senators wrote that they are \u201cextremely concerned that Rosneft\u2019s control of a major U.S. energy supplier could pose a grave threat to American energy security, impact the flow and price of gasoline for American consumers, and expose critical U.S. infrastructure to national security threats.\u201d They urged Mnuchin \u2014 in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has to sign off on acquisitions of U.S. assets by foreign companies \u2014 to prepare for the prospect that PDVSA might soon default.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the event Rosneft were to acquire Citgo, we would expect a thorough, conflict-free and expedient review,\u201d the senators\u2019 wrote in their letter to Mnuchin.\u000a\u000aBennett had previously vowed that Avenue would not lobby for an entity that was averse to U.S. foreign policy interests \u2014 specifically singling out Russia and China \u2014 and he said that if Rosneft took control of Citgo, \u201cwe would resign immediately. Don\u2019t want that hassle.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen asked whether Venezuela was averse to U.S. foreign policy interests, Bennett said \u201cI don\u2019t work for Venezuela. I work for a Houston-based company that has three plants in America and produces 19 percent of America\u2019s gasoline. It\u2019s an American company, Americans work there.\u201d\u000a\u000aBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox.

Neither did the White House or Treasury.\u000a\u000aCitgo attracted attention last month, when it was revealed in a Federal Election Commission filing that the company donated $500,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, despite not having donated to recent presidential inaugurations.\u000a\u000aThe company has long employed established Washington lobbying firms and lobbyists, including Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and Cornerstone Government Affairs.\u000a\u000aBennett explained that Avenue\u2019s deal with Citgo was a subcontract with a company called VantageKnight that was started by a veteran lobbyist named Manuel Ortiz, who previously represented Citgo while working at Brownstein.\u000a\u000aOrtiz has deep ties on the Democratic side of the aisle, but no obvious connections to Trump\u2019s administration. He did not respond to requests for comment, but sources say he also brought in Avenue Strategies to lobby for the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which signed Avenue to a $125,000 contract covering the four months from March through June.\u000a\u000aVantageKnight was paid $270,000 during the first three months of the year to lobby for Citgo, according to filings with congressional oversight offices.\u000a\u000aThe filings indicate that Ortiz lobbied Congress and the Trump administration on the \u201cpotential impact of U.S. energy and foreign policy restrictions\u201d on Citgo\u2019s \u201coperations and valuation of assets,\u201d as well as \u201csanctions related issues.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVNEW YORK \u2014 America's reality TV president has made America face its reality, on TV.\u000a\u000aNow, civil rights leaders across the country worry what will come from Donald Trump's equivocation on racism and hatred\u2014and the country\u2019s struggle in the week and a half since Charlottesville to deal with a problem much bigger than a few hundred wannabe Nazis with Tiki torches. Civil rights leaders talk about deep, visceral fear about where this could lead, and not in the usual political \u201cconcern\u201d or \u201cobjections.\u201d They see a searing landscape of possibilities ahead: Riots. Violence at protests and counterprotests. Deep psychological and emotional damage, especially among children.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in a poisonous atmosphere that is being increased by the president of the United States. It\u2019s like turning on the gas in a room,\u201d the Rev. Al Sharpton told me, speaking for the latest episode of POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny match could lead to an explosion, and we\u2019re getting that kind of atmosphere from this president.\u201d\u000a\u000aInto the cauldron: Trump\u2019s rally in Phoenix on Tuesday night, which White House aides reportedly worry will stoke more tension even before he opens his mouth for a speech that few expect will do anything to change course or apologize.\u000a\u000aSharpton would like Trump to say he\u2019s sorry, to turn down the temperature. But he acknowledges that would probably be meaningless to him at this point.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s getting further and further and further away from being able to change his own narrative,\u201d Sharpton said.\u000a\u000aSharpton knows about protests, and he knows about Trump. He sat for the interview right after finishing his regular Saturday morning rally at National Action Network headquarters here in New York, just off Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem, where Korey Wise\u2014one of the wrongly accused Central Park Five for whom Trump called for the death penalty\u2014was in the crowd applauding vintage Sharpton lines like, \u201cMaybe the pope needs to send it back,\u201d a dig at Trump\u2019s giving Pope Francis a copy of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\u000a\u000aSharpton isn\u2019t the only veteran of decades of fighting with Trump who sees last week as a new frontier\u2014and now looking for new ways to take him on. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who made the future president\u2019s enemies list 30 years ago while he was still in the New York Assembly for holding up a development on the Upper West Side, said he was still shocked to see anti-Semitism encouraged from this White House, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s written a resolution that would make Trump the first president since Andrew Jackson to be censured.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf someone has no personal anti-Semitic or anti-black or racist feelings, but is willing to exploit those feelings for political advantage\u2014is that morally superior?\u201d Nadler said in a separate conversation for the Off Message podcast. \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible.\u201d (The censure resolution is not going anywhere: During a CNN town hall Monday night, House Speaker Paul Ryan said censuring Trump would be \u201cthe absolutely worst thing we should do,\u201d reasoning that Republicans joining with Democrats on this would be \u201csome partisan hackfest.\u201d)\u000a\u000aNew York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler (pictured) has authored a resolution to censure President Donald Trump for his comments about neo-Nazis. | Bridget Mulcahy/POLITICO\u000a\u000aBoth men see this as a critical, but not surprising, moment for American history.\u000a\u000aSharpton is holding a rally next week, a march from the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on Aug. 28. It\u2019s an annual event he organizes, but this year it seems to be taking on special significance\u2014and he\u2019s now stepping up both the number of expected participants and the amount of security accordingly.\u000a\u000aIn 2012, Sharpton accused Trump of peddling racism throughout his birther phase. They met in Trump Tower that November\u2014\u201cto apologize for calling me a racist\u2014very nice, apology accepted!\u201d was the @realDonaldTrump tweet, though the reverend himself said then and says now that he didn\u2019t call Trump himself a racist, and that he didn\u2019t apologize.\u000a\u000aSharpton still deliberately isn\u2019t calling Trump a racist, or an anti-Semite. \u201cI don\u2019t want to reduce this to that. His policies are there. That speaks for itself. If we make it personal, he wins,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cI used to call people names. Don\u2019t give people the easy way out.\u201d But, Sharpton added: \u201cI think he has empowered anti-Semites and racists. I think he has brought them from the shadows into the mainstream and I think he\u2019s emboldened them, and I think that\u2019s a dangerous course for the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aClick here to subscribe to the full episode, to hear Al Sharpton discuss his own learning curve on anti-Semitism and inclusion, Jerry Nadler on people he believes are racists in Congress, and both tell their own stories of encountering racism and anti-Semitism early in life.\u000a\u000aNadler thinks Trump should quit (though he points out, he\u2019s not technically calling for that), and he\u2019s authored a resolution to censure the president for his comments about neo-Nazis that he believes his Republican colleagues in Congress have a moral obligation to join.\u000a\u000aConsequences are about to arrive in the form of other legislation, he warned: The president\u2019s reaction to Charlottesville has hardened Democrats even further against providing votes to pass a budget or raise the debt ceiling, as they did when Republican infighting kept them from getting a majority on their own during the last few rounds. Put in a provision to defund Planned Parenthood, like in the 2013 shutdown, or to fund the border wall, Nadler says, and Democrats will walk away and not look back, even if that means not helping stop a potential economic collapse.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t give in to that kind of blackmail,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cWe\u2019re the minority. We have no leverage. When one party has control of both houses of Congress and the president, it\u2019s their responsibility. We will certainly help in any way we can, up to the point of doing terrible things.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for the Jewish aides to the administration who defend Trump, including his daughter and son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2014who\u2019s repeatedly knocked back charges of anti-Semitism against Trump by invoking his own grandparents\u2019 survival of the Holocaust\u2014Nadler says they need to get real.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t care what Jared Kushner said about the fact that Donald Trump loves, loves him and Ivanka and other people,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe was willing to traffic in anti-Semitism. He was willing to use anti-Semitic imagery. And then, when caught up in it, refused to repudiate it, and denied that it was what it clearly was.\u201d\u000a\u000aDespite his long history with Trump, Nadler said he can remember meeting the future president only once, just after the first plans were finalized for that Manhattan development they fought over. Sitting in his office in Trump Tower, Nadler recalled, Trump showed off how many buildings there were, and how the highest one was to be 150 stories.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s the highest floor people live on in New York? Nadler asked him. Trump said it was right there in Trump Tower, on the 68th floor, where his apartment is.\u000a\u000a\u201c\u2018Oh, and I assume you\u2019d live on the 150th floor?\u2019\u201d Nadler remembers asking him. \u201cAnd he says, \u2018Yes.\u2019 And I concluded [that] this was all about his wanting to be the tallest man in the world, or the highest man in the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut a story more painful for Nadler to discuss is his own history with anti-Semitism, including being threatened physically, as a college freshman, by a fellow student because he was Jewish. It shocked him, even in 1965, that he was being threatened at Columbia University in New York. \u201cI think when I was growing up we really thought a lot of it was gone,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aSharpton also told a story he rarely shares, about his own first encounter with racism. Like Nadler, he grew up in New York. He was riding with his family to see his grandparents in Alabama for Christmas. He was about 4 years old. In North Carolina, his father\u2014an amateur boxer who claimed to have once sparred with Sugar Ray Robinson\u2014stopped to buy them hamburgers.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe came back with his head down and my sister, and I said, \u2018What happened to the hamburgers?\u2019 He said, \u2018They won\u2019t serve us here.\u2019 And I never saw anybody humiliate or insult my father until then. I never saw my father the same,\u201d Sharpton said.\u000a\u000aIn 1991, Sharpton was stabbed while leading a protest in Brooklyn in 1991, and he looks at that scar every morning getting dressed\u2014and it reminds him of his father.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat I most remember is my invincible father couldn\u2019t make a guy sell us a hamburger in the middle of the night in North Carolina,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cSo I know and I feel the scars of disempowerment based on race.\u201d\u000a\u000aSharpton has his own checkered history full of accusations of anti-Semitism. He bristles when those are brought up, saying that it\u2019s usually willful misinterpretation by others seeking division, though some is reflective of his own learning curve.\u000a\u000aTo him, the imperative now is for people who are offended to stand united against Trump and refuse to play into the violence or debates like the one over the Confederate monuments, because he says that\u2019s what Trump wants.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s feeling a mix of emotions.\u000a\u000a\u201cConcerned because you wanted to think we were beyond that. Challenged because you can\u2019t give up because had we given up before, we would have never made the progress we\u2019ve got,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that that kid that watched his daddy couldn\u2019t buy a hamburger was sitting on the platform watching Barack Obama be sworn in as president. So I\u2019ve seen too much to give up.\u201d

aVItaly's far-right Northern League may need to soften its anti-euro stance in order to enter into a governing coalition with Forza Italia | Miguel Medina/AFP via Getty Images Italy\u2019s Northern League goes soft (on the euro) The Italian far-right party wants to be back in government and is softening its line on Europe to get there.\u000a\u000aItaly\u2019s far-right Northern League is eyeing a return to government next year, taking advantage of a surge in support in local elections over the summer.\u000a\u000aHowever, if it wants to join a coalition with its old ally Silvio Berlusconi, the Northern League may have to soften its tough line on Europe \u2014 and especially on the single currency, long a bugbear of the Italian right.\u000a\u000aThe shift is already happening. Party leader Matteo Salvini \u2014 who\u2019s spent years campaigning against the single currency (and occasionally wearing a T-shirt saying \u201cBasta euro\u201c) \u2014 appears to have changed his tone.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to POLITICO last week, he didn\u2019t attack the single currency or even the EU, instead saying \u201cwe want to give Europe one last chance, but in return we want to see real change, especially when it comes to Schengen and the Dublin treaty\u201d \u2014 the two EU treaties that regulate cross-border movement in the bloc.\u000a\u000aLibero, an Italian daily that follows the Northern League\u2019s line, described Salvini\u2019s comments (first reported in Brussels Playbook) as \u201ca small shift in foreign policy,\u201d with the party moving \u201cfrom euro-nihilism to Euroskepticism.\u201d It said that shift has become more marked since Marine Le Pen\u2019s defeat in the French presidential election.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s method behind the change in attitude.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s realpolitik,\u201d said Paolo Grimoldi, a Northern League MP who has known Salvini since they were teenagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the 51 percent of votes [needed to govern alone] and it\u2019s not very clear how to leave the euro.\u201d\u000a\u000aGrimoldi said a softening of the party\u2019s anti-euro position would be needed to form a coalition with Berlusconi, the controversial former prime minister whose Forza Italia party is key to setting up a united center-right front.\u000a\u000aIn all three Berlusconi coalition governments, he has found a place for the Northern League and that will be the case again if talks to create a center-right bloc succeed. When the Northern League was in power in the past, it didn\u2019t have a clear anti-euro line, which has emerged since Salvini took over the leadership.\u000a\u000aTo court Salvini, Berlusconi has even been floating the idea of a double currency: using the euro for international transactions and the old Italian lira internally. Marine Le Pen had a similar proposal, but it didn\u2019t fly with French voters.\u000a\u000aIf a third party is needed for a center-right-led coalition, it would likely be the far-right Brothers of Italy, a small group with roots in Italy\u2019s fascist past, and there could be room for some small, moderate parties.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s the Northern League that is in pole position when it comes to creating a new center-right coalition, especially after being the only big party to make gains in June\u2019s local elections. That would make the League \u201cthe engine\u201d of a governing coalition, wrote Istituto Cattaneo, a political research institute, commenting on the local elections\u2019 results.\u000a\u000aLofty ambitions\u000a\u000aSalvini doesn\u2019t just want to prop up the old warhorse Berlusconi. This admirer of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin wants to be prime minister \u2014 and he could achieve that ambition if his party gets more votes than Berlusconi\u2019s. (The tycoon, who turns 81 next month, won\u2019t be prime minister anyway, as a conviction for tax fraud means he cannot be elected to parliament).\u000a\u000aSince becoming leader in 2013, Salvini has saved a party that was on the brink of collapse in the wake of a corruption scandal that brought down his predecessor and party founder Umberto Bossi. (The scandal hasn\u2019t completely gone away; a tribunal recently ordered the party to refund the Italian state to the tune of \u20ac48 million.)\u000a\u000aHe has succeeded in turning the Northern League from an anti-migrant party that wanted to split from the poorer Italian south into a stronger force that campaigns against the euro (and still doesn\u2019t like migrants), and has no qualms about forging ties with the likes of the neo-fascist Casa Pound activist group.\u000a\u000aIt helps that he\u2019s young \u2014 44 \u2014 and charismatic. Almost always casually dressed, Salvini is a regular on TV talk shows and in gossip magazines where he makes headlines for his colorful love life.\u000a\u000a\u201cI will be the candidate [for prime minister], not [European Parliament President Antonio] Tajani, not Berlusconi. The party with the most votes gets to choose and so far that party is the Northern League,\u201d he told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aTo get the top job, he\u2019ll have to elbow his way past Tajani, a schoolmate of current Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, and a long-term Berlusconi ally.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe candidate for premier that Berlusconi thinks of, in case of victory, remains the president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani. Soft, prudent, institutional: the Paolo Gentiloni of the center-right,\u201d political analyst Marco Damilano wrote last month.\u000a\u000aSalvini\u2019s change of tone will have wider implications for Italian politics. Another potential governing party, the anti-establishment 5Star Movement, has often been accused of ambiguity on the single currency. The Northern League\u2019s less harsh language may force the 5Stars \u2014 neck-and-neck with Matteo Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party in the polls \u2014 to take a firm line one way or the other.\u000a\u000aAfter a year in which the far-right fell short of its ambitions to govern across Europe, and with the eurozone enjoying sustained growth, Salvini\u2019s new stance could just be smart politics.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday, from an electorate point of view, it pays a bit less to denounce these problems [with the euro],\u201d said Northern League MP Grimoldi.

aVLast weekend, as more than 9,000 alumni descended on Lynchburg, Virginia, for Liberty University\u2019s homecoming weekend, much went as expected. The carnival atmosphere was pervasive\u2014boosters offered free hayrides around campus, young families could let their kids run off some energy on the bounce-houses set up on the quad, and on Saturday afternoon, the football team won big. At the homecoming parade, bands marched, members of a hip-hop dance troupe donned Trump and Clinton masks, and University President Jerry Falwell Jr. sat on the back of a red convertible and threw candy to his constituents along the parade route.\u000a\u000aDespite the happiness and cheer, though, an uncomfortable and urgent question hung over the campus, as it has for several months: What to do about Donald Trump?\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe candidate has profoundly split Liberty, the largest Christian university in the world, and a political linchpin of American religious right. Trump\u2014a thrice-married, womanizing TV personality and billionaire who has spoken ill of some minority groups and immigrants and routinely bragged about his poor treatment of women\u2014is perhaps the least Christian Republican presidential candidate in generations. With his sordid personal history and ambivalence about Judeo-Christian morals, Trump has hewn deep divides in the evangelical community between those who support his campaign and those unable to vote for him in good conscience.\u000a\u000aPerhaps nowhere is this more acutely felt than at Liberty, where Trump has spurred debates not only about the merits of his candidacy, but about free speech and free inquiry on a campus dedicated to a conservative Christian education.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs perhaps the least Christian Republican nominee in generations, Trump has deeply divided the evangelical community.\u000a\u000aEarly in the 2016 Republican primaries, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Trump\u2014he\u2019s the candidate\u2019s most famous evangelical supporter, bar none\u2014a move that mystified many of the believers in Liberty University\u2019s orbit. Falwell has consistently maintained that his views shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as representing those of Liberty University itself. But many in Liberty\u2019s community of boosters, academics, alumni and students see in Falwell\u2019s remarks a double standard over who has the ability to freely voice their conscience.\u000a\u000aA member of the Board of Trustees who criticized Trump and questioned Falwell\u2019s endorsement of him was pushed into resigning. In the student newspaper, the Liberty Champion, a student-penned column criticizing Trump\u2019s grotesque \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d comments about women was preemptively censored at Falwell\u2019s request (that writer has since resigned). And Liberty\u2019s faculty \u2014 all of whom work without the possibility of tenure\u2014are reluctant to speak out, with many fearing retribution and the loss of their positions.\u000a\u000aQuietly, often anonymously and in private, students and faculty are speaking out\u2014many in condemnation of Trump, and a smaller group in opposition to Falwell and the direction he\u2019s led Liberty.\u000a\u000aSerious arguments about Republicans are rare at Liberty. In 1980, Ronald Reagan visited a week before the presidential election to voice his support for prayer in public schools (President George H.W. Bush did the same in a 1990 visit). It\u2019s where Senator John McCain came in 2006 to make peace with evangelical leaders ahead of his run for the presidency in 2008. It\u2019s where Mitt Romney reaffirmed his belief in traditional marriage the same week President Barack Obama announced his own support of same-sex marriage in May 2012.\u000a\u000aSince its founding, the twin cornerstones of Liberty University have been its indivisible commitments to the basic tenets of Christianity and conservative politics. And now, for the first time, the world\u2019s largest Christian university is grappling with whether and how it\u2019s possible to go about those commitments if they\u2019re divorced from each other.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aCompared with the presidents of other colleges, Jerry Falwell Jr. wields outsized influence over his campus. In large part, that\u2019s because of his namesake: the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a titan of Christian conservatism, the mandarin who founded Liberty University in 1971 and the Moral Majority in 1979.\u000a\u000aFor more than three decades, Rev. Falwell inhabited a singular role in America\u2019s evangelical life, but in the broader secular world, he was a flypaper for controversy, defined to many by his most outlandish statements\u2014as when he warned that one of TV\u2019s \u201cTeletubbies\u201d was gay, or, most notably, his September 13, 2001, comments explaining the fresh wounds of the 9/11 attacks as the result of God\u2019s righteous anger prompted by abortionists, feminists, gays, lesbians and the ACLU, among others.\u000a\u000aRev. Jerry Falwell with Ronald Reagan in 1984 (upper left), with Senator Ted Kennedy in 1983 (lower left), and in a 2006 photo taken at Liberty University (right). | AP Photos\u000a\u000aWhen Rev. Falwell died in May 2007, at age 73, his two major roles were split between his two sons: Rev. Jonathan Falwell became the pastor of Thomas Road, the Baptist church the elder Falwell founded in 1956; Jerry Jr. inherited the presidency of Liberty University.\u000a\u000aSince then, Falwell Jr. has rapidly grown the university\u2019s presence and influence. Over the past nine years, the size of the residential student body has swelled from 9,600 to roughly 14,000, and 113,000 students take courses online. This growth\u2014combined with a vigorous fundraising effort\u2014has reaped a huge financial windfall. When Rev. Falwell passed away in 2007, the university\u2019s net assets amounted to roughly $100 million; Today, its assets are valued at more than $1.6 billion.\u000a\u000aOn the back of this enormous success, Falwell\u2019s clout on campus has outgrown its already prodigious scope. And that power has made it virtually impossible to voice opposition.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSince 2007, Falwell\u2019s clout on campus has only grown, and that power has made it virtually impossible to voice opposition.\u000a\u000aWitness the case of Mark DeMoss. For years, DeMoss was a member of Liberty University\u2019s board of trustees and chaired its executive committee. DeMoss\u2019 conservative evangelical bona fides are unimpeachable. He served as an aide (and, ultimately, chief of staff) to Rev. Jerry Falwell, a man DeMoss cites as his \u201cpolitical mentor\u201d and likened to being \u201ca second father\u201d after the death of his own father\u2014who was himself a Falwell associate and is the namesake of DeMoss Hall, the Ionic-columned, 500,000-square-foot academic hub of Liberty\u2019s campus. DeMoss is a Liberty graduate whose expertise in public relations for faith-based organizations has netted him clients ranging from Billy Graham\u2019s Library and Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University to Chick-fil-A. In both 2008 and 2012, he was an adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaigns.\u000a\u000aBut this spring, he stepped out of bounds: He crossed Jerry Falwell Jr.\u000a\u000aIn a March 1 article in the Washington Post, DeMoss was quoted saying that he disagreed with Falwell\u2019s endorsement of Trump, a candidate who, in DeMoss\u2019 eyes, does not represent the \u201cChrist-like behavior that Liberty has spent 40 years promoting with its students.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe blowback against DeMoss was swift. Falwell reportedly believed that DeMoss\u2019 motives for speaking to the media were entirely political, and that he was, in DeMoss\u2019 words, \u201ca political pawn of rival campaigns.\u201d DeMoss insisted that he was speaking out \u201cnot to score political points against Trump, but to give voice to scores of Liberty alumni, faculty and supporters who feel queasy about the school\u2019s new connection to Trump.\u201d (In an email to Politico, Liberty refused to confirm or deny DeMoss\u2019 characterization.)\u000a\u000aOn April 25, DeMoss resigned from Liberty University\u2019s board of trustees, citing a \u201cconcern about a lack of trust.\u201d (This, again, at his alma mater, a college whose main building is named after his dad.)\u000a\u000aLiberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\u000a\u000aThe move already has had a chilling effect on campus. \u201cWhatever the truth may be behind that situation,\u201d one professor said in an email, \u201cit does leave the impression that speaking too forcefully or too directly about such issues could, at a minimum, lead to professional complications, unwanted scrutiny, or simply a loss of favor that might decrease one's chances of receiving a career advancement opportunity that would have otherwise been given.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen there\u2019s that kind of culture, a sense of fear surrounding what might happen if you speak up\u2014that\u2019s why faculty have trouble with it,\u201d says Dustin Wahl, one of the students behind Liberty United Against Trump, an open letter and online petition that has been signed by thousands of people in the Liberty community.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhen there\u2019s that kind of culture, [there\u2019s] a sense of fear surrounding what might happen if you speak up,\u201d says one Liberty student.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the months since Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed him, Donald Trump has been inexorably associated with Liberty University,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cWe are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement, and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.\u201d\u000a\u000aWahl says the point of the statement \u201cwas to show the world that there is diversity at Liberty University.\u201d The letter has more than 3,000 signatures, he says, though he can\u2019t say with certainty how many of those represent current Liberty students. More than half of the signatures came from people with official Liberty addresses, but some of those could be alumni accounts. And, for that matter, some students may have signed using private email accounts, like Gmail.\u000a\u000aFalwell, who claims he is \u201cproud\u201d of the students for speaking their mind publicly, says the letter hasn\u2019t gotten much traction around campus. One professor I spoke with echoed him: \u201cI see no evidence that the student protest has reached more than a handful of people,\u201d adding that any claims of \u201cdivision\u201d or \u201cturmoil\u201d on campus are untrue. \u201cIt's all blown completely out of proportion in the media \u2026 as usual,\u201d wrote the professor.\u000a\u000aAnother professor, however, says the administration has no way of knowing how many students and faculty share the letter\u2019s concerns, and notes that there is no process through which Falwell could ever learn that. Make no mistake, the professor told me: Faculty members are quietly cheering about the student revolt.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aFalwell is aware of the tension, and in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this year, he seemed to acknowledge that a lot of people associated with Liberty do not share opinions.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny time you support a candidate, and you\u2019re an official at a university, you just to have to accept the fact that a large percentage of the community is not going to agree with you,\u201d Falwell said, adding that political disagreement isn\u2019t really an issue on Liberty\u2019s campus. In fact, Falwell often commends his student body for its willingness to engage diverse viewpoints. He proudly contrasts Liberty with other schools, like Virginia Tech and Brandeis, who have canceled speakers because of student unrest.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think our community is mature enough that they understand that all the administrators and faculty have their own personal political views,\u201d Falwell concluded.\u000a\u000aCertainly, they do\u2014but what are those views?\u000a\u000aShortly before a speech on campus by Donald Trump in January 2016, Liberty students voice their consciences through prayer and respectful protest. | AP Photos\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been under the belief for years [that] staff aren't allowed to do interviews without authorization,\u201d one faculty member told me. \u201cIt is the policy of the university for questions / comments from the media to be handled through our LU Marketing Department,\u201d wrote another. And another: \u201cI can\u2019t be quoted on this. Even anonymously.\u201d And another: \u201cI thought through your request and decided I just can\u2019t go on the record.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose faculty members who agreed to speak with Politico Magazine did so on condition of anonymity; no Liberty faculty member quoted in this article will be identified by name unless otherwise noted.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile conservatism and Christian values are held in high esteem by the overwhelming majority,\u201d wrote one professor, \u201cdifferent faculty and staff members fall on a reasonably wide spectrum of how to put those principles into action and the extent to which various aspects of conservatism and Christianity should be instantiated in politics.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis year, I cannot in good conscience vote for the Republican presidential candidate,\u201d says one professor. \u201cThe very obvious moral hypocrisy of supporting a man like Trump won't be lost on the larger culture,\u201d says another. Several faculty members pointed out the hypocrisy of Christians who are quick to forgive Trump for his \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comments, and yet continue to hold Bill Clinton\u2019s indiscretions over his head. Christian support for Trump shows \u201cthat the Republicans control the evangelical vote instead of vice versa,\u201d one professor writes. \u201cBy voting for a man who is EXACTLY like the people they claim to be opposing, I think they're acknowledging their subservient status and opening themselves up for legitimate moral derision.\u201d\u000a\u000aThose faculty members who said they were going to vote for Trump tended to view him as little more than a way to stop Hillary Clinton. \u201cI'm not pro-Trump, but will do almost anything to keep Hillary from getting elected,\u201d says one professor. \u201cI fear for religious freedom and the future of institutions like Liberty. I do not agree with Jerry's enthusiastic support of Trump, and I'm suspicious of claims that [Trump] has had a recent conversion experience. But I do see Jerry's reasoning, and I think he has a business sense that most of us will never understand.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn interviews and emails with me, faculty were quick to voice their moral opposition to Trump and their disappointment with Falwell\u2019s decision to endorse him.\u000a\u000aIn interviews and emails with me, faculty were quick to voice their moral opposition to Trump and their disappointment with Falwell\u2019s decision to endorse him. None of the faculty I spoke with said that they plan to vote for Clinton, even though, according to one professor, she is \u201cpretty obviously the better choice.\u201d The handful of those who said they are supporting Trump claim to be doing so only reluctantly or for \u201cpragmatic\u201d reasons.\u000a\u000aFrom my conversations, it seemed that there is a good deal of political diversity among Liberty\u2019s faculty \u2014 which might explain why several professors were so eager to speak with me, even if it were on condition of anonymity. Still: why all the secrecy?\u000a\u000aAfter receiving mixed messages from faculty about Liberty\u2019s policy for contact between faculty and the media, I went to find its exact wording: \u201cAny request for information from an outside media organization or any request for comment from any outside party regarding the University in any regard whatsoever should be referred to the President or the President\u2019s authorized designee.\u201d It\u2019s a rule rather sweeping in scope, and seems to insist that the university must be involved whenever a faculty member speaks with a journalist.\u000a\u000aIn an email to Politico Magazine, Liberty University\u2019s lead counsel, David M. Corry, characterized the policy somewhat differently. \u201cFaculty and staff do not need permission to speak with media,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut there are special rules about using their affiliation with Liberty University,\u201d including informing Liberty\u2019s administration no more than three hours after any contact takes place, and explicitly communicating to the interviewer that their views do not reflect the university\u2019s.\u000a\u000aFollowing these rules, Corry added, \u201cis especially important when statements are made either in support or in opposition to a candidate for elected office,\u201d because Liberty is a 501(c)(3) organization. That status prohibits the university from taking an official political position, and Corry says its media guidelines for faculty were created to protect its status. That may well be the case, but how then to explain Jerry Falwell Jr. being introduced as the president of Liberty University when he spoke at the 2016 GOP convention\u2014a speech in which he talked about working to \u201crestore Liberty University to financial health,\u201d and said that Trump can do the same for the nation?\u000a\u000aJerry Falwell Jr. speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. | Getty Images\u000a\u000aFaculty I spoke with suggested that Falwell is insincere in claiming his views cannot be confused with those of the university. On one hand, a professor wrote, Falwell has the right to express his opinions as a private citizen. But on the other, \u201cHe is the highest-profile representative of Liberty University, and everything he does and says will reflect, in one way or another, on the values and principles of this institution. I think it is fair for others to exercise their rights to make theological and pragmatic criticisms of his political statements.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFaculty I spoke with suggested that Falwell is insincere in claiming his views cannot be confused with those of Liberty University.\u000a\u000aAnother professor referred me to a section in the faculty handbook, typeset in bold for emphasis: \u201cAll employees of the University are expected to conduct themselves in matters of language and morality in a manner compatible with the Mission of the University and The Liberty Way. Unsuitable conduct may be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Liberty Way is the university\u2019s manual for its students, faculty, and staff. It describes in detail how everyone affiliated with the school should behave, dress, speak, etc. The reason for the manual is also explicitly stated: Every person associated with the university \u201cshould avoid any activity, on or off campus, which would contradict the university\u2019s mission or purpose, compromise the testimony or reputation of the university.\u201d In other words, it is the official position of Liberty University that the behavior of its students, faculty, and staff is clearly a reflection of the entire institution\u2019s morals.\u000a\u000aWhich is precisely why one faculty member I spoke with suggested that Falwell was disingenuous: If the administration is so concerned about its reputation when it comes to the actions of a faculty member or student, then why isn't it even more concerned about how its reputation is affected by its president\u2019s public comments?\u000a\u000aEvangelical blogger Warren Throckmorton, who regularly writes about Christian higher education, offered a similar thought. \u201cI wonder why it is acceptable to the Liberty board for Jerry Falwell to endorse a candidate as an individual not speaking for the university, but it is not fine for a board member [Mark DeMoss] to express an opinion as an individual not speaking for the university.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cJerry Falwell, Jr. would not have the public platform to speak as he does without the university and all the staff and students who have made it great,\u201d one professor wrote me. \u201cPart of the sacrifice of leadership should involve giving up some of his own freedoms in order to be a better steward of the public image of the university and the thousands of people associated with it. \u2026 It is fair for faculty, staff, and students to argue that he should voluntarily restrict his free speech on this issue because his words will reflect on Liberty University and ultimately on us.\u201d\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aDustin Wahl, co-author of Liberty United Against Trump, claims to have had \u201cprivate contact with faculty\u201d about his open letter. Faculty members are supportive, he says, but \u201cwant to remain anonymous.\u201d\u000a\u000aI asked Wahl whether there were any concerns around campus about publicly rebuking President Falwell. Wahl, echoing Falwell, says that Liberty values academic freedom, and he feels free to speak his mind\u2014but notes an important caveat.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a rational fear of President Falwell doing something against them. People have joked about it, like, \u2018I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re even still going here!\u2019 But that\u2019s not really the fear: There\u2019s a sense among students that you don\u2019t want to disagree with a position of leadership because it feels wrong to a lot of students.\u201d Wahl says some classmates privately told him that they wanted to sign his letter, but decided that because they were in positions of student leadership, \u201cit would be wrong to disagree with hierarchy.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Wahl doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s irrational to fear repercussions from administration. \u201cFalwell has proven himself to have incredibly thin skin when it comes to disagreement. The fact is, the chairman was asked to resign because he gave his opinion,\u201d he says, referencing the resignation of Mark DeMoss.\u000a\u000aSeveral faculty members contacted for this story referenced DeMoss, suggesting worries that publicly opposing Falwell could cost them their jobs. However, both Corry and Len Stevens, the school\u2019s media relations manager, say such concerns are baseless.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf [faculty] are fearful, they shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Stevens wrote in an email to Politico Magazine, capitalizing the first word. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd yet, despite such assurances from Liberty\u2019s administration, fear persists.\u000a\u000aFor the faculty, part of the reason for this stems from the fact that Liberty does not offer tenure. All employment is at-will, an arrangement clearly proclaimed in the handbook: \u201cLiberty University and employee each remain free to terminate their employment relationship, with or without advance notice for any reason or for no reason at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs a professor, anything that could distantly affect your job security is a very high-stakes game,\u201d said one faculty member, citing the general lack of jobs in academia.\u000a\u000aHans-Joerg Tiede, associate secretary of the department of academic freedom at the American Association of University Professors, cites this as a clear example of why university professors need tenure. Having read Liberty\u2019s media policy, Tiede considers it \u201can interference in faculty members\u2019 academic freedom,\u201d adding that Liberty is not the only school guilty of this. \u201cWe certainly define academic freedom [to include] the freedom to speak to the press.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, the AAUP does have a slightly different concept of academic freedom for religious institutions, provided these \u201climitations\u201d to full academic freedom are disclosed to the faculty member at their hiring. \u201cBut these would be restrictions that relate directly to religious doctrines,\u201d says Tiede\u2014not political views.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor many in the Evangelical world, the line between the religious doctrine and political beliefs isn\u2019t so clean.\u000a\u000aBut for many in the Evangelical world\u2014including many at Liberty, whose founder created the Moral Majority\u2014the line between the religious doctrine and politics isn\u2019t so clean. Is abortion a religious or political issue? How about same-sex marriage? War? The refugee crisis? For the last several decades, evangelicals have approached these and other issues as both political and religious concerns. Casting a vote was as easy as identifying the candidate who shared that approach\u2014and for conservative Christians in the mold of Rev. Jerry Falwell, that has often meant supporting conservative Republicans.\u000a\u000aWith Trump, though\u2014a thrice-married, womanizing TV personality who has spoken ill of some minorities and immigrants and routinely bragged about his poor treatment of women\u2014that choice isn\u2019t so clear.\u000a\u000aIn the world of conservative Christians, there are leaders who have denounced Trump\u2019s politics and questioned his character. Among the first was Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, who wrote in January that \u201cTrump\u2019s vitriolic \u2014 and often racist and sexist\u2014language about immigrants, women, the disabled, and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons, not just the \u2018winners\u2019 of the moment, are created in God\u2019s image.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf course, other evangelical leaders\u2014Falwell, Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Franklin Graham\u2014have remained steadfast in their support of Trump, even after the release of the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, showing Trump vulgarly bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent.\u000a\u000aFrom January 2016: Jerry Falwell Jr. appears with Trump for a campaign event in Iowa. | AP Photos\u000a\u000aTheir continued support for Trump has been noticed and condemned by other evangelical leaders, especially women. \u201cTry to absorb how acceptable the disesteem and objectifying of women has been when some Christian leaders don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal,\u201d wrote Living Proof Ministries founder Beth Moore shortly after the tape came out.\u000a\u000aIt all adds up to a fracturing of the evangelical vote, which, as Laurie Goodstein recently noted in the New York Times, is \u201clikely to reshape national politics for years to come.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut on a smaller scale, this confusion about who is and isn\u2019t allowed to speak for evangelicalism is playing out at Liberty University. Falwell endorses Trump, and some on campus speak out to say he doesn\u2019t speak for the school. Falwell then speaks out to say that those individuals don\u2019t speak for the school. Faculty take to social media to reassure their networks that they don\u2019t share Falwell\u2019s political values. Journalists ask faculty to discuss their views\u2014and we\u2019re back to Falwell, perhaps the only person on campus who does not need to request his own permission to speak publicly about his personal political views.\u000a\u000aAll things considered, it seems correct to say that Liberty technically allows all of its faculty and students to speak to anyone they wish, about anything they wish. It also seems correct to say that many faculty and students don\u2019t feel as though this is the case in practice. In fact, several contacted me after we\u2019d first spoken to again confirm that I would protect their identities.\u000a\u000aI asked Corry what he makes of faculty\u2019s reticence to speaking on record. His conclusion is that it is a \u201cself-imposed\u201d silence based on faculty members\u2019 own mistrust of mainstream media. \u201cThe media's tendency to twist words and spin an interview would explain [faculty] reluctance to speak to a reporter while feeling free to post on Facebook and Twitter, where they have complete control over their messages,\u201d Corry wrote in an email. \u201cThere is a long history of people from Liberty being misrepresented in the press and this reality is likely the greatest single reason for Liberty employees staying away from interactions with reporters.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo be fair, many in the Christian community do believe that reporters don\u2019t seem terribly concerned about fairness or accuracy in representing conservative religious people. But in the dozens of interactions I had with Liberty faculty in reporting this story, the prevailing concern I heard wasn\u2019t about media bias, it was about Falwell and Liberty\u2019s administration.\u000a\u000aCorry\u2019s remarks about the dishonesty of reporters was disconcerting because, well, I\u2019m a reporter, and they seemed like a coy way of undermining the story I was asking him to comment on. His remarks echoed many of Trump\u2019s own complaints about the media\u2019s dishonesty. The actual words Corry used gave the impression that he was inviting me to read between the lines.\u000a\u000aThere was a similar subtext to the university\u2019s official response to DeMoss\u2019 resignation: \u201cIndividual board members have varied reasons for their displeasure regarding Mark DeMoss\u2019 comments to the Washington Post, most of which are not related to his disagreement with Jerry Falwell\u2019s personal endorsement of Donald Trump or a belief that Mark DeMoss\u2019 motivations were entirely political. Liberty would prefer to not inventory or detail all these reasons.\u201d The suggestion here is that contacting the Post was merely one in a long list of DeMoss\u2019 indiscretions, but that Liberty was going to take the high road and not go into all of them. In the same interview, Falwell spoke about the criticism he faced for inviting Romney to speak on campus in May 2012. \u201cI took a lot of heat having someone from the Mormon faith speak at Liberty, but I did it because Mark lobbied hard for it.\u201d The suggestion here is that DeMoss is behaving like a hypocrite.\u000a\u000aA similar subtext appeared in the school\u2019s response to Falwell\u2019s axing of a student op-ed that was highly critical of Trump. After outlining several reasons why the piece was killed, Corry said, \u201cThe University is at a loss for why [the student author] seems to have not recalled or understood these facts and circumstances.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd then there was what some took to be a dig from Falwell directed at the \u201cLiberty United Against Trump\u201d student protest: \u201cThis student statement seems to ignore the teachings of Jesus not to judge others, but they are young and still learning.\u201d\u000a\u000aPerhaps most troubling of all was Corry\u2019s request that I share with the school the list of faculty members who were reticent to speak with me. That way, he assured me, the university would be able to contact them, \u201cclarify the ground rules, and underscore that they are free to speak about their preferred or un-preferred candidate as private citizens without retribution from the University.\u201d (I declined to provide him the list.)\u000a\u000aThe trouble with subtext is that it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s really there. But we can pretty easily talk about the context that all of these remarks are happening within.\u000a\u000aLiberty University has always pretty clearly been associated with Republican candidates, thanks to its founder\u2019s involvement with conservative politics. The current president is the son of that founder, and is a vocal and consistent supporter of a candidate many see as antithetical to many of the core tenets of Christianity. Though many non-tenured faculty oppose Trump privately, any who wish to address the issue publicly are required to inform the office of the president\u2014a man who has compared Trump both to his late father and King David.\u000a\u000aLiberty\u2019s faculty have read their contracts. It seems many of them have also read between the lines.\u000a\u000aBrandon Ambrosino is a writer living in Delaware. His pieces have appeared in the New York Times, Boston Globe, The Atlantic and the BBC, among others.

aVSalespeople at Pyongyang\u2019s premier car dealership wait patiently beside racks of glossy brochures in a showroom filled with that unmistakable new car smell from a couple dozen Whistle sedans and Cuckoo SUVs \u2014 all bearing the distinctive, double-pigeon logo of Pyonghwa Motors, North Korea\u2019s only passenger car company.\u000a\u000aThe streets of Pyongyang are more crowded than ever, but Pyonghwa, whose sole factory just south of the capital was designed to produce as many as 10,000 cars a year, appears to be stuck in neutral. Experts say just about everything its pigeon hood ornaments are attached to these days comes straight from China.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am afraid that since November 2012 there has not been any production of a Pyonghwa vehicle,\u201d said Erik van Ingen Schenau, an expert on the Chinese automobile market and author of a book documenting North Korean vehicles. \u201cThe newer models with the Pyonghwa badges are all Chinese-made.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf any assembly is being done locally, it is likely very small scale \u2014 such as putting on tires, inserting batteries or finishing the cars\u2019 interiors, he said. Recent satellite imagery on Google Earth shows no cars in the lots around the factory.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea\u2019s passenger car market is, at best, nascent.\u000a\u000aProduction and resources have always been focused on military vehicles or trucks rather than passenger cars, which outside of Pyongyang are still few and far between and well beyond the means of all but the most elite citizens. To further complicate matters, U.N. sanctions announced in March last year have made it harder for North Korea to get the parts needed for its assembly lines.\u000a\u000aPyonghwa itself is a remnant of a less-tense time, when South Korean investment aimed at improving ties through economic engagement was encouraged \u2014 in this case as a joint venture with the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church.\u000a\u000aIt was the first and is probably still the only company allowed to use billboard advertisements.\u000a\u000a\u201cPyonghwa Motors will take the lead in building a bridge between South and North,\u201d former CEO Park Sang Kwon, a Korean-American who spearheaded the effort from the South to create the company, said in a statement on its website, which hasn\u2019t been updated since 2012.\u000a\u000aThe promise of Pyonghwa, which means \u201cPeace\u201d in Korean, sputtered and stalled as relations between Pyongyang and Seoul soured and the North embarked down its path of becoming a nuclear power.\u000a\u000aProduction of a Pyonghwa version of the Fiat Siena began at its Nampo plant in 2002, with 137 vehicles assembled from component \u201ckits\u201d shipped in from abroad. Output peaked in 2011, when the plant assembled 1,820 vehicles, then soon crashed when the South Korean side of the venture pulled out.\u000a\u000aA chart showing the release years of Pyonghwa\u2019s 12 models is posted on a wall at the dealership \u2014 and stops abruptly at 2010. The company displayed 36 cars, trucks and pickups at the Pyongyang Spring International Trade Fair in 2013, but van Ingen Schenau, who is director of the France-based China Motor Vehicle Documentation Centre, said all were Chinese.\u000a\u000a\u201cMost of them were made by FAW in Changchun or FAW-Volkswagen,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aFAW \u2014 First Auto Works \u2014 is one of China\u2019s \u2018big four\u201c state-owned auto makers. With its headquarters in Jilin Province, adjacent to the North, the state-owned FAW Group is particularly well-placed to tap into the North Korean market.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s by no means the only player in the game.\u000a\u000aPrivate auto maker Hawtai Motor Group is one of the most visible, supplying hundreds of cars for the burgundy and gold fleet of \u201cKKG\u201d taxis that began appearing in Pyongyang in 2014. Another Chinese brand, BYD, flooded the city\u2019s streets with cars for a competing fleet of green and yellow taxis in 2013.\u000a\u000aLocally produced Sungri and Taepaksan trucks increasingly are being replaced by secondhand Chinese Dongfeng, FAW-made \u201cLiberation\u201d trucks and Yuejin vehicles. Two of Pyonghwa\u2019s more recently introduced showroom models have been identified as rebranded Beijing Auto products.\u000a\u000aThe streets of Pyongyang offer some insights into the state of the North Korean economy.\u000a\u000aBlack Mercedes limousines for senior officials and blue Volvos \u2014 North Korea famously bought, but failed to pay for, 1,000 of the Swedish cars in 1974 \u2014 are a common sight. Trams, some built in the former Czechoslovakia, and trolleys are another. The Pyongyang Trolleybus Works recently introduced the 170-passenger Chollima 091, with Chinese axles.\u000a\u000aThere is a considerable flow of long-haul buses, trucks and smaller vehicles that transport people and goods around for a fee. The practice isn\u2019t openly approved of by the government, but it\u2019s become a commonplace entrepreneurial side-business.\u000a\u000aStiffer pressure on Beijing to clamp down on trade with Pyongyang could crimp the growth in traffic. But if sanctions and political instabilities can be overcome \u2014 two very big ifs \u2014 Chinese capital could start up where South Korea\u2019s Pyonghwa experiment left off.\u000a\u000aFAW seemed to be heading in that direction when in 2013 it was widely reported to have signed a memorandum of intent to build a factory in Rason, a special economic zone near the Russian and Chinese borders.\u000a\u000aBut like many planned projects in the North the status of the plant is uncertain.\u000a\u000aCompany officials were not immediately available for comment. BYD and the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers also had no comment.\u000a\u000aSign up for our newly-designed weekly newsletter\u000a\u000aLike us on Facebook\u000a\u000aFollow us on Instagram and Twitter\u000a\u000aReport Typo/Error

aVThere's apparently no better way to stick it to the most powerful man in the world than by sending your own diploma back to your alma mater.\u000a\u000aBut to Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., the handful of students trying to return their diplomas to the nation's largest Christian college are just \u201cgrandstanding to gain five minutes of fame.\u201d\u000a\u000aA small group of Liberty graduates told NPR over the weekend they are sending their diplomas back to the university because of Falwell's continued support of Trump in the wake of the violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cI'm sending my diploma back because the president of the United States is defending Nazis and white supremacists,\u201d Chris Gaumer, a former Student Government Association president and 2006 graduate, said. \u201cAnd in defending the president's comments, Jerry Falwell Jr. is making himself and, it seems to me, the university he represents, complicit.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt should be noted that on Sunday, Falwell spent about seven minutes of a roughly 10-minute interview on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d condemning the KKK sympathizers, neo-Nazis and white nationalists who participated in the Charlottesville riots, where one woman \u2014 32-year-old Heather Heyer \u2014 was killed and dozens more were injured.\u000a\u000aSome students, though, seemed to take issue with Falwell's initial praise for Trump, as he called the president's statements on Charlottesville \u201cbold\u201d and \u201ctruthful\u201d:\u000a\u000aFinally a leader in WH. Jobs returning, N Korea backing down, bold truthful stmt about #charlottesville tragedy.So proud of @realdonaldtrump \u2014 Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) August 16, 2017\u000a\u000aThe truth as stated by @realDonaldTrump is that violent white supemacists, Nazi, KKK and similar hate groups are pure evil and un-American. \u2014 Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) August 17, 2017\u000a\u000aTrump faced criticism from the right and the left for blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for the violence in Charlottesville, which is about an hour away from Liberty University's sprawling Lynchburg, Virginia, campus.\u000a\u000aIn a statement to Independent Journal Review, Falwell described the students' decision to return their diplomas as \u201cnothing but a joke and a publicity stunt.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlex Wong/Getty Images\u000a\u000a\u201cShame on the media for even reporting,\u201d he told IJR. \u201cIf the graduate doesn't like Donald Trump, he should just state that he went to Liberty University and he doesn't like that one of Liberty's leaders supports the president.\u201d\u000a\u000aFalwell went on to say it \u201chas absolutely no effect\u201d for students to send their diplomas back because the degrees were earned. The university \u201cwill not revoke them or 'take them back,'\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe vast majority of administration and faculty at Ivy League schools supported Barack Obama,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe are all entitled to our opinions as Americans.\u201d\u000a\u000aFull disclosure: I'm a Liberty graduate and, for what it\u2019s worth, I plan on keeping my diploma because, regardless of who Falwell supports, I worked hard for my degree.\u000a\u000aFalwell was one of Trump's earliest evangelical supporters. He endorsed Trump in January 2016, breaking from other Christian leaders who, at the time, were concerned about the billionaire candidate's brazen rhetoric, marital history, and past support of abortion.\u000a\u000aIn May, Trump gave his first commencement address as president at Liberty, where he thanked evangelical Christians for their support on Election Day.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wanna thank you because, boy, did you come out and vote \u2014 those of you that are old enough; in other words, your parents,\u201d he said. "Boy, oh boy, you voted. You voted!\u201d

Vladimir Putin was a disaffected young KGB officer; as president of Russia a mere decade later, he would call the Soviet collapse \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aDonald Trump, meanwhile, spent August 1991 trying to dig out of a financial hole so big it had the New York Times jokingly comparing him to the Soviet Union. \u201cBoth the developer and the country,\u201d the newspaper wrote, \u201care motivated by the same impulse: survival.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump made it through that crisis even if the Soviet Union did not, and now he and Putin are an unlikely pair at the pinnacle of world power\u2014and yet both are obsessed still by questions of their own political survival amid crises internal and external.\u000a\u000aFor this week\u2019s Global POLITICO, we offer a special edition on Trump and Putin, Russia and Russiagate, at a time when the country looms as large as ever in American politics.\u000a\u000aVeteran Russia hands Angela Stent and Dan Yergin\u2014Stent is a former U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia; Yergin, a Pulitzer-winning historian and expert on the geopolitics of energy\u2014argue that it may loom too large, noting that even many anti-Putin Russians find themselves puzzled, as Stent put it, \u201cabout the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aInstead, Yergin argues, developments like Russia\u2019s \u201cpivot east\u201d to China\u2014what some are calling a new \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d\u2014has been little covered, as has the scrambling of the economic prospects for Russia\u2019s heavily oil-and-gas-dominated economy, now that the shale revolution has turned the United States into a global energy powerhouse on the same level as Russia and Saudi Arabia.\u000a\u000aAnd Putin may be weaker than he looks from the outside, Stent adds. The political foundations of his authoritarian regime more than 17 years into his reign, she argues, bear watching headed toward his presumed 2018 reelection. Regime insiders with whom she\u2019s spoken, Stent says, are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the election and whether a Putin win will be seen as legitimate, given Russia\u2019s heavily rigged system and penchant for running up the total in certain regions to implausible 90 percent-plus tallies.\u000a\u000aNo one doubts another term is Putin\u2019s for the asking, since the one potential candidate seen as a genuine potential opponent, anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, is technically barred from running. But protests among young people have been spreading through Russia this year and, as Stent notes, few have any idea what agenda Putin plans to pursue assuming he is granted another six-year presidential term, one that would make him Russia\u2019s longest-serving leader since Stalin.\u000a\u000aIn a separate conversation, investor Bill Browder talks about what it\u2019s like to be the man in the middle of the story behind the U.S. sanctions that infuriated Putin\u2014sanctions that, as Browder explains, were almost certainly what Putin\u2019s envoys were discussing with Trump\u2019s son and campaign advisers at the now-famous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller.\u000a\u000aRepealing the Magnitsky Act sanctions, named for Browder\u2019s murdered lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, Browder argues, is \u201cthe most important thing in the world\u201d for Putin and the Russian government insiders who are on the sanctioned list.\u000a\u000aOf course, those sanctions remain in place today\u2014and the U.S. Congress has just voted to impose additional new sanctions on Russia in response to the 2016 election hacking\u2014seven months into a Trump presidency that has the world very much confused about just what America\u2019s policy is toward the strongman in the Kremlin.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Russia policy in the United States,\u201d Stent says. \u201cWe have at least two, if not more.\u201d One recent survey, she notes, even found a \u201cmajority of Europeans now believe that Russia at least is a more predictable power and has a more stable leadership than the United States does.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cUnpredictable may be an understatement,\u201d says Yergin.\u000a\u000aAnd in fact, Yergin saw that firsthand himself last week; a member of Trump\u2019s advisory council of business leaders, Yergin recounted in the interview how the group decided to disband itself after Trump\u2019s equivocation over a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was, Yergin notes, very much \u201ca comment about what\u2019s happening to our politics.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne thing on which they all tend to agree with Trump is that relations between the two countries are at a low point 26 years after that last fateful August for the Soviet Union. Things are \u201cfrigid, antagonistic, confrontational,\u201d Yergin says.\u000a\u000a\u201cCold War 2.0,\u201d Stent says.\u000a\u000aYergin isn\u2019t sold on that. \u201cMaybe the phrase we should use is a breakdown,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd a breakdown between the world\u2019s two major nuclear powers is something to be very concerned about.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aFrom Russia \u2026 to Russiagate: a special Global POLITICO this week. We\u2019ll look at whether America and Russia are really doomed to clash on the world stage, how we got Putin so wrong\u2014and what\u2019s next for the Kremlin leader. And of course we\u2019ll talk Trump and his strange obsession with Putin. And how it\u2019s led not to one Russia policy for the United States\u2014but many conflicting ones.\u000a\u000aMy guests this week offer a master class in the subject. Angela Stent heads Russian studies at Georgetown University; before that, she was the national intelligence officer for Russia during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, our chief U.S. intelligence analyst in effect trying to understand Putin\u2019s Russia. Dan Yergin is one of the world\u2019s premier experts on energy, vice chairman of IHS Markit and Pulitzer-winning author of The Prize and The Quest and a true expert on Russia as one of the world\u2019s leading petrostates. They are also, by the way, the first husband and wife dynamic duo we\u2019ve had on The Global POLITICO.\u000a\u000aI learned so much in our conversation\u2014which covered everything from Russia\u2019s new strategic alliance with China to the tough new competition it faces from the United States on the global energy markets. We heard Angela\u2019s report from Moscow that regime insiders are in fact quite worried about Putin\u2019s seemingly guaranteed reelection next year. So is it a new Cold War? Are we Russian hands too obsessed with making Putin and his country a boogeyman in American politics today?\u000a\u000aBut first we have part one of our special Russia episode. We\u2019ll hear about Russiagate from a key player, Western investor Bill Browder, whose push for a sanctions bill named after his dead lawyer Sergei Magnitsky might have started the whole Russian lobbying campaign of Donald Trump in the first place.\u000a\u000aSusan Glasser: I\u2019m Susan Glasser and welcome back to The Global POLITICO. Our guest again is Bill Browder. I was trying to think of a concise way of introducing him. I guess the most concise way I can think of is to say Bill was probably the very first person, I think, outside of maybe a random Russian pundit, that I interviewed when I moved to Moscow in January of 2001. He, at the time, and now as well, is the CEO and founder of Hermitage Capital Management. At the time, the largest outside investor in Russia. This was in a very different context in January of 2001, when both of us thought a little bit differently about Vladimir Putin.\u000a\u000aBill Browder: Yeah. Well, a lot of people remind me that I was a Putin fan in the early days, and I was. Maybe more than you were, in fact. I think you\u2019re being polite.\u000a\u000aGlasser: I did write a whole story, I believe, called \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s Apologists.\u201d No, but I wanted to understand the case, and I believe I quoted you in it.\u000a\u000aBrowder: I was definitely, in the early days of Vladimir Putin, thinking he was a good guy. Part of it was based on naivete, of course. But part of it was based on the fact that he had replaced Yeltsin, who had basically let Russia become a chaotic, oligarchic state; where 22 guys owned the whole country, and everybody else ate dirt, and lived in poverty. Yeltsin was drunk, and disorganized, and letting the whole thing sort of turn into a Mad Max type of world.\u000a\u000aAnd so I, along with everybody else, was hoping for some kind of order to come around. Putin was this, at the time, this fresh-faced technocrat. Nobody really knew what he was saying, but he wasn\u2019t drunk, and he seemed to be\u2014he spoke a little bit of English. So the idea was, or the hope was, that he was going to restore order in Russia, and it was all going to sort of normalize. And I actually believe from the first couple of years of his presidency, he didn\u2019t have the same sense of bravado and self-confidence that he has right now. And so he was\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: \u201cThe appetite grows while eating\u201d is an old Russian phrase.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Yes. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. But in his case, he didn\u2019t have absolute power, and he didn\u2019t have that much self-confidence. One could make a case, based on what he was doing, that he was sort of a technocrat, doing the right thing, reforming the economy. And so for some time, I was a fan.\u000a\u000aAnd I was also a fan because he was starting to crack down on the oligarchs who were, in my mind, the biggest source of all trouble. And I thought he was going to return the power of the oligarchs\u2014the power that the oligarchs had taken from the president\u2014back to the state.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, that\u2019s right. In fact, the first time that we talked, it wasn\u2019t in the context of Vladimir Putin, as I remember it, but in the context of your crusade at the time\u2014you\u2019ve always been a crusader, it seems to me, in a way\u2014about the lack of accountability and transparency at Gazprom, the state natural gas monopoly. And you had a very impressive financial presentation about the misuse of resources in Gazprom, which had reached almost epic scale.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Well, you\u2019re being very polite calling them misuse of resources. The absolute brazen theft and stealing.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, epic misuse of resources. That\u2019s right. But that was our first encounter. And the reason I bring it up is because, flash forward, obviously, all these years later. We met in Putin\u2019s Moscow at a time when we didn\u2019t quite know what Putin\u2019s Moscow was. I\u2019ve seen you almost all the time. You know, every year, I think, since then, along the way. But I don\u2019t think either one of us ever anticipated that we would be meeting again in Donald Trump\u2019s Washington.\u000a\u000aWhere you have been here, testifying on Capitol Hill about the unbelievable convergence, in effect, between what\u2019s happened to you in your business, in your professional life, and the electoral integrity of the United States; questions about foreign lobbyists and how they operate here; questions about what kind of Russian intelligence operation was being launched in 2016; have somehow amazingly and bizarrely converged with the fight that you\u2019ve been waging.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Right. I found myself right in the middle of every single one of these issues. And perhaps for your listeners, we should fast-forward a little bit, and outline the story of how I got to this crazy moment right now. So, as you said, I was exposing corruption at companies like Gazprom, and guess what? The guys who were stealing the billions of dollars weren\u2019t so happy about me exposing it. I was kicked out of the country in 2005. All this terrible stuff started happening. My offices were raided. The police seized all of our documents. I ended up hiring a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky to investigate.\u000a\u000aSergei discovered that the reason that they had seized our documents was to steal $230 million of taxes that we had paid in the previous year, in a highly complex fraud. But Sergei, my lawyer, and I were so convinced that this must be a rogue operation because at the time I still had these illusions that Putin was a nationalist. He might not have been, at that point\u2014this was 2005\u2014I had kind of gotten over the fact. I no longer thought he was honest, but I thought that maybe he was still a patriot.\u000a\u000aAnd the idea that that $230 million of tax money could be stolen, I thought he wouldn\u2019t like that. And so we publicized the scandal.\u000a\u000aSergei then testified against these, what we thought were rogue officers involved. And we waited for the good guys to get the bad guys, and that would be the end of the story. And it turned out that in Putin\u2019s Russia, there are no good guys. Six weeks after Sergei testified, he was arrested by the same people he testified against. He was put into pretrial detention. He was then tortured in pretrial detention to get him to withdraw his testimony.\u000a\u000aThey put him in cells with 14 inmates and eight beds; left the lights on 24 hours a day to impose sleep deprivation. They put him in cells with no heat, and no windowpanes, in December in Moscow, so he nearly froze to death. They put him in cells with no toilet, just a hole in the floor where the sewage would bubble up.\u000a\u000aAnd they were doing all this stuff because they wanted him not only to retract his testimony, but they wanted to get him to sign a false confession to say that he stole the $230 million, and he did so on my instruction. And Sergei, while he was just a tax lawyer\u2014wore a white shirt, and a red tie, and blue suit, and got a Starbucks in the morning\u2014when they threw him in jail, and they thought he would buckle in a week, it turns out that they found a man of absolute integrity who refused to buckle under any circumstances.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, he documented all of this and was able to pass it out to you, which is how you got this information. So now, he got his name on an act here, passed by Congress. You learned a lot about Washington in the process of basically reinventing your career and your business around\u2014\u000a\u000aBrowder: Human rights.\u000a\u000aGlasser: \u2014righting this wrong.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Well, let me just interject one thing. They killed him. Let\u2019s not forget, they killed him. They tortured him and they killed him.\u000a\u000aGlasser: A young man in his 30s.\u000a\u000aBrowder: He was 37 years old. He left a wife and two children. He was killed on the 16th of November, in the evening. I got the call at 7:45 a.m. on the 17th of November. And it was by far the most heartbreaking, life-changing, terrible, terrible phone call I could have ever gotten. Sergei Magnitsky was killed because of me. If he hadn\u2019t been my lawyer, he\u2019d still be alive today. He died at the age of 37, and I just, to this day, just can\u2019t process that.\u000a\u000aThe only way that I can really go on from day to day, in my own life, was when I made the decision very quickly after that that I was going to go out and get justice for Sergei. And I was going to reorient my whole life, put aside everything else I was doing, and go after the people who killed him, and make sure they face justice.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So what on earth does Sergei Magnitsky have to do with Donald Trump?\u000a\u000aBrowder: So in my quest for justice, first of all, I should point out that there was no chance of getting justice in Russia. Vladimir Putin circled the wagons and exonerated everybody involved, gave special promotions and state honors to the people who were most complicit. And so I came to America. I came to Washington. And I told the story of Sergei Magnitsky to Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican.\u000a\u000aI said, \u201cCan we freeze the assets and ban the visas of the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky?\u201d And they said yes. As a result, we ended up with something called the Magnitsky Act, which does exactly that. It freezes assets and bans visas. And it doesn\u2019t just apply to the people who killed Sergei. It applies to people in Russia who do all sorts of other similar, terrible things.\u000a\u000aIn December of 2012, President Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law. And all of a sudden, Vladimir Putin went out of his mind. Vladimir Putin, who thought that he could control things both inside and outside his country, found a situation which was completely out of his control. He went out of his mind partially because he personally is at risk of having his $200 billion of wealth frozen. He\u2019s the richest man in the world.\u000a\u000aGlasser: When you say he went out of his mind\u2014let\u2019s just be clear for the listeners\u2014his retaliation for the United States passing the Magnitsky Act was?\u000a\u000aBrowder: He banned adoption of Russian orphans by American families. And let me just give a little color to that because it\u2019s important. It sounds pretty horrible as it is. It\u2019s much more than horrible. The previous 10 years or so, the Russians had a big program of Americans adopting Russian children. However, they didn\u2019t let the Americans adopt the healthy ones. They basically took the unhealthy ones, the children with heart conditions, with Down syndrome, with HIV, with spina bifida, and they allowed them to take those children. And Americans came to Russia, in large numbers.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Yes, you and I both knew every time you would get on the airplane back to the United States, it would be filled with children.\u000a\u000aBrowder: The Delta flight was filled with these uncertain parents, and these crying children as they were all getting used to each other. But these parents would come with open hearts, and open minds, and big love. They would take these children in and they would nurse them to health. It was a very successful program.\u000a\u000aVladimir Putin looked around to say, \u201cHow can I retaliate against the Magnitsky Act, which I hate?\u201d And first he looked at freezing assets of American banks in Russia, and realized that the retaliation would be the freezing of Russian assets in America, so he couldn\u2019t do that. They then even considered closing the supply routes, or the exit routes, for American military equipment out of Afghanistan. They realized that if they did that that Americans would stop their supplies into Syria.\u000a\u000aAnd they said, \u201cWhat can we do that the Americans can\u2019t retaliate on?\u201d They said, \u201cThey love adopting our children. Let\u2019s just\u201d\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: And by the way, that was clearly a hasty decision on Putin\u2019s part. This gets forgotten a lot.\u000a\u000aBrowder: What makes this so incredibly heinous is that the children who were being adopted could not get the medical care they needed in Russia, that they were getting in America. The orphanages were very poor in Russia. And so, effectively, Putin was sentencing orphans to death in order to retaliate against American\u2019s sanctioning him and his corrupt officers.\u000a\u000aThat actually had a huge negative impact in Russia. I can remember right after they announced that, the Russians called it Herod\u2019s law. Herod is a famous character in the Bible who kills the children in Israel. And that\u2019s what they called it. And like 100,000 people\u2014and these were not the normal demonstrators. These were like schoolteachers, and doctors and so on\u2014went out into the street to demonstrate. And Putin was very surprised.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And it was at a time of threat to Putin\u2019s rule, which is relevant to this whole question not only of his response to the Magnitsky Act, but also to his response to the American election. Why he hated Hillary Clinton so much. Why they might have intervened in our election. This moment in time, when your Magnitsky Act was passed here in the U.S. Congress, was a moment when Putin faced unprecedented demonstrations against the continuation of his regime.\u000a\u000aHe was returning to the presidency after allowing Dmitry Medvedev to be his placeholder for a term, and he sat out as the prime minister, and Medvedev was the figurehead president. He announced he was going to return, and there were really serious demonstrations.\u000a\u000aBrowder: In Russia, because it\u2019s such a prison-yard mentality, you show disrespect, and then that gives everybody else the feeling that they can show disrespect. That\u2019s when the whole thing falls apart for the president.\u000a\u000aHere was a situation where everybody was starting to show him disrespect. When I say everybody, I mean a few hundred thousand people. And it just carried on from there. And so, as you said, there was all this, for the first time, demonstrations as Putin had come back into the official role of the president. He viewed, rightly or wrongly\u2014certainly, wrongly\u2014that somehow all these demonstrations were being organized by Hillary Clinton and the State Department.\u000a\u000aGlasser: That\u2019s right. He publicly blamed her for it. He also blamed Obama for the Magnitsky Act, even though they were somewhat reluctant, as I understand it.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Somewhat reluctant is an understatement. The Obama administration tried every possible trick to get in our way, to stop the Magnitsky Act from passing. And it only passed because of the way the U.S. Constitution is written; that the legislative branch, when acting in concert, has more power than the executive branch.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, it really is an irony, actually, of the politics of where we find the politics of Russia in Washington today; that at the time, it really was the Democratic administration that was concerned about its hands being tied with Russia, and not wanting to\u2014\u000a\u000aBrowder: Indeed. But getting back onto where does it all fit in with Donald Trump. Anyways, so Putin got crazy about the Magnitsky Act. He really doesn\u2019t like it. He doesn\u2019t like it because his own money is potentially at risk. He also doesn\u2019t like it because his whole system of kleptocracy, of stealing money, how did he get his $200 billion\u2014which we\u2019ll talk about in a minute. He gets it from, effectively, extortion, coercion, etc. He gets it from oligarchs and other people. Anyone who doesn\u2019t cooperate gets arrested, tortured and possibly even killed.\u000a\u000aThe people who do all the arresting, torturing and killing, in order for them to do so on an industrial scale, they have to be guaranteed impunity. There\u2019s 10,000 people that work for him. And historically, they could do all these terrible things to people and nothing would happen. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, because of Sergei Magnitsky, this law is passed, which basically creates a consequence. A real, serious consequence to people, which means that their assets that they\u2019ve gotten will be frozen offshore, and they can\u2019t travel. That makes the whole system of kleptocracy not work the way it worked before.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Okay. So when we hear the word \u201cadoption,\u201d and we hear the word \u201cTrump Tower,\u201d and we hear the word \u201cmeeting,\u201d they weren\u2019t really talking about adoption.\u000a\u000aBrowder: There was nothing to do with adoption. That\u2019s a code word for sanctions, and sanctions repeal. So Putin goes on this major fight to get the sanctions repealed. And he tries everything. He tries everything. He tries to coerce people. He makes threats. He does all this type of stuff, and it\u2019s not working.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, Putin began a sort of Washington political campaign in order to get the Magnitsky Act repealed. He does so through a woman named Natalia Veselnitskaya.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And when was the first time you heard of Natalia Veselnitskaya?\u000a\u000aBrowder: Well, I knew about Natalia Veselnitskaya as far back as 2014, because she was a Russian lawyer representing a Russian oligarch, whose assets were frozen and seized by the Department of Justice, in the United States, in New York, because they were connected to\u2014the money had come from the crime that Sergei Magnitsky had exposed and was killed over.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So they were directly connected to Magnitsky?\u000a\u000aBrowder: They\u2019re directly connected to the Magnitsky case. They were culprits of receiving the money. And they were under indictment.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So she surfaced as the lawyer?\u000a\u000aBrowder: She surfaces as the lawyer. She\u2019s basically been deputized by the Putin regime since she\u2019s in that place anyways, not just to do the legal defense on the money, but to repeal the Magnitsky Act. And so what does she do? Well, she\u2019s, by the way, got an unlimited budget. I\u2019ve never seen somebody throw so much money around so freely. She\u2019s got an unlimited budget, and she goes out and then hires a sort of general contractor for the project. This is sort of frizzy-haired guy. A former Russian intelligence, or Soviet intelligence, officer named Rinat Akhmetshin.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Another person who I\u2019m sure our listeners have now heard of because he also attended the famous meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Exactly. So Rinat\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: When did you hear of him?\u000a\u000aBrowder: I only heard about him in 2016. So I heard about her in 2014. He emerges onto the scene\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t say emerges onto the scene. I would say he\u2019s a shadowy character. His fingerprints start showing up in places as early as early 2016. He is a former GRU officer. GRU is military intelligence. I should also point out that after the hacking of the election, when Obama imposed sanctions, one of the organizations he imposed sanctions on was the Russian GRU.\u000a\u000aSo Rinat Akhmetshin was a former GRU officer who had immigrated to the United States, naturalized, but continued to effectively be loyal to the Russian government. There was one further person, whose name is Anatoli Samochornov.\u000a\u000aGlasser: The translator.\u000a\u000aBrowder: The translator. And I\u2019ve seen him, because he was accompanying Natalia Veselnitskaya all over the world. Her anti-Magnitsky campaign wasn\u2019t just limited to the United States. She was traveling all over the world, at the European Parliament, and various other places.\u000a\u000aBrowder: This project was going on in 2016. So she\u2019s running around. She gets Akhmetshin in Washington. And Akhmetshin, who\u2019s an insider in Washington. He knows his way around the corridors of power like nobody else. He then, with her pocketbook, and her budget, goes out and hires Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, a guy named Chris Cooper of Potomac Square Group, former Wall Street Journal reporters. He hires Ron Dellums, a former Democratic congressman. A firm called Cozen O\u2019Connor, which is a guy named Howard Schweitzer, who\u2019s a former Ex-Im Bank employee.\u000a\u000aAnd then with this team of people, they then fan out across Capitol Hill, and try to get Congress both to repeal the Magnitsky Act, which is a pretty big lift, but they also wanted to get Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s name deleted from the Global Magnitsky Act, which was just under consideration at the time. They even found one congressman, a guy named Dana Rohrabacher, a representative from Orange County, California, who\u2019s known to be Putin\u2019s favorite congressman. Anyway, so they go around trying to get Sergei\u2019s name removed from the Global Magnitsky Act. This guy introduced it.\u000a\u000aGlasser: This is all in the spring of last year?\u000a\u000aBrowder: This was all April through June of last year.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So while Donald Trump is rolling up primary victories and emerging as the overwhelming front-runner for the Republican nomination, saying favorable things about Putin, questioning the sanctions publicly, this lobbying campaign is simultaneously occurring here in Washington?\u000a\u000aBrowder: That\u2019s right. And then, on June 9th, Natalia flies in from Russia. She\u2019s got to be in court earlier in that day because we\u2019re in the process of disqualifying her lawyer, a guy with a funny name, John Moscow, for ethical violations because he had been our lawyer, and then switched sides to become her lawyer.\u000a\u000aSo she was in court on his behalf because he was about to be disqualified in the appeals court. And then after that, she runs over with this whole cast of dodgy Russians over to Trump Tower, to meet with Donald Trump Jr., to meet with Jared Kushner.\u000a\u000aBrowder: It was June 9th. And then after June 9th, they come back to Washington. And they have this movie. It\u2019s an anti-Magnitsky movie. Very high budget, high production value, documentary, which is a Putin propaganda film, basically trying to turn the whole Magnitsky story on its head. They organize a screening at the Newseum in Washington, which is supposed to be the museum of free speech and journalism.\u000a\u000aThey invite members of Congress, members of the State Department, journalists. They get Seymour Hersh to introduce it. And Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS character, is running around trying to get different journalists to write about it. The movie\u2019s basic premise was that Sergei Magnitsky actually wasn\u2019t murdered, that he just died of natural causes, that it was nobody\u2019s fault. And that Sergei Magnitsky wasn\u2019t a whistleblower; that he was actually a criminal, and that I, Bill Browder, had lied to Congress about Sergei Magnitsky. That was the premise of the movie.\u000a\u000aAnd so they put this movie on. They were not successful in getting any articles written. A bunch of Russian opposition activists showed up and jeered, and challenged him at every step of the way at the end of the movie. And it didn\u2019t have the impact that they wanted it to have. And Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s name was never taken off the Global Magnitsky Act.\u000a\u000aAnd so their entire operation failed, completely and absolutely, and all money was wasted. But that\u2019s sort of beside the point because we got a first-hand look at who these people were.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, right. And of course, at the time, did you have any understanding that they were simultaneously seeking to influence the Republican candidate for president?\u000a\u000aBrowder: I had no idea. Having said that, it didn\u2019t surprise me when I learned it because they were lifting up every stone, knocking on every door, trying to figure out where they could get some kind of positive treatment. And of course, it would seem plausible that if the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, who\u2019s been saying nice things about Putin, why wouldn\u2019t they go to him and give it a shot?\u000a\u000aGlasser: And Paul Manafort was already involved in the campaign at that time?\u000a\u000aBrowder: Paul Manafort was there. Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner were all in the meeting. They showed up with one ask, which was, \u201cIf your dad becomes president, can you repeal the Magnitsky Act?\u201d\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, it\u2019s interesting that they\u2019ve all basically acknowledged it by saying that adoption was discussed. I find it very interesting that President Trump himself said that he recently, at his face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin at the G-20, he also volunteered, in fact, in his interview with The New York Times, that adoption came up.\u000a\u000aBrowder: Nobody was talking about adoption. What they care about is the sanctions. That was the conversation. And reference to adoptions is a code word for that. One shouldn\u2019t be mistaken about that.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So how do you interpret the convergence of your Magnitsky Act story and this Trump investigation? And was that related to the election hacking, in your view, or were these separate Russian intelligence operations?\u000a\u000aBrowder: I have no idea. All I really know is what I know from the surface and from the evidence. And the evidence is that there was a big initiative to get the Magnitsky Act repealed. And we\u2019ve seen that from all sorts of direct and indirect evidence. So what\u2019s the big question? The big question is we know what the Russians wanted, we just don\u2019t know what they were ready to offer in return. That\u2019s the big question.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re going to know everything eventually. The beautiful thing about these situations where\u2014I mean, you had so many different people. Nobody wants to get into trouble. We\u2019re going to know absolutely every detail, and every piece of paper that was left, and every email that was sent, and every thought of the individuals in that meeting. So it\u2019s just a matter of time before it all comes out, and to find out whether this is something significant, or this was just a really bad judgment meeting that these people had.\u000a\u000aGlasser: When you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee recently, you said, \u201cThis is Vladimir Putin\u2019s single most important foreign policy priority.\u201d I want to push you on that. More important than Syria? More important than Ukraine?\u000a\u000aBrowder: A hundred times because it affects his personal money. You know, all this other stuff, these are all sort of political activities. Why is he in Syria and Ukraine? He\u2019s there because he needs to have some enemies to fight a war to keep everybody distracted. This affects his own money. You have to understand these people kill for money. They killed a lot of people to get that money. And if someone wants to take it away from them, that\u2019s the most important thing in the world for them.\u000a\u000aGlasser: You\u2019ve been here in Washington, and there is a sense of, kind of, Russia fever. A lot of Republicans, even ones who are skeptical of Donald Trump, will say, you know, \u201cThis is hysteria on the part of Democrats. This is all about just getting Trump out of office.\u201d Is the Russia investigation, in your view, something that should be taken seriously? Are Trump\u2019s opponents just being hysterical?\u000a\u000aBrowder: Well, let me just challenge you on your assumption. There was a vote for sanctions on Russia to tie the president\u2019s hands so that he can\u2019t ever change those sanctions. And there\u2019s only three people in the House of Representatives that voted against it, and two people in the Senate. I mean, there\u2019s absolute unanimity in the legislative branch of the U.S.\u000a\u000aGlasser: It\u2019s one of the only bipartisan things there is right now.\u000a\u000aBrowder: And it\u2019s absolutely almost unanimous. People want to take that power away from the president because he said all the stuff about Russia. That\u2019s pretty compelling. That tells you really where their head is at.\u000a\u000aGlasser: OK. And my final question. If you got Donald Trump under oath, and Bob Mueller designated his investigatory powers to you, what are the three questions you would ask the president?\u000a\u000aBrowder: I wouldn\u2019t ask the president any questions. I would read out loud my book, Red Notice, to him. And once he heard the whole story, maybe he\u2019d change his mind about whether Putin\u2019s a good guy or not.\u000a\u000aGlasser: All right. We\u2019ll leave it at that. Bill, it\u2019s very good to see you. It\u2019s amazing to me that our paths are intersecting 16 years, I guess, maybe or more since we first\u2014\u000a\u000aBrowder: You look exactly the same.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So do you. No, it\u2019s an incredible story, and I think Senator Lindsey Graham said today, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it if it was written down in a novel. You\u2019d send it back.\u201d But you know, here we are, and we\u2019ve gone from Putin\u2019s Moscow to Trump\u2019s Washington. So thank you for joining us here at POLITICO\u2019s offices, and we will look forward to having you back when we know what the next chapter in this book brings.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aAnd now for part two of this week\u2019s Global POLITICO, a master class in Russia with Angela Stent and Dan Yergin. Dan and Angela, as I mentioned, are not only among America\u2019s preeminent experts on Russia, they also happen to be married. They\u2019ve taught me much over the years about Russia the petrostate, how the United States has looked at it.\u000a\u000aThey raise some important questions about where Russia\u2019s at today\u2014and our own current obsession with it. As with Bill Browder, I talked with them about the question of whether and how we misread Vladimir Putin, and just what they think is going to happen with American policy toward Russia now that Donald Trump is president\u2014and proposing a reconciliation with Russia that his own party in Congress is more or less absolutely opposed to.\u000a\u000aSo thanks to Dan and Angela for joining us on The Global POLITICO.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Angela, you were the national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, yes?\u000a\u000aStent: Yes.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Dan, you can\u2019t write about energy without thinking an awful lot about Russia and how it fits into the world today. So I just noticed the cover of the new National Interest, a publication you contribute to, Angela, for September: Are Russia and the United States doomed to conflict with each other? What do you guys think?\u000a\u000aStent: Well, I actually have one of the pieces in that issue of The National Interest. And essentially what I said is we have a fundamentally different view of the world; we have fundamentally different interests. But we are in some ways doomed to cooperate because there are some issues like the nuclear arsenal, like nuclear nonproliferation, where we are the two nuclear superpowers. And if we don\u2019t work together, then the world is a much more dangerous place.\u000a\u000aThere are conflicts like the one in Syria where, again, we have to work together to avoid further exacerbation of the conflict and hopefully find some way of a more lasting cease-fire. And then there\u2019s the conflict in Ukraine, where we at least have to talk to each other, even though we\u2019re not making much progress there. So we aren\u2019t inevitably doomed to conflict, but what we have to, I think, understand is that there are fundamental ways in which we\u2019re never going to see eye to eye, and at this\u2014can at best be a sort of limited partnership where we work together on issues where we have narrowly defined similar interests, and where we will probably agree to disagree and continue to disagree for a very long time, certainly as long as Russia continues to have the kind of political system it does.\u000a\u000aGlasser: What do you think, Dan?\u000a\u000aYergin: Well, I think first I should note that Angela talked about a limited partnership, and that is the title of her book, The Limited Partnership, about U.S.-Russian relations, so an interesting observation.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Which by the way, is a lot more clear-eyed than either the sort of grand sweeping partnership that people occasionally propose, or the Russia and the United States as intractable enemy that you will inevitably be locked in mortal combat with until the end of days.\u000a\u000aYergin: Well, Susan, as you and Peter know from your own work on Russia, it was not inevitable that we would have this degree of estrangement. And if you go back, you can say, \u201cWell, why?\u201d After all, there isn\u2019t the ideological conflict. Russia is not the Soviet Union. Its population is only half of it. Its GDP is perhaps the size of Spain or something along those lines. How and why has this come about? And I think that probably this latest phase really began when Edward Snowden went to Moscow and the summit got canceled between Obama and Putin. And from there on, the sort of channels of communication broke down. Ukraine happened, the sanctions happened, Russia pivoted to the east to China.\u000a\u000aAnd then of course, you get to the 2016 election and the Russian interference, which the intelligence community is very strong about. And so it\u2019s now gone down past that, and new sanctions that seem to make it very difficult to get back to a kind of a more working relationship. And it\u2019s amazing that Russia, which is not the Soviet Union, is not leading a communist revolution, should loom so large in our international relations when we have other really serious issues that need to be dealt with.\u000a\u000aGlasser: I think you\u2019re totally right about that. We\u2019re obsessed with Russia in a way that I can\u2019t remember ever.\u000a\u000aStent: I was in Russia a few months ago talking to Russians, both those who I would say are more supportive of the government and those who aren\u2019t. And all of them, to a man and woman, said, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand why you Americans are so obsessed with what Russia may or may not have done.\u201d They said, \u201cYou\u2019ve now made us into this colossus, as if we kind of control what\u2019s happening in the United States. You\u2019re really attributing to our leadership, to the Kremlin, to Putin, whatever, much greater power than we think they have.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd they sort of said, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand such a great country like the United States, most powerful country militarily in the world, why do you have so little self-confidence? Why are you\u2014you think that we can destroy your democracy.\u201d So there\u2019s a real puzzlement there about the extent to which now Russia has been made into this kind of boogeyman in the United States, as if they really have the power to destroy our democracy.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Both of you, I don't know if it\u2019s for the same reason or a different reason, expressed concerns about the sanctions bill that was just passed by the U.S. Congress. Now, this was obviously a very significant measure, if only because it probably represents the most significant example of Congress seizing the initiative from a president on a foreign policy issue of major concern since, really\u2014some people argue since the Reagan era and the imposition of sanctions against South Africa. It was 98-2 in the Senate; it was obviously a very significant statement by the Republican-dominated Congress that they weren\u2019t willing to see the president of their own party take policy in a direction. And yet, interestingly, many of the Europeans who also have many concerns about President Putin, were also concerned about this sanctions bill.\u000a\u000aYergin: Yes, I think that there are a couple of reasons. I mean what is the purpose of sanctions? Sanctions are meant to be leveraged, that you can use to achieve objectives. Once you lock sanctions into law as opposed to presidential discretion, then you lose that ability. It becomes a domestic political issue and it takes away the flexibility that this president or the next president may have to adjust relations.\u000a\u000aI think one of the Russians pointed out that these were sanctions, as he put it, not merely on the Russians, these were sanctions on President Trump, because it reflected a lack of trust on President Trump to manage this relationship. The European reaction to it was, first of all, don\u2019t do unilateral sanctions, because they usually don\u2019t work. They create conflict. Secondly, some of the things were the U.S. saying to Europe, \u201cWe know what your energy security needs and problems are, and we\u2019re going to intervene to affect them.\u201d And the Europeans say, \u201cWell, wait, it\u2019s our energy security. Let us determine that.\u201d I mean, should Brussels, should the EU, pass sanctions on pipelines in the United States? I mean that kind of question is there.\u000a\u000aStent: So I think a little history is illustrative here. In the Kennedy administration, going back that far, to 1962, the United States tried to prevent its European allies from selling pipeline equipment, pipelines to the Soviet Union to construct an oil pipeline from Eastern Europe. That didn\u2019t work. In the Reagan administration, they tried to prevent the European allies again from providing equipment to build a gas pipeline from Yamal. And in the end, even Margaret Thatcher, who was Ronald Reagan\u2019s great friend and soulmate, personally traveled to the shipyards in Scotland from which they were exporting the components and defied the U.S.\u000a\u000aSo I think we have an unsuccessful history of trying to prevent our allies, particularly in the energy field, from providing equipment or getting involved in the construction of these oil and gas pipelines from the Soviet Union and Russia. And it usually doesn\u2019t work. The Obama administration worked very hard to craft sanctions with the Europeans that were multilateral that we all agreed on, and they worked remarkably well. Chancellor Merkel was key here. With this new sanctions bill, and if the Europeans feel that they\u2019re now being pressured to do things they don\u2019t want to do, they could well say, well, they\u2019re not going to adhere to the sanctions that they imposed on Russia.\u000a\u000aAnd I think the other thing is that we\u2019ve had these particular Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia since 2014. Russia\u2019s policy in Ukraine hasn\u2019t changed at all. There is absolutely no\u2014the sanctions have hurt Russia economically, but there\u2019s absolutely no sign that they\u2019re going to change their policy because of this. So I think that\u2019s why, again, you need the flexibility, you need to offer the Russians the potential for some sanctions relief if they were to do\u2014to make moves in Ukraine of which we approve. And we lose that when we pass these kinds of sanctions.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, Dan, I\u2019m glad Angela brought up the energy piece of it. It always does seem to come back to that, right?\u000a\u000aYergin: Right.\u000a\u000aGlasser: How dependent are the Europeans still on Russian resources?\u000a\u000aYergin: I think that there\u2019s always been, and Angela referred to the fear of European dependence upon Russian gas, Russian energy. But the world has really changed. It\u2019s no longer that it\u2019s Russia or no one; it\u2019s a competitive global market. Russian gas is now going to compete in Europe with U.S. LNG, liquefied natural gas, liquefied natural gas from other countries.\u000a\u000aIn fact, the Europeans, there\u2019s some language in the bill that really got the Europeans in this latest sanction bill because it talked about the promotion of U.S. energy exports. And so they were saying, \u201cWell, wait, this is really trying\u2014\u201d\u000a\u000aGlasser: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the real agenda behind this.\u201d\u000a\u000aYergin: Yes. I don\u2019t think it is, but it kind of led to this view and this\u2014so Russia is going to continue to be a big gas supplier to Europe and the question is just which pipelines is it going to come from? Right now, Europe, about a third of its gas imports come from Russia.\u000a\u000aAnd so now the Russians are realizing they have to compete on price or there\u2019s going to be all this surplus LNG that\u2019s going to land in the market. So I think, actually, if you take away the rhetoric, a lot of the geopolitics has actually been drained out of the gas market because the market forces are so much stronger now and because you have multiple sources. That makes a huge difference.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So this is\u2014OK, so let\u2019s get this onto the table then, which is the shale revolution. It has, in the last decade, basically absolutely scrambled the energy picture in the world, right? The United States is\u2014now we\u2019re talking about exporting rather than importing, we\u2019re talking about the United States along with Russia and the OPEC countries as being basically a new pillar of the global energy market.\u000a\u000aYergin: Yes. It\u2019s a different game, Susan. I remember in about 2009 we did an article together and the title line that you wrote is \u201cThere Will Be Oil.\u201d And that was at the point when everybody is saying peak oil, it\u2019s all finished.\u000a\u000aGlasser: That\u2019s right. That was a special issue of Foreign Policy magazine. It was a fantastic issue all about oil, and it was totally outdated within a year of its publication.\u000a\u000aYergin: Well, no, it wasn\u2019t, because, I mean, we would have just changed the headline. Instead of \u201cThere Will Be Oil,\u201d \u201cThere Will Be Lots of Oil.\u201d\u000a\u000aGlasser: Lots of oil.\u000a\u000aYergin: And that\u2019s what there\u2019s been: lots of oil. And it was just when the shale gas revolution was beginning and the oil was just beginning, but it\u2019s now been transformative. People talk about OPEC and non-OPEC; that\u2019s the kind of parameters, the division of the world. But now you also have to talk about the big three: Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. And some think the United States will be the world\u2019s largest oil producer.\u000a\u000aWe\u2019ve gone from importing 60 percent of our oil to about 23 percent of our oil. And on natural gas, we were going to run short and we were going to be the biggest importer of LNG; well, we\u2019re going to be one of the big three of LNG exports sometime in the 2020s. Maybe the largest. That will be debated back and forth.\u000a\u000aU.S. LNG has gone to Lithuania. In June of this year, the first shipment of U.S. LNG went to Poland. And that changes the pricing structure. So what it\u2019s done is it\u2019s made the global energy markets much more competitive. I remember at our conference that we call our CERAWeek conference in Houston in 2014, just after he had stepped down as head of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke said that the shale revolution had been one of the most positive, maybe the most positive thing to have happened to the U.S. economy since the 2008 downturn. It was a very big stimulus.\u000a\u000aAnd so it\u2019s really been transformative in so many different ways and it puts the U.S. in a different position. And economically it puts us in a different position. And I\u2019ll tell you, you travel elsewhere in the world, people are very conscious and very aware at how the energy balance has changed in a way that\u2019s a positive for the United States.\u000a\u000aGlasser: So, Angela, Russia has often tried to use its energy resources as a tool of foreign policy. Putin is facing reelection, not too much suspense in the outcome of that contest; but nonetheless, there are politics in Russia, and they often have revolved around the use of resources. Especially at a time when the economy is under sanction. Oil prices have fallen in recent years as a result of not only the shale revolution but then there\u2019s also the toll that sanctions have taken on the Russian economy.\u000a\u000aSo what kind of shape, first of all, is Putin in, headed into 2018?\u000a\u000aStent: Well, that\u2019s a very important question. It\u2019s interesting because when you go to Russia and you talk to people who claim to know what\u2019s happening in the Kremlin, they all say well, they\u2019re still very concerned about the election, which is going to be held next March 18th on the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea four years before. They\u2019re very concerned.\u000a\u000aAnd you say, \u201cWell, why are you concerned? If you look at President Putin\u2019s poll numbers, they\u2019re very high.\u201d I think they\u2019re concerned, A, to have the high poll numbers and then to make people\u2014to ensure that people believe that this was a clean election and there weren\u2019t falsified results. Because clearly in past elections, people have questioned whether these really were the results. We know in the Duma in the last parliamentary elections, for instance, there were people who said that only 25 percent of the population of Moscow, for instance, voted. So I think one of the concerns is to make this look like a legitimate election.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Can it be legitimate if there\u2019s no opponent?\u000a\u000aStent: This is the system there. Of course, for the people who want a really truly competitive election, it\u2019s not legitimate. I mean, the one potential challenger to Putin is Alexei Navalny, who has been very active and who\u2019s built quite an organization countrywide, but he\u2019s probably not going to be able to run because he\u2019s been convicted on various charges, and that I think disqualifies him from running.\u000a\u000aSo the only other candidates will be ones from the four parties that are approved that are in the Duma: the Communists, the Liberal Democrats. They\u2019re all led by people who are older than Putin; they\u2019re about Trump\u2019s age. So yeah, that\u2019s the way it goes. So for Putin, the Russian economy obviously took a huge hit from falling oil prices, first of all, then from just the structural problems of the economy. And then, thirdly, the sanctions, which did affect the economy badly. The growth numbers are somewhat better now. The economy is somewhat recovered.\u000a\u000aSo the way that Putin has dealt with this population, of course, is appealing to patriotism, the anti-Americanism, which is obviously rather easy to do with everything that\u2019s happening now with the sanctions, that he has made Russia a great country again, and then invoking we\u2019ve suffered through worse things before. We Russians are strong and we don\u2019t want anyone to try and limit our own sovereignty or try and overthrow us. So that\u2019s his appeal to the population.\u000a\u000aAnd so far, we think, it\u2019s working. I think you have to be very careful with the poll numbers in Russia. But I think you can say that he still remains popular, at least in wide swaths of the country, partly because there\u2019s no alternative.\u000a\u000aSo I think the result is that Putin will undoubtedly be reelected. I think the much more serious issue is what happens then? And when I go to Russia and I ask Russians again of different political persuasions, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? What\u2019s he going to do in his next term?\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd they all say, \u201cNobody knows. Is there going to be economic reform? He has all these proposals that have been made. Is he going to do anything? Or is it just about remaining in power, him and the people around him? And the results for Russia could be really quite detrimental because if Russia doesn\u2019t reform economically, if they don\u2019t move away from just being a petrostate, they\u2019re going to become progressively less modern.\u000a\u000aYergin: I think one point, a basic point to understand about Putin is that his goal is the restoration of Russia as a great power. That\u2019s his project, and he has pursued it in many different ways.\u000a\u000aThe Russian economy, as Angela said, seems to be back, growing somewhere between 1 and 2 percent, and when you have a declining population, that\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s not the 4 percent that it needs. But the oil industry has adopted to lower prices, and it hasn\u2019t hurt to the degree that we thought. And the reason is because the ruble is down. So the government receives and the companies receive dollars, but they only may receive half as many dollars. But those dollars, because the ruble is down, buy the same amount of rubles. And actually since the sanctions were put in place in 2014, Russian oil production has gone up.\u000a\u000aThe other thing that\u2019s part of this strategy is that you see this burgeoning cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia that has been at the center of this OPEC/non-OPEC effort to stabilize the oil markets. And it\u2019s because these two countries see their self-interest in terms of stabilizing the market as very congruent.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Well, that is a really interesting development when you think about how they\u2019re both watching this new ascendance of the United States as the other major energy superpower now.\u000a\u000aBut somebody said to me recently, \u201cWell, the thing that\u2019s really different,\u201d this was a non-U.S. very senior diplomat, the United States, in this person\u2019s view, is now the No. 1 source of geopolitical uncertainty\u2014if not instability, at least uncertainty, in the world. I\u2019m wondering, first of all, if you guys both agree with that, and second of all, what does it mean for places like Russia? They may now be more incentivized to act more responsibly.\u000a\u000aYergin: I don't know how you rank it as No. 1 or or No. 3, but certainly if you\u2019re in any other country and you\u2019re trying to understand where is the U.S. going, where is this great aircraft carrier called the U.S. sailing, and it seems to be on a very jittery course where you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. That obviously creates uncertainty in the minds of countries all around the world.\u000a\u000aI mean, what\u2019s striking is it hasn\u2019t so far had economic impact. We\u2019ve seen stock markets go up, we see Europe recovering, the world economy looking better, growth rate projections up. But it\u2019s\u2014to say unpredictable might be a slight understatement.\u000a\u000aStent: I would like to come back to the issue of America as the greatest source of instability in the world and how the Russians view this.\u000a\u000aBut I think they were very surprised when Trump won, and then they were initially very hopeful. Now, we know that in the Duma they broke out the champagne because they thought that President Trump would be able to implement what he had talked about during the entire campaign. President Putin was the one world leader that he consistently said positive things about.\u000a\u000aGlasser: And still does, by the way, even with everything that\u2019s happened since then. Donald Trump has had every opportunity to criticize Putin, and he still refused to do so.\u000a\u000aStent: Right. So he said that, then he said we can make a deal with the Russians, why shouldn\u2019t we be friendly with them. And so there was great hope. And then I think the Kremlin began to realize that as all of these Russiagate investigations unfolded, that this wasn\u2019t going to happen. And now I think they themselves are very concerned about the unpredictability.\u000a\u000aWe don\u2019t have a Russian policy in the United States; we have at least two, if not more. We have what President Trump and some people around him appear to believe, which is that we can still do a deal with Russia, that we can work together, we can jointly defeat Islamic State. We can maybe jointly work together on North Korea. Then, of course, you have a much more skeptical, I would say, Defense Department, I would say National Security Council, and also the State Department where Secretary Tillerson himself has said, \u201cThe kind of policy we should pursue\u201d\u2014and I have to say this sounds very much like what both Obama and Bush said because that really is the only kind of policy\u2014\u201cis one where we push against Russian aggression. But on the other hand, we have to find ways where we can work with Russia, and we have to try and create a sense of strategic stability.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd then, of course, you have a Russia policy from the Congress (and we\u2019ve talked about the sanctions already), which if anything wants to be even tougher on Russia. So I think that the Kremlin has began to realize that there is no predictability; that even if President Trump\u2019s instincts are to keep pushing forward and trying to improve relations with Russia, he may not be able to do that just because of all his domestic problems.\u000a\u000aAnd so I think they\u2019re sitting back, and then to come to the second point, so now Russia is really trying to present itself as the more moderate and reasonable power. They have put forward now a plan for what we have to do\u2014we should be doing with North Korea, I mean, in conjunction with the Chinese, which is to sit down and have talks. They will continuously say we have to continue working together in Syria. So Putin himself has said in the past few weeks consistently, \u201cWe want to try and work together with the United States,\u201d even though there\u2019s the anti-American strand there.\u000a\u000aAnd I think a public opinion poll was released today or yesterday showing that a lot of Europeans now believe that Russia at least is a more predictable power and has a more stable leadership than the United States does. So this is really unprecedented. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had the same experience. But when you travel abroad as an American, it\u2019s very interesting to see that everybody wants to know what is happening in your country and what has happened to what America was.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Dan, you\u2019ve been doing a lot of this traveling. What are they saying to you?\u000a\u000aYergin: I think very similar things, that everywhere you go, people want to know what\u2019s happening in Washington and how does this work. And they see the drop, they\u2019re watching CNN, they\u2019re following this very closely. They\u2019re confused. They don\u2019t know who to talk to. And see a U.S. government that seems somewhat dysfunctional, is not getting things done.\u000a\u000aSusan, I think something that you know going back to your own Russian experience, there is a fundamental difference of view when Putin talks about sovereignty, about non-interference in country\u2019s affairs versus the U.S. with universal values.\u000a\u000aAnd on that, Putin has found a soulmate, and the soulmate is Xi Jinping, the president of China. And this pivot to China is on very practical terms that Russia sees its growth market for energy on gas and oil in China. But it\u2019s also very much that they\u2019re united on this principle of sovereignty. You don\u2019t interfere in our political system. And you\u2019ve seen this, people say it\u2019s a strategic partnership, what\u2019s going on between Russia and China. Russia\u2019s just done something that it had refused to do before; sold these very advanced SU-35 jets to China. They didn\u2019t want to sell it before because they were afraid the Chinese would reverse-engineer them. Now it\u2019s part of this relationship.\u000a\u000aStent: But on the other hand, I would also say that President Trump himself, go back to his inaugural address, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not our business to interfere in other countries.\u201d So in fact\u2014\u000a\u000aGlasser: Right. I thought you were going to say the soulmate was Trump on that.\u000a\u000aYergin: Yes. I did too, because I think in some ways Trump is also the soulmate on this. I mean he has repeatedly said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in interfering in other people\u2019s domestic affairs, and we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd again, I think this is not a united policy yet. This may be President Trump\u2019s view; it\u2019s obviously not the view of people who work permanently in organizations like the State Department.\u000a\u000aAnd I would just say, I mean the Russians on the one hand say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t interfere in other people\u2019s domestic affairs,\u201d but look at Ukraine. Look at Georgia. I mean there are many examples where of course that\u2019s not true.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Angela, I want to ask you, you have seen how it works inside the U.S. government and watched the full arc of our intelligence agencies trying to analyze and understand Vladimir Putin since he came to power. All three of us have had different perspectives on watching Putin since he came to power. You\u2019ve gone to this Valdai forum, it\u2019ll be 14 straight years in a row where you get the opportunity to see President Putin in action. I was there back in the very first interview he gave to the U.S. press in 2001 after President Bush\u2019s famous first summit with him, where he looked into his soul.\u000a\u000aDan, you have made the study of Russia a key part of your understanding of the global economics of oil over this\u2014generations. So did the U.S. misread Vladimir Putin, and is that part of the reason why we\u2019re in this sort of saber-rattling, almost not even talking phase of the relationship?\u000a\u000aStent: I think that first of all, you have to go back to the 1990s. And I think that the U.S. had expectations about what was going to happen in Russia, which it turns out were very unrealistic and misplaced. We somehow thought that Russia was going to make a transition from Point A to Point B, and Point B was going to be a Russia that while it wouldn\u2019t look completely like the West, would look much more like the West.\u000a\u000aSo I think that was a fundamental miscalculation and failure to understand the kind of historical influences then. And I think we\u2014progressively what happened is that Putin himself got disillusioned.\u000a\u000aI think we were also late to come to the realization of how important it was for Putin to restore Russia\u2019s greatness. Again, you go back to the speech he made at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 where he basically served notice that Russia was going to be back again and that the U.S. couldn\u2019t dictate to Russia. And I think that\u2014so we underestimated. And then the extent to which Russia was in the end willing to use force in Georgia and in Ukraine to achieve these goals.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Did your colleagues inside the government, though, was there a debate about these issues? Would you say that we were\u2014\u000a\u000aStent: Oh, yes. I mean, the thing is that the debate inside the government isn\u2019t really very different from the debate outside the government among journalists, think tankers, academics, whatever. There are these debates about Putin. And I think the thing you realize the further along you go is how little we really understand about the inner workings of the Kremlin. I mean, the joke is the people who know don\u2019t talk and the people who talk don\u2019t know.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Which is why, Dan, many people have said, \u201cScrew the Kremlinology, let\u2019s look at the more basic facts that we do know about the society, including its economy.\u201d A lot of people believe, for example, that it was the crash of oil prices back in the 1980s that had an awful lot, as well as Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika, that had an awful lot to do with the ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union.\u000a\u000aYergin: Oh, I think that\u2019s absolutely true. I think Mikhail Gorbachev had bad luck, which was plunging oil prices. Boris Yeltsin had bad luck in plunging oil prices, and Vladimir Putin had very good luck for a long time because oil prices, Russia\u2019s oil earnings, increased about sevenfold during the time from 2000 to around 2013, 2014.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Dan, by the way, you were on this strategy and policy board that was just disbanded this week.\u000a\u000aYergin: It disbanded itself.\u000a\u000aGlasser: It disbanded itself; OK. Did you get anything out of it? I mean, do you think\u2014\u000a\u000aYergin: Well, I think there were some major things that\u2014it was meant to bring perspectives from different parts of the economy in an unfiltered way. So I think it was very important in helping to prevent a currency war with China because the discussion was that China is not a currency manipulator now; it spent a trillion dollars defending its currency.\u000a\u000aI think it was doing important work on the relationship between education and the needs of the workforce in the 21st century, work on infrastructure. I mean, it was a dialogue, it was information, it was points of view. So I think it was bringing things to bear, but, of course, it got overwhelmed by the political turmoil that\u2019s engulfed both our nation\u2019s capital and our national politics.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Was there a vote of this group or\u2014\u000a\u000aYergin: I think it was a general view within it that when we had the conference call to go around the room, that it was time to disband. It lost sight of what it was trying to contribute on the economy, and it had become a symbol. And I think everybody just decided that it was just\u2014it should not go on and it was time to bring it to an end.\u000a\u000aGlasser: It\u2019s one of those examples, we all know that crazy, unpredictable things can happen. But even so, if you said this group would break up, I would say, \u201cOK, well, I can imagine scenarios where there would be something too controversial.\u201d That it would be over Confederate monuments, I think, is not something that any of us would have predicted.\u000a\u000aYergin: Yes. And I think that\u2019s right. It\u2019s just the way these things have happened, and it was just not going to be able to function. So to have this and the manufacturing council, to have these group of\u2014most of the members are CEOs\u2014to just say that we can\u2019t go on was a comment about what\u2019s happening to our politics. This is at a very high level of people thinking strategically. But I think by a Wednesday in August, it was time to disband.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Amazing. Amazing times. So Angela, our old friend and your longtime colleague Fiona Hill has the unenviable job right now of being inside that White House as a senior director for Russia. What would you advise her? You\u2019ve already said in our conversation today that we don\u2019t really have a Russia policy, or perhaps we have multiple different Russia policies. When Fiona hits the red button and says, \u201cAngela, help, what should I do?\u201d what are you going to tell her?\u000a\u000aStent: Well, I think they should continue doing what my understanding is that they are doing in the National Security Council, and that is look at the areas where you can and have to work together with Russia. So we already mentioned Syria. There are some very serious arms control and nuclear arms questions coming. The United States believes, for instance, that Russia is in violation of the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces. We have to talk to the Russians about this. We have to figure out what we\u2019re going to do. The New Start Agreement on strategic nuclear weapons that was worked out under the Obama administration, that expires in 2021. That\u2019s not that far away, and we have to start thinking about how do we renew that, because if we don\u2019t, then we don\u2019t have any agreements working on this.\u000a\u000aI personally think that we should be having a dialogue with the Russians on cyber issues. That may seem strange given the fact that we\u2019re talking about their interference in our election, but we do have such an agreement with the Chinese, and even though it doesn\u2019t work perfectly, it is worth sitting down and trying to talk to the Russians about the rules of the road. I mean, interestingly, Putin himself has suggested that, and apparently that\u2019s something that came up during their meeting. It\u2019s not going to go away. The Russians aren\u2019t going to stop doing this. But we at least\u2014it\u2019s better if we can try and agree on some rules of the road. So I think on all of those issues, we need to talk to the Russians.\u000a\u000aWhat Putin would like would be a new tri-polar Yalta Agreement. That you re-divide the world, Russia, China and the United States. We have our sphere of influence, they do, the Chinese do and we just\u2014hands off everybody else\u2019s. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to agree with that ever, and that\u2019s certainly\u2014so it comes back to what I said at the beginning. We have different views of how the world should function and what drives international politics.\u000a\u000aBut I think to go back to what the National Security Council is doing, those are the things that they should be working on. And I think they are; the problem is to what extent can they pursue these policies if you have a wild card in the White House?\u000a\u000aGlasser: A wild card in the White House. OK. We\u2019re going to end it on this final quick question. \u201cNew Cold War.\u201d A lot of people throw that around. Is that the right term? If it isn\u2019t, do you have some better frame for understanding what\u2019s happening between the U.S. and Russia?\u000a\u000aStent: I think it\u2019s very reminiscent of the old Cold War. I mean, Dan said at the beginning there isn\u2019t an ideological conflict. But you know there is in many ways because Russia now puts itself forward as the leader of conservative internationale\u2014against regime change, against decadent Western morals. So it resembles the Cold War. The difference is the U.S. is infinitely stronger than the Russians, militarily. They certainly can project power in their own neighborhood in Syria, but we\u2019re not military rivals in the way that we were before. We\u2019re becoming geopolitical rivals more than we were before. So it\u2019s a sort of Cold War 2.0.\u000a\u000aGlasser: Dan, you get the last word.\u000a\u000aYergin: I don\u2019t think \u201cNew Cold War\u201d is a way to describe it because it suggests that there\u2019s kind of no way out of it. Frigid, antagonistic, confrontational in some ways, yes. But I think it\u2019s more a great power clash, and although I take what Angela says, it\u2019s not as ideological. It\u2019s not a vanguard of world revolution. Maybe the phrase we should use is a breakdown. And a breakdown in relations between the world\u2019s two major nuclear powers is something to be very concerned about.\u000a\u000aSusan Glasser is POLITICO\u2019s chief international affairs columnist and host of its new weekly podcast, The Global Politico.

aVGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel | Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images UK must pay Brexit bill, says Angela Merkel German chancellor said bill was not a fine but an \u2018obligation\u2019 that Britain had entered into.\u000a\u000aGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the U.K. on Saturday that it would have to pay a settlement to leave the EU, denying that the obligation amounted to a \u201cfine.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is about obligations that Great Britain has entered into and that naturally must remain on the books,\u201d Merkel said in her weekly podcast published Saturday ahead of the latest round of talks next week, Bloomberg reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the cost of divorce \u2014 that makes it sound like fines. We\u2019re still at the very start of these negotiations.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe divorce bill, or how much the U.K. should pay the EU upon leaving the bloc, is one of the most contentious issues in the Brexit talks. The EU has already outlined a full list of bodies and funds that it believes must be covered by the financial settlement. Estimates of the bill have ranged up to \u20ac100 billion.\u000a\u000aBrussels has told Britain to come forward with a proposal for how to calculate the bill or risk derailing next week\u2019s Brexit talks \u2014 something it has so far declined to do, preferring to critique the EU proposal.\u000a\u000aBoris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, said he did not \u201crecognize\u201d the \u20ac100 billion figure but added that \u201cwe should pay not a penny more, not a penny less, of what we think our legal obligations amount to.\u201d

aVEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager | Aurore Belot/AFP via Getty Images EU launches in-depth probe into Bayer\u2019s purchase of Monsanto The deal has sparked intense opposition in Europe and further afield.\u000a\u000aMargrethe Vestager, European commissioner for competition, opened an in-depth probe into Bayer\u2019s controversial $66 billion acquisition of Monsanto on Tuesday, citing a list of competition concerns that will almost certainly drag the review into 2018.\u000a\u000aThe market for weedkillers is at the forefront of the probe, with investigators warning Germany\u2019s Bayer is one of only a few companies to produce a genuine alternative to Missouri-based Monsanto\u2019s market-leading pesticides based on the controversial herbicide glyphosate. They also said the merger risked reducing competition for developing and marketing new seeds and plant traits.\u000a\u000aThose preliminary conclusions will lift the hopes of an army of critics, who view Vestager as the last chance to kill a tie-up. The deal has sparked intense opposition in Europe and further afield, with environmentalists and hundreds of thousands of petitioners calling on the Danish commissioner to block it.\u000a\u000aMuch of the public furore about glyphosate, however, lies well beyond the scope of Vestager\u2019s investigation. The chemical is a subject of intense debate primarily because the EU must decide by the end of the year whether to renew its license for up to 15 years for use by farmers, who say it is critical to maintain yields, while scientists continue to debate whether it causes cancer.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne monster corporation controlling our food is a bad idea for farmers and citizens everywhere\u201d \u2014 Nick Flynn\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to ensure effective competition so that farmers can have access to innovative products, better quality and also purchase products at competitive prices,\u201d Vestager said, announcing the so-called Phase II investigation.\u000a\u000aThe Commission noted the merged entity \u201cwould hold both the largest portfolio of pesticides products and the strongest global market positions in seeds and traits, making it the largest integrated company in the industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Commission has the power to either block mergers or demand divestments by the companies.\u000a\u000aBayer said it would continue to \u201cwork constructively with the Commission with a view to obtaining the Commission\u2019s approval of the transaction by the end of this year.\u201d Monsanto had no immediate comment.\u000a\u000aAgri-chemical mega-mergers\u000a\u000aThe deal, announced in September 2016 amid a wave of consolidation between the giant agri-chemical companies, has made slow progress on the regulatory front. The U.S. Department of Justice continues to examine the deal, and regulators in Australia, Brazil and Canada have also been looking into it. South Africa has conditionally approved the merger.\u000a\u000aIn Europe, investigators have honed in on the companies\u2019 overlapping businesses in vegetable seeds and field crop seeds, in particular oilseed rape and cotton, plus Bayer\u2019s position as one of the main rivals to Monsanto on the market for developing and introducing traits to plants.\u000a\u000aThe companies\u2019 activities in developing and selling \u201cnon-selective herbicides\u201d also attracted attention. \u201cBayer produces glufosinate ammonium, also a non-selective herbicide and one of the very few alternatives to glyphosate,\u201d the Commission said.\u000a\u000aRegulators also said they would examine how the advent of digital agriculture and the use of Big Data analyses could reinforce strong market positions.\u000a\u000aMore than a million people globally have signed a variety of petitions against the deal, while thousands of campaigners have bombarded Vestager online asking her to block what they call Bayer and Monsanto\u2019s #mergerfromhell. In a letter to petitioners published Tuesday, Vestager said she had received more than 50,000 petition emails and more than 5,000 postcards and letters on the case but warned she could only examine the deal on competition grounds.\u000a\u000aBayer and Monsanto\u2019s merger is the last of the trio of mega-mergers that have dramatically consolidated the agri-chemical industry.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe other concerns you raise are handled by my colleagues and national authorities and are subject to European and national rules to protect food safety, consumers, the environment and the climate,\u201d she wrote.\u000a\u000aCampaigners nonetheless expect her to block the deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cOne monster corporation controlling our food is a bad idea for farmers and citizens everywhere,\u201d said Nick Flynn, legal director at Avaaz, a campaign group. \u201cThat\u2019s why over a million people are hoping Commissioner Vestager comes back with a long term rejection of Monsanto and Bayer\u2019s marriage from hell.\u201d\u000a\u000aBayer and Monsanto\u2019s merger is the last of the trio of mega-mergers that have dramatically consolidated the agri-chemical industry. Two of the deals \u2014 Dow\u2019s tie-up with DuPont and ChemChina\u2019s acquisition of Syngenta \u2014 obtained EU clearance at the end of long probes and on condition they sold off some businesses.

aVTexas Democrats desperately want Rep. Joaquín Castro to run for governor next year \u2014 and they\u2019re frustrated by what they see as his twin brother\u2019s presidential ambitions getting in the way.\u000a\u000aThe congressman\u2019s decision as to whether to run against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is caught up in the Castro brothers\u2019 unique mix of their deep personal connection and parallel political ambitions. Joaquín Castro is being hounded by Democrats to get in but is torn, according to people who\u2019ve spoken with him, over whether to take on a popular incumbent with $40 million in the bank.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s where his identical twin brother, Julián Castro, comes in. The former Housing and Urban Development secretary and 2012 Democratic convention speaker recently launched a PAC and is spending the fall writing an autobiographical, campaign-style book, and has made his interest in 2020 clear.\u000a\u000aThe brothers serve as each other\u2019s top strategists, and they\u2019ve agreed that Julián\u2019s next political move takes primacy for now. One worry is that a Joaquín loss for governor \u2014 it would be an uphill battle, at best, against Abbott \u2014 would make the Castros look like losers. The other is that if Joaquin happened to pull off an upset, it would distract attention from Julián, potentially complicating his path to the White House.\u000a\u000aJulián has talked to many people about the lack of national Democratic figures to channel the rising power of Latinos, and how well-positioned he believes he is to occupy that space. But he, too, would also be a long shot if he were to run for president in 2020.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThough Joaquín Castro is seen as unlikely to go through with it, last month Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez spoke with the congressman and encouraged him to run for governor, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Several members of the Texas House delegation have also urged him to take the leap.\u000a\u000aBoth Castros are famously cautious.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo matter what, I think Joaquín wants to do everything possible that Julián is in the best possible position to move forward with his plans,\u201d said Gilberto Hinojosa, the Texas Democratic chairman, who\u2019s eager to see the congressman jump in against Abbott.\u000a\u000aHinojosa and other Texas Democrats have talked to the congressman about running. State party officials reached out to operatives in Washington last week to help in the recruitment effort, according to people involved in the conversations.\u000a\u000aJoaquín Castro isn't just seen as the strongest potential candidate \u2014 15 months out from the election, Democrats have literally no one else. The race is seen as such a long shot that national Democrats haven\u2019t put much thought into trying to find a candidate, who they believe would likely only drain resources from other more winnable races.\u000a\u000aLocal Democrats are more optimistic. They see a tough environment for Republicans, thanks in part to Donald Trump's early woes. They're heartened by Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke's challenge to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. They also believe the state's steady demographic changes are nudging the state blue, though there\u2019s no electoral evidence of it to date (Hillary Clinton did beat Donald Trump in three Republican-held congressional districts).\u000a\u000aAs for Joaquin, Democrats say he's the only one who would bring a record on issues, generate excitement on the trail, boast support from establishment Democrats and big national donors, and turn out the state\u2019s enormous Latino population. That could be enough, they argue, to get within range of making Abbott vulnerable.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has been a rock-solid leader on economic issues," said Jeff Rotkoff, the campaigns director at the Texas AFL-CIO. \u201cIf he so chose, he\u2019d be a very powerful messenger.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn private conversations, Castro talks about how \u201cthe normal calculus\u201d of politics has been scrambled by Trump. Does that mean he passes on a race because the work in Congress feels too compelling to give up, especially with the speculation that Democrats have an outside shot at winning the House next year? Or does it mean deciding what\u2019s happening in Washington and Austin is too disconcerting to not at least try to beat Abbott next year, if only to begin laying the groundwork for a multi-cycle campaign for the governor's job?\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019d have a lot to consider on that,\u201d said Chris Turner, the leader of the Texas state House Democrats. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do what\u2019s best for Texas and the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aThrough a spokesman, Joaquín Castro declined to comment, and Julián Castro did not respond to an effort to reach him directly.\u000a\u000aBut at a news conference in Austin last week, the congressman joined state legislators blasting Abbott and the GOP for their just-concluded monthlong special session. When asked whether he\u2019d run, Joaquin Castro left open the option in a way that people familiar with his response say was deliberate.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s my intention right now to run for reelection. If that changes, I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d he said, according to people present.\u000a\u000aFirst lady Michelle Obama talks with Julian Castro (center) and his brother Joaquin Castro during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. | Alex Wong/Getty Images.\u000a\u000aThe governor\u2019s race isn\u2019t the only one where the Castro brothers\u2019 internal dynamics have played out. Joaquín Castro told people earlier this year that part of why he was passing on the Senate race against Cruz was to keep from butting into his brother\u2019s plans. (However, when Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) was briefly floated for the FBI director opening, Castro said he\u2019d be interested in running for his seat. The shorter timetable of a special election would have been more favorable for Castro and he wouldn't have had to give up his House seat.)\u000a\u000aO\u2019Rourke is eager to run with his friend and fellow congressman as a Democratic slate: O'Rourke for Senate, Castro for governor. O'Rourke regularly encourages people to call Castro and make the case to him directly.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve told him as much, let him know I would do anything in my power to be successful,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said on a drive between the kind of campaign stops in red and blue Texas that he said have convinced him Democrats have a real opportunity to win statewide. \u201cIt will take a total commitment, and obviously it\u2019s going to be tough. But there\u2019s never been a better year than this one.\u201d\u000a\u000aRunning alongside each other would help them both, O\u2019Rourke argued.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe state is already energized," he said. "It would be supercharged if he would get out there.\u201d\u000a\u000aCastro was 16 years old the last time a Democrat was elected governor in Texas \u2014 Ann Richards in 1990. But beyond how tough Abbott would be to beat, there are factors that could keep Castro in Congress. His seat is safe, and in addition to his committee posts, including a spot on the Intelligence Committee, he\u2019s viewed an obvious candidate for a spot in the next generation of House Democratic leaders.\u000a\u000aBut an ability to do something substantial in the House requires being in the majority. And the path to the majority likely requires redistricting in states like Texas, where Democrats are sure they\u2019d be able to win more races if they had a Democratic governor instead of a Republican governor helping to draw district lines.\u000a\u000a\u201cNone of that happens unless we have a strong statewide ticket,\u201d Hinojosa said. \u201cNo one could make it stronger than Joaquín.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVODESSA, Ukraine \u2014 In the Ukrainian tourist destination of Odessa, a port on the Black Sea, holidaymakers mingle with internally displaced people from the country\u2019s war-torn east, local Roma, students, and economic migrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus, Africa and Asia.\u000a\u000aYet the air carries something less healthy than sea breezes: tuberculosis.\u000a\u000aOdessa has the highest rate of TB in Ukraine, with 110 cases per 100,000 people in 2016, and rising fast. Closely linked with migration, instability and poverty, controlling this airborne disease takes on additional urgency this year as Ukraine seeks to integrate into Europe thanks to a new visa-free regime. Part of a migration corridor from Central Asia and the Caucasus to Russia and Western Europe, Ukraine has at least 5 million citizens working abroad, according to its foreign ministry: in Poland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Russia and Germany. Another 1.5 million people have been internally displaced by the war in the east of the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine should pay special attention to TB because it\u2019s a very sensitive topic for Europe\u201d \u2014 Alexey Bobrik, World Health Organization\u2019s technical officer\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine should pay special attention to TB because it\u2019s a very sensitive topic for Europe,\u201d said Alexey Bobrik, the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) technical officer for HIV, TB and viral hepatitis in Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m talking about global security and transmission of TB through borders.\u201d\u000a\u000aTuberculosis was largely wiped out in Western Europe in the early 20th century through treatment, improved health monitoring and awareness, and higher living standards. Since the Soviet Union collapsed the disease has returned with a vengeance in former Soviet states. Ukraine declared a TB epidemic in 1995.\u000a\u000aSince then, the country has received huge amounts of international aid to tackle TB and its twin epidemic, HIV. But weak political will and chronic distrust of the country\u2019s corrupt health system has held back progress. While overall TB rates are gradually falling, in places like Odessa they continue to rise. More worryingly, Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the world for multi-drug resistant (MDR) forms of TB, which do not respond to traditional treatment.\u000a\u000aA quarter of newly diagnosed cases of TB in Ukraine in 2016 were MDR-TB, according to WHO. Cure rates for resistant forms are the lowest among all MDR-TB burden countries: 38 percent. In Odessa, where TB-HIV co-infection is rife, the overall TB cure rate last year was just 43 percent. \u201cThat basically shows you how effective the health system is here, which is a shame for a European country,\u201d Bobrik said.\u000a\u000aUnchanged system\u000a\u000aUkraine\u2019s TB system has changed little since Soviet times. It\u2019s based on in-patient treatment lasting months or even years in TB clinics and sanatoriums, often located in once-beautiful historical buildings that are in disrepair and unsuited to modern infectious disease control and patient needs.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t provide proper treatment conditions,\u201d said Dr. Oksana Leonenko-Brodetskaya, who heads Odessa city\u2019s TB clinic. It\u2019s housed in a peeling pink classical building in the city center. \u201cWe\u2019ve no individual isolated wards, and no phasing system of existing wards, and so cross-infection occurs.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to modern international standards, isolated in-patient treatment is not the answer to TB anyway \u2014 early and accurate diagnosis, early treatment and retention of patients on an ambulatory basis is. Most patients stop being infectious within days or weeks of starting treatment. In a country with no job or social security, and in a city like Odessa with a large migrant population, expecting patients to stay for months in poorly equipped hospitals is unrealistic, unnecessary and hugely expensive.\u000a\u000a\u201cUkraine can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Bobrik said. \u201cYou can spend your funding on TB dispensaries and a lot of health workers who sit in these dispensaries and don\u2019t go to patients. Or instead of that, you can create an out-patient model.\u201d\u000a\u000aRetaining out-patients requires a change of approach. More than 20 percent of newly diagnosed patients in Odessa in 2016 were migrants and non-residents of the city. Many \u2014 although far from all \u2014 are among the most disadvantaged members of society: the homeless, drug users, former prisoners. The stigma around TB is another reason patients try not to be associated with TB treatment centers.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey all try to disappear,\u201d Leonenko-Brodetskaya said of her patients, claiming many register with false addresses and fall off the grid as soon as they start to feel better.\u000a\u000aEveryone concerned with TB in Odessa speaks about a taxi driver or a market trader still working with active TB and a fake health certificate, because they can\u2019t afford to stop. The stories may be apocryphal but Maria Kochetova, who spent three months in a TB ward earlier this year, recalled patients there who stopped taking medication, checked out early or simply disappeared. Even among patients, there\u2019s an instinct to blame other patients for spread of the disease.\u000a\u000aKochetova also recalled several patients dying of a disease which, if caught early enough, should be treatable. Kochetova\u2019s doctors didn\u2019t expect her to survive either. The 34-year-old called an ambulance only after weeks of what she told herself was flu. She\u2019d never considered herself at risk from TB: She wasn\u2019t homeless; she didn\u2019t use drugs; she had a regular job as a cleaner.\u000a\u000aDoctors told her it started with an earlier bout of pneumonia she\u2019d left untreated because she couldn\u2019t afford it.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019d cost money if I ended up in hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who does this; everyone keeps going until they fall down because they know hospital is so expensive.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Free\u2019 treatment\u000a\u000aUkrainian health care is theoretically free. In practice, patients pay for services and medication through an entrenched system of kickbacks to medical staff trying to supplement painfully low salaries. Kochetova was fortunate that once she did end up in hospital, her active TB was diagnosed within three days instead of three weeks, and TB treatment is genuinely free. But during those three days, she says she had to pay more than 1,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (\u20ac33) for various services \u2014 that\u2019s two weeks\u2019 wages for a junior medical worker.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey fleece you for everything,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aNon-hospitalized patients have to make daily trips to clinics to get medicines, which are supposed to be taken under observation to ensure patients complete treatment courses of up to two years for MDR-TB. Failure to complete courses leads not just to further illness but to more development of drug-resistant forms. The daily travel is onerous, especially for those with no income or fixed living place, or from rural areas.\u000a\u000aPrograms run by state clinics and nongovernment organizations in Odessa provide a solution: psycho-social support and incentives for patients to adhere to treatment by bringing medicines to their homes and providing other aid such as food parcels, bus tickets or mobile phone credit. Odessa city has also tried to incentivize medical staff. Under a pioneer bonus system to boost primary care diagnosis rates, family GPs receive 2,000 hryvnia (\u20ac66) for every fast, accurate TB diagnosis and referral. Last year, city authorities paid 200 bonuses from the 1,113 newly diagnosed cases.\u000a\u000aIn future, the city wants to keep TB treatment and monitoring within the ambulatory primary health care system, with bonuses for medical staff based on successful treatment outcomes.\u000a\u000aThese innovations are in line with overall Ukraine health reforms now in legislative limbo. These would change the old Soviet centralized model of funding institutions based on number of staff and hospital beds irrespective of numbers of patients and their needs, to patient-centered, results-based funding. Regions would have more autonomy to allocate funds to primary medicine, and to NGOs to provide services. The reforms should make most key health services genuinely free for patients.\u000a\u000aAlthough backed by the EU and by international agencies that have largely underwritten Ukraine\u2019s TB and HIV programming, parliament shelved the draft financing laws until the fall, and there is widespread opposition. In Odessa\u2019s medical community, the reforms are surrounded by doubt and rumor, from fears they will cut jobs, to accusations that their real purpose is to sell off valuable real estate now used as clinics.\u000a\u000aExamples from other post-Soviet and eastern bloc countries show that the transition to a new model is indeed painful, but can be achieved. With the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s main health donor funding the majority of HIV and TB response \u2014 due to pull out of the region in 2020, Ukraine has little time left to find a domestic answer to its epidemics and its failing health system.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor Eastern Europe it\u2019s a particularly acute issue,\u201d said Michel Kazatchkine, former director of the Global Fund. \u201cIncreasing epidemics, low coverage with treatment and prevention, no readiness and in some cases no willingness to pay for services for vulnerable people \u2026 nothing is ready.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn his current role as U.N. special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Kazatchkine is lobbying for health reform in Ukraine to ease the transition once external funding stops.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would be less pessimistic than I was a year-and-a-half ago because I see changes. I\u2019m seeing more political commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cAIDS and TB are on the agenda.\u201d

aVHe understands Mr. Trump\u2019s sleeping patterns and how he likes his steak (\u201cIt would rock on the plate, it was so well done\u201d), and how Mr. Trump insists \u2014 despite the hair salon on the premises \u2014 on doing his own hair.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal knows how to stroke his ego and lift his spirits, like the time years ago he received an urgent warning from Mr. Trump\u2019s soon-to-land plane that the mogul was in a sour mood. Mr. Senecal quickly hired a bugler to play \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d as Mr. Trump stepped out of his limousine to enter Mar-a-Lago.\u000a\u000aMost days, though, he greeted Mr. Trump with little fanfare, taking the suit he arrived in to be pressed in the full-service laundry in the basement.\u000a\u000aThe next morning, before dawn and after about four hours\u2019 sleep, Mr. Trump would meet him at the arched entrance of his private quarters to accept a bundle of newspapers including The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and the Palm Beach papers. Mr. Trump would emerge hours later, in khakis, a white golf shirt and baseball cap. If the cap was white, the staff noticed, the boss was in a good mood. If it was red, it was best to stay away.\u000a\u000aOn Sundays, Mr. Trump would drive himself to his nearby golf course, alternating each year between his black Bentley and his white Bentley.\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal tried to retire in 2009, but Mr. Trump decided he was irreplaceable, so while Mr. Senecal was relieved of his butler duties, he has been kept around as a kind of unofficial historian at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cTony, to retire is to expire,\u201d Mr. Trump told him. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next season.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal, with horn-rimmed glasses, a walrus mustache and a white pocket kerchief in his black jacket, seems to reflect his boss\u2019s worldview: He worries about attacks by Islamic terrorists and is critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s ex-wives.\u000a\u000aAnd like Mr. Trump, he is at ease among the celebrities who visit the estate. But while he might once have admired Dixie Carter sipping crème de menthe by the fireplace and reciting soliloquies from the television show \u201cDesigning Women,\u201d these days Mr. Senecal encounters Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey lounging on a couch under the living room\u2019s 21-foot gold-leafed ceiling, or chatting with Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as he exits the luxurious Spanish Room.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aThe butler\u2019s up-close observations of Mr. Trump over the years have revealed not only the mogul\u2019s quirks \u2014 Mr. Trump rarely appears in bathing trunks, for example, and does not like to swim \u2014 but also his habitual, self-soothing exaggerations.\u000a\u000aIn the early years, Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka slept in the same children\u2019s suite that Dina Merrill, an actress and a daughter of Mrs. Post, occupied in the 1930s. Mr. Trump liked to tell guests that the nursery rhyme-themed tiles in the room were made by a young Walt Disney.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t like that, do you?\u201d Mr. Trump would say when he caught Mr. Senecal rolling his eyes. The house historian would protest that it was not true.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho cares?\u201d Mr. Trump would respond with a laugh.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump is abundantly proud of his ability to drive a golf ball, once asking rhetorically during a news conference: \u201cDo I hit it long? Is Trump strong?\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal suggested that Mr. Trump was perhaps not quite as strong as he imagined, remembering times they would hit balls together from the Mar-a-Lago property into the Intracoastal Waterway.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000a\u201cTony, how far is that?\u201d Mr. Trump would ask.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s like 275 yards,\u201d Mr. Senecal would respond, though he said the actual distance was 225 yards.\u000a\u000aStill, Mr. Senecal said that Mr. Trump could be generous when the mood struck him, sometimes peeling $100 bills from a wad in his pocket to give to the groundskeepers, whom Mr. Senecal described as appreciative.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019re a Hispanic and you\u2019re in here trimming the trees and everything, and a guy walks up and hands you a hundred dollars,\u201d Mr. Senecal said. \u201cAnd they love him, not for that, they just love him.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to Mar-a-Lago lore, Mrs. Post, who was once the wealthiest woman in the United States, scoped out the property that would become the estate in the 1920s by crawling through the junglelike brush between Lake Worth and the Atlantic Ocean. She imported stone from Genoa, Italy, and 16th-century Flemish tapestries that she protected by drawing the drapes in the brightest hours. (They faded after Mr. Trump bought the place and blasted the living room with sunlight.)\u000a\u000aWhen she died in 1973, Mrs. Post left the house to the United States government with the intent that it would become a presidential retreat. But the upkeep proved too expensive, and ownership was transferred back to Mrs. Post\u2019s daughters, who unloaded it to Mr. Trump for less than $10 million in 1985. He turned it into a private club a decade later.\u000a\u000aThese days, what really seems to bug Mr. Trump is the sound of planes over the property. Whereas Mrs. Post ensured that the nearby airport would divert flights away from the estate during her stays, the same courtesy has not been extended to Mr. Trump, and the constant roar of engines \u201cdrives him nuts,\u201d Mr. Senecal said.\u000a\u000a\u201cTony,\u201d Mr. Trump would often shout. \u201cCall the tower!\u201d\u000a\u000aThe candidate is suing the county-run airport. He has also sued the town in a dispute over the size of his estate\u2019s flagpole; the size of the banquet hall he added to the property; and the size of the club, which, to frighten the local gentry, he once threatened to sell to followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.\u000a\u000aMore recently, Mar-a-Lago has set off controversy in the Republican primary, as Mr. Trump has been criticized by rivals for hiring employees from abroad to staff the club rather than relying on the local work force.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of Romanians, there\u2019s a lot of South Africans, we have one Irishman,\u201d Mr. Senecal said of the staff, before echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s defense that locals shunned the short-term seasonal work. But he also added of the foreigners: \u201cThey\u2019re so good. They are so professional. These local people,\u201d he trailed off, making a disapproving face.\u000a\u000aOver the decades, he has grown close to the Trump family. He recalled how Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, once stepped out of his limo on the club\u2019s gravel driveway and remarked to Mr. Senecal, \u201cSomebody better get that coin.\u201d The butler went on his hands and knees and after a few minutes found a crusty penny.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000a\u201cHis eyes were incredible,\u201d Mr. Senecal said of Fred Trump. \u201cMr. Trump has the same eyes.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe also remembered Donald Trump\u2019s young sons running through the library, paneled with centuries-old British oak and filled with rare first-edition books that no one in the family ever read. When the library became a bar, Mr. Trump put a portrait of himself on a wall, posing in tennis whites.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been in other homes in Palm Beach \u2014 same exact painting,\u201d Mr. Senecal confided archly. \u201cJust a different head.\u201d\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

She would instruct him to \u201cget that spot out of that rug\u201d and then do it herself if he failed. She would occasionally tell Mr. Senecal to have the gardeners go inside because she wanted to swim naked in the pool.\u000a\u000aIn 1990, Mr. Senecal took a sabbatical to become the mayor of a town in West Virginia, where he gained some notoriety for a proposal requiring all panhandlers to carry begging permits. He said that Mr. Trump wrote to him, \u201cThis is so great, Tony.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal returned in 1992, and took up his old residence in the butler\u2019s room, but was soon asked to move out after Mr. Trump married Marla Maples, who \u201creally didn\u2019t belong here,\u201d Mr. Senecal said. Also, Mr. Trump wanted to rent the room out to members.\u000a\u000aA decade later, Mr. Trump decided to put his own imprint on Mar-a-Lago by building the 20,000-square-foot Donald J. Trump Ballroom. The venue made its big debut with the 2005 wedding of Mr. Trump to Melania Trump, whom Mr. Senecal described as exceptionally compassionate. Tony Bennett, whose paintings hang in the mansion, sang. Mr. Senecal greeted guests at the door, including Hillary Clinton. (In the interview, he offered a profane description for Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.)\u000a\u000aThe ballroom later hosted an 80th birthday party for Maya Angelou, thrown by Oprah Winfrey, during which part of the hall was set aside for a \u201creligious ceremony with the hooting and the hollering,\u201d Mr. Senecal recalled. \u201cMr. Trump was right on into it. It was so great. He was clapping.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Senecal\u2019s admiration for his longtime boss seems to know few limits. On March 6, as Mr. Trump made his way through the living room on his way to the golf course, Mr. Senecal called out \u201cAll rise!\u201d to the club members and staff. They rose.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump was wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. It was white, not red. He seemed in a good mood.

aVDigital Politics is a column about the global intersection of technology and the world of politics.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 When people started surfing the web about 30 years ago, life was pretty simple. It might have taken minutes \u2014 if not longer \u2014 to get online, but when you were connected, there were few restrictions on what you could do.\u000a\u000aFast forward to 2017, and the world is a very different place. China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d has blocked a vast array of digital services. Policymakers from Brazil to Bangladesh are looking to rein in the activities of some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. And a growing list of lawmakers elsewhere is also expanding countries\u2019 offline laws into the online world.\u000a\u000aAt the center of this global tussle between technology and politics stands Europe, whose policymakers have set their sights on becoming the de facto global arbiters for how companies \u2014 and, in some cases, their users \u2014 behave online.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s an ambitious task with many supporters, in Europe and further afield, hoping to bring these mostly Silicon Valley tech giants down a peg or two. But Europe\u2019s aggressive push to control the digital world also may come with some serious downsides.\u000a\u000aFor every attempt to rein in the activities of Google or Facebook, among others, the Continent\u2019s lawmakers could embolden the efforts of more repressive regimes worldwide to tighten their own grip on what happens online. And if more and more countries impose their own rules on the web, such a race to define the digital world may eventually carve up the global nature of our online lives into a Balkanized version of the internet.\u000a\u000aEuropeans officials are already expanding digital rules for data privacy and are clamping down on what can be published online.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s certainly not what European lawmakers are hoping for, but it is a stark reminder of the law of unintended consequences.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs Europe, we must set the global standards,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourová, the European commissioner for justice, who will travel to Washington next month to discuss how the U.S. can keep pace with European digital privacy rules, which already are among the toughest in the world.\u000a\u000aEurope\u2019s ambition to become the world\u2019s digital policeman may sound surprising to those who scoff at the region\u2019s inability to keep pace with the United States and China in churning out tech giants from Google and Amazon to Alibaba and Tencent.\u000a\u000aBut that lackluster record hasn\u2019t stopped Europe\u2019s lawmakers from seeking to export the bloc\u2019s growing list of digital rules beyond its borders, aiming to expand its hands-on approach to technology to all four corners of the planet (with, importantly, the significant exception of China).\u000a\u000aThe battle lines are already being drawn, potentially creating cracks in the digital world as countries vie to control the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Uber.\u000a\u000aEuropeans officials are already expanding digital rules for data privacy and are clamping down on what can be published online. Some also openly balk at the dominance of Silicon Valley\u2019s best and brightest.\u000a\u000aIn June, Brussels-based policymakers fined Google a record \u20ac2.4 billion for flaunting the region\u2019s antitrust rules, and they are pursuing two separate cases into the search giant\u2019s alleged abuse of its dominant position. The company denies wrongdoing.\u000a\u000aEuropean authorities are even questioning where tech companies pay their taxes as they rake in record profits across ever-expanding global empires. Last year, the European Commission ordered Apple to pay \u20ac13 billion in back taxes to Ireland. (The company and Irish government are appealing.)\u000a\u000aBoth cases are likely to be back in the headlines this fall. Google must comply with EU demands to open up some of its search services by the end of September and judges may start to hear appeals against Apple\u2019s blockbuster fine.\u000a\u000aCentral to Europe\u2019s regulatory zeal is a fundamentally different take on the role of government in people\u2019s lives compared to the United States \u2014 still home to the Western world\u2019s largest tech companies.\u000a\u000aAmerican politicians have often given digital giants relatively free rein when it comes to our search queries, social media posts and e-commerce purchases. Contrast that to Europe where lawmakers \u2014 now bit players in a world dominated by these tech giants \u2014 have balked at allowing a small number of companies to dominate large swathes of our daily digital lives.\u000a\u000aThe Continent\u2019s policymakers have woken up to the fact that people now interact more regularly, and often have greater affinity, with digital services like Twitter and Uber than they do with their elected officials. And they have started to take action.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d said Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia and an advocate for limited oversight of the web. \u201cThe internet was not created along national borders.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany American policymakers and executives view European reservations towards these tech companies as mere sour grapes. The Continent can\u2019t keep pace, they claim. And with few other options available, the region\u2019s politicians have turned up their anti-American rhetoric to full blast.\u000a\u000aThat argument misses the point.\u000a\u000aEurope\u2019s efforts to corral the digital world are part of a longstanding tradition of the Continent\u2019s governments taking a more paternalistic (some would say overly-interventionist) stance to their citizens\u2019 lives, compared to the United States.\u000a\u000aIn the U.S., lawmakers have been happy to allow new technologies to sprint ahead while regulation struggles to catch up. Europeans (in general) have been more wary \u2014 quicker to question the effects of rapid changes on wider society and more willing to hit the brakes when digital advances overturn the status quo.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a conflict that will only escalate as the digital world becomes central to an increasing number of industries \u2014 and parts of society.\u000a\u000a\u201cDigital platforms are becoming increasingly important in the public discourse,\u201d said Stefan Heumann, co-director of Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a Berlin-based think tank focused on digital issues. \u201cIt\u2019s up to someone to set the rules.\u201d\u000a\u000aEurope\u2019s approach is not without risks \u2014 or its critics.\u000a\u000aSure, the digital world may now be such an integral part of most people\u2019s lives that global standards are inevitable. But is it up to Europe to set the rules of the road \u2014 or, indeed, is that even possible?\u000a\u000aThe region\u2019s politicians may want to dictate what should, and should not, be allowed to happen online. But this stance will only make it harder to object when authoritarian regimes in China or Russia push their own (restricted) versions of the internet overseas, particularly in developing countries whose populations are only now starting to get connected.\u000a\u000aStill, many other countries are, for now, following Europe\u2019s lead, partly because of a lack of leadership on such topics from the United States.\u000a\u000aIf countries or regions start setting different online laws, the mostly unified digital world that we have come to rely on could quickly morph into a \u201csplinternet\u201d\u000a\u000aAntitrust investigations similar to those of the EU have started in India, authorities in Brazil have tried to access encrypted WhatsApp messages, and countries from Colombia to South Africa have adopted Europe\u2019s tough data privacy rules almost word for word.\u000a\u000aThe danger, though, is that Europe won\u2019t succeed in exporting its rules \u2014 only its interventionist approach.\u000a\u000aIf countries or regions start setting different online laws, the mostly unified digital world that we have come to rely on could quickly morph into a \u201csplinternet,\u201d with competing countries seeking to impose potentially contradictory legislation that would fracture the online world.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s hard to see how such a scenario \u2014 and we are already starting to see this digital Balkanization \u2014 would help anyone.\u000a\u000aMark Scott is chief technology correspondent at POLITICO.

aVLouise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, posted a cringe-worthy Instagram, followed by an oblivious public reply to a commenter yesterday, bragging about her designer clothes and the couple\u2019s vast wealth. In a now-deleted post, Linton, 36, a Scottish-born actress (her credits include exactly one episode each of Cold Case and CSI: NY ), stepped off a U.S. Air Force jet on the couple\u2019s federal government trip to Kentucky\u2019s Fort Knox and, like any dignified person might do in that situation, proceeded to Instagram the photo evidence along with her outfit credits, which were not tagged in the post, but hashtagged in succession: \u201c#roulandmouret pants, #tomford sunnies, #hermesscarf, #valentinorockstudheels #valentino.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt didn\u2019t end there for Linton, who married 54-year-old Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and film producer who is now fifth in line to the presidency, in June. When Instagram user @jennimiller29 commented, \u201cGlad we could pay for your little getaway #deplorable,\u201d Linton snapped back in a lengthy, deeply privileged, and totally oblivious reply.\u000a\u000a\u201cHave you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self-sacrifice to your country?\u201d Linton asked. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we paid more in taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\u201d After inserting strong-arm and kiss-face emojis, Linton quipped: \u201cYou\u2019re adorably out of touch.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhich was a pretty funny thing to say given that she is newly married to someone worth an estimated $300 million, is wearing $995 shoes, and, after deplaning a military jet, is framing their federally mandated tax bill and/or Mnuchin\u2019s White House role as a \u201csacrifice.\u201d Sadly, this \u201cpoor little rich people in government\u201d narrative has its roots with none other than the Trump family, who, during the presidential campaign, repeatedly characterized President Trump\u2019s candidacy as a \u201cgreat sacrifice.\u201d Linton may want to talk to some Gold Star families and revisit this argument.\u000a\u000aA Treasury Department official declined to comment to The New York Times regarding Linton\u2019s post, though they did clarify that the Mnuchins reimbursed the government for the trip, and that Linton was not compensated by any of the labels she promoted with hashtags. Still, this mini-scandal is ill-timed for Mnuchin, who is already under fire of late, after more than 300 graduates from his alma mater, Yale, wrote an open letter imploring him to resign in protest of Trump\u2019s comments equating Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville with their counter-protesters. Mnuchin replied by denying the president supports hate groups and, referring to the raging \u201cculture wars,\u201d saying that \u201csome of these issues are far more complicated than we are led to believe by the mass media.\u201d\u000a\u000aLinton has since deleted the post and made her Instagram account private. In the meantime, perhaps she puts on her #valentinorockstudheels, walks over to the East Wing, and offers her assistance with First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s long-in-the-works anti-cyberbullying initiative?

aVU.S. President Donald Trump | Pool photo by Chris Kleponis/Getty Images Most Americans say Trump\u2019s behavior \u2018not what I expect from a president\u2019: poll Survey comes amid a rocky month for the president.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump promised to bring a fresh, outsider approach to the Oval Office, but about 7 in 10 voters nonetheless say the commander in chief\u2019s behavior \u201cis not what I expect from a president,\u201d according to a poll released Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe George Washington University poll found that 71 percent of voters had that view of Trump\u2019s comportment in office, while 27 percent disagreed that his behavior was not what they expected.\u000a\u000aSixty-eight percent of registered voters said Trump\u2019s actions and rhetoric \u201ccould get us accidentally involved in an international conflict,\u201d while 29 percent disagreed with that statement, the poll found.\u000a\u000aThe poll comes amid a rocky August for the president, who has faced criticism for his response after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counterprotester dead. The poll also found that 42 percent of voters approve of the job Trump has done so far in office, while 55 percent disapprove. Fifty-six percent of registered voters said Trump has not been an effective president, while 39 percent said he had been.\u000a\u000aThe portion of voters with a favorable view of Trump \u2014 41 percent, compared to 56 percent with an unfavorable view \u2014 was higher in the poll than for both House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with 36 percent and 19 percent respectively viewing them favorably.\u000a\u000aBoth Republican congressional leaders have drawn ire from the president in recent days over the GOP\u2019s stalled legislative agenda \u2014 most notably a failure to follow through on a seven-year effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000aThe poll surveyed 1,009 registered voters nationwide from August 13-17, and it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

aVNew York\u2019s brash new landlord can afford to sit pretty. He has powerful friends, a beautiful wife, a football team, and some of the choicest turf in Manhattan. It\u2019s wild, it\u2019s crazy. Isn\u2019t it?\u000a\u000aRoy Cohn has a problem. It is mid-November, a peak month for New York hotel bookings, and an out-of-town client of his law firm, Saxe, Bacon & Bolan, is stuck for a room for the night. Another lawyer might tell the fellow to hike his grip down to the "Y," but Cohn is known around town as a fixer of sorts, a reputation that must constantly be nurtured by small favors. He decides to call another client, who happens to own two hotels in the city, the Grand Hyatt and the Barbizon Plaza. In the powerful New York triangle of politics, law, and real estate, the two men have what passes for a friendship. It is 8:30 in the morning, but the voice on the other end of the phone is full of brio. "Roy M. Hi. What's up? Who? Sorry, Roy, I think the Grand Hyatt is full. But how about the Barbizon? Hold on. Let me find out." There follows a partially muffled shout to an assistant in the next office to line up the room, then he's back on the phone. "Okay, I think we can book him into the Barbizon. Only for you, Roy."\u000a\u000aOnly for you, Roy. Or you, Hugh. Or Abe or Ed or Mario. Meet Donald Trump. Age 38. Eyebrows by Henry Luce. The sandy hair\u2014longish on the sides in a Chamber of Commerce sort of way and brushed flat over the ears\u2014by George Steinbrenner. The six-foot-two-inch frame is trim but well-nourished. The hands small and neatly groomed. The suit is blue and stylish\u2014maybe a little too flared in the leg for someone who lives east of the Hudson. About the only thing that gives away this striver from an outer borough are his cuff links: huge mollusks of gold and stone the size of half-dollars.\u000a\u000aThis story was originally published in the May 1984 issue of GQ.\u000a\u000aOn this brisk, fall morning, a visitor making one of many journeys to Donald Trump's offices on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan gets out of his cab in front of the building. Double-parked outside is a half-block-long Cadillac stretch limo with "DJT" vanity plates.\u000a\u000aUpstairs, not surprisingly, Trump is on the horn. "Yeah, eleven-thirty would be much better, Ben. I'll cancel somebody else and move them around a little bit. Okay pal. See you then." He swivels around to greet his new arrival. "That man is the head of an insurance company, a major one. He's having some people from California come to New York tomorrow, and he wants to show them some real estate. They represent a $4 billion account, and the only real estate they want to see is Trump Tower. That's all they want to see. It's crazy."\u000a\u000aEDITOR\u2019S PICK\u000a\u000aSuch is the newfound fame of Donald Trump. Not too long ago he was dismissed by the real estate establishment as little more than a mauve-suited sharpie with a big mouth. He got rid of the suits. Then, with a style that was considered bold in some quarters and smarmy in others, he cut a broad swath through prime blocks of Manhattan real estate, plastering the family name on any blank surface that rose and shined and, not incidentally, building more in the city of New York than anyone else in the past five years. Trump refurbished the bankrupt Commodore Hotel adjacent to Grand Central Station and turned it into one of the city's more spectacular new luxury hotels, the 1407-room Grand Hyatt. To tidy up the view, he cleaned and caulked the Forty-second Street facade of Grand Central, then leased and renovated the old Vanderbilt Athletic Club and renamed it The Tennis Club. Trump optioned a twenty-five-acre site of decaying waterfront property from the defunct Penn Central Railroad and then talked the city into using the site for its $450 million Convention Center. In May 1983 he finished Trump Tower, and last March opened Trump Plaza, a new, forty-story cooperative development on New York's Upper East Side, a block away from Bloomingdale's. Another project, Harrah's at Trump Plaza, the largest casino in Atlantic City, opens this month.\u000a\u000aTo the gray world of New York real estate, ruled for so long by the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Rudins, the LeFraks, and now the Reichmanns, Trump has infused a brand of freewheeling self-aggrandizement not seen since the days of the late, great Bill Zeckendorf. "My projects now sort of self-promote," says Donald. "And if there's a reason I'm good promotionally, it's that I know what people want. I am good in challenging situations. What I like is for people to tell me something can't be done when I think it can. In real estate, you deal with some very smart, very devious people. They're the sharpest wolves in the world. I've competed against them and I've come out fine."\u000a\u000aNowhere is this mix of real-estate hard sell and showbiz brashness more apparent than in Trump Tower, the trim, bronze, sixty-eight-story office, retail, and condominium complex that opened last year on the site of the old Bonwit Teller building at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-sixth Street.\u000a\u000aThere are only two types of people who live on Fifth Avenue in midtown: homeless derelicts, who sleep over the hot-air grates in front of Saks, and well-groomed members of the cabaret set, who prefer to set down roots in a neighborhood where groceries or even a bar of soap are a taxi ride away. The latter have decided to call Trump Tower's 268 condominium apartments home. (Trump has sold the apartments in the building as condominiums rather than co-ops. It ensures that no one with the right amount of money, regardless of its origins, will be given the heave-ho by a snooty co-op board.) For most new tenants, like Johnny Carson, Paul Anka, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg, Trump Tower will serve as a New York pied-à-terre. Across the hall from Johnny's new digs, the folks about to move in have been busy installing a swimming pool in their apartment. "It's actually three apartments\u2014one's a duplex," says Trump. "Two for living in and one just for the pool. Lots of saunas. It's strange. It's an unbelievable situation. There are some people that won't be here more than a week a year. It's crazy."\u000a\u000aThat may be an understatement. Try $600,000 for a cramped, L-shaped one-bedroom. The price is a million or more for the ninety-one larger apartments. When even the European cognoscenti balked at paying $12 million for the penthouse triplex, Trump took the place for himself.\u000a\u000aDown below on street level is where the rabble is supposed to ooh and aah. Entering the foyer, with its peach marble floor, ceiling and walls, produces a sort of vertigo. On rainy days, a spectator sport develops near the entrance where, unbeknownst to the first-time visitor, the floor cants somewhat to the six-story shopping atrium. There, with the marble greased by the water, tanned lady shoppers hit the incline, pick up speed and momentarily hydroplane before skittering to flat ground and safety.\u000a\u000aAh, but for the nimble of foot and the stout of pocketbook, Trump Tower's atrium is a veritable EPCOT for the advanced shopper. Retail tenants, says Trump, were chosen largely for their moneyed cachet. And indeed, shops such as Loewe, Asprey, Harry Winston, Cartier, and Buccellati can tame even the most hearty of spendthrifts. So intimidating are these outfits that at Christmastime last year, a number of tourists were seen tentatively peeking in through the window of the atrium's smoke shop, apparently afraid to enter this hallowed purveyor of magazines, cigarettes, and gum. "It's the greatest group of stores ever assembled under one roof," says Trump. "Well, it's probably the most expensive set of stores, certainly. And the greatest.\u000a\u000aAnd they're the most important stores." (Donald Trump's declarations have a habit of sliding up or down in magnitude. If he thinks he can get away with it, the statements become broader and more encompassing. When he has overstepped himself, he retrenches.) "People love Trump Tower because it's a scene, it's a talked-about scene. You know that people come from all over the world and say, 'We want to visit it.' It's become an attraction. All over the world they talk about this building. And they love it."\u000a\u000aEDITOR\u2019S PICK\u000a\u000aLast October, Trump paid Oklahoma oilman J. Walter Duncan about $6 million for the New Jersey Generals, one of eighteen teams in the fledgling United States Football League. The club, despite the presence of running back Herschel Walker, mustered a meager 6\u201312 record in a pretty meager league. "This football thing is crazy," says Trump. "I bought the team for very little money\u2014I paid much less than what is reported\u2014and we've created a value for it now. It's crazy what's happened."\u000a\u000aTrump kicked off his ownership with a hiring blitz. He got Gary Barbaro, the all-pro safety from Kansas City. Then he latched onto Dave Lapham, the veteran guard from the Bengals. Next, he wooed quarterback Brian Sipe away from the Browns with a two-year $1.9 million contract. Finally, he signed Bobby Leopold and Willie Harper from the 49ers. (To secure Walker from the NFL this spring, Trump gave his star back a four-year multimillion-dollar contract that Walker called "the best in the USFL and the National Football League.")\u000a\u000aWasting little time in clearing out the front office, Trump dumped coach Chuck Fairbanks and, after a widely reported courtship of Don Shula, hired former Jets coach Walt Michaels. Talks with Shula broke down, according to Trump, when the coach asked for the unaskable\u2014an apartment in Trump Tower. "That's something more valuable than money," said the owner at the time. "That's something I really consider gold." Shula recalls it differently: "All I did was listen to what he had to say. They approached me. I didn't approach them."\u000a\u000aThe staff scramble created a promotional windfall for Trump. During the winter, barely a day passed without a New York columnist trumpeting as an "exclusive" rumors of the new owner's latest acquisition. It could only have delighted Trump, who was enjoying a mano a mano publicity duel with New York's reigning sports baron, George Steinbrenner.\u000a\u000aHaving picked up the Generals for a relative song, Trump has kicked off his campaign for parity with the NFL, beginning with a little something he envisions as the "Galaxy Bowl," a play-off between the Super Bowl winner and the best team in the USFL. "I could have paid $40 or $50 million for an NFL team," says Trump. "I could have bought Baltimore. I could have bought a number of teams in the NFL. But I wanted a team in New York, and I couldn't buy the Giants or the Jets. Besides, it's more creative this way. In a couple of years, maybe the two leagues will be equal." (NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle's reply is typically oblique: "The USFL has to do what's in its best interest.")\u000a\u000aTrump's first plan of attack is to change the playing season. "Right now," he says, "I like the concept of playing in the fall and winter, head-on against the NFL. The league is very vulnerable." Says USFL Commissioner Chet Simmons: "What we have in Don is an active young guy who is doing a lot of thinking, some of it off-the-cuff."\u000a\u000aThe press generated from Trump's wild plans seems to have paid off. He claims that the Generals have sold more than 30,000 season tickets. "People are hungry for a winning team in New York," says Trump. Earlier this year, Trump signed linebacker Lawrence Taylor to a playing contract that would begin once his contract with the Giants runs out in 1987. When the Giants decided they wanted Taylor's services beyond his present contract, they had to go to Trump. He charged them a $700,000 contract buy-out fee.\u000a\u000aTrump Tower is what its owner brazenly calls "the Tiffany location." "When you're in real estate," he says, "the expression 'Tiffany location' means the best." The folks next door, at Tiffany's, might reasonably argue that they, in fact, occupy the Tiffany location. But Trump didn't get to be what he is, or where he is, by acknowledging the competition. Where he is now, of course, is not so far geographically from where he started. Just walk a few blocks down Fifth from Trump Tower to the E train subway station and take it to the last stop on the line\u2014Jamaica Estates, Queens. This is where Trump grew up.\u000a\u000aTo smooth out his tendency to bulldoze those around him, he was carted off to the New York Military Academy at Cornwall-on-Hudson. "When I graduated," he recalls, "I was, like, the top-ranking guy in terms of the military. That doesn't mean I was able to get along with people, because the reason I went in the first place was that I didn't get along with a lot of people." Summers were spent doing errands for his father, Fred C. Trump, a former carpenter who had built a small empire of middle-class apartment buildings in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.\u000a\u000aFred Sr., now 78, still manages the family's rental units out of a modest office in a red brick building at 600 Avenue Z in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. The office may be spare, but the bank account isn't. Forbes magazine has estimated Donald and his father's net worth to be in the $400 million bracket. Fred Jr., Donald's older brother, died of a heart ailment in 1981. One older sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is a federal judge in New Jersey. The other, Elizabeth Trump, is an administrative assistant at Chase Manhattan, and his brother Robert, 34, is an executive vice-president of the Trump Organization.\u000a\u000a"It's magnificent," Trump says of his new Atlantic City hotel. "It's three blocks long, it's a megastructure. It's incredible. It's the largest casino in the world. It just dominates."\u000a\u000aWhile at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Donald started putting together his first deals. "I began dabbling in real estate," he says, "buying brownstones, fixing them up a bit, and turning them over for a profit." In 1968 he joined the family-owned Trump Organization, by then landlord of 40,000 apartment units. It was all smalltime outer-borough stuff, though, and the newest member was busting to cross the East River into Manhattan. He'd already tested the waters once. "At one point, when I was very young," says Trump, "I was the producer of a Broadway play. Well, sort of a semiproducer. I helped raise money for a little show with Sam Levene and Molly Picon called Paris Is Out. I was only 22 years old. It's a crummy business."\u000a\u000aHe met Ivana Winkelmayr, his wife to be, at a party in New York, where the former Czech ski-team member was taking a break from her modeling career in Montreal. They were married within a year by the Trump family pastor, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale. The influence of the latter may excuse Trump's showroom description of the former: "My wife was the number-one model in Montreal for eight years." Now cast in the mold of Leona Helmsley and Luba Potamkin, Ivana Trump has become a primo collaborator in her husband's endeavors, in charge of overseeing all the decorating details. She has helped design everything from the New Jersey Generals' cheerleaders' uniforms, to the commodes in Atlantic City, to the interior of their fifteen-bedroom Georgian manor house in Connecticut, to the lobby of Trump Tower. "We demolished a mountain of marble for Trump Tower," she boasts. "Twenty-five hundred tons. Then, believe it or not, one store tried to sneak Formica into their space and install nylon carpet instead of 100 percent wool."\u000a\u000aIn between meetings with contractors and designers at Trump Plaza and in Atlantic City, Ivana has been working on the triplex apartment atop Trump Tower, where the couple and their three children moved in March. "On the first floor here is the living room, dining room, kitchen, and entertainment rooms," she says. "The second floor has a balcony looking over the living room. On this floor is our bedroom, with a sitting room for us to watch a romantic movie or for Don to watch a football game. There are our bathrooms and our closets. And from the little bedroom on the second floor you can look down here into the living room, because everything is glass. It's a double-height living room. The third floor has the children's room and the maid's room, and the guest rooms. And then there is an elevator that services all three floors."\u000a\u000aAs in the movies, success in real estate often depends on the deal, and Trump, in his relatively short career, has proved himself a remarkably deft dealmaker. The Trump family's strong ties to the Brooklyn Democratic machine that launched the political careers of New York Governor Hugh Carey and New York Mayor Abe Beame haven't done Donald's career any harm either. "I got along with Carey," says Donald. "He was very good, and he was a good governor." Both Carey and Beame were in power in the mid-Seventies, when New York was facing bankruptcy and Trump made his first big deal\u2014a very complex one\u2014to build the Grand Hyatt Hotel. "The city was dead," says Donald. "As dead as it could be."\u000a\u000aEDITOR\u2019S PICK\u000a\u000aFor $500,000 he took an option on the Commodore Hotel, then owned by the Penn Central. When he heard that Hyatt was looking for a New York hotel site, he struck a partnership: Trump would build it on the land he had just leased, and Hyatt would manage it. With the help of George Peacock, now a senior vice-president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, Trump rounded up tentative pledges for $70 million in mortgage money. "So I took this commitment, which was a statement with a hundred stipulations in it, to the city," Trump told The New York Times. "One of the conditions was that I would obtain a tax abatement. I told the city, I will build you this incredible, gorgeous, gleaming hotel. I will put people to work in the construction trades and save hotel jobs, and the Grand Central area, which was pretty depressing at the time, will come around. So the city made a deal."\u000a\u000aThrough an intricate financing package, Trump is now co-owner of the Grand Hyatt without having invested his own money. Then there is the abatement, which exempts the hotel from paying city taxes for the next forty years and is estimated to be worth $50 million. "Who knew that it would turn out as great as it did?" says Trump. "I didn't. I thought it could be fine, I thought it could be okay. And it's turned out to have the highest occupancy in New York. I don't know if you call that vision or luck. Perhaps it's a combination of both. It was all timing. In another year, I wouldn't have gotten the abatement."\u000a\u000aBut the Hyatt deal was just a warm-up for the main act, Trump Tower. A pattern would begin to develop. All of Trump's real estate projects are owned solely by himself and one major high ticket co-venturer. For Trump Tower it was again Equitable. "The Hyatt got us acquainted with Donald, and that led us to the next big one," says Peacock. An aide to Hugh Carey, Louise M. Sunshine (who is now, along with Ivana and Robert Trump, a Trump Organization executive vice-president), provided Donald with an introduction to David Evins, a major stockholder in Genesco, then the owner of Bonwit Teller. Conversation revealed that the cash-poor conglomerate might be willing to sell its lease on the building. Equitable owned the land under the building, and Tiffany's owned the air rights over it.\u000a\u000aChase financed the $24 million needed for all rights to the plot and then syndicated the entire $150 million construction loan. Trump sold the condominium apartments for $277 million. He and Equitable had split their first round of profits before any of the tenants had even moved in. "So we have about a $277 million sellout," says Trump, "just for the upper half of the building. And then we own the lower half for nothing." The partnership, unencumbered by mortgages, now collects the rents from thirteen floors of office space at $50 a square foot and the six levels of retail space at $150 to $450 a square foot. "It's a crazy deal," says Trump. "It's better than working."\u000a\u000aTrump's accomplishments have not been without cost both to the architectural heritage of the city and to the builder's own reputation. A lot of people just don't like Donald Trump very much. It probably started during the clean-up of Grand Central, when he hung an enormous banner over the side of the terminal with trump in big, bold letters. Destroying two bas-reliefs from the front of Bonwit Teller that had been promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art did not further endear him to the public.\u000a\u000aTrump's version: "That's so overplayed, it's ridiculous. There was a good reason for doing that, which has not been explained well, with the insurance and the problems and the fact that it wasn't practical. We went through a whole zoning thing that lasted a year and a half, and nobody ever mentioned those two sculptures. Taking them down was very dangerous. If they broke, they would have fallen all over Fifth Avenue. They weren't even sculptures. They were stones with some engraving on them. They were nothing. Just junk."\u000a\u000aFrom the Metropolitan comes a slightly different view. "They were irreplaceable architectural documents," says Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, who handled the negotiations with Trump for the Met. "One of the friezes, a grillwork by Ely Jacques Kahn, was a textbook example of the 'moderne' style." Indeed, the "stones with some engraving on them" were appraised by Robert Miller of the Robert Miller Gallery at $250,000. Trump, says Miller, "is not an esthetic person."\u000a\u000aMore bad publicity followed Trump's tactics in trying to force out tenants from one of the apartment buildings he owns on Central Park South, maneuvers that included offering vacant apartments in the building to the homeless and covering up empty apartment windows and street-level storefronts with tin sheeting. Trump's version: "It's a building of a hundred rent-controlled units. There are multimillionaires living in the building\u2026or very wealthy people at least. Some pay as little as $300 or $400 a month. Actually, offering the apartments to the homeless wasn't such a good idea. In New York City, even if they don't have a lease, you can't get them out. It's the law. It's incredible. If I had put the homeless in there, I wouldn't have been able to get them out either. I'd have had to start the whole cycle over again. It's crazy."\u000a\u000aIt is nearing the end of winter, and young Donald's fancy turns to the two Trump projects nearing completion: the co-op on Manhattan's East Side and the hotel-casino in Atlantic City. But first, Donald wants to talk about the one that got away. "I offered to build the convention center [in New York City] for $250 million," says Trump. He also wanted to name it The Trump Convention Center, an appellation the city balked at. "It will now probably cost them over $450 million. Everybody had a site, you know, build it here, build it there, build it in Times Square. But ultimately they picked ours. The overruns aren't my fault. I got the land and got them to build on it and everything else. They blew it after that."\u000a\u000aConversely, Trump Plaza benefited from sheer promotional momentum. "I was watching the U.S. Open on television," Donald recalls, "when Martina Navratilova won. There were hundreds of photographers and reporters around her. She moved to the microphone, put down her trophy, and said something to the effect of, 'I thank you for the check. Now I'm going to buy an apartment at Trump Plaza in New York.' Now this is in a stadium filled with 20,000 people, on national television, international television, probably world television, and she said, 'I'm going to take this check and immediately run over and buy an apartment at Trump Plaza.'" And Navratilova did just that. So did Rawleigh Warner of Mobil Oil and former Kentucky governor John Y. Brown and his wife, Phyllis George. The $50 million cooperative development has also attracted a "lower echelon" of West Coast types on the order of Dick Clark, Chuck Barris, Norman Fell, and Regis Philbin. You get the idea.\u000a\u000aEDITOR\u2019S PICK\u000a\u000aOn an inspection tour of the building, Donald is all compliments. "Isn't that a great-looking elevator system? Gorgeous job, isn't it?" A saleswoman making the tour with him is herself a wellspring of enthusiasm. "The kitchens are small because most of our buyers are not that interested in cooking," she gushes. "They are people who, when they eat in, order intimate little dinner parties from The Silver Palate. And this over here is the third bedroom, which a lot of people use as a den because it's so well located. This room was designed by Angelo Donghia, who is kind of the doyen of everything!"\u000a\u000aTalk then turns to the deal in Atlantic City. Trump bought the land for the hotel cheap, before the referendum that brought gambling to the resort. The $250 million project, which looks like nothing less than two '58 Edsel grills placed together to form an inverted "T," should catch the weekend gambler's eye, even among the other garish monstrosities in Atlantic City. It certainly has caught Trump's. "I think it's going to be an incredible building," he says. "I think it's going to be the largest and one of the most spectacular hotels anywhere in the world. It's magnificent. It's three blocks long. It's a megastructure. It's incredible. It's the largest casino in the world. It just dominates."\u000a\u000aOn the way back to Trump Tower, the car glides by Central Park South. "I own the Barbizon Plaza. I own the whole block on Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas," says Donald, with a trace of exaggeration. (His two buildings probably comprise less than a sixth of the block.) "I could just leave the building standing and convert it to co-ops, but I don't want to do that, because it would be like a desecration of the Avenue of the Americas site." (Trump always calls Sixth Avenue, Avenue of the Americas. There is not a New Yorker alive who refers to the street by this name, except Trump. It probably sounds classier to deep-pocket Europeans.)\u000a\u000a"Right now I'm sort of assessing the alternatives," says Trump, who in the days ahead will announce expansive but tentative ideas for the future: plans for erecting the tallest building in the world, or putting together a deal for a giant domed stadium in the Bronx. "There are lots of crazy alternatives. A lot of things can happen. I don't know what is going to happen over the next ten years. I just couldn't predict. We've done a lot. I guess we've done as much as anybody in terms of business." Which reminds him: "Did you see that article on me in the business section of the [New York] Sunday Times?" (Had the visitor not seen it, he surely couldn't have missed the Lucite-framed copy that rests on the windowsill in Trump's office.) "That was the largest story the Times supposedly has ever done on the business page. It was big. Let's see\u2026it was half a front page, and a whole back page and some more. It was crazy. They tell me it was the longest story ever done on a person as a profile. They did a larger story on IBM. That was literally the largest, but it couldn't have been much longer. It was wild."\u000a\u000aAs the limo turns down Fifth Avenue, Trump motions about the car. "A coach-maker did this for me. It's wild, isn't it? We have the wet bar, the whole thing, the whole kaboodle. Look, it's got a TV and a radio." He leans forward to the driver. "Hey, Tony. You hear we just signed Freddie Gilbert, Herschel's friend from Georgia?" Before Tony can answer, Trump's mind is racing ahead to the view out the side window. "Did you ever pass Trump Tower at night and see the way it glows?" he asks. "It almost glows in the dark. That's because I used real bronze. If you get imitations, it doesn't look the same. It looks like nothing." He settles back into his seat. "I'm a first-class sort of person. I only go first class."

aVEXECUTIVE ORDER\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a- - - - - - -\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES\u000a\u000aBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:\u000a\u000aSection 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.\u000a\u000a(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).\u000a\u000a(i) Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: "(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists." 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.\u000a\u000a(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: "Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate." 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\u000a\u000a(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.\u000a\u000a(iv) Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.\u000a\u000a(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the "political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions" about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.\u000a\u000a(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.\u000a\u000a(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:\u000a\u000a(i) Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\u000a\u000a(ii) Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.\u000a\u000a(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.\u000a\u000a(iv) Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.\u000a\u000a(v) Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.\u000a\u000a(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.\u000a\u000a(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.\u000a\u000a(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.\u000a\u000a(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u000a\u000a(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.\u000a\u000aSec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.\u000a\u000a(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.\u000a\u000a(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.\u000a\u000a(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.\u000a\u000a(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.\u000a\u000a(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.\u000a\u000a(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.\u000a\u000aSec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension.\u000a\u000a(a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:\u000a\u000a(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;\u000a\u000a(ii) did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and\u000a\u000a(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.\u000a\u000a(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:\u000a\u000a(i) any lawful permanent resident of the United States;\u000a\u000a(ii) any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;\u000a\u000a(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;\u000a\u000a(iv) any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;\u000a\u000a(v) any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or\u000a\u000a(vi) any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u000a\u000a(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:\u000a\u000a(i) the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;\u000a\u000a(ii) the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;\u000a\u000a(iii) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;\u000a\u000a(iv) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;\u000a\u000a(v)the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;\u000a\u000a(vi) the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;\u000a\u000a(vii) the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;\u000a\u000a(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or\u000a\u000a(ix) the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.\u000a\u000aSec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.\u000a\u000aSec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.\u000a\u000a(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.\u000a\u000a(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual's entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.\u000a\u000a(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.\u000a\u000aSec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.\u000a\u000aSec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.\u000a\u000a(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.\u000a\u000aSec. 9. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.\u000a\u000a(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.\u000a\u000aSec. 10. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.\u000a\u000aSec. 11. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following information:\u000a\u000a(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-security-related reasons;\u000a\u000a(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States;\u000a\u000a(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called "honor killings," in the United States by foreign nationals; and\u000a\u000a(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.\u000a\u000a(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall release the initial report under subsection (a) of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this order and shall include information for the period from September 11, 2001, until the date of the initial report. Subsequent reports shall be issued every 180 days thereafter and reflect the period since the previous report.\u000a\u000aSec. 12. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with appropriate domestic and international partners, including countries and organizations, to ensure efficient, effective, and appropriate implementation of the actions directed in this order.\u000a\u000a(b) In implementing this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, as appropriate, those providing an opportunity for individuals to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determination for aliens covered by section 235(b)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A).\u000a\u000a(c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order.\u000a\u000a(d) Any individual whose visa was marked revoked or marked canceled as a result of Executive Order 13769 shall be entitled to a travel document confirming that the individual is permitted to travel to the United States and seek entry. Any prior cancellation or revocation of a visa that was solely pursuant to Executive Order 13769 shall not be the basis of inadmissibility for any future determination about entry or admissibility.\u000a\u000a(e) This order shall not apply to an individual who has been granted asylum, to a refugee who has already been admitted to the United States, or to an individual granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, consistent with the laws of the United States.\u000a\u000aSec. 13. Revocation. Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017, is revoked as of the effective date of this order.\u000a\u000aSec. 14. Effective Date.

aV(WASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 17, 2017) \u2013 U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer today announced an agreement reached with the government of Colombia to allow for expanded market access for U.S. exports of paddy rice.\u000a\u000aA previous agreement in 2012 between both countries enabled exports of U.S. paddy rice to Colombia, but under strict and costly requirements related to phytosanitary concerns. The new agreement lifts these requirements and expands access beyond the single port of Barranquilla, which was the only port previously open to U.S. exporters.\u000a\u000aThe new agreement reflects the close trade ties between the United States and Colombia, and the high quality and safe rice produced by the U.S. rice industry. The agreement, combined with preferential access under the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA), will further accelerate increased U.S. exports of food and agriculture to Colombia.\u000a\u000aUSDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said:\u000a\u000a\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is another great testament of our determination to expand export opportunities for America\u2019s farmers and ranchers and to ensure fair trade with our international partners. This agreement expands opportunities for U.S. rice producers in the important Colombian market. It also underscores the value of improved relationships to solve problems, based on a solid trade agreement that benefits both parties and on a commitment to science-based rule-making.\u201d\u000a\u000aU.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, said:\u000a\u000a\u201cI welcome this new agreement and the expanded market access and opportunity it will afford to U.S. exporters of paddy rice.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis outcome is a result of the Administration\u2019s efforts to enforce international trade commitments on behalf of the American people, and to deepen our bilateral ties with key trading partners, particularly allies like Colombia.\u201d\u000a\u000aBackground:\u000a\u000aColombia is the United States\u2019 12th largest export market for food and agricultural products, with exports valued at over $2.4 billion in 2016 \u2013 a sharp increase over exports prior to completion of the CTPA, when Colombia ranked as the 26th market for U.S. food and agricultural exports in 2011, with an associated value of $1.12 billion. Exports of milled rice to Colombia have increased dramatically since entry into force of the CTPA in 2012, averaging $79 million per year compared to $3 million in 2011.\u000a\u000aExports of paddy rice since 2012, when the CTPA entered into force and the letter exchange provided for market access, have constituted a small but growing share of total U.S. rice exports to Colombia, reaching $15 million in 2016. Under the new agreement on paddy rice, costly and unnecessary fumigation and processing requirements are rescinded, and access expanded to all ports of entry in Colombia.\u000a\u000aPaddy rice, also known as \u201crough rice,\u201d is the whole rice grain, along with its hulls. It is harvested directly from rice fields or paddies and transported or exported to processing facilities. As part of the processing, the protective hull is removed, leaving only the actual rice kernel for consumption. By leaving the sturdy hull on, it is possible to store the kernels for several months without incurring product losses due to spoiling or infestation.\u000a\u000a#\u000a\u000aUSDA is an equal opportunity lender, provider and employer.

aVPresident Donald Trump will hold a huge campaign rally in scorching Phoenix, Arizona, this evening, a day after he flip-flopped on one of his major campaign promises by sounding like a \u201cclassic neocon\u201d during his Monday speech on Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aTrump will rally his supporters as reports surface that his administration may be more willing than ever to give permanent amnesty to those who received President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty as part of a larger comprehensive immigration deal.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThere are other subplots to watch as well. Kelli Ward, who is challenging \u201cNever Trump\u201d Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), will be at the rally while Sheriff Joe Arpaio will reportedly not get a pardon tonight. Some have wondered if Trump will also attack Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who is battling an aggressive brain cancer. And Phoenix\u2019s Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, said he hoped Trump would not come to Phoenix after Charlottesville. Trump also canceled a planned visit to the U.S.-Mexico border earlier in the day.\u000a\u000aStay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates throughout the evening.

aVJournalists and pundits greeted President Donald Trump\u2019s Afghanistan speech with a rare chorus of cheers. Fox News and its guests were effusive in their praise; New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman tweeted that Trump \u201cgave his best speech as POTUS.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reason for the media\u2019s reversal was not the content of the speech, but the fact that Trump had clearly and deliberately rejected a policy on which he had campaigned.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000aThat is not to say Trump was wrong to make the change. His earlier calls \u2014 predating his run for president \u2014 for total withdrawal look naïve in light of the rise of the so-called Islamic State.\u000a\u000aAnd, indeed, Trump acknowledged that in his speech. In an extraordinary and honest gesture of humility, Trump said: \u201c[D]ecisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, in other words, when you\u2019re president of the United States.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe provided three compelling reasons not to leave Afghanistan: first, the sacrifices that Americans had made thus far demanded \u201can honorable and enduring outcome\u201d; second, the nation had learned from Barack Obama\u2019s hasty withdrawal from Iraw just how dangerous a vacuum could be; and third, the U.S. still faced grave security threats from the region. All presidents change their minds; few explain clearly why they have arrived at different opinions.\u000a\u000aAnd yet the speech lacked a compelling vision of what staying in Afghanistan actually meant, and what strategic goals the U.S. wanted to achieve (rather than what defeats the U.S. wanted to avoid). Trump did not need to give troop numbers, battle plans, or timelines for withdrawal, but he needed to provide an overall sense of America\u2019s role in the region. He did not. And thus the speech was largely a retread of Obama\u2019s policy, minus deadlines and details.\u000a\u000aThat is precisely why the media praised Trump\u2019s speech. It affirmed Obama\u2019s approach to Afghanistan, and thus the speech meant that the media, too \u2014 Obama\u2019s Greek chorus for eight years \u2014 had been right not to doubt him.\u000a\u000aFew in the media asked questions about where Trump\u2019s policy would lead. They were satisfied that he had largely affirmed the status quo. In their applause, there was more than a hint of hope that he would do the same on other issues, too.\u000a\u000aAbove all, the media treated the speech as a victory lap in their efforts to dislodge Steve Bannon, who was widely reported to have opposed a massive surge of troops into Afghanistan.\u000a\u000aThe White House will, no doubt, enjoy the media\u2019s temporary praise, and see it as a validation of its decisions on policy and personnel. But it will not last, and Trump has taken the risky step of allowing the media to believe they can separate him from his ideas and his voters.\u000a\u000aJoel B.

aVRepresentative Carlos Curbelo, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the House, has said that the Climate Solutions Caucus has grown faster than he expected | Astrid Riecken/Getty Images More Republican lawmakers bucking their party on climate change But if the Republican Party is undergoing a shift on climate, it is at its earliest, most incremental stage.\u000a\u000aLOS ANGELES \u2014 While President Donald Trump continues to dismantle Obama-era climate policies, an unlikely surge of Republican lawmakers has begun taking steps to distance themselves from the Republicans\u2019 hard line on climate change.\u000a\u000aThe House Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan backwater when it formed early last year, has more than tripled in size since January, driven in part by Trump\u2019s decision in June to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.\u000a\u000aAnd last month, 46 Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill that would have deleted a requirement that the Defense Department prepare for the effects of climate change.\u000a\u000aThe willingness of some Republicans to buck their party on climate change could help burnish their moderate credentials ahead of the 2018 elections. Of the 26 Republican caucus members, all but five represent districts targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee next year.\u000a\u000aBut it has also buoyed activists who view the House members\u2019 positioning as a rare sign of Republican movement on climate change.\u000a\u000a\u201cStrangely, President Trump helped us,\u201d said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman whose views on climate change contributed to his defeat in a South Carolina primary in 2010. \u201cHis withdrawal from Paris dramatically increased the number of [internet] searches about climate change and increased interest \u2026 People are getting more and more uncomfortable with the nuttiness of these positions.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a Republican-held Congress, Inglis said, voting to reject a Republican-backed amendment to the defense authorization bill was \u201ca big step for these members \u2026 Members of Congress who are attuned to their districts apparently are picking up on the reality that Americans on both left and right are concerned about climate change.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf the Republican Party is undergoing a shift on climate, it is at its earliest, most incremental stage. Rejection of mainstream climate science remains widespread within the Republican Party. Trump has called climate change a \u201choax,\u201d and he infuriated environmentalists again this week when he repealed a flood standard for federally funded infrastructure projects.\u000a\u000aThe Climate Solutions Caucus itself represents only a minority of the Republican conference. And its members have been criticized by environmental activists for their records on issues ranging from oil drilling to climate research, some posting lifetime scores in single digits on the League of Conservation Voters\u2019 environmental scorecard.\u000a\u000aRepresentative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat who founded the climate caucus with fellow Floridian Carlos Curbelo, a Republican, said Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement was so jarring that \u201csome of my colleagues were looking for ways to show that they actually do want to respond.\u201d But at least two Republican members of the caucus \u2014 Reps. Tom Reed and Claudia Tenney of New York \u2014 supported Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the accord.\u000a\u000a\u201cI tend to call it the \u2018Climate Peacocks Caucus\u2019 \u2026 people who express great concern and then vote the wrong way,\u201d said R.L. Miller, founder of the super-PAC Climate Hawks Vote. \u201cObviously, the caucus is growing in popularity. But my overall sense is that it is being used as political cover. It is no coincidence that the Republicans who joined are on that red-to-blue flip-able list.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlex Taurel, deputy legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters, said \u201cthere is a wide variety of support for action on climate change, and not just sort of rhetorically accepting the science.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, in their vote on the defense authorization bill, Republicans fought to keep language declaring \u201cclimate change is a direct threat to the national security of the United States and is impacting stability in areas of the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaurel said it is \u201cstill too early to know what that vote kind of signifies. But if it represents a harbinger that the caucus is going to start to support things together to reduce carbon pollution, then that\u2019s a real development.\u201d\u000a\u000aCurbelo, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the House, said this week that the Climate Solutions Caucus has grown faster than he expected and that \u201ctwo years ago, I don\u2019t think you could find more than two or three Republicans in the House who were willing to go on record in a significant way\u201d on climate change. He said the group is now focused on \u201cblocking and tackling \u2026 opposing anti-climate legislation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the next phase, and hopefully we can get to that this Congress, is to turn the caucus into an ideas factory, get behind proactive legislation,\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cI think the vast majority of House Republicans are shifting toward accepting the science and openness toward at least modest policy prescriptions.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Republicans, the most politically palatable opening on climate change appears to be on spending, not regulation. Representative John Faso, a top target of Democrats in New York, said Republicans should push in their infrastructure talks for money to help local and state governments \u201charden their infrastructure\u201d to gird against climate change. He also suggested including incentives for agriculture-friendly carbon sequestration programs in the farm bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cYes, we can show that the climate is changing, yes we can attribute at least some of that change to human activity. The question, ultimately, is if you adopt certain measures, does this appreciably slow the climate change and at what cost are those measures to be implemented,\u201d Faso said. \u201cI do think that if we concentrate on things that are economically viable and scientifically sustainable and approvable and achievable, then we can address this issue.\u201d\u000a\u000aDeutch said he is \u201cconfident that we will come up with an agenda that the caucus as a whole can support.\u201d\u000a\u000aFew politicians or strategists of either major political party expect climate change to factor more significantly in 2018 than the economy, health care or myriad other issues. But public polling suggests increasing public concern about the changing climate, and Democrats are already hitting Republicans on the issue in competitive districts.\u000a\u000aDoug Applegate, who nearly toppled Representative Darrell Issa in 2016 and is among the Democrats challenging him again in his Southern California district, said that \u201con certain days of the week \u2026 [Issa] pops up and tries to sound like a moderate Republican.\u201d And Andy Thorburn, one of several Democrats vying to unseat Representative Ed Royce in California\u2019s Orange County, called Royce\u2019s membership in the climate caucus \u201csheep\u2019s clothing for the wolf \u2026 because his record there is abysmal.\u201d\u000a\u000aDave Gilliard, a strategist for four of California\u2019s seven targeted Republicans, including Issa and Royce, said of Issa\u2019s membership in the climate caucus, \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it from the political side \u2026 We have had no discussions on the campaign side about climate change being something we need to jump on from a political issue next year.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI would say that it matters to a very narrow constituency, probably,\u201d Gilliard said.\u000a\u000aIssa, who was once given a \u201cClimate Change Denier\u201d award by the League of Conservation Voters, said this week that he stands by his controversial, 2009 statement about the \u201cwide range of scientific opinion\u201d on climate change. Issa, who called Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris agreement \u201cill-advised,\u201d said \u201clong-term trends for warming are settled,\u201d as is \u201cthe fact that we are producing human CO2 emissions that are going into the atmosphere.\u201d But he said calculations about dangerous tipping points are not resolved, and he criticized Obama for disregarding Republicans on the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere wasn\u2019t that opportunity to say, \u2018What are the things we can do \u2026 how can we increase sustainability?\u201d Issa said, adding that Republicans now have an opportunity to address \u201cwhat is our glidepath to a sustainable ecology.\u201d\u000a\u000aJill Sigal, a former energy official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration and executive vice president of the Climate Leadership Council, a conservative group pushing for a carbon tax, said growth in the Climate Solutions Caucus has given her \u201cincreasing hope\u201d in the ability of Congress to work on climate change.\u000a\u000aInglis, who once dismissed climate change as \u201ca bunch of hooey\u201d but now advocates on the subject, called it \u201cvery exciting.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that all the folks in the caucus are ready to, you know, charge the barricades on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all signed up for that. But they are enlisting for inquiry into action on climate change \u2026 And that we will take and celebrate.\u201d

aV\u201cI\u2018d rather not say a number and then have to change it later on. Let me look at the plan that the military brings me,\u201d Mattis said. \u201dWe\u2019ve given them the strategic goals. They now have to line up the different things they have to do, assign troops to each one of those efforts. Once I see that, look at the number we have on the ground, reorganize those on the ground to align with new strategy and then [I\u2019ll] bring in whatever gap fillers I need.\u201d

aVFor European shipowners faced with scrapping a tanker at the end of its working life, it\u2019s a no-brainer: sell it for \u20ac3 million to be broken up for scrap on a beach in Bangladesh, or recycle it in an environmentally friendly shipyard that complies with EU standards \u2014 and get nothing.\u000a\u000aThe vast majority of EU shipowners choose the former option, often changing the flag of registry on their aging ships for just a few thousand euros \u2014 but now Brussels plans to crack down on a practice that is polluting beaches in the developing world and putting lives at risk.\u000a\u000aWith efforts to come up with financial incentives to get shipowners to choose EU-approved yards currently becalmed, the European Commission has decided to update a worldwide list of shipyards that meet European social and environmental standards \u2014 by this fall \u2014 and oblige owners of commercial vessels flying an EU country flag to use EU-compliant facilities for recycling by 2019.\u000a\u000aNGOs fear those rules will remain largely toothless, because EU shipowners can simply change the flag of registry of their vessels for as little as \u20ac2,400 before sending them off to be scrapped in foreign yards that don\u2019t meet EU standards. Although 40 percent of the world\u2019s fleet is controlled by EU entities, only around 20 percent fly a EU flag, a share that falls to 9 percent for end-of-life ships, according to a study by the European Commission.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn theory, it should be very easy for European shipowners to pick a EU recognized yard, but the reality shows that the vast majority of EU-owned or EU-flagged end-of-life vessels end up for dangerous and dirty breaking on beaches of Bangladesh, India or Pakistan,\u201d said Ingvild Jenssen, founder and director at NGO Shipbreaking Platform, a coalition of 19 organizations working to prevent pollution and unsafe working conditions caused by beaching \u2014 the practice of running old ships aground on third-world beaches.\u000a\u000aBeaching is by far the most common shipbreaking method in South Asia, according to Shipbreaking Platform. It says 86 percent of the world\u2019s end-of-life tonnage was broken on beaches in 2016. The practice is very polluting and the working conditions are \u201cappalling,\u201d Jenssen said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the NGO, at least 22 workers were killed in Bangladeshi yards in 2016 and 29 suffered severe injuries. Last year saw the worst catastrophe in the history of the industry, when 28 workers were killed and more than 50 injured when an explosion and a massive fire ripped through a tanker beached in Gadani, Pakistan.\u000a\u000aIn Bangladesh, unskilled workers \u2014 many of them under 18 \u2014 cut vessels apart for an estimated $3 for a 12- to 16-hour working day, according to a report by the European Economic and Social Committee. The life expectancy for men in the shipbreaking industry is 20 years lower than for Bangladeshi men in the general population.\u000a\u000aMost of a ship\u2019s steel is coated with paint containing lead, mercury, zinc, arsenic and chromium, according to a study by the International Law and Policy Institute. The tides also wash out PCBs, asbestos and huge quantities of oil from beached ships.\u000a\u000aInstead, EU rules mandate that approved facilities must have impermeable floors and dismantling must be done without the elements coming in contact with the sea or \u201cany other permeable surface such as sand or gravel.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut tough environmental standards and well-paid workers mean that shipowners shy away from using EU-approved yards.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are handicapped by the high costs of labor, social charges and taxes,\u201d said Antonio Barredo, managing director of DDR Vessels, a Spanish decontamination, dismantling and recycling company.\u000a\u000aAsian yards also have an advantage over their European rivals because they are closer to local steel industries. \u201cThe reason why the yards in Asia are interested in recycling the ships is because they use the scrap,\u201d said Patrick Verhoeven, secretary-general of the European Community Shipowners\u2019 Associations, an industry group. \u201cThere is a live steel scrap industry \u2013 which we do not have in Europe. It does not make economic sense to do it here.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a result, the French port of Bordeaux, one of 18 EU-approved facilities, currently dismantles one ship a year, which is usually a vessel owned by public entities.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have room for 10 ships a year,\u201d said Patrick Brocart, director for shipyards at the port of Bordeaux. \u201cToday we are a very small player.\u201d\u000a\u000aMoney talks\u000a\u000aMost European shipowners are taking a hard look at the bottom line when deciding what to do with their old vessels, and for now profit wins out over environmental worries.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, 328 vessels owned by EU entities or bearing EU flags were dismantled, of which 84 percent were beached in South Asia, Jenssen said.\u000a\u000aAccording to the NGO, German shipowners were responsible for 97 ships rammed up on the beaches of South Asia out of a total of 99 vessels sold for demolition. Greece was responsible for 104 vessels sold to South Asian shipbreaking yards in 2016, the highest absolute number for an EU country.\u000a\u000aOne solution being mulled in Brussels is to give shipowners a financial incentive to use cleaner yards.\u000a\u000aThe idea would be to charge a fee to all ships calling at an EU port. The money collected over a ship\u2019s lifetime would be refunded if it was eventually scrapped at an EU-approved yard. The scheme was supported by NGOs and the European shipyard industry, but strongly opposed by shipowners, who complained it would disrupt efforts for a global solution brokered by the International Maritime Organization. Although the organization adopted the Hong Kong Convention on the safe disposal of ships in 2009, it still hasn\u2019t come into force because too few countries have ratified it. The association of international shipowners has only voluntary guidelines.\u000a\u000aVerhoeven warned that even if the EU agrees on a financial incentive aimed at cancelling out the difference between dismantling in South Asia and using EU-approved yards, it would be ineffective because European yards have a capacity shortage \u2013 an argument yards here reject.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe do have capacity in Europe, but it is not adequate to dismantle the big bunker vessels or container vessels,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do not think we will ever have it, unless a government or the EU decides to put money in creating these facilities.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the end, the Commission balked at introducing the fee, calling for \u201cfurther analysis\u201d of the measure\u2019s compatibility with EU and international law.\u000a\u000aInstead, the Commission is hoping moral persuasion does the trick \u2014 saying its updated list of shipyards, for which it has received 22 applications from outside the bloc, will still have a global impact. \u201cApplications to the list have come from facilities in different regions of the world, including South Asia,\u201d said a Commission spokesperson. \u201cThis suggests that the list will be a reference for the whole sector, irrelevant of flag.\u201d
