V\u201cI think Mitch McConnell, and to a degree, Paul Ryan. They do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented,\u201d Steve Bannon said in an interview. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Bannon: McConnell, Ryan 'trying to nullify the 2016 election'\u000a\u000aFormer White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told CBS this week that Washington\u2019s \u201cRepublican establishment,\u201d including the top GOP leaders in both houses of Congress, \u201cis trying to nullify the 2016 election.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat more traditional Republicans are looking to undermine President Donald Trump, Bannon said, is as \u201cobvious as night follows day.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election. That's a brutal fact we have to face,\u201d Bannon said in an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that will air on Sunday. Bannon\u2019s interviewer, CBS anchor Charlie Rose, responded by asking the former White House adviser to name names.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Mitch McConnell, and to a degree, Paul Ryan. They do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented,\u201d Bannon replied. \u201cIt's obvious as night follows day is what they're trying to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aPressed further by Rose, Bannon recalled an early meeting between McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Trump inside the president\u2019s Manhattan skyscraper. McConnell, Bannon recalled, told Trump that \u201cI don't want to hear anymore of this 'drain the swamp' talk,\u201d a reference to the president\u2019s anti-corruption catchphrase on the campaign trail. \u201cMcConnell was, Day One, did not want to go there. Wanted us to back off,\u201d Bannon said.\u000a\u000aAt another point in his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Bannon explained that Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, on which he can be heard describing to co-host Billy Bush in vulgar terms how his celebrity allowed him to sexually assault women without consequence, proved to be a \u201clitmus test\u201d for those around the president.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aBannon recalled the early October Saturday during last year\u2019s presidential campaign after The Washington Post first published the tape, prompting the Trump campaign to hold a meeting on what to do. The former White House strategist said Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff who was then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the president \u201cyou have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history."\u000a\u000aAnd while that negative forecast did not wind up costing Priebus a job in the White House, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was not so lucky. Bannon recalled that the governor, a top surrogate for Trump during last year\u2019s campaign, offered a similarly dim outlook that ultimately cost him a Cabinet position.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou know, I'm Irish. I gotta get my black book and I got 'em,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cChristie, because of Billy Bush weekend was not looked at for a Cabinet position.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe wasn't there for you on Billy Bush weekend so therefore he doesn't get a Cabinet position?\u201d Rose asked.\u000a\u000a\u201cI told him, \u2018The plane leaves at 11 o'clock in the morning. If you're on the plane, you're on the team.\u2019 Didn't make the plane,\u201d Bannon said.\u000a\u000aBy contrast, Bannon said he had told Trump at the post-Access Hollywood tape meeting that he had a \u201c100 percent probability of winning.\u201d It was a forecast so rosy that even Trump would not believe it, Bannon said.\u000a\u000a\u201cAppealing to the American people and to the working-class people in this country, absolutely. You know why? 'Cause \u2013 it was a winner. That's why I told him 'double down' every time,\u201d the former chief strategist said. \u201cAnd on that day, that's the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, \u2018Come on, it's not 100 percent.\u2019 I go, \u2018It's absolutely 100 percent.\u2019 And I told him why: They don\u2019t care.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVAfter a meatloaf lunch at the White House last Tuesday, President Donald Trump made New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie an intriguing offer: Would he like to be secretary of labor?\u000a\u000aChristie said no, according to four people close to Trump who were briefed on the conversation, which was just the latest in a series of nudges Trump has given Christie about joining him in Washington. Christie has told Trump he is not interested and instead plans to join the private sector after he leaves Trenton next year, two people close to Trump said.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aChristie\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\u000a\u000aThe previously unreported conversation is particularly notable because it happened during a whirlwind 48 hours in which Trump\u2019s first nominee, Andrew Puzder, lost Senate support, withdrew his nomination and was replaced by former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta \u2014 and all the while Christie\u2019s name never publicly popped up. Acosta was picked shortly after Puzder officially dropped out and wasn't at the 77-minute news conference where his nomination was announced. Trump didn't travel to Florida, where Acosta lives, to interview him. Acosta referred a request for comment to the White House.\u000a\u000aThe Christie offer and lightning-fast Acosta pick provide a window into the way Trump chooses people to fill jobs \u2014 an approach that is culturally familiar from his years of televised boardroom \u201cfirings\u201d on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but is still something of a shock to Washington\u2019s political culture and its class of career operatives and government officials accustomed to a slower, more orderly hiring process. Trump, as he has throughout his public and private career, goes on gut and instinct, his first impression in a meeting, and often whether the person has been loyal to him, several people familiar with his conversations and thinking say.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is very intuitive,\u201d said Louise Sunshine, a longtime executive in the Trump Organization. \u201cHe looks for people who are smart and loyal and strong, and is very intuitive about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump can plan to pick one person one minute and change his mind the next. He can think of a name and immediately tell advisers he wants that person for a particular job. There is no discernible rhyme or reason or formal vetting process to many of his hires, allies and aides say, with no formal questionnaires or protocols \u2014 and several Cabinet appointees\u2019 confirmation struggles brought the downsides of such an approach into stark relief. He cares, above all, about appearance, loyalty and strength \u2014 a word he often uses.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe makes a decision when he is interviewing someone, and pretty quickly,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican and top ally. \u201cThere\u2019s no procrastination.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile some of his choices are made on a whim, he also likes to call dozens of people about potential hires, telling them what others said and asking them if they agree or disagree \u2014 and why. Last week, he asked TV anchors who visited the Oval Office for advice on filling the national security adviser position that opened up after Michael Flynn was ousted, according to two sources close to the administration. During the transition, he would walk the tables of Mar-a-Lago and ask guests whom he should pick for different jobs. He will call longtime business associates in New York, including Democrats and people who have never been involved in politics, and ask their advice.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to ask the housekeeper, but he values the opinion of a broad array of people,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump adviser who views the president\u2019s personnel moves as typical of a CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s different than how the Washington establishment works, where you\u2019re paying consultants and pollsters to focus group everything. He doesn\u2019t bother with that.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt can be very random,\u201d one person who has been heavily involved in a number of the searches said. \u201cYou can mention a name, and he will want to hire the person. Or he can veto someone, and you\u2019re not really sure why.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile the list of potential Supreme Court nominees was heavily vetted by a wide range of conservatives, his ultimate choice of Neil Gorsuch, perhaps the most consequential and controversy-free decision of his first month in office, came after only one interview, a 40-minute face-to-face meeting with the judge at Trump Tower.\u000a\u000aTrump also tends to throw people off the scent during his job searches, intentionally or not. Last weekend at Mar-a-Lago, he expressed to associates and friends that he liked former U.S. ambassador to United Nations John Bolton to replace Flynn, and that he was concerned that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster had bad-mouthed him during the campaign, according to people who spoke to Trump.\u000a\u000aAt least one person left their conversation with Trump on Saturday thinking Bolton was the favorite.\u000a\u000aBut on Monday, Trump was sitting beside McMaster announcing that the three-star general would be the new national security adviser. It was unclear what changed his mind, or whether he was ever committed to Bolton. One person with knowledge of the decision-making said some of Trump's advisers convinced him Bolton was \u201ctoo controversial,\u201d particularly after the Flynn fiasco.\u000a\u000aChris Christie has told President Donald Trump he is not interested in joining the administration and instead plans to join the private sector after he leaves Trenton next year. | Getty\u000a\u000aTrump often says different things to different advisers and aides, leaving them all a little unsure what will happen. On the day that Flynn was eventually removed as national security adviser, Trump wavered throughout the afternoon, seeking advice from various aides, allies, friends and associates.\u000a\u000aHours before Flynn was out, one person close to Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if he stays or goes.\u201d Another person who said he talked to Trump said: \u201cFlynn is definitely out.\u201d A third person said Flynn could survive.\u000a\u000aSeveral days after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump was still asking friends if he made the right decision, and what they thought of Flynn, according to one person who regularly talks to Trump. Contrary to his public persona, Trump does not enjoy firing people, several allies and advisers said.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe wants to hear from everyone all the time,\u201d Sam Nunberg, a longtime aide, of Trump\u2019s practices. "He is always asking questions."\u000a\u000aSunshine said Trump\u2019s hiring instincts were good \u201cbecause he has a lot of people who have been with him since the 1970s.\u201d But the longtime Trump friend said she worries about the quality of the advice he was getting from others on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and is glad he continues to reach out to old friends.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a prisoner in the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is under the influence of all these people who are giving him the wrong advice.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s search for a secretary of state particularly captured what can seem like a chaotic hiring process. After his advisers had narrowed down the list to a small group of finalists, Trump took a sudden meeting with Rex Tillerson and then decided he wanted the ExxonMobil CEO to lead Foggy Bottom. A number of Trump\u2019s friends and advisers said they didn\u2019t see Tillerson as a strong candidate, while Trump told others that the CEO was the emerging favorite.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s aides have also learned ways to sway his decision-making. After Tillerson had been confirmed, Trump spiked Tillerson\u2019s choice for deputy secretary, Elliott Abrams, a seasoned GOP foreign policy hand. Trump had read Abrams\u2019 critical comments about him last year in a briefing book before meeting with Abrams in the Oval Office \u2014 a discovery that didn\u2019t seem accidental. Several people close to Trump say whoever controls the information that gets to him about a nominee has significant power.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe remembers slights, but in this case, it was someone who didn\u2019t want Abrams making sure Trump saw those past statements,\u201d said a source familiar with the meetings, noting that Trump has a reputation for a short attention span. \u201cBecause we know Trump isn\u2019t poring over every word that\u2019s in those briefing books on his own.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump also becomes obsessed with hiring certain people, even if they have told him no or if Trump has passed them over for other jobs.\u000a\u000aAfter Rudy Giuliani backed out of the secretary of state race, Trump continued to ask whether Giuliani wanted to join the administration, according to a person familiar with their conversations. He had already offered Christie the labor secretary job before he chose Puzder, two people close to Trump said.\u000a\u000aHe has also become fixated on retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, whom Trump met several years ago in New York City when both were receiving a Man of the Year award at a charity dinner. Keane, 74, turned down Trump\u2019s invitation to consider the defense secretary job and suggested retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who now has the job.\u000a\u000aAs his administration began to search for Flynn\u2019s replacement last week, Trump again suggested Keane to associates, even though the retired soldier had only months ago said no to a Cabinet position for personal reasons, one source close to the administration said. \u201cHe's rough and tough and made an impression on Trump,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on this one initial encounter.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s obvious deference to decorated military officials, several of whom have joined his administration, has reassured veterans of Washington\u2019s national security establishment who worry about an untested, impulsive commander in chief and a West Wing light on governing experience.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a wide sense among longtime Washington people who look at the Trump administration and see a guy like Jared Kushner running it and feel some resentment,\u201d said one senior GOP foreign policy adviser on Capitol Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018We did our time in the mud and he\u2019s bypassed all that and is in the senior job.\u2019 There\u2019s this wide sense that they aren\u2019t qualified en masse.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVIf someone had said in 1988 that a woman who grew up under communism would lead a reunited Germany in the not too distant future, few would have believed it. Now, with polls predicting Angela Merkel will win a fourth term as chancellor on September 24, it\u2019s getting hard to imagine Germany and Europe without her.\u000a\u000aHere are some key moments from Merkel\u2019s life and career, in words, pictures and video.\u000a\u000aBeginnings\u000a\u000aAngela Dorothea Kasner was born on July 17, 1954 in Hamburg. Just a few weeks later, her father Horst, a Lutheran pastor, moved the family to Quitzow in Brandenburg and three years after that to Templin, a small town north of Berlin in then-communist East Germany.\u000a\u000aIn 1973, Merkel began studying physics at Leipzig University. In 1986, she earned a doctorate in quantum chemistry in Berlin. In between, she married fellow student Ulrich Merkel, from whom she separated in 1981. When she applied for a position at an engineering school, she was offered a job by the Stasi secret police, which she turned down.\u000a\u000a1989: Nothing beats a good sauna\u000a\u000aWhen the Berlin Wall came down on November 9, 1989, many East Germans rushed to the border to celebrate. But Merkel, as she did every Thursday evening, went to the sauna with a friend and joined the celebrations only afterward.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was Thursday, and Thursday was my sauna day so that\u2019s where I went \u2014 in the same communist high-rise where we always went,\u201d Merkel told the Guardian.\u000a\u000aThe fall of the Wall did not break her sauna routine, but the end of the Cold War marked the beginning of her political career. Merkel, 35, joined the center-right activist movement Demokratischer Aufbruch (\u201cDemocratic Awakening.\u201c) Her first job was to unpack boxes of new computers and set them up in the office.\u000a\u000a1990: Baggy skirts and Jesus sandals\u000a\u000aIn 1990, the Democratic Awakening merged with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in East Germany (which would later merge with its West German counterpart) and Merkel moved on to become the deputy spokesperson of the German Democratic Republic government under Lothar de Maizière.\u000a\u000aThe first and last elected GDR prime minister said Merkel\u2019s appearance was completely unremarkable. \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem to care about her outward appearance at all,\u201d said de Maizière. \u201cShe looked like a typical GDR scientist, wearing a baggy skirt and Jesus sandals and a cropped haircut.\u201d\u000a\u000aDe Maizière even asked his office manager to take her out to buy clothes.\u000a\u000aThat same year, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag in reunified Germany\u2019s first general election.\u000a\u000a1991: Cabinet minister\u000a\u000aHelmut Kohl, who would later reportedly accuse Merkel of \u201cdestroying his Europe,\u201d was now her political mentor. The reunification chancellor referred to her as \u201cmein Mädchen\u201d (\u201cmy girl\u201d). Merkel made her debut in his government as federal minister for women and youth.\u000a\u000a1994: Environment minister\u000a\u000aIn 1994, Merkel was appointed federal environment minister. According to her late biographer Gerd Langguth, she broke down in tears during negotiations at a United Nations global-warming conference in Berlin. Her long-time close aide Beate Baumann told her to pull herself together. Merkel went back and negotiated an agreement.\u000a\u000aGerhard Schröder, the Social Democrat who would become chancellor from 1998 to 2005, called her \u201cpitiful\u201d as environment minister. But Merkel had plans for Schröder. \u201cI will put him in the corner, just like he did with me,\u201d she told German photographer Herlinde Koelbl. \u201cI still need time, but one day, the time will come for this. And I am already looking forward.\u201d\u000a\u000a1998: Secretary-general of the CDU\u000a\u000aIn 1998, Kohl\u2019s years as chancellor came to an end. But Merkel was still climbing up the ranks. In November 1998, she was elected CDU secretary-general. Later that year, she married chemist Joachim Sauer, her long-time partner.\u000a\u000a1999: Auf wiedersehen, Helmut!\u000a\u000aA scandal over anonymous political donations to the CDU, known as the Schwarzgeldaffäre, prompted Merkel to make a decisive move. Both Kohl and Wolfgang Schäuble, who had become CDU leader, were implicated. In defiance of her mentor, and without informing Schäuble, Merkel wrote an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung urging the CDU to move on and leave the tainted Kohl era behind.\u000a\u000aKohl saw it as a betrayal. Within a few short months, Merkel would replace Schäuble as party leader.\u000a\u000a2000: CDU leader\u000a\u000aAfter Schäuble\u2019s resignation, Merkel had a clear path to becoming party leader. In April she was elected with 895 out of 937 votes, becoming the first woman to hold the post.\u000a\u000a2002: Breakfast in Wolfratshausen\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s first years as party leader were not easy. She found herself in a power struggle with the Edmund Stoiber, chairman of the CDU\u2019s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). At a now-famous breakfast with Stoiber in his home town Wolfratshausen, Merkel decided to withdraw her bid to be the parties\u2019 joint candidate for chancellor in his favor. What seemed to be a defeat worked out well for Merkel in the long term: Stoiber lost the general election, leaving him and his party weakened in their alliance with the CDU.\u000a\u000a2005: Germany\u2019s first female chancellor\u000a\u000aThe 2005 parliamentary election did not produce a clear winner: The CDU/CSU won just one percent more of the vote than the SPD. But after Social Democrat leader and outgoing Chancellor Gerhard Schröder resigned, Merkel took the helm of a grand coalition of CDU/CSU and and SPD. She took office in November as the country\u2019s first ever female chancellor.\u000a\u000a2009: Reelection\u000a\u000aIn the 2009 parliamentary election, Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc won its lowest vote share (33.8 percent) in 60 years but emerged as the largest group in the Bundestag by some distance. The CDU/CSU teamed up to form a coalition government with the liberal FDP. Merkel was back for another term in office.\u000a\u000a2011: Energiewende\u000a\u000aMerkel made a major policy pledge after the nuclear crisis in Fukushima, Japan, to phase out nuclear energy by 2020. This so-called Energiewende (\u201cenergy turning point\u201d), by the world\u2019s fourth biggest economy, made Germany a pioneer among industrial nations in renewable energy with targets going beyond EU guidelines.\u000a\u000a2011: \u0386\u03bd\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1 \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u000a\u000aAll eyes were on Merkel in the Greek economic crisis. German banks held the largest amount of Greek debt, which put the fate of 11 million Greeks in the chancellor\u2019s hands.\u000a\u000aMerkel wanted Greece to remain in the eurozone \u2014 but demanded major economic reforms in return. Under pressure from other EU leaders, she agreed measures to save Greece from bankruptcy, concluding that \u201cIf the euro falls, then Europe falls.\u201d\u000a\u000a2013: Merkel III\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s victory in the 2013 parliamentary election meant she went on to become the third postwar chancellor to reach a decade in office, after Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. The CDU/CSU achieved its best election result since 1990 with almost 42 percent of the vote, and ended up just five seats short of an overall majority in parliament. As the FDP failed to win enough votes to enter parliament, Merkel turned back to the SPD as her coalition partner.\u000a\u000a2013: Live from Maryland: Merkel\u2019s not-so-private calls\u000a\u000aWikileaks and Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee, claimed the U.S. had tapped the phones of Merkel and her colleagues for years. \u201cSpying among friends is never acceptable,\u201d Merkel said. The case increased tensions between the two countries, but didn\u2019t lead to criminal charges \u2014 Germany\u2019s federal prosecutor dropped the case in 2015.\u000a\u000a2015: \u2018Wir schaffen das\u2019\u000a\u000aJust as the worst of the economic crisis seemed over, Europe was confronted with the worst migration crisis on the Continent since World War II. Merkel adopted a temporary open-door policy for Syrians fleeing war in their country. As a result, Germany received the highest number of new asylum applications in the EU, and more than a million people arrived in the country in total.\u000a\u000aCracks began to appear in Germany\u2019s welcoming attitude after many economic migrants started to make the journey to Western Europe, and fears arose about the security threat posed by some new arrivals. Merkel, by now widely known as Mutti and seen as a kind of mother of the nation, defended her policy from critics in her own party and beyond. They accused her of failing to understand the gravity of the situation by declaring \u201cWir schaffen das\u201d (\u201cWe\u2019ll manage this\u201d) \u2014 the phrase that became synonymous with her handling of the crisis.\u000a\u000aHowever, her attitude also led to praise and international recognition. Time magazine named her \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d and said \u201cshe has stepped up in a way that was uncharacteristic, even for her,\u201d and \u201cshe asked more of her country than most politicians would dare.\u201d\u000a\u000a2017: New leader of the free world?\u000a\u000aMerkel met Donald Trump for the first time in Washington, two months after the U.S. president took office. Establishing a relationship as close as with his predecessor Obama has not been easy.\u000a\u000aWith Trump pursuing right-wing populist policies, some commentators argue that Merkel is now the de facto leader of the free world, its foremost champion of liberal values. Merkel has shied away from that label. But in May she suggested Germany and Europe could no longer rely on the U.S. in the way they had done in the past. Europe should pay more attention to its own interests and really \u201ctake our fate into our own hands,\u201d Merkel declared.\u000a\u000a2017: Gay marriage vote\u000a\u000aIn an unexpected move, the German parliament legalized same-sex marriage in its last session before the fall election. For more than a decade, the CDU had blocked such legislation, with Merkel herself strongly opposed. But when she was asked about the topic during an onstage interview, she suggested it should be a matter for MPs\u2019 individual consciences, rather than a party political issue. Her opponents swiftly pushed for a vote in parliament and the legislation passed. In some ways, that was a setback for Merkel, who voted against the change. But it also took the issue off the campaign agenda.\u000a\u000aIf the polls are right, Merkel\u2019s journey is far from over. Angie, where will it lead us from here?

aVU.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox | Matt Cardy/Getty Images Liam Fox: Britain does not have capacity to strike trade deals now UK trade secretary says Britain wants to adopt terms of existing EU trade agreements on temporary basis.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 Britain has turned down countries wishing to strike free-trade deals after Brexit because the government does not have the capacity to negotiate them, the U.K.\u2019s International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with POLITICO, Fox said he had told countries with pre-existing EU trade deals that the U.K. wanted to adopt these agreements in their entirety after Brexit but only on a temporary basis until they can be updated.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a number of countries who said they would like to move directly to a new free-trade agreement but we have said we are simply unable to do that at the moment,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt requires the willingness of the country involved to want to move the process further on and it\u2019s dependent on our own capacity in our own department.\u201d\u000a\u000aFox said a trade deal with the U.S. was the government\u2019s No. 1 priority after leaving the EU, followed by agreements with Australia and then New Zealand, but admitted it would have to wait until an agreement is struck with Brussels first.\u000a\u000aFox said that requests coming in to strike new deals with the U.K. is a sign of the global appetite for liberalizing trade with Britain.\u000a\u000aCountries such as Japan, South Korea and Switzerland may hope to extract more concessions than they are able to from the EU.\u000a\u000aHowever, it could also signify resistance from \u201cthird countries\u201d outside the EU to allow the U.K. to simply roll over the same terms and conditions negotiated by the EU, a bloc with almost seven times the number of consumers. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Switzerland \u2014 significant economies with existing trade deals with Brussels \u2014 may hope to extract more concessions from the U.K. than they are able to from the EU.\u000a\u000aFox, though, is adamant the future is positive for the U.K., even if new trading relationships take longer for his department to negotiate than first imagined.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe EU has got some 40 free-trade agreements with third countries,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe have always said that our aim is twofold \u2014 first of all, to provide continuity as we leave the EU but then to move to more bespoke and more liberal agreements when we are able to do so.\u201d\u000a\u000aWaiting for Brexit\u000a\u000aFox said the U.K. was \u201calready moving\u201d with the United States and was pushing Brussels to tie up its deal with Japan \u2014 agreed in principle in July \u2014 before Britain leaves in March 2019. \u201cAustralia and New Zealand [are] our next highest priorities because they are very keen to establish open markets and they are more like us in terms of the markets that they are,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to look at the EU agreements and see how we can update them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K. and the U.S. have set up a trade working group to lay the groundwork for an agreement which could be signed soon after Britain\u2019s exit in March 2019.\u000a\u000aOn the U.S. trade deal, Fox explained why it would have to wait: \u201cWe can\u2019t make commitments until we see the shape of the EU deal because we don\u2019t want to move faster in one agreement than another, or to make agreements which might tie our hands in another.\u201d\u000a\u000aCountries such as Japan also caution that it is impossible to determine what a deal with the U.K. would look like until the Brexit deal is done and Britain\u2019s future access to the EU market is clear.\u000a\u000a\u201cBusinesses will increasingly make their voices heard. We would all be wise to listen to those\u201d \u2014 Liam Fox\u000a\u000aFox was adamant that an agreement with the European Union on the terms of the divorce and future relationship would be struck and would form the basis of Britain\u2019s global trading system.\u000a\u000aBut he claimed there were politicians in Brussels who were prepared to scupper the prospects of a deal to protect the European project: \u201cWhat they are thinking about is how can we increase political integration at whatever economic cost. For me it\u2019s just unthinkable that you wouldn\u2019t have as an essential pillar in your thinking, making your people more prosperous. It\u2019s ever closer union.\u201d\u000a\u000aFox warned that trade barriers with the U.K. would damage both sides and ultimately endanger the EU: \u201cThe success of the European project is ultimately whether it delivers prosperity for its people.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019ve got this tension between European businesses who want to get on and the political overlords who have this almost theological attachment to ever-closer union. Businesses will increasingly make their voices heard. We would all be wise to listen to those,\u201d Fox said.

aVToday, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce has postponed the final determinations in the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations of imports of softwood lumber from Canada until no later than November 14, 2017.\u000a\u000a\u201cI remain hopeful that we can reach a negotiated solution that satisfies the concerns of all parties,\u201d said Secretary Ross. \u201cThis extension could provide the time needed to address the complex issues at hand and to reach an equitable and durable suspension agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aGiven the complexity of these investigations and ongoing discussions between the Governments of the United States and Canada focusing on a durable solution to this long-standing trade dispute, the final determinations in these investigations have been postponed. As a result, the deadline to issue the final determinations will be announced no later than November 14, 2017. Under U.S. law, Commerce may postpone an AD final determination for a total of 135 days after the publication of the AD preliminary determination. Further, because the CVD investigation has been aligned with the AD investigation, that final determination will also be announced no later than November 14, 2017.\u000a\u000aBackground:\u000a\u000aOn April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively, Commerce published its preliminary determinations in the CVD and AD investigations of softwood lumber from Canada. The U.S. International Trade Commissions (ITC) is conducting a parallel investigation to determine if the American producers have been harmed by the softwood lumber imports from Canada. If the Commerce Department\u2019s final determinations are affirmative, and the ITC makes an affirmative final injury determination, the Commerce Department will issue AD and CVD orders. If the ITC does not find that U.S. producers have been harmed, then the investigations will end, and no duties will be collected.

aVBritish Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis | Yuri Gripas/AFP via Getty Images David Davis: No deal worse for some EU countries than for UK \u2018Nobody pretended this would be simple and easy.\u2019\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 Failure to reach a Brexit deal would be worse for the economies of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark than it would be for Britain, according to Brexit Secretary David Davis.\u000a\u000aA no-deal scenario, with the imposition of World Trade Organization tariffs and trade barriers, is expected to be economically damaging for both sides. However, the commonly held view has been that, with around 40 percent of its exports going to the EU, the U.K. would be hit hardest.\u000a\u000aHowever, updating MPs on the Brexit negotiations, Davis said other EU countries understood the importance of U.K. trade to their own economies. He said this particularly applied to countries \u201con the North Sea littoral\u201d \u2014 naming the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Denmark. \u201cAll of them know that the impact of no deal would be quite dramatic, more dramatic than for us,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTaking questions in the House of Commons Tuesday afternoon, Davis also told MPs that \u201csignificant differences\u201d remained between the U.K. and the EU on Britain\u2019s financial obligations. Talks on the so-called Brexit bill would go on \u201cfor the full duration of the negotiation\u201d and could end with the U.K. not agreeing on the EU\u2019s \u201clegal basis\u201d for the bill, he added.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s negotiators had been \u201cgoing through the legal basis for each of the claims, because they\u2019re all set on various claims about what voting in certain budgets and certain financial proposals binds us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, frankly, the outcome of that will be that we will not agree on the legal basis.\u201d Davis told the BBC last week that the U.K. would meet its \u201cinternational obligations\u201d but that they may be \u201cmoral ones, maybe political ones\u201d rather than legal obligations.\u000a\u000aWhile hailing progress in some aspects of the talks, including on citizens\u2019 rights and Northern Ireland, Davis said there was still work to be done, adding: \u201cNobody pretended this would be simple and easy.\u201d\u000a\u000aInsisting that he did not want a no-deal scenario, he nevertheless told MPs that such an outcome would not be \u201ca catastrophe.\u201d\u000a\u000aGently criticizing his EU counterparts, he said: \u201cSometimes they have to remember they are negotiators, not arbiters \u2026 the interests in those other countries is as much engaged in having a deal as ours is and that\u2019s what will drive it in the end.\u201d\u000a\u000aOver an hour-and-a-half of questions, Davis came under little pressure from Brexiteers in his own party, despite concessions from the U.K. over the summer, which have seen the Cabinet fully embrace plans for a post-Brexit transition period, accept that there will be some financial obligations, and acknowledge the European Court of Justice could still have indirect influence over U.K. law.\u000a\u000aBut in a sign of potential alignment between the opposition and rebel Tories, Davis was urged by Labour and by the former Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to keep the U.K. in the European single market and a customs union during a transition period following Brexit. Davis refused to be drawn on the specifics of the government\u2019s plans for what it calls \u201can implementation period\u201d after Brexit, but did indicate that he still wanted the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u2014 the \u201cend game\u201d \u2014 to be determined before a transition period begins.\u000a\u000aLabour Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer, who last month said the party wanted the U.K. to remain in the single market and a customs union with the EU during a transition, said the Brexit negotiations were now reaching the stage \u201cwhere fantasy meets brutal reality.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavis challenged Labour over whether they would be willing to pay a \u20ac100 billion bill \u2014 the top-end estimate of the settlement the EU is seeking \u2014 and accused the EU of refusing talks on future relationship matters as a \u201cpressure tactic to make us pay.\u201d\u000a\u000aFollowing the revelation that the U.K. is calling for continuous talks following the September round of negotiations, he added that the U.K. was \u201cready to do anything to accelerate the process,\u201d but downplayed the importance of the European Council summit in October, which will rule on whether talks have made \u201csufficient progress\u201d to proceed to the next phase.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pin ourselves to September or October, in doing so you are doing the job of the people trying to negotiate against you,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aDavis also said the U.K. would seek to \u201cmaintain [an] ongoing relationship\u201d with the European Investment Bank after Brexit.

aVI lied. I bragged. I flailed my hands and arms. I wore a long red tie. Really long. I did it all.\u000a\u000aExcept take responsibility. For anything. Ever.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aWhile some people who know me might think I'm describing myself, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m describing the three months last year that I was the Donald Trump stand-in for dozens of mock debates against Hillary Clinton (who was played by Hillary Clinton).\u000a\u000aTo truly become Trump, I had to immerse myself in all things Trump. I watched every clip of Trump I could get my hands on. All the primary debates, rallies, TV interviews. As I told POLITICO's Annie Karni a few months ago, I got so into my role as Donald Trump that I began to lose my sense of where my tie ended and he began.\u000a\u000aBut in the process, I learned a few things about the man who, though I wouldn\u2019t have believed it back then, went on to become America\u2019s improbable 45th president. A few traits were clear right away. Really nothing that by this point hasn\u2019t been noted and analyzed. Serial lying. Megalomania. Ignorance.\u000a\u000aBut the one thing that stood out more than anything, and hasn\u2019t been adequately explored even now, is that Trump has never paid the price for his actions. I couldn\u2019t find even one instance. He didn\u2019t pay taxes. Nothing. He didn\u2019t pay creditors. Nothing. He didn\u2019t pay contractors. Nothing. I\u2019d even argue he came out for the better. He skipped out on his debts, but kept the planes, the helicopters, the penthouses and properties. If you go bankrupt once and there are no consequences, why not do it three more times?\u000a\u000aSame with his personal life. He betrayed and publicly embarrassed his first wife\u2014the mother of his eldest three children\u2014in spectacular fashion. No matter\u2014he simply got a second wife (with whom he betrayed his first). Then a third.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s habit of failing upward jumped out at me right away. But what took a bit to sink in was the realization that why would he ever admit anything? Why would he regret anything? Why apologize for anything?\u000a\u000aEvery public figure who runs for office makes sure they have the answers to two questions: 1) Why are you running? 2) What do you regret most? When asked Question No. 2 during his presidency, George W. Bush couldn\u2019t answer. The press pummeled him.\u000a\u000aFor me, as Trump, answering No. 1 was easy. I was running to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But I started thinking through how to answer No. 2. Access Hollywood? Trump University? Not paying taxes? Then I remembered my job, to be Donald Trump. So the answer was clear:\u000a\u000a\u201cNothing.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt would have been a rare moment of total honesty from him.\u000a\u000aNot easy to avoid the unwanted Trump hug, sometimes it even takes practice...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA favorite moment from debate prep (9/24/16): pic.twitter.com/JAAHaqKFoa \u2014 Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) May 19, 2017\u000a\u000aThe rest of us pay the consequences for our failures, mistakes, offenses, wronging others. Any parent will say that making their child feel the consequences of their misbehavior is no less important than rewarding them for their successes. Why? To make clear what\u2019s right and what's wrong. Without that, you can\u2019t function personally. Or professionally. You will get dumped. Divorced. Fired.\u000a\u000aConsequences teach responsibility. Consequences force people to learn. Consequences impose discipline. People don\u2019t learn the easy way.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s worse. If you never punish a child, if they never spend a moment in timeout, not only do they have no reason not to repeat the behavior\u2014they are emboldened by getting away with it. If I get caught robbing the corner store, but am allowed to keep the loot, why wouldn\u2019t I test the limits and rob a bank?\u000a\u000aSo, if you had free rein to do as you please? For at least the past 50 of your 70 years? That\u2019s not good. That results in worse and worse transgressions. If you can say the repulsive things about women he did to Billy Bush, why wouldn\u2019t he say the same even now? Or worse. And if the culprit doesn\u2019t pay, someone is. In Trump\u2019s case, tens and tens of millions of us are paying the price for his mistakes.\u000a\u000aNext week, Secretary Clinton\u2019s book comes out. I\u2019ve read it. It\u2019s good, really good. It\u2019s candid, and pretty blunt. She says what she did wrong. Did she suffer any consequences? Yes, she is not the 45th president of the United States. I\u2019d argue she also paid the price for Jim Comey\u2019s terribly naive judgment, and Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on American democracy. I agree with her. Those people share the blame. But she will be blamed for not taking all the blame when in fact she is paying the price for all three. The same media talking heads and pundits who rip her for not absorbing every ounce of blame are the ones who give Trump a pass on ever paying the consequences. Can you imagine what they\u2019d be saying if Hillary as president had done even one of the dozens of crazy or terrible or worse things he\u2019s done? She\u2019d probably have been strung up on Pennsylvania Avenue by now. (But not before being blamed for the eclipse ruining picnics across America.)\u000a\u000aAs for Trump, Americans of all stripes are hoping one of these days he will have to pay the piper. Impeachment. Invoking the 25th Amendment. Getting shellacked by proxy in the 2018 midterms. But the next time we really get to present him with the bill will be 11/3/2020.\u000a\u000aNot only is that a long time away, but it\u2019s not a sure thing. There\u2019s the classic question: If the election were held tomorrow, would you vote for Trump or Democrat X? I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d lose. It will be a struggle between those who voted in 2016 to blow America up and those who in 2020 want to Make America America Again.\u000a\u000aHe could very well go his entire life without ever suffering the consequences. After all, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhilippe Reines has been a spokesman and adviser to Hillary Clinton since 2002, and is currently writing a book about his tenure and the Trump presidency.

aVGun Cases are Notoriously Hard to Make Stick. New York Thinks It Has the Answer. The city has launched an ambitious program to collect DNA from every gun recovered by police. But questions remain about effectiveness, and cost.\u000a\u000aTimothy Kupferschmid, the chief of laboratories at the New York Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, stands in his office in Lower Manhattan. The lab he oversees tested DNA recovered from firearms in more than 1,600 cases last year. [Photo: Carlos Jaramillo for The Trace]\u000a\u000aThis story was reported in partnership with WNYC, and was published with the New York Daily News.\u000a\u000aTwo New York police officers were sitting in a patrol car one night last August when they saw Avree Lamar, a 19-year-old with an open arrest warrant, climb into a cab near a housing project in Red Hook, Brooklyn.\u000a\u000aThe officers followed the cab, pulled it over, and arrested Lamar. In the back of Lamar\u2019s waistband, they found a loaded 9mm pistol, court papers said. He was charged with criminal possession of a loaded weapon, a felony.\u000a\u000aIt seemed like a straightforward case. But for all New York City\u2019s success in reducing violent crime, only about half of the people arrested for carrying a loaded gun in the city get convicted. Juries like hard evidence, and often mistrust cases that hinge on police testimony. Prosecutors say cases like Lamar\u2019s are not always easy wins.\u000a\u000aTo change that, the city is pursuing an ambitious and expensive plan to collect and test DNA from every gun recovered by police. The goal is to boost the number of successful prosecutions, and discourage carrying illegal weapons in the nation\u2019s largest city.\u000a\u000aThe Trace and WNYC contacted eight other major police departments. None are attempting DNA collection and testing on this scale. Several said such an undertaking would be extremely difficult without adding staff, lab space, and expensive equipment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, only deploy DNA tests for select gun cases \u2014 often shootings and murders.\u000a\u000aThe New York program, which began in the summer of 2015, is continuing to expand. Last year, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed DNA tests for 1,682 gun cases, nearly quadruple the number from 2014. Just this month, the city gave the office an additional $8 million to pay for 55 new employees to process gun swabs, plus training and equipment. That money amounts to about 10 percent of the office\u2019s total annual budget.\u000a\u000aPolice officials and the medical examiner\u2019s office said they could not estimate the total cost of the swabbing and testing program since it would include staff time for police, prosecutors, and scientists, as well as equipment and training in several different departments and agencies.\u000a\u000aLamar\u2019s gun was swabbed at the police station, and sent to the medical examiner\u2019s office.\u000a\u000aScientists in the M.E.\u2019s office then compared a DNA sample from Lamar to the genetic mixture found on the pistol\u2019s trigger guard. Their conclusion: the DNA retrieved from the weapon was 6.8 trillion times more likely to belong to Lamar than someone else.\u000a\u000aLamar pleaded guilty, and a judge sentenced him to three years in prison \u2014 a lengthy sentence for a first offense, lawyers said.\u000a\u000aRelated Story Criminal Justice An Illegal Gun on the Streets Is No Slam Dunk in Court To reverse a sharp decline in firearm convictions, New York City is pursuing another experiment with specialized gun courts. But making illegal weapons charges stick can be vexingly hard to do.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is the goal, to make it radioactive to even pick up a gun,\u201d said Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, a nonprofit group that helped the city develop its strategy for using DNA in gun cases.\u000a\u000aSome legal and forensic experts said that DNA testing, while more sophisticated than ever, is not foolproof. They say the science used to test small amounts of DNA isn\u2019t perfect, and there are ways an innocent person\u2019s genetic material could get on a gun he or she never touched.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last few years are real efforts to push the boundaries of DNA evidence,\u201d said Clinton Hughes, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of New York\u2019s DNA unit. \u201cDNA does not necessarily mean that there\u2019s going to be a just result, or an accurate result in a particular case.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome civil liberty groups have also raised concerns about the expansion of DNA collection by local law enforcement agencies.\u000a\u000aDNA that is deemed \u201cabandoned\u201d \u2014 left on the rim of a soda can or the end of a cigarette, for example \u2014 can legally be picked up by police and entered into a local database. People whose genetic information is stored in the database are almost never aware of it, legal experts said.\u000a\u000aExpanded DNA testing on guns is part of a larger effort New York is making to crack down on illegal firearms and gun violence. In January of 2016, police formed a 200-officer gun-violence suppression division to focus on illegal firearms, shootings, and gangs. In Brooklyn, there are two courtrooms dedicated to expediting gun cases. Other boroughs are expected to follow suit.\u000a\u000aThe theory behind the push to make more successful gun cases is that certainty of punishment is more important in deterring crime than the severity of punishment. If would-be criminals believe police will get their DNA and there\u2019ll be no way to avoid conviction, they\u2019ll be less likely to break the law, Aborn said.\u000a\u000aNYPD Deputy Chief Emanuel Katranakis said DNA evidence from firearms often helps police investigate suspects they might otherwise overlook. Last year, police linked genetic material from a gun to a person in an existing DNA database 309 times, he said. New York has made remarkable strides in reducing gun crime. Last year, police recorded 998 shootings \u2014 the fewest in recorded city history.\u000a\u000aBut there are still neighborhoods where violent crime is common, and people are frequently shot. In a one-month span this summer in the Bronx, a 5-year-old boy was shot in the head; a police officer was fatally shot while sitting in her patrol car, and a man was caught on surveillance video shooting three men on a city street.\u000a\u000aSome other large cities have struggled to control rising levels of gun crime, the violence that spurred President Donald Trump to speak of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in his inaugural address. Chicago, which has a third of New York\u2019s population, reported 3,550 shooting incidents last year.\u000a\u000aBenjamin Meda is a detective who heads the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s gun unit for gangs and narcotics. Los Angeles saw shootings rise slightly last year, and Meda said police can use all the investigative tools they can get.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are extremely interested in what New York is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see what their success is \u2014 what the return on their DNA hits are, what they\u2019re doing that we aren\u2019t doing.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been almost 25 years since a drop of blood on the pavement at OJ Simpson\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s house brought DNA evidence into the public consciousness. Back then, scientists needed a sample of blood or other bodily fluid the size of a quarter to test for DNA.\u000a\u000aAs the science became more sophisticated, the New York M.E.\u2019s office developed a method that it used to make DNA matches from a tiny amount of recovered genetic material. It also developed an algorithm that helped scientists identify a possible match even when someone\u2019s DNA was mixed up with that of other people.\u000a\u000aBoth these technologies are key when it comes to testing firearms. Guns \u2014 especially crime guns \u2014 are often passed among several people before they are confiscated by police.\u000a\u000aMany judges allowed DNA evidence that was obtained using those testing methods to be admitted in criminal cases. But in 2015, a Brooklyn judge tossed DNA evidence obtained using those protocols in two cases, saying it was not scientifically reliable.\u000a\u000aLast year, the M.E.\u2019s office turned to a widely used computer model called STRMix, which as of this spring was being used by 17 American crime laboratories and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to test mixed DNA samples.\u000a\u000aIn a chilly, sterile DNA lab on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, scientists cut the cotton off the swabs mailed to them by police and drop them in test tubes. They then clean and measure those samples, running them through a giant whirring machine that looks like a high-tech microwave.\u000a\u000aThe lab needs 37.5 picograms \u2014 as little as six cells of genetic material \u2014 to test a sample against a suspect in a case. Police swab handguns in three places: The grip area, the trigger area, and, the slide area, which on a pistol needs to be pulled back before firing.\u000a\u000aIf enough DNA is recovered, scientists go on to do more tests. They add chemicals, some of which contain fluorescent tags, to each sample. They put the samples into what is essentially a DNA \u201cXerox machine.\u201d The machine copies the DNA millions of times at the locations that the scientists are testing.\u000a\u000aSupport Our Work Help us tell the story of America\u2019s gun violence crisis. Donate Now\u000a\u000aThe samples are then run through another instrument which picks up the fluorescent tags and uses them to produce a color chart. This gives scientists a visual representation of the DNA found on the gun that they can compare with a suspect\u2019s.\u000a\u000aIf a gun swab shows that a mixture of DNA from several people is on the gun, a scientist can enter information about the mixture into a computer, together with the suspect\u2019s DNA profile. The computer produces a ratio showing how likely it is that the suspect\u2019s DNA is part of the genetic mixture recovered from the firearm.\u000a\u000aA gun swab does not always produce a usable sample. Rachel Singer, chief of forensic science at the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office, said that in about half of all cases, there is either too little DNA on a swab \u2014 or there\u2019s genetic material from too many people \u2014 to produce a result that can be tested against a suspect\u2019s DNA.\u000a\u000aThe medical examiner can determine whether someone\u2019s DNA is part of a mix of as many as three biological samples, but if a fourth person\u2019s DNA is detected on a weapon, the office will not make a determination.\u000a\u000aProsecutors say they are aware of the limitations of DNA evidence, but that they are using it responsibly to get more plea deals and longer sentences.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have found that when we do have DNA on a criminal possession of a weapons case, we either are able to negotiate a plea, or the defendant ultimately gets convicted,\u201d Singer said.\u000a\u000aProsecutors said there is almost always other evidence in gun-possessions cases \u2014 like video footage or police testimony \u2014 to prevent wrongful convictions. In Lamar\u2019s case, for example, DNA evidence was used to support the testimony of a police officer who said he pulled a gun out of the defendant\u2019s waistband.\u000a\u000aIt can take weeks for the lab to come back with the results of a DNA test. Defense lawyers say that in the lag time, prosecutors often try to use the possibility of a DNA match to convince their clients to agree to a deal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I\u2019m having a conversation with a prosecutor, oftentimes DNA is used as a threat to exact a guilty plea,\u201d said Scott Hechniger, a senior staff attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services, a public defense law firm. Hechniger said a prosecutor might offer his client a one-time deal before DNA results come back from the lab. If they come back and there\u2019s a match, the deal is off.\u000a\u000aHechinger said New York\u2019s initiative to increase DNA testing is part of a broader move toward a zero-tolerance, one-size-fits-all approach to guns \u2014 where prosecutors seek the stiffest sentences for everyone, even defendants with no prior record.\u000a\u000aStill, there is room to challenge DNA evidence. Brooklyn attorney Douglas Rankin said that if his client\u2019s DNA is not found on a gun, or the test is inconclusive, he can make a strong case for reasonable doubt. Even when there is DNA evidence, Rankin said he has sometimes had luck arguing that it can\u2019t be relied upon. He recalled one case in which a man was charged with illegally possessing a loaded gun after police found it under a couch he was sleeping on in a friend\u2019s apartment. At trial, Rankin argued that because of his client\u2019s proximity to the weapon, it would have been easy for a tiny quantity of his client\u2019s DNA to end up on it. The man was acquitted.\u000a\u000aWhile it is impossible to tie conviction rates to any one factor, there is some evidence that the city\u2019s push to swab all recovered guns for DNA is translating to more pleas and longer sentences.\u000a\u000aIn the first half of this year, about 56 percent of all gun-possession arrests ended in convictions. That\u2019s higher than in any year in the last decade, according to data provided by the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.\u000a\u000aPeople who possess loaded guns illegally have also been slightly more likely to serve time for their offenses since DNA swabs became more commonplace. In the first half of 2017, almost 25 percent of people who were arrested on charges of possessing a loaded gun were sent to prison \u2014 a higher percentage than in any full year since 2007.\u000a\u000aSTRMix has yet to be put to the test in a New York City court. It was successfully challenged in one upstate murder trial last year, when a judge ruled that the state laboratory that collected the DNA samples was not approved to collect samples for the new STRMix analysis.\u000a\u000aNow lawyers and scientists are waiting for a challenge to STRMix in a New York City gun case, likely to come within the next few months.\u000a\u000a\u201cI expect, as we have a very strong and robust defense community, that they will do their job and challenge us appropriately,\u201d Timothy Kupferschmid, chief of laboratories for the New York Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. \u201cI look forward to those challenges and to showing them what we\u2019re doing.\u201d

aVHidden and shared by a small group of people who use them when needed, and are always sure to return them, such guns appear to be rising in number in New York, according to the police. It is unclear why. The economy? Times are tough \u2014 not everyone can afford a gun. \u201cThe gangs are younger, and their resources are less,\u201d said Ed Talty, an assistant district attorney in the Bronx.\u000a\u000aOr perhaps it\u2019s not that there are more communal guns, but rather, that they are easier to identify through forensic science.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe get a lot more ballistic matches than we ever have before,\u201d Lieutenant Ruane said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. You go, how the hell did that match up to that shooting? It\u2019s a different command, a different borough, Brooklyn or something.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe two men who opened the Bronx mailbox may have been momentarily surprised by what they found inside \u2014 nothing. But they simply went to another hiding spot in the building, in a bag under the stairs, the police said. The building was routinely referred to as \u201cVietnam,\u201d a name coined during more violent times in the 1980s.\u000a\u000aPhoto\u000a\u000aThere was the gun.\u000a\u000aThe two men emerged from the apartments on East 161st Street, and one of them, Solomon Corbett, 23, raised the gun and ended the argument with Ms. Crute by shooting her in the head and chest, the police said. He later told the police that he felt threatened by her boyfriend and intended to shoot him, but missed. That he hit her nine times seems to have weakened his case for self-defense.\u000a\u000aMr. Corbett has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. The gun was never found. It may have been thrown away, or it may be stashed somewhere else, because when it comes to community guns, hiding holes abound.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

aVThree years ago, Johns Hopkins University researchers in Baltimore asked a seemingly simple straightforward question: Could the persistent gap in reading performance between poor students and wealthier ones be closed if they gave the poor students eyeglasses?\u000a\u000aThey knew that poorer students were less likely to have glasses than wealthier white children, but data were limited on whether simply helping children better focus on the page in front of them might improve their ability to master a skill essential for early learning. They screened several hundred second- and third-graders, gave two pairs of eyeglasses to the ones who needed them (about 60 percent of the group, based on a uniquely liberal prescribing standard) and then they tracked their school performance over the course of the year. The outcomes were notable even with the small sample size\u2014reading proficiency improved significantly compared with the children who did not need eyeglasses. In late 2015, a conversation between Dr. Leana Wen, the new Baltimore City health commissioner, and Johns Hopkins President Ronald Daniels about areas of potential collaboration quickly focused on students\u2019 eyesight. Vision screening by the health department had already identified an unmet need for thousands of children; the research seemed to confirm the value of addressing it in the school setting.\u000a\u000aIn May 2016, the Baltimore Health Department assembled a public-private coalition made up of the city\u2019s public school system, Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins School of Education, eyeglass retailer Warby Parker, and a national nonprofit called Vision To Learn.\u000a\u000aThe three-year program, called Vision for Baltimore, plans to visit 150 schools over the course of the study and screen 60,000 students, making it the biggest study of its kind. The data officials expect to glean could radically alter how school systems across the country approach one of the most difficult and consequential problems in modern education. It may well be that the solution to the persistent gap in reading proficiency is not instructional, but a simple health issue that could be addressed with a pair eyeglasses that could cost a couple of hundred dollars at the mall.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe know, based on common sense, that giving glasses for kids is important for education [and] health,\u201d said Dr. Wen.\u000a\u000aDierra Sollers, a fifth-grader at Dr. Bernard Harris, Sr. Elementary School, tries on her new glasses, as schools CEO Dr. Sonja Brookins Santelises looks on. Sollers' glasses were symbolically the 1,000th pair given out to Baltimore public school students through the Vision for Baltimore program. | Kenneth K. Lam/Baltimore Sun/TNS via Getty Images | Getty Images\u000a\u000aAs of mid-August, Vision for Baltimore has performed nearly 18,000 screenings and distributed nearly 2,000 pairs of glasses for free. That\u2019s on schedule of the program\u2019s goal to give out 8,000 glasses before the end of the study. They estimate that just 20 percent of screened children who need glasses subsequently get them, leaving as many as 20,000 children citywide staring fuzzily at the board in their classrooms.\u000a\u000aExperts attribute the glasses gap to Maryland law, which requires screening only or pre-K, first-and eighth-graders. A child who develops eyesight issues in second grade could wait years before being examined again, falling further behind peers. But even with mandatory screening, parents may not follow through. Parents might not be able to afford the glasses if they don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. (Maryland\u2019s Medicaid system covers one pair of eyeglasses for minors per year, and will replace them in some cases.) The consequences of not addressing eyesight problems early can be dire and compounding. Studies over the past decade suggest that students who perform badly in school are misdiagnosed with behavioral disorders or special education needs when the culprit was their poor eyesight.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe solution was deceptively simple: If kids can\u2019t get to the doctor, bring the doctor to the kids. Under the Vision for Baltimore program, a mobile clinic shows up to the school for about a week during the school year to determine whether a child may need glasses. In Baltimore, the city health department conducts the screening, which requires checking distance vision, depth perception and eye alignment. If the child fails the screening test, he is given a parental consent form for an optometry exam on the school campus. Two weeks later, an optician comes to the school to fit the glasses, which the child picks himself. Each student gets one pair.\u000a\u000aShandra Worthy-Owens, principal of Dr. Bernard Harris Sr. Elementary School, said V4B has been a success at her school. The project clinicians communicated weekly to make sure the school had the necessary forms and knew when the clinic would arrive on campus for screenings. \u201cThey just supported us throughout the whole process,\u201d Worthy-Owens said. Her school staff conducted home visits, made extra phone calls and stayed late on campus to accommodate with parents\u2019 work schedules.\u000a\u000aAbout 100 students, a fourth of Worthy-Owens\u2019 school\u2019s total, received the glasses in March. Though there are no hard data yet on reading proficiency, Worthy-Owens said teachers at her school have noticed those students who received and regularly wear glasses from V4B have improved in the classroom. The glasses have even boosted student self-esteem: Her school spotlights the students for wearing their glasses on a bulletin board, she said, and none of them have been bullied. She attributes this to the way they promote the \u201ccoolness\u201d of wearing them.\u000a\u000aBut the program still has to overcome a lack of cooperation from some parents, who often fail to fill out necessary paperwork. Families can provide a Medicaid number to cover the cost of the exam, for example, but many do not, or the number comes back wrong or illegible. The cost is covered with or without a Medicaid number, but Worthy-Owens said some parents did not want their children to get glasses even after they were identified, either because they fear the cost or resist revealing other personal information to the school. \u201cTrust was an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have the relationship with the community in order for the consent process to work.\u201d Worthy-Owens said she often has to persuade reluctant parents to fill out the one-page consent form, which asks for the child\u2019s name, gender, birthdate, address, school and Medicaid identification number, as well as the parents\u2019 names and phone number. Next year, the form will not ask for a Medicaid number so fewer parents will hesitate to turn it in. If the program can\u2019t overcome hurdles like these, says Bob Slavin, who leads Johns Hopkins center for education reform, Vision for Baltimore doesn\u2019t \u201chave a prayer\u201d of getting anywhere near its goal of reaching 20,000 in-need children.\u000a\u000aThe project is expensive and relies on philanthropy. Vision To Learn pays about $100 per child in each community\u2014this covers each area\u2019s mobile clinic, eyeglasses, vision tests, directors\u2019 oversight and optometry team. The mobile clinic alone costs around $115,000\u2014$100,000 to buy and renovate the van and $15,000 for medical equipment. The nonprofit receives revenue from insurance reimbursement and private donations. Baltimore\u2019s health department pays $250,000 annually in salaries for its three screeners and office staff. The research team meets their own costs from donations and grants.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the kids are wearing glasses and they\u2019re doing better, the attendance is higher, and the standardized test scores have improved, then you can really make the argument for why this needs to be built into what schools do,\u201d said Megan Collins, a lead researcher in the study.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all know the need is there,\u201d said Austin Beutner, chairman and founder of Vision To Learn. \u201cWe have a lot to come, not only in Baltimore.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Health Care\u000a\u000aEducation\u000a\u000aBaltimore

Thomas/Getty Images Trump hits new low in public opinion \u2014 but he\u2019s still beating Hillary Clinton Just 36 percent of those reached by the poll feel either very or somewhat positive about Trump.\u000a\u000aThe number of Americans who say they hold positive views of President Donald Trump has dropped to its lowest point since his inauguration, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBut the fresh survey offered Trump at least one potential bit of solace: He\u2019s still beating Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aJust 36 percent of those reached by the poll said they have either very or somewhat positive feelings about Trump, two points lower than the poll\u2019s June iteration. But at 36 percent, Trump still finished 6 points higher than Clinton, his 2016 Democratic opponent, about whom just 30 percent of respondents said they feel either very or somewhat positive.\u000a\u000aThe 2016 rivals were nearly deadlocked among those with negative feelings. Fifty-three percent of those polled said they hold either very or somewhat negative feelings towards Clinton, while 52 percent said the same of Trump.\u000a\u000aWhile the president has struggled at times through the early months of his presidency, feuding with members of his own party, fueling racial tensions and failing thus far to push through a major legislative victory, Clinton has mostly stayed quiet aside from an occasional speaking engagement.\u000a\u000aIn recent weeks, excerpts from her forthcoming book, titled \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d have trickled out, including bits in which she recalls being put off by Trump\u2019s behavior during one of their debates and passages published by CNN that are critical of former FBI Director James Comey, former Vice President Joe Biden and her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for the doubt they expressed about her campaign.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s approval rating in the poll was unchanged relative to June, remaining at 40 percent. The number of respondents who said they disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance also remained the same at 55 percent.\u000a\u000aRespondents expressed warm feelings for former President Barack Obama, about whom 51 percent said they felt positive, compared to 35 percent who said they held negative feelings about him. Forty-four percent said they felt positive about Sanders and 45 percent said the same of former President George W. Bush. Thirty percent of those polled said they held negative feelings towards both Sanders and Bush.\u000a\u000aThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll was conducted from August 5-9, contacting 1,200 adults nationwide via landlines and cell phones. The poll\u2019s margin of error was plus-or-minus 2.82 points.

Even the lineup for Thursday\u2019s gathering suggested as much. It was billed as a foreign ministers\u2019 meeting \u2014 but, of the Visegrad countries, only Poland and Hungary had foreign ministers present. Slovakia and the Czech Republic sent state secretaries.\u000a\u000aIn recent months, there have been other signs that Czech and Slovak leaders have concluded their countries are best served by being close to the EU\u2019s Franco-German heart, especially as Paris and Berlin have signaled they want to embark on a new drive for European integration after Germany\u2019s parliamentary election on September 24.\u000a\u000aThe Czech Republic is planning to request observer status at meetings of eurozone finance ministers. Meanwhile, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said a couple of weeks ago that the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of his policy were being \u201cclose to the [EU] core, close to France, to Germany.\u201d\u000a\u000aPoland and Hungary, by contrast, have clashed with the European Commission and Western European governments repeatedly in recent years, on issues including the rule of law and migration \u2014 to the increasing discomfort of politicians in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.\u000a\u000aPetr Je\u017eek, a Czech member of the European Parliament representing the centrist ANO movement, which leads in opinion polls ahead of a general election in October, said the Visegrad Group was a \u201cuseful format for regional cooperation\u201d in the long term. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the government in Poland and to some extent the one in Hungary are not the ones one should team up with too much.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile leaders of all the Visegrad countries emphasize their commitment to the group, officials in Slovakia and the Czech Republic highlight the importance of other relationships.\u000a\u000a\u201cVisegrad is not the only pillar on which the Czech Republic builds its Central European policy,\u201d said Tomas Kafka, director of the Central Europe department at the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing the country\u2019s strategic dialogue with Germany and its so-called Slavkov cooperation with Slovakia and Austria.\u000a\u000a\u201cAll three pillars are equally \u2026 useful to us,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u2018Cultural counter-revolution\u2019\u000a\u000aHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán\u2019s government has worked to use the Visegrad Group as a tool for boosting its profile on the European stage.\u000a\u000a\u201cOrbán and [Polish ruling party leader Jaros\u0142aw] Kaczy\u0144ski would like to see Visegrad as a breeding ground of a \u2018cultural counter-revolution\u2019 in the EU \u2026 counterbalancing the liberal, federalist Europe of Germany and France,\u201d said Péter Krekó, director at the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute, a think tank.\u000a\u000a\u201cBut with Slovakia in the eurozone, and the Czech Republic aiming to be an observer in the Eurogroup meetings, they have already made their decisions to belong to the core of the EU,\u201d he said, adding that Austria, Germany and France were all working to undermine the cohesion of the Visegrad Group.\u000a\u000aOne issue on which the Visegrad Group appeared united was their opposition to accepting quotas of migrants allocated by the European Commission. But Milan Ni\u010d, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said the Slovak government softened its stance on this issue after a general election last year.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil then, Fico was very much a populist and sided with Orbán as part of his domestic campaign. But then he formed a coalition with a liberal Slovak Hungarian party, which is pro-refugee \u2026 he started to backpedal,\u201d Ni\u010d said.\u000a\u000aA clear sign that Western European governments are not treating all members of the Visegrad Group in the same way came as recently as last week. When French President Emmanuel Macron visited Central and Eastern Europe, he chose to meet in Salzburg with the Czech and Slovak leadership, while snubbing the Polish and Hungarian governments.\u000a\u000aDuring his election campaign and after taking office, Macron criticized democratic backsliding in Central Europe, angering Hungarian and Polish leaders. And he has vowed to reform Europe\u2019s posted workers directive, which allows companies in Western Europe to use cheaper labor from the east of the Continent. That move has especially irked the Polish leadership, which fears businesses could suffer.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said some of Macron\u2019s comments on Poland were \u201cdirected at his domestic audience.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe French president\u2019s \u201cidea to reform the posted workers directive of the European Union is supposed to be discussed in the framework of experts and not brought to the political level or ideological level,\u201d he said, stressing that Polish, Czech and Slovak officials will work together to try to get a compromise on posted workers.\u000a\u000aPoland does not feel \u201cisolated,\u201d Waszczykowski said. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he added, referring to Central European and Eastern Partnership officials on the stage.

aVThe appointment of a prominent journalist to Macron's team fits into a major rejigging of his media strategy | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images Macron signs up journalist as spokesman amid PR shakeup The outspoken Bruno Roger-Petit joins will be responsible for \u2018broadcasting the Elysée\u2019s public message.\u2019\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office named TV journalist and opinion writer Bruno Roger-Petit as a spokesman Tuesday, completing a shakeup of the French president\u2019s communications team amid falling poll scores.\u000a\u000aRoger-Petit\u2019s hiring came after the Elysée presidential palace this summer brought in three new press attachés, two of them from Macron\u2019s centrist La République en Marche movement.\u000a\u000aRoger-Petit, named as a \u201cspokesman and adviser to the president,\u201d will be tasked with \u201cbroadcasting the Elysée\u2019s public message\u201d via \u201cany means at his disposal, notably the presidency\u2019s Twitter account,\u201d a statement from Macron\u2019s office said.\u000a\u000aThe appointment of a prominent journalist to Macron\u2019s team fits into a major rejigging of his media strategy.\u000a\u000aNo longer concerned with preserving his mystique, Macron will speak out more frequently to explain his reform agenda and fight back against plummeting approval scores.\u000a\u000aThe president is also pressing his cabinet members and staff to speak out in his defense on TV and radio.\u000a\u000aBy hiring Roger-Petit, a no-holds-barred debater, the Elysée gains a combative presence already known to much of the public after stints as a news presenter and a frequent guest on popular talk shows.\u000a\u000aMost recently, he wrote political commentary for Challenges, a business magazine.\u000a\u000aA prolific tweeter with more than 70,000 followers, Roger-Petit deleted his account minutes after his appointment was made public.\u000a\u000aBut he will have trouble hiding years of strong opinions, including an article he penned in July headlined \u201cWhy Macron must absolutely abandon Jupiter\u201d that seemed to presage the president\u2019s about-face on communications. The \u201cJupiterian\u201d concept was developed by Macron\u2019s team in the last few months of the presidential campaign to illustrate his vision of the presidency. Jupiter is the supreme god of Roman mythology \u2014 god of the sky, thunder and lightning.\u000a\u000aRoger-Petit may have been pulling his punches in that article. In early 2016 he wrote that Macron had \u201cstolen everything\u201d from former Prime Minister Manuel Valls.\u000a\u000aRoger-Petit\u2019s big challenge now is to turn the tide of negative opinion while also avoiding the fate of another journalist-turned-spokeswoman, Laurence Haim. Formerly the Washington correspondent for iTele, Haim was hired as a spokeswoman during Macron\u2019s campaign but did not win a government appointment, and went back to journalism.

aVBritish Prime Minister Theresa May | Pool photo by Andy Rain/EPA Theresa May pushes to ease Brexit law through House of Commons Opposition accuses British PM of \u2018power grab\u2019 over proposed changes to key committees.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 Theresa May will attempt to change lawmaking rules to overcome her lost majority and ease new Brexit laws through the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aMPs will vote Tuesday on a new motion that would automatically give the Conservatives a majority on key committees required to pass new laws, the Huffington Post and Independent both reported Thursday.\u000a\u000aMay lost her parliamentary majority in June after calling a snap election, but stayed in power because of a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who agreed to back her government on key votes.\u000a\u000aThe motion, which is due to be published Friday, would allow the prime minister to control the legislative agenda in the crucial committee stages of lawmaking without assistance from any other party.\u000a\u000aThe EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which started its passage through the House of Commons in earnest on Thursday and brings EU law onto the U.K. statute book, is already coming under fire from MPs who fear it hands executive powers to ministers during the Brexit process by giving them the authority to change legislation without consulting parliament.\u000a\u000aA U.K. bill has three stages, called readings, and between second and third readings there is a committee stage where a bill is scrutinized clause by clause.\u000a\u000aA public bill committee, which examines the details of a particular bill, normally consists of between 18 and 30 MPs, chosen by the committee of selection. By long-standing convention, the party balance on the committee matches the distribution of votes in the last general election.\u000a\u000aThe leaked motion states that House of Commons rules will be changed so that \u201cwhere a committee has an odd number of members, the government shall have a majority.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd \u201cwhere a committee has an even number of members, the number of government and opposition members shall be equal, but this instruction shall not apply to the nomination of any public bill committee.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn practise, this means should they win Tuesday\u2019s vote, the Tories will have a majority on every key committee, despite not having an overall majority in the Commons.\u000a\u000aA government spokesperson said: \u201cThese proposals create the fairest balance between the opposition and government, and will ensure technical, procedural rules do not cause unwarranted delays to the business of parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe adjustments provide for maximum scrutiny with minimum disruption and delay, both to parliamentary proceedings and to the governance of the country,\u201d the spokesperson added.\u000a\u000aShadow Leader of the House Valerie Vaz told the Huffington Post: \u201cThis is an unprecedented power grab by a minority government that lost its moral authority as well as its majority at the general election.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe British people will not understand how having voted to deny the Conservatives a majority, the Tories can alter the rules of parliament to ensure they have one.\u201d

aVBOLOGNA, Italy \u2014 Once, the Northern League campaigned for the break-up of Italy. Now, the party\u2019s challenge is how to reconcile its separatist roots with the national ambitions of its leader, Matteo Salvini.\u000a\u000aThe ultimate aim of the Northern League, according to its constitution, is the independence of \u201cPadania\u201d \u2014 the party\u2019s name for the broad region across northern Italy it argues should constitute an independent state. But you wouldn\u2019t know it since Salvini became leader in 2013.\u000a\u000aThe Northern League\u2019s bellicose leader has propelled his once marginal party into one of the largest in Italy by hammering on topics like crime, terrorism, immigration, and the ills of the European Union. Regional autonomy \u2014 once his party\u2019s defining issue \u2014 has almost completely dropped out of his register.\u000a\u000aIf Salvini is to maintain that so-far successful strategy ahead of parliamentary elections expected early next year, he will have to overcome resistance by some of that party\u2019s old guard \u2014 including its two most prominent regional leaders, Luca Zaia, president of Italy\u2019s Veneto region, and Roberto Maroni, Salvini\u2019s predecessor who is now president of Lombardy, the region around Milan.\u000a\u000aLombardy and Veneto, the party\u2019s two electoral strongholds, are due to hold advisory referendums on October 22 asking voters whether they support more autonomous powers for the regional governments. The measures are expected to pass overwhelmingly; the true test will be turnout.\u000a\u000aIf the two Northern League leaders can mobilize numbers and show the issue matters to people, it would build momentum for their party ahead of a general election expected early next year. It could also provide a platform for the popular Zaia to challenge Salvini over the direction he has taken the party.\u000a\u000aThis transformation of the Northern League is a curious chapter in the long struggle between regionalism and centralism in Italy.\u000a\u000aAsked why the Northern League has changed its focus, Salvini\u2019s allies say that issues like immigration are so urgent that the party\u2019s long-term goals can wait.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe League responds to the questions of the time,\u201d said Massimiliano Fedriga, the party\u2019s leader in the lower house, who is close to Salvini. \u201cWe can\u2019t give the responses to citizens today which we gave 20 or 30 years ago. This is normal. We are responding to the needs of people.\u201d\u000a\u000aCan the center hold?\u000a\u000aThis transformation of the Northern League is a curious chapter in the long struggle between regionalism and centralism in Italy, which goes back to its creation out of a patchwork of fiefdoms in the 19th century.\u000a\u000aItaly has 20 regions: fifteen have a small measure of tax and spending ability, and five have the deeper autonomous powers to which the Northern League in Lombardy and Veneto aspires.\u000a\u000aAll five special autonomous regions \u2014 the islands Sicily and Sardinia, and three areas that border Austria and France \u2014 are geographically distant from Rome and have prevalent local languages that differ from standard Italian.\u000a\u000aSalvini took over the leadership at a low point, following a disastrous national election and an embezzlement scandal that forced the resignation of senior party figures.\u000a\u000aHis reinvention of the Northern League has made it the most popular party on the right, approaching 15 percent in opinion polls, just ahead of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia.\u000a\u000aSalvini\u2019s open ambition is to lead a coalition of the right into government next year, and polls indicate he might just be able to do it.\u000a\u000aThe bearded firebrand won an endorsement of his country-wide strategy in the party\u2019s national congress in May. He was reelected leader with 83 percent of the vote, seeing off a challenge from a former lawmaker backed by the party\u2019s old guard, Giovanni Fava, who ran on a platform of restoring the party\u2019s traditional focus on regional autonomy to \u201csave the League.\u201d Fava has become a prominent autonomy campaigner ahead of the referendums.\u000a\u000aThe party\u2019s founder and president for life Umberto Bossi begrudged Salvini\u2019s victory, complaining of low turnout and alienation of its core activist base.\u000a\u000aTransformation\u000a\u000aThe contrast between the party Bossi led and the direction in which Salvini has taken it is stark.\u000a\u000aBossi was notorious for railing against southern Italians as lazy, corrupt peasants enabled by the state to freeload off hardworking northerners.\u000a\u000aSalvini, by contrast, campaigns in Italy\u2019s furthest southern reaches, from Sicily to Calabria. He has even floated the idea of changing the party\u2019s name to discard the word \u201cNorthern.\u201d His quest to lead the right even led him to court the modern-day fascist group CasaPound, which campaigns for a muscular Italian state with radically centralist economic policies.\u000a\u000a\u201cI have an idea of the League\u2026 that fights battles not just in Lombardy and Veneto, but by the side of earthquake victims from Abruzzo, fishermen from Sicily, farmers from Apulia,\u201d he said after his reelection.\u000a\u000aClaudio Borghi Aquilini, the party\u2019s head of economic policy, described how hardened Northern League veterans met political activists from the south.\u000a\u000aThey were \u201cbasically hugging each other, realizing they were on the same side of the divide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great moment.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe thought that our enemy was in Rome,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we discovered all the decisions are being taken in Brussels.\u201d\u000a\u000aCrucial test\u000a\u000aSo far, Salvini has squared the autonomy referendums in Veneto and Lombardy with his national strategy by avoiding mentioning them except for to promise \u201cregionalism for all.\u201d He has indicated that should the votes pass, he will push for further referendums to devolve powers to the country\u2019s 20 regions.\u000a\u000a\u201cReferendums for autonomy? I will propose them for all of Italy,\u201d a rare tweet by him on the subject read.\u000a\u000aStill, Salvini\u2019s new style has not caught on in the Northern League\u2019s local and regional branches, where leaders still speak in terms of northern Italy versus the south.\u000a\u000aThe question is whether, with its national leadership appearing to have abandoned the issue that once defined it, the party can still count on the deeply loyal activist base it once enjoyed.\u000a\u000aOreste Rossi, a former MEP who was a founding member of the Northern League in the Piedmont region, said he left the party after Bossi\u2019s resignation when it became clear it was changing political direction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe League once believed in Padanian independence,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cSalvini doesn\u2019t speak about regions anymore, he speaks about Italy.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIn a normal country it would be impossible to have a party like this, that has changed so radically from one week to another,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aAlong with a coterie of ex-League activists, Rossi has founded a group called \u201cGreat North,\u201d which campaigns for Italy to be divided into three states. Bossi has attended its events, and Maroni, Salvini\u2019s predecessor, openly called on the former leader not to be tempted to defect earlier this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am delighted if Salvini turns the League into a center-right party,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my friends in the League, but it\u2019s good for us. We are the pro-independence alternative.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe party\u2019s die-hard regionalists may keep quiet as long as Salvini\u2019s strategy is bringing the party closer to national power.\u000a\u000aThe secessionist currents of the north run deep, and they aren\u2019t going anywhere fast. Veneto\u2019s governor, Zaia, has been pursuing the referendum since 2014, when he vowed he would hold a vote after a contested online poll showed strong support for Veneto\u2019s independence.\u000a\u000aHis initial ambition was to hold a vote on outright independence or for the region to keep 80 percent of tax revenues, but both options were rejected by the Constitutional Court. Ultimately, Zaia settled for merely seeking more autonomous powers through an article in the constitution that allows regions to do just that.\u000a\u000aHe picked the date of the vote as October 22: the anniversary of the 1866 plebiscite that annexed the Kingdom of Lombardy-Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy.\u000a\u000aThe party\u2019s die-hard regionalists may keep quiet as long as Salvini\u2019s strategy is bringing the party closer to national power. But an electoral slip-up would bring the conflict out into the open.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe result of the election next year will be key,\u201d said Arianna Giovannini, a lecturer at De Montfort University who has been studying Salvini\u2019s transformation of the party. \u201cIf it does well, there may be a way of containing internal tensions. There would be less of an incentive to split.\u201d

aVBannon: 'Billy Bush weekend' cost Christie a Cabinet post\u000a\u000aFormer White House adviser Steve Bannon told "60 Minutes" that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was out of the running for a Cabinet position after his critical response to the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Donald Trump bragged about groping women.\u000a\u000a"Christie, because of Billy Bush weekend, was not looked at for a Cabinet position," Bannon said in an interview with Charlie Rose. Bush was the host of Access Hollywood in 2005, when Trump made the remarks, which resurfaced during the presidential campaign and caused several top Republicans to distance themselves from the nominee.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aWhen the tape surfaced, Christie called Trump's words "unacceptable," but said he was still supporting Trump in his bid for office.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat kind of talk and conversation \u2014 even in private \u2014 is just unacceptable,\u201d he said in October 2016. \u201cI was really disturbed and disappointed by it and embarrassed for him and his family.\u201d\u000a\u000aBannon said those remarks cost Christie a position in the administration.\u000a\u000a"I told him the plane leaves at 11 o'clock in the morning," Bannon said. "If you're on the plane, you're on the team. Didn't make the plane."\u000a\u000aPOLITICO previously reported that Trump offered Christie several jobs, including the labor secretary job, which he turned down.\u000a\u000aChristie spokesman Brian Murray said on Friday that Bannon's claims were "factually incorrect."\u000a\u000a"As has been widely reported, the governor had been offered multiple Cabinet positions in addition to other senior posts in the White House and elsewhere," Murray said in a statement. "He chose to stay as governor and complete his term. Any assertion to the contrary is simply factually incorrect."

aVRep. Charlie Dent's retirement comes the day after another swing district Republican, Washington Rep. Dave Reichert, announced he was calling it quits. GOP moderate Charlie Dent won't seek reelection to House in 2018\u000a\u000aPennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican who occupies a swing district, will not seek reelection in 2018, he confirmed in a statement on Thursday night.\u000a\u000aDent issued a statement emphasizing his lengthy career in public office and noting that he "never planned on serving" more than five or six terms \u2014 but he's now in his seventh.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aDent said his decision was the product of periodic discussions that began during the government shutdown in 2013 and continued into the mid-summer, when a small group of friends, family and staff decided he wouldn't run again.\u000a\u000aDent described himself as a member of the "governing wing of the Republican Party" and said he's always sought to "fulfill the basic functions of government, like keeping the lights on and preventing default."\u000a\u000a"Regrettably, that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction, disorder and chaos," he said.\u000a\u000aDent's retirement comes the day after another swing district Republican, Washington Rep. Dave Reichert, announced he was calling it quits. Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, another moderate, is also retiring. Democrats are certain to target all three seats in next year's midterms. Dent's announced departure comes one day after state Rep. Justin Simmons said he would challenge him in a primary.\u000a\u000aDent spent much of 2017 opposing President Donald Trump's agenda, to the chagrin of hard-line conservatives, who vowed to oppose him. Last Friday, 125 conservative allies of the president converged in Dent's district in Northeast Pennsylvania to voice their opposition to his actions in office.\u000a\u000aDent is leader of the centrist Tuesday Group. He has openly questioned the the GOP's proposed budget and the president's efforts on tax reform.\u000a\u000aDent's decision seemed to catch his primary rival, Simmons, off guard on Thursday evening.\u000a\u000a"I guess the polling must have been really bad. Can't say we were expecting this," he said.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aSimmons has feuded with Dent in recent weeks as he inched closer to mounting a primary challenge. He contended that Dent failed to adequately support Trump's agenda and that Dent had lost touch with the Republican Party in his district, as well as nationally. Dent fired back at Simmons last week, releasing a series of text messages, including one in which Simmons asked for his endorsement.\u000a\u000aSimmons formally entered the race on Wednesday, and said he "absolutely" thinks Dent decided to retire because of the challenge.\u000a\u000a"I think right now we could say, 'Mission Accomplished,'" Simmons said. "We wanted to make sure we got a more conservative candidate in the seat, and now we can do that."\u000a\u000aSimmons spoke Friday at a rally organized by groups aligned with Trump, who descended on Dent's district and called for his ouster. At the time, Dent rejected complaints that he doesn't support Trump, arguing that he was willing to work with the president.\u000a\u000a"At the same time," he added, "I am not a sycophant."\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania's 15th District with nearly 52 percent of the vote in 2016. But former President Barack Obama also won it once, and Democrats have long coveted the seat, which Dent protected even during wave elections last decade.\u000a\u000aCristiano Lima contributed to this report.

aVTim Kaine and Donald Trump Have Touted the Same Gun Violence Program. There\u2019s No Evidence That It Works. Project Exile was largely abandoned, but strict sentencing laws modeled after it are back in fashion.\u000a\u000aBy the mid-1990s, Richmond, Virginia, had become one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. The homicide rate hovered around 50 per 100,000 residents, high enough to place it in the top five most deadly cities in the country.\u000a\u000aDesperate to curb the violence, the city piloted a controversial program in 1997 intended to more severely punish perpetrators of gun crimes. Instead of trying cases in state courts, an approach that often led to abbreviated prison stays in nearby facilities, perpetrators were routed to federal courts, where the minimum prison sentence for illegal gun possession was five years. The federal prisons were also situated far from Richmond, and friends and family. The initiative was called Project Exile.\u000a\u000aIn its first year, gun-related homicides in Richmond dropped 40 percent. Senator Tim Kaine, who took office as the city\u2019s mayor in 1998, and was a city councilman when it was implemented, touted the program in his election campaigns and has claimed credit for its success. Project Exile has also found a supporter in Donald Trump, who hailed it in a position paper on Second Amendment rights as a program that protects responsible gun owners while punishing criminals who perpetrate violence with firearms.\u000a\u000aStay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis.

But research shows that Richmond\u2019s descent from the heights of violent crime in the mid-1990s likely had little to do with increased and more punitive sentences. The most comprehensive study to challenge its efficacy was published in 2003, and it claimed that while Richmond appeared to be getting safer in the years following Project Exile\u2019s rollout, the city\u2019s crime numbers would have likely fallen without the program\u2019s sentence enhancement.\u000a\u000aRichmond was experiencing an aberrantly high spike in violent crime just as prosecutors set Project Exile into motion in 1996. Researchers think it\u2019s likely that the number of shootings would have fallen from its abnormal upward swing in 1996 without a violence intervention program. Other cities similar with similar populations and crime rates to Richmond, including Norfolk, Virginia, reported similar drops in crime rates without programs that delivered harsher penalties to offenders.\u000a\u000aProject Exile was created in 1997 by prosecutors in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Richmond. They argued that illegal gun cases should be brought in federal court, where a determination of guilt would trigger a mandatory five-year prison sentence, with no opportunity for parole. Many offenders convicted under state law served a year or less on their sentence and then were released on probation or parole.\u000a\u000aIn bringing cases, prosecutors pursued certain violations of federal law, charging felons and domestic abusers who illegally carried guns, as well as drug users or traffickers who possessed guns.\u000a\u000aBefore the implementation of Project Exile, defendants charged with a gun crime were permitted to post bail. Some law enforcement experts said that the temporary release of potentially dangerous gun carriers dissuaded shooting witnesses from coming forward and slowed investigators\u2019 ability to clear crimes. In addition to lengthening sentences, Project Exile eliminated bail as a possibility, and also diminished plea bargaining.\u000a\u000aThe prosecutors who designed Project Exile decided to roll out the program with a huge marketing campaign. Barbara Joynes, who helped develop the messaging, tells The Trace that she was asked to craft advertising that would reach offenders most likely to be carrying guns.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not often you\u2019re asked to target people carrying a gun while committing a crime,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the demographic for that? You can\u2019t just go to market research and easily identify those people.\u201d With law enforcement\u2019s help, her team focused on outdoor advertising in high crime areas. Billboards, bus ads, radio spots, and television commercials warned: \u201cAn illegal gun will get you 5 years in Federal Prison.\u201d\u000a\u000aJoynes says the ads were convincing. \u201cWhen cops would catch somebody in a criminal act, they\u2019d pat them down and ask, are you carrying? The person would say, \u2018Are you crazy? I don\u2019t want to be exiled.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Project Exile\u2019s first two years, prosecutors indicted 404 people in Richmond on federal gun charges, six times as many as the city\u2019s annual average. (Federal gun charges are frequently reserved for crimes related to gun trafficking.) Of those, 86 percent were convicted, serving, on average, a prison term of 55 months.\u000a\u000aHomicides in Richmond fell from 160, their peak in 1994, to 94 in 1998 \u2014 a dazzling 41 percent drop. Incidents of violent crime also dipped during this time by over 20 percent.\u000a\u000aIn 1999, then-mayor Kaine told the New York Times that Project Exile is \u201cdriving the crime rate down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believers [in their own community] again.\u201d\u000a\u000aProject Exile became a model for other gun violence prevention efforts that centered on harsher criminal punishments. By 1999, the Virginia state legislature had passed statutes to implement a statewide version of Richmond\u2019s program, lengthening the sentences for gun crimes that offenders would serve in state prisons to five years. Seeing the immediate exaltation of Project Exile, other cities requested funding to emulate it. Philadelphia, Camden, Atlanta, Oakland, and Rochester all had their own versions of an Exile-like program. President George W. Bush\u2019s administration rolled out a $2 billion program called Project Safe Neighborhoods to increase federal prosecutions of gun crimes nationwide, which peaked in 2004.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone was pleased with Project Exile. African-Americans were disproportionately convicted under its auspices, and some black voters say they are still angry about it.\u000a\u000aCrucially, Project Exile\u2019s influence over the crime rate was also uncertain. In the 2003 study, University of Chicago researchers concluded that \u201cthe reduction in Richmond\u2019s gun homicide rates surrounding the implementation of Project Exile was not unusual and that almost all of the observed decrease probably would have occurred even in the absence of the program.\u201d\u000a\u000aCritics also said that imprisoning felons far from their hometowns excessively burdened families, who often had to travel hours to visit.\u000a\u000aOakland, which implemented a version of Project Exile in 1999, saw homicide rates rise after it shifted gun cases to federal courts.\u000a\u000aIn the decades since Project Exile was introduced, sentencing reform has gained traction among both political parties, as people continue to call into question the purpose \u2014 and humaneness \u2014 of imprisoning people far from their homes for long periods of time. Many cities abandoned their versions of Project Exile, and federal funding for Project Safe Neighborhoods has been rolled back.\u000a\u000aRochester\u2019s Project Exile is one of the few versions of program still active. After 18 years, results are mixed.\u000a\u000aBut the punitive spirit of Exile survives through other policies, like gun enhancement \u2014 increasing sentences based on the presence of a gun during an offense \u2014 and mandatory minimum sentences in state statutes.\u000a\u000aEven though some research indicates that swiftness and certainty of punishment are better deterrents to crime than the severity of the punishment, a bipartisan federal proposal for sentencing reform from last October left intact mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes.\u000a\u000aAs homicides in cities surge, officials in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Baltimore are calling for mandatory minimum sentences for gun convictions.\u000a\u000aKevin Davis, the police commissioner of Baltimore, which closed out its bloodiest year ever in December, with 344 homicides, is pushing for a statewide bill modeled after Project Exile that would impose a one-year minimum sentence for illegal gun carrying.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we\u2019re going to win this conflict, there has to be a consequence to someone making a decision to arm himself with an illegal firearm,\u201d he said in an interview with the Baltimore Sun. \u201cRight now, that consequence is nonexistent.\u201d\u000a\u000a[Photo: Evan Vucci/Gerald Herbert/AP]

aVTheresa May casts a glance over at German chancellor Angela Merkel during a joint presser in 2016 | Soren Stache/EPA Opinion Why Berlin won\u2019t come to UK\u2019s rescue on Brexit The economic case for Germans to back a soft exit is not as strong as Brits think.\u000a\u000aBERLIN \u2014 With the German election around the corner, the United Kingdom appears to be holding out hope that a fourth term for Chancellor Angela Merkel and a potentially more pro-business coalition partner could come to its rescue in divorce talks in Brussels.\u000a\u000aSuch wishful thinking is understandable given London\u2019s precarious negotiating position, but it reflects major misconceptions about Berlin\u2019s ability \u2014 and its willingness \u2014 to push for a softer Brexit.\u000a\u000aFor most Germans, Brexit is still a bit of puzzle. How does retreating from a club of like-minded democratic countries allow Britain \u201cto take back control,\u201d they wonder.\u000a\u000aWhen German voters look at the economic and political challenges facing Europe \u2014 the threats to its security and the disdain that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin show for its institutions and values \u2014 they want more cooperation in Europe, not less.\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s Brexiteers have claimed they don\u2019t want to leave Europe, just the European Union. But that statement only proves how little they understand about how Germany sees the bloc. For Berlin, the EU is a core national interest and the only permanent and effective solution for political cooperation in Europe.\u000a\u000aFor Germany, nothing is more important than the single market.\u000a\u000aIn theory, of course, European nations could work together without common institutions. But for the Germans especially, history has shown us that this doesn\u2019t go smoothly in practice. And the more complex the issues at stake, the more pressing the need for common institutions and shared sovereignty becomes.\u000a\u000aAs a result, all major parties in Germany are, by British standards, strongly pro-European. The differences between them are subtle and mostly concern the eurozone.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to Brexit, all parties more or less agree: Germany doesn\u2019t want to punish Britain and wants a good relationship in the future, but it won\u2019t stand for \u201ccherry-picking.\u201d In other words, Germans don\u2019t like the idea of selective participation in the single market, and they will try to make sure the EU27 remain united in the talks.\u000a\u000aSome in the U.K. have expressed hope that a coalition government of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) will take a more pragmatic approach and put the country\u2019s economic interests first.\u000a\u000aBut that theory is the result of another major misunderstanding: The Brits believe the economic case for a softer German stance is strong. The opposite is true.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, German businesses would like to minimize the economic disruption that comes from a hard Brexit \u2014 but not at the cost of setting a dangerous precedent for the EU.\u000a\u000aFor German businesses, whose complex supply chains criss-cross the entire EU, nothing is more important than the single market, with its common rules and institutions. If forced to choose, business will always choose to protect the single market over tariff-free access to the U.K.\u000a\u000aNor is it true that the British market is more important for the German economy than vice versa. Despite Germany\u2019s sizeable trade surplus with Britain, both countries\u2019 economies depend roughly equally on each other\u2019s markets.\u000a\u000aIt is highly unlikely that the liberal FDP would use its precious bargaining chips with the CDU/CSU on the Brexit question. If the FDP takes a stance on Europe to set itself apart in coalition talks, it will do so on eurozone issues.\u000a\u000aThe party is strongly opposed to the integrationist plans of French President Emmanuel Macron, as is a sizeable chunk of the German population. Its young leader, Christian Lindner, is far more likely to focus on pushing through its vision for European reform than stick his neck out for the Brits.\u000a\u000aYes, Germany is the largest and most powerful country in Europe, and yes, perhaps it could push through a softer stance on Brexit if it wanted to. But David Davis was wrong to suggest before the Brexit referendum that if the U.K. voted to leave, it would negotiate a deal with Berlin, not Brussels.\u000a\u000aEU policy is not determined by Germany alone, nor could it be. Neutralizing the potential for German dominance by creating common European institutions was one of the EU\u2019s main founding goals.\u000a\u000aAn EU that follows a solely German agenda would be unappealing to its members and harmful to Germany\u2019s national interest in the long run. Berlin knows that.\u000a\u000aThe eurozone and refugee crisis have already pushed Germany into a leadership role it was reluctant to take and undermined the EU\u2019s appeal in some countries.\u000a\u000aBerlin will be reluctant to put itself once again ahead of the rest of the pack. Indeed, even if the next German government has a notably softer view on Brexit than other countries, it would not be in its interest to strong-arm the rest of the EU into following its lead.\u000a\u000aHowever you look at it, the German election will have only a minor effect on the Britain\u2019s divorce talks. Brexiteers would be well advised to focus on preparing their public for the hard political choices to come rather than hoping for a new Merkel government to come to their rescue.\u000a\u000aSuch a belief \u2014 popular among British Conservatives \u2014 was false when David Cameron tried to renegotiate Britain\u2019s EU membership, and it is false now.\u000a\u000aChristian Odendahl is chief economist and Berlin representative at the Centre for European Reform.

He said the British government was asking for EU law, its customs union and the rules of the single market to be suspended at the border.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe U.K. wants to use Ireland as a kind of test case,\u201d Barnier said, adding: \u201cThis will not happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aBarnier said the EU recognized the \u201cunique situation and the specific circumstances of the Republic of Ireland\u201d and that he considered it a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to address Ireland\u2019s concerns in his negotiations with Britain.\u000a\u000aIn a statement in response to the paper, the Irish government said: \u201cThe paper clearly reflects the continuing close engagement between Ireland and the EU Task Force \u2026 Our priorities remain protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, including by avoiding a hard border, and maintaining the Common Travel Area.\u201d\u000a\u000aBarnier also said that the U.K. appeared to be \u201cbacktracking\u201d on its position on financial commitments to the EU, which it had acknowledged in July.

aVA copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was obtained by The New York Times.\u000a\u000aThe acknowledgment by the president\u2019s eldest son that he intended to seek legal counsel after the meeting suggests that he knew, or at least suspected, that accepting potentially damaging information about a rival campaign from a foreign country raised thorny legal issues.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on what, if any, information they had, I could then consult with counsel to make an informed decision as to whether to give it further consideration.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Trump\u2019s lengthy interview took place in the basement of the Capitol, with Mr. Trump successfully evading reporters as he left and returned for bathroom breaks. The interview was conducted by committee staff, with Democratic and Republican teams of investigators taking turns questioning Mr. Trump in one-hour blocks. A handful of senators also attended portions of the meeting.\u000a\u000aThe June 2016 meeting was arranged after the younger Mr. Trump received an email from a family associate saying that potentially damaging information was being provided as part of the Russian government\u2019s support for his father. But in his statement on Thursday, he described his decision to agree to the meeting as the byproduct of the chaotic, seat-of-the-pants campaign assembled by his father, rather than any attempt to collude with Russia.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump has given differing accounts of his contacts last year with Russians. He told The Times in March that he never met with Russians on behalf of the campaign, a statement his lawyer has since said was meant to refer to Russian government officials. In July, he described the Trump Tower meeting as primarily focused on the issue of Russian adoptions, before eventually acknowledging that he took the meeting because he was told Ms. Veselnitskaya had damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.\u000a\u000aBut intentionally misspeaking to Congress is a crime, giving his statement on Thursday added weight. If there were any doubt about the stakes, the office of Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a member of the panel, made them clear in an email to reporters on Thursday afternoon that included the text of the so-called False Statements statute.\u000a\u000aMr. Trump told investigators that working for his father\u2019s campaign consumed his life. \u201cI had never worked on a campaign before, and it was an exhausting, all-encompassing, life-changing experience. Every single day I fielded dozens, if not hundreds, of emails and phone calls.\u201d\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Trump\u2019s brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, painted a similar picture during an interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aIn his statement, Mr. Trump said he had some reservations about the June 2016 proposal from the meeting\u2019s facilitator, Rob Goldstone, whom he described as a \u201ccolorful\u201d music promoter he had come to know through the son of a Russian oligarch. Mr. Goldstone asked Mr. Trump to take a meeting that would include potentially damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.\u000a\u000a\u201cSince I had no additional information to validate what Rob was saying, I did not quite know what to make of his email,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no way to gauge the reliability, credibility or accuracy of any of the things he was saying.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs it later turned out, my skepticism was justified,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cThe meeting provided no meaningful information and turned out not to be about what had been represented.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an email response to Mr. Goldstone, Mr. Trump wrote that if the promised information about Mrs. Clinton was as advertised, \u201cI love it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cAs much as some have made of my using the phrase \u2018I love it,\u2019 it was simply a colloquial way of saying that I appreciated Rob\u2019s gesture,\u201d he said in his statement on Thursday.\u000a\u000aWhen asked why, shortly after the Trump Tower meeting was set up, his father promised to deliver a \u201cmajor speech\u201d about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccorrupt dealings,\u201d Mr. Trump said that that was merely the way his father speaks, according to a person familiar with the interview.\u000a\u000aThe Senate Judiciary Committee is one of three congressional panels investigating aspects of President Trump\u2019s links to Russia and related matters. The committee, which has oversight of the Justice Department, is particularly interested in the circumstances surrounding President Trump\u2019s abrupt firing in May of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aDemocrats have repeatedly said that they still expect Donald Trump Jr. to appear at a public committee hearing and were careful to cast the Thursday sit-down as a staff-driven interview, where senators breezed in and out merely to observe. It was unclear if Mr. Trump had agreed to such testimony, and the committee\u2019s chairman, Charles E. Grassley, did not say one way or another whether there would be a hearing.\u000a\u000aSpokesmen for Mr. Grassley and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, declined to comment on the interview after it concluded. Committee members who did not attend are expected to be briefed on its contents in the coming days.\u000a\u000aSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said the mood behind closed doors was \u201ccordial\u201d and that investigators were asking primarily factual questions.\u000a\u000aHe said that what he had heard from Mr. Trump made him only more certain that the committee needed to hear from other attendees of the Trump Tower meeting, including Mr. Kushner and Paul J. Manafort, who was the Trump campaign chairman at the time. Mr. Blumenthal said that the committee needs to look further into how Mr. Trump\u2019s initial statements to the news media about that meeting were put together.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe covered a good deal of ground,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u201cThere is still a lot of questioning to be covered.\u201d

CNN found a copy out at a Florida bookstore Tuesday and read it overnight.\u000a\u000aAccording to the passages made public, Clinton wastes no time taking aim at her Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. She blames him for setting the framework for Trump to begin calling her Crooked Hillary. She also calls some of Sanders supporters \u201csexist\u201d and attacks their behavior online.\u000a\u000aSimon & Schuster via Associated Press Clinton\u2019s new book is called \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn one section that was tweeted out by a pro-Clinton Twitter account: \u201cWhen I finally challenged Bernie during a debate to name a single time I changed a position or a vote because of a financial contribution, he couldn\u2019t come up with anything,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNonetheless, his attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump\u2019s \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 campaign.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000aClinton went on: \u201cHe certainly shared my horror at the thought of Donald Trump becoming President, and I appreciate that he campaigned for me in the general election. But he isn\u2019t a Democrat \u2014 that\u2019s not a smear, that\u2019s what he says. He didn\u2019t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Hillary-Bernie divide has continued to simmer inside of Democratic politics through much of 2017. But the Democrats have worked to move past it, or at least to relegate it to the background. Headlines blaring that Clinton blames Sanders for what happened 10 months ago will reopen old wounds and undermine those efforts, making Democrats look nearly as fractured as Republicans.\u000a\u000aWhat the party needs at this moment is to look forward, not back.\u000a\u000aAnd if party politics weren\u2019t enough of a headache, the timing of the book release is also problematic from a news-cycle perspective. While the decision on when to release a manuscript is often made months in advance, the release date for this one means that Clinton will start her promotional rounds on television this weekend, just as Hurricane Irma is set to land in Florida. Not exactly the publicity storm she\u2019ll be looking for.

aVIntel's new Dual-Core Xeon Processor 5100 | Intel via Getty Images Intel wins retrial over \u20ac1.06 billion fine in setback for Commission Ruling translates into years of additional litigation and casts doubt over landmark Commission case.\u000a\u000aIn a victory for Intel\u2019s lawyers, the EU\u2019s top court on Wednesday ordered a retrial of the chipmaker\u2019s appeal against a \u20ac1.06 billion antitrust fine, ruling that a lower court should have delved further into the European Commission accusations.\u000a\u000aThe ruling translates into years of additional litigation and casts doubt over a landmark Commission case.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe General Court was required to examine all of Intel\u2019s arguments \u2026 which the General Court failed to do,\u201d the European Court of Justice said in a statement issued to the press.\u000a\u000aCommission regulators concluded in 2009 that Intel, then the dominant manufacturer of certain computer chips, offered discounts or paid customers on condition they shun rival Advanced Micro Devices. It was fined \u20ac1.06 billion, a record sum until the Commission hit Google with a \u20ac2.42 billion sanction in June.\u000a\u000aThe General Court had backed the Commission and rejected Intel\u2019s initial appeal in its entirety. The ECJ ruled it should have closely scrutinized the Commission\u2019s economic evidence but stopped well short of striking down the Commission decision.\u000a\u000aIn a blow for Intel, the ECJ rejected the chipmaker\u2019s claims that the EU antitrust regulator made procedural mistakes and targeted conduct outside the EU\u2019s jurisdiction.\u000a\u000aLawyers for Qualcomm, which is battling a probe based on similar allegations as contained in the Intel case, and Google, which is expected to file an appeal against the \u20ac2.42 billion fine in the coming week, will study the judgment closely.

aVPresident Donald Trump, who often cares more about personal chemistry than political ideology, brought the officials to the White House and showed the exuberance and the bipartisan spirit that has gripped him in the last 48 hours. | Alex Brandon/AP Trump, jovial after debt deal, turns meeting into a freewheeling affair\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump repeatedly said Thursday how thrilled he was to strike a deal on the debt ceiling with Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader he has accused of shedding "fake tears" and whom he once called a \u201chead clown.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an Oval Office meeting with the New York and New Jersey congressional delegations, he repeatedly shook Schumer\u2019s hand and kept him after for a private session, his third chat with the Democrat in 30 hours.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aHe praised Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 who also attended the meeting and who has often torched Trump but without mentioning his name \u2014 for his work on the Tappan Zee Bridge and other New York projects. \u201cMy governor!\u201d he said to Cuomo, according to Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican.\u000a\u000aHe told the room that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie coached him in the 2016 presidential debates against Hillary Clinton, and that \u201cHillary was easy\u201d after dealing with \u201cChris.\u201d He wished Christie, whose birthday was Wednesday, a happy one. \u201cYou should give him a tunnel for his birthday,\u201d Schumer said, drawing laughs from the room, referring to the Gateway rail-expansion project.\u000a\u000aTrump, a New York real estate developer who often cares more about personal chemistry than political ideology, brought the officials to the White House and showed the exuberance and the bipartisan spirit that has gripped him in the past 48 hours. He seemed thrilled that all the power players in his former life were in the Oval Office, seeking his approval and asking him for help.\u000a\u000aThe meeting was ostensibly about a $30 billion Gateway tunnel that New York and New Jersey leaders want the federal government to pay half of. The White House gave a sanitized readout, saying all the parties cooperated. \u201cThe president and his administration remain committed to creating a robust infrastructure package that will modernize and transform our nation\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d the White House statement said.\u000a\u000aOfficials said there was no promise that the project would happen, but Trump was optimistic. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say, \u2018OK, go ahead.\u2019 What he said was that he clearly understood how essential and important it is,\u201d said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. \u201cHe said he would have a couple meetings with his staff and get back to us.\u201d\u000a\u000aWith Trump, observers say people often leave meetings feeling as if they have won his approval \u2014 only to learn later they haven\u2019t. He often agrees with whomever he speaks to, according to aides and advisers. And the president\u2019s continued good moods \u2014 spurred by positive media coverage and what he sees as progress \u2014 could be derailed any minute.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

He asked specific questions about the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects New York City with its western suburban counties, a favored project of Cuomo.\u000a\u000aHe was engaged on Sandy recovery, talking about the 2012 hurricane that slammed New York and how it affected tunnel travel into and from the city. He told the governors that he wanted to help on LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark airports, and listened to a fairly lengthy presentation on the tunnel, showing more of an attention span than he sometimes does.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe was really interested in the bidding process,\u201d King said. \u201cHe wanted to know all about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the meeting, he repeatedly told the room how happy he was to work with Schumer on a debt deal, a move that has angered many Republicans. Trump surprised his own party by agreeing on Wednesday to a three-month extension of the debt ceiling, overruling leadership and his treasury secretary.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018What kind of impact do you think it had?\u2019\u201d King said. \u201cI told him I thought it was fantastic and we needed more of it.\u201d Others in the room agreed.\u000a\u000aOne attendee said that Trump told the room that the deal would bring in a new bipartisan spirit. \u201cHe said after yesterday, we\u2019re going to do things in a bipartisan way,\u201d this person said, describing Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cNo one really knows what we announced, but it was bipartisan.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president, though, had one gripe, after his visit from the emir of Kuwait on Thursday afternoon. He was very impressed by the emir\u2019s plane but noted that it was longer than his \u2014 maybe even by 100 feet.\u000a\u000a

aV\u201cDictatorial.\u201d \u201cArrogant.\u201d \u201cPompous.\u201d \u201cSuperficial.\u201d \u201cTone-deaf.\u201d \u201cTone-dead.\u201d \u201cOut of line.\u201d \u201cInsulting\u201d \u2014 \u201cabsolutely insulting.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThese are the words that Nina Turner, president of the group founded by Bernie Sanders to further his "political revolution," used in an interview to describe the Democratic National Committee. The grievances converge around a recent trip to deliver petitions to the party\u2019s headquarters in Washington, where Turner and other progressives were greeted by barricades, security guards, and an offering of donuts and water, which she saw as an empty gesture indicative of an institution that isn't \u201csmart enough, humble enough, to say, 'let\u2019s take a step back and really listen to the people,'" that is far too willing to \u201cdisregard people,\u201d to \u201cdismiss,\u201d \u201cbelittle,\u201d and \u201cshun" them and \u201cpush them to the side\u201d \u2014 all of which has left Turner with the view, as she puts it, that "the establishment side of the Democratic Party have shown themselves to be dictators" who "want to dictate the terms of unity."\u000a\u000aIn the months since last year\u2019s long and fraught Democratic primary, Sanders and allies like Rep. Keith Ellison have become key partners in that same "establishment side," working from new leadership roles in the U.S. Senate and at the DNC.\u000a\u000aIf Sanders is working to change the system from within, Turner's approach at Our Revolution looks to be the opposite: After taking over last month, she's taking on the same institutional forces that are allied with Sanders, rallying supporters against the familiar target of the DNC, and offering a candid, at times cutting critique of the party and its centers of power \u2014 marking a newly aggressive posture toward the Democratic Party that puts Our Revolution out in front of its own figurehead.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is time to make the Democratic Party \u2018Feel the Bern\u2019 again,\u201d Turner wrote in an email to Our Revolution members on Tuesday. "The DNC may think that they can continue working behind closed doors, but they will know different when millions of us come knocking.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe email recounted the same July 25 visit to DNC headquarters on Capitol Hill.\u000a\u000aTurner, the 49-year-old former Ohio state senator and DNC member herself, led about 60 supporters that day to the DNC offices to deliver petition signatures supporting the \u201cPeople\u2019s Platform,\u201d a 2018 policy agenda drafted by Our Revolution in response to the one unveiled that week by party leaders in the House and Senate.\u000a\u000aWhen they arrived, she said, barricades blocked the entrance steps and a handful of DNC staffers stood waiting outside. \u201cI was absolutely stunned,\u201d Turner said Tuesday. \u201cFor them to be that tone-deaf, or that arrogant, to think that it\u2019s OK to put up a barricade so that the people can\u2019t even \u2014 I mean, we were not even good enough to stand on their stairs.\u201d\u000a\u000aCiting the current political climate in Washington, DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said the barricades are put in place anytime there is a large crowd \u2014 protocol set by the \u201cbuilding security team,\u201d she said, not party officials.\u000a\u000aA spread of donuts and water had also been set up for the Our Revolution party. Turner took particular issue with the donuts and water, which she called \u201chand-out trinkets."\u000a\u000a\u201cThey tried to seduce us with donuts and water,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re pompous and arrogant enough to say to the people, 'you\u2019re not good enough to be on our property \u2014 and, oh by the way, we\u2019re just gonna hand you donuts and water over the barricade.' That is insulting. Absolutely insulting.\u201d\u000a\u000aTurner decided to write to Our Revolution members about the incident because, in her view, she said, it embodied the same problems that made the DNC a source of mistrust among progressives in the first place.\u000a\u000aShe recalled the brief remarks made that day by DNC political director Amanda Brown Lierman, who told the crowd of progressives that Democrats would need their support in 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d said Turner. \u201cYou think people are just gonna do what you say, and you don\u2019t have to really listen.\u201d The DNC recounted the moment differently: Brown Lierman \u201cexpressed gratitude on behalf of the DNC\u201d and spoke about the party\u2019s \u201cshared values,\u201d Hinojosa said.\u000a\u000aThe donuts and water, too, were meant as a token of goodwill, officials said. That the snacks were a source of animus came as a surprise inside the building.\u000a\u000aAccording to Turner, the incident remains unresolved: DNC chair Tom Perez \u201cwould be wise\u201d to call her to apologize, she said, quickly recalling his weakness with progressives in the tight chair's race earlier this year against Ellison, now serving as DNC deputy chair. \u201cChairman Perez won, but the energy was behind Congressman Keith Ellison," said Turner. "The chairman would be wise to embrace this energy. He would be wise to make a phone call. He should have reached out to me by now to apologize for the way the people who came to the DNC were treated.\u201d\u000a\u000aOur Revolution\u2019s indictment of the DNC, amplified in Tuesday's email, comes at a critical but tenuous moment for the party: Even as Democrats look to 2018 as a singular opportunity to win back seats in the House of Representatives, seizing on voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with the president and the failed Republican health care effort, they are also struggling to settle on an effective economic message and resolve their approach to policy issues like abortion and single-payer health care.\u000a\u000aTurner rejected the idea that a new DNC fight would stir up old feelings of division and mistrust. \u201cI want to flip that on its head," she responded. \u201cWhy won\u2019t the Democratic Party partner with the progressive left \u2014 i.e. Our Revolution?\u201d (Our Revolution has been invited to meetings with progressive groups at the DNC, the last one in July, according to a DNC official, and \u201cthey haven\u2019t showed up." The official also noted that Our Revolution and the DNC worked together earlier this year on the party's "unity"-themed tour, headlined by Sanders and Perez.)\u000a\u000aSome in the Sanders orbit attributed the DNC offensive to a new phase of Our Revolution under Turner, a founding board member who assumed the role of president in July, taking the reins from one of the senator\u2019s long-serving political advisers, Jeff Weaver.\u000a\u000aTurner, a self-described \u201cjustice warrior,\u201d operates from the position that, as she put it, \u201cthe system has to be shaken up from time to time.\u201d That was evident in late 2015, when she stunned the Clinton campaign by jumping ship for Sanders, and it\u2019s been evident in her first few weeks at the helm of Our Revolution, where she seems eager to take on her own party. (\u201cBe sure to ask her about donuts and water,\u201d one Our Revolution staffer advised.)\u000a\u000aBoth ends of the leadership change \u2014 Turner\u2019s rise and Weaver\u2019s departure \u2014 promise a new dynamic between Sanders and Our Revolution, likely one with more distance, current and former aides said. Although Weaver managed the group from something of a remove, spending much of this year working on a new book, he did serve as a central link to Sanders. To some of Sanders hands, his exit was a signal that the senator\u2019s political focus lies elsewhere. To others, it meant a step away from the group\u2019s state and local campaign effort, which has struggled to secure victories under the Sanders banner. (\u201cDisappointing but not surprising,\u201d said a former Sanders campaign adviser of the shift. \u201cVoter contact is hard. Cheap stunts are easy.\u201d)\u000a\u000aTurner, who also sits on the DNC's Unity and Reform Commission, has already made Our Revolution a more forceful presence in the party \u2014 and in the press \u2014 willing to weigh in or take positions where Sanders has not. (Most recently, Turner voiced support for a progressive \u201clitmus test\u201d in 2018. Sanders has not backed the idea.)\u000a\u000aOne Sanders aide described their work as parallel but separate: The senator is working \u201cinside the system,\u201d the aide said, and Our Revolution is working \u201coutside the system."\u000a\u000aThe points at which those tracks converge, and conflict, however, will prove more difficult to navigate, with Sanders working with the same party leadership that Turner has made a new target. (Ellison, the deputy DNC chair and a leading progressive, found himself in the middle of the petition upset, assuring Turner that he hadn\u2019t known anything about it beforehand, that he was \u201cshocked\u201d to hear about the greeting, and would take the issue to the chair, according to Turner.)\u000a\u000aSo far, Our Revolution has only highlighted its recent conflict with the DNC.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the Tuesday email, the group has used footage of Turner\u2019s remarks at the petition drop in July \u2014 a pointed response to the DNC barricades, donuts, and water \u2014 in digital acquisition ads directing new members to their signup page.\u000a\u000aAsked what it would look like to \u201cmake the Democratic Party \u2018feel the Bern\u2019 again,\u201d as Tuesday's Our Revolution email puts it, Turner cited the group's work at large.\u000a\u000a"We have a component within our mission that talks about transforming the party,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we do every day.\u201d

aVHungarian Pime Minister Viktor Orban gives a press conference in Budapest on July 4, 2017 | Attila Kisbendek/AFP via Getty Images Hungary: Visit by MEPs is \u2018political interference\u2019 Minister calls visit by committee \u2018outrageous.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian government said a planned visit to the country by a group of MEPs later this month was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and would interfere with the country\u2019s general election, planned for spring 2018.\u000a\u000aIn an exchange of letters between the Hungarian government and Ingeborg Gräßle, the German MEP who chairs the European Parliament\u2019s Budgetary Control Committee, seen by POLITICO, János Lázár, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, asked the committee to \u201creconsider elements of the program,\u201d scheduled for September 16-18.\u000a\u000aMEPs on the committee, as well as advisers to the Parliament\u2019s political groups and representatives of the European Court of Auditors, plan to visit projects that have been given money from the bloc to \u201cverify if there are misuses of EU funds.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a letter dated August 9, Lázár told Gräßle that the committee was not following Hungary\u2019s suggested list of projects to check and asked its members to follow a \u201cbalanced program\u201d not a \u201cstrongly politically motivated one.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI found it outrageous that a committee of the European Parliament systematically ignores and rejects a notable amount of the suggestions of the Hungarian government, thus significantly interferes in the Hungarian [election] campaign,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aHe said the aim of the visit was \u201cnot to learn about the implementation of the [EU\u2019s] cohesion policy in Hungary, but to comply with the aims of the Hungarian political opposition, which I categorically reject.\u201d\u000a\u000aLázár also criticized a lack of visits to \u201ctowns currently lead by opposition party politicians,\u201d while a visit to the home village of the Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is on the agenda.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe program was agreed by all groups,\u201d Gräßle said. \u201cTwo groups \u2014 the EPP and Greens\u2014\u2013 gave input on projects. All other projects were proposed by the secretariat of our committee, and agreed by all groups as well.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would like to reassure the Hungarian government once again that there is no bias neither behind the choice of the date of our mission, nor of the projects. The Budgetary Control Committee will conduct its visit in a politically neutral way, as we always do.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen MEP Judith Sargentini said the Hungarian response was surprising.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat struck me most is the lack of diplomatic language in the letters,\u201d Sargentini said. She said she understands that the government might not be supportive of what is essentially an audit, but she expected \u201ca neutral approach,\u201d to the committee visit.\u000a\u000aGräßle asked European Parliament President Antonio Tajani to raise the issue with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.\u000a\u000aShe said the \u201clack of cooperation\u201d from the Hungarians and their suggestion to change the agenda of the visit was \u201csufficiently serious\u201d for the Commission to discuss it.

aVBERLIN \u2014 The German election is still waiting for its fake news moment.\u000a\u000aWith less than a month before voters head to the polls, the country\u2019s political parties, intelligence agencies and growing number of fact-checking organizations are scouring the depths of the internet for signs of digital misinformation that may sway the election.\u000a\u000aSo far, false reports \u2014 targeted either at politicians like Chancellor Angela Merkel or hot-button issues like the refugee crisis \u2014 have not broken through into the campaign. But as the days clock down to the September 24 election, policymakers fret that Germany may still see an influx of last-minute fake news, digital hacks or online hate speech that could alter the vote.\u000a\u000aMerkel, who remains ahead in the polls, is expected to again take the reins of the most politically and economically important country in Europe. But her position may be weakened if any digital trickery makes a late appearance in the campaign \u2014 or during the haggling over a new coalition government after the election.\u000a\u000a\u201cDisinformation campaigns have not yet had an effect on the German election,\u201d said Jakub Janda, deputy director of the European Values think tank in Prague, who tracks state-backed fake news efforts across the Continent. \u201cIt took major institutions two years to wake up to this threat, but they\u2019re now taking it seriously.\u201d\u000a\u000aGermany still remains on edge after a group of Russian hackers broke into the computer systems of the national parliament in 2015.\u000a\u000aThe inability of fake news to make a political dent in Germany, experts say, stands in contrast to elections in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom and the United States, where online falsities \u2014 either published by traditional media outlets or through social media \u2014 were widely shared with potential voters.\u000a\u000aThe effect of such digital misinformation campaigns made many Germans keenly aware of potential false reports shared online. German publishers \u2014 whose readerships remain relatively robust despite newspaper subscription declines across the Western world \u2014 also have beefed up fact-checking tools in recent months.\u000a\u000aAnd the role of social media, particularly Twitter, has been less pronounced in spreading false reports compared to what happened in the United States and other European countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cTwitter in Germany is a more niche environment,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow of the digital forensic research lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank, who is tracking online fake news and hate speech ahead of the election.\u000a\u000aGermany, though, still remains on edge after a group of Russian hackers, who also targeted U.S. and French elections and have links to the Kremlin, broke into the computer systems of the national parliament in 2015 to collect reams of information on lawmakers and their staff.\u000a\u000aIntelligence agencies and security experts say this hacked material may be made public, potentially in the aftermath of the election, when Merkel is expected to start negotiations to form a ruling coalition. Experts warn these emails could be mixed with outright falsehoods, making it difficult to tell what is, and isn\u2019t, real.\u000a\u000aThat could echo a similar data attack against French President Emmanuel Macron, which led to the publishing of reams of emails from Macron\u2019s political party before the second round of France\u2019s presidential election. The hack \u2014 published hours before a media blackout period before election day \u2014 failed to sway many undecided voters, according to political experts.\u000a\u000aHans-Georg Maaßen, head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, warned in July that such hacks were still a possibility ahead of the election, adding that the aim was to \u201champer the trust in the functioning of our democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aTaking no chances\u000a\u000aIn typical German style, the country is not taking any chances.\u000a\u000aLocal publishers \u2014 many of which still receive hefty government subsidies \u2014 have established, or expanded, fact-checking programs, mirroring similar initiatives in France, Britain and Spain, where outlets like Le Monde and El País tried to debunk myths almost in real time.\u000a\u000aTech giants like Google and Facebook also have pumped in money and technical resources to boost public awareness of potential online misinformation and hate speech, as well as to educate politicians whose knowledge of digital threats is often rudimentary, at best.\u000a\u000aAt a security conference in Munich earlier this year, for instance, Facebook held a joint training workshop for politicians with the German Federal Office for Information Security.\u000a\u000aDuring the daylong event, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, lawmakers were schooled on basic online security measures, including protecting their social media accounts from potential hacks.\u000a\u000aSuch efforts come as Germany will implement some of the Western world\u2019s toughest hate speech laws on October 1, which could lead to fines of up to \u20ac50 million for social media companies if they do not remove such content within 24 hours.\u000a\u000aThe failure of digital misinformation to sway the election, experts warn, does not mean that Germany is yet out of the woods.\u000a\u000aFacebook, which is the country\u2019s largest social network with roughly 35 million users, is expected to face the brunt of this legislation. To prepare, the tech giant has removed racist and other illegal content, including deleting tens of thousands of fake accounts and hiring hundreds of monitors to rake through online messages.\u000a\u000aThese efforts, though, have failed to win over many German publishers, which have mostly rebuffed Facebook\u2019s pleas to join the company\u2019s fact-checking initiative to debunk potentially false online posts that are flagged by users.\u000a\u000aThat program also has been rolled out across the U.S. and in parts of Europe, but has so far had limited impact in Germany, according to Jutta Kramm, head of fact-checking at Correctiv, the only German media group to sign up.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe main challenge is measuring our impact,\u201d Kramm said. She added that her group, on average, selected just one potentially fake news story daily to review \u2014 a small drop in the vast ocean of Facebook posts.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but you have to be where the people are,\u201d said Kramm, in reference to Correctiv\u2019s fake news debunking program. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem for Facebook. They need to do something more about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aNot out of the woods\u000a\u000aThe failure of digital misinformation to sway the election, experts warn, does not mean that Germany is yet out of the woods.\u000a\u000aAcross social media, online message boards and digital media outlets, far-right groups from Germany and outside the country have targeted specific issues, notably the refugee crisis, trying to galvanize support and make a dent in the election campaign.\u000a\u000aIn one of the more noticeable events, according to Alexander Sängerlaub, project leader of the fake news initiative at digital think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, online groups hijacked comments made by Margot Käßmann, the former bishop of Hanover.\u000a\u000aOver a two-week period in late May, more than 30,000 social media posts and articles were published that took Käßmann\u2019s comments out of context, claiming, falsely, that she had said many native-born Germans were neo-Nazis, according to Stiftung Neue Verantwortung\u2019s analysis of the online activity.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re more prepared than the U.S. was to debunk fake news\u201d \u2014 Alexander Sängerlaub, digital think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung\u000a\u000aWhile traditional media quickly debunked the allegations, the fake news reports still received double the level of engagements on social media than these mainstream reports, highlighting that people were more willing to share \u2014 and comment on \u2014 the false reports than the fact-checking articles.\u000a\u000aSuch avid sharing on social media showed that Germans were just as willing to disseminate fake news as their American or British counterparts, Sängerlaub said. It also illustrated that unknown blogs, fake news sites and social media accounts often can garner more attention than traditional media rivals, particularly when promoting controversial topics.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re more prepared than the U.S. was to debunk fake news,\u201d Sängerlaub said. \u201cSo far, we haven\u2019t seen anything big. But we still have a month to go.\u201d

aVNearly a year on from the referendum that began the U.K. on its journey to the EU exit door, the formal negotiations on the terms of Britain\u2019s departure are due to start Monday morning.\u000a\u000aThe talks will begin \u2014 as the EU27 have demanded \u2014 with discussions about citizens\u2019 rights, the Irish border and the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations (the so-called Brexit bill). But once sufficient progress has been made on those issues they will move into complex territory covering everything from trade and security to planes and fishing.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to the negotiators who will be on either side of the table.\u000a\u000aThe U.K.\u2019s Brexit negotiating team\u000a\u000aDavid Davis\u000a\u000aPosition: Secretary of state for exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: A true Brexit believer\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Standing down and flighting his own by-election in 2008 in protest at erosion of civil liberties\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 9/10\u000a\u000aThe odds-on favorite to become Conservative leader in 2005, Davis was pipped to the post by a young upstart named David Cameron. By 2016, he had gotten used to his place on the backbenches \u2014 a Tory freethinker and Brexiteer, though not of the head-banging variety. But in a textbook example of how that old wheel can turn, Cameron\u2019s post-referendum demise paved the way for Davis to return to government in the pivotal Brexit secretary role. Underestimated in Brussels but highly-rated by Theresa May, Davis, at 68-years-old, may view Brexit as his last great task in government (though he\u2019s now rumored to fancy a tilt at the top job again). Having argued for it for so long, he has a burning desire to get it right.\u000a\u000aOliver Robbins\u000a\u000aPosition: Prime Minister\u2019s EU adviser, Permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Whitehall wunderkind turned Brexit supremo\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Kicked out of a parliamentary committee hearing for presenting \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d evidence\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aTheresa May\u2019s Brexit sherpa, Robbins has been the U.K.\u2019s central figure behind closed doors ever since he was appointed by David Cameron as personal adviser on the EU in the days immediately after the June 2016 referendum. Robbins kept the role under May, and was also made permanent secretary \u2014 the top official \u2014 in David Davis\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union. Despite his tall and imposing frame, colleagues describe him as a likeable chap, and he has been well-received by his counterparts in Brussels, with whom he has had regular contact in the run-up to negotiations. Having held senior office in the governments of Blair, Brown, Cameron and May, he is the ultimate Brexit \u201cgrown-up.\u201d\u000a\u000aPhilip Rycroft\u000a\u000aPosition: Second permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU)\u000a\u000aReal position: Keeping the United Kingdom together through Brexit\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making transition from working with Europhile Nick Clegg, to delivering Brexit\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 6/10\u000a\u000aOlly Robbins\u2019 right-hand man, responsible for managing the department\u2019s overall policy and legislative program with Robbins expected to spend much of his time in detailed negotiations. He also has a role in the Cabinet Office heading up work on the constitution and devolution, so will be tasked with keeping an eagle eye on how Brexit affects Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A Europe expert who served in the cabinet of Leon Brittan in the European Commission. During the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government he was then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg\u2019s right hand man in the civil service as director general in the DPM\u2019s office. Rycroft also has experience in the private sector as corporate affairs director at Hutchison Whampoa (Europe) Ltd, a multinational company with interests in a range of sectors including ports, energy, hotels and retail.\u000a\u000aTim Barrow\u000a\u000aPosition: U.K. permanent representative to the EU\u000a\u000aReal position: Diplomatic nous\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Making headlines with his dog-eared leather briefcase on Article 50 day\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 4/10\u000a\u000aWhat better man to usher in a new age of swashbuckling global Britain than one who looks like he just stepped out of a smoking room in the Colonial Office circa 1875? Barrow took over as the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the EU after the dramatic resignation of the much liked and respected Ivan Rogers in January. The heavily-whiskered Barrow proved a much more manageable lead at the U.K.\u2019s permanent representation, keeping a low profile that will have suited Downing Street just fine, after Rogers\u2019 valedictory diatribe about \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d caused red faces in London. Previously the U.K\u2019.s man in Moscow, where he was a similarly low-key figure, Barrow is a Foreign Office man through and through. Having ably dispatched Theresa May\u2019s Article 50 letter on March 29, he is now expected to play the facilitator in the Brexit talks. However, he is not rated in Brussels, drawing unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, and is not seen as having much influence in No. 10.\u000a\u000aAlex Ellis\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aReal position: International man of mystery\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Debuting at the Foreign Office as part of the team that supported political transition in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela\u000a\u000aU.K. Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aThe effervescent Ellis is a popular man at DExEU, where he is one of two director generals, said to take enjoyment in slipping Brexit soundbites into everyday conversation (\u201cAs a demonstration of our new deep and special partnership \u2026 would you like a cup of tea?\u201d). With top level Brussels experience \u2014 he worked in the office of former Commission President José Manuel Barroso from 2004 to 2007 \u2014 Ellis will bring vital insight into how the old place works. A former history teacher, his career spans South Africa, Portugal and most recently Brazil, where he was the U.K.\u2019s ambassador for three years before taking up the Brexit call.\u000a\u000aSarah Healey\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at DExEU\u000a\u000aHealey is popular among staff in Davis\u2019 department and has a command of detail that would \u2014 and does \u2014 impress even Theresa May. She is a Brexit brainbox who is influential in Whitehall. A high-flyer like Robbins, Healey was brought into the Brexit department in July 2016 having risen through the ranks at the culture, work and pensions and education departments. She began her career in the prime minister\u2019s strategy unit, and has compared the cross-government work on Brexit to the task of putting on the 2012 London Olympics. She is also a quizzing maestro, who as a student won the BBC\u2019s cult quiz show University Challenge and twice competed in the Champions of Champions competition for Magdalen College, Oxford.\u000a\u000aSimon Case\u000a\u000aPostition: Director general for the U.K.-EU partnership, U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep)\u000a\u000aHas led the U.K. government\u2019s work on exiting and seeking a new partnership with the European Union within the U.K. Representation to the EU.

He has been at the Treasury since 1995.\u000a\u000aGlyn Williams\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general at the Home Office\u000a\u000aA long-time civil servant (starting at the then Department of Trade and Industry in 1985) Williams is now responsible for policy in the U.K.\u2019s Border, Immigration and Citizenship System, including the development of a post-EU exit immigration regime. He also has experience of trade negotiations from his time in Geneva representing the U.K. at World Trade Organisation talks.\u000a\u000aCatherine Webb\u000a\u000aPosition: Director of market access and budget at DExEU\u000a\u000aBefore her current role at DExEU \u2014 responsible for policy on EU market access, goods and budgetary issues \u2014 Webb worked on an EU related portfolio in the Cabinet Office. She joined the civil service in 2000 and held various Treasury positions before taking up the role of economic and trade counselor at the British Embassy in Beijing.\u000a\u000aMark Philip Sedwill\u000a\u000aPosition: National security adviser to the prime minister\u000a\u000aWell known to Theresa May from his time as permanent secretary at the Home Office from February 2013 until April 2017 \u2014 when he was a late addition to the Brexit negotiating team.

Heads up the department\u2019s A-team of officials tasked with coordinating all aspects of government policy on Brexit, reporting directly to Robbins. The team was set up by Robbins, raising eyebrows in DExEu. \u201cThis team are the super team. A circle within a circle,\u201d said a government official. Names of those serving in the team are not public. They draw out information from DExEU and other departments and coordinate it \u2014 that is their \u201cninja skill.\u201d \u201cA crack private office squad,\u201d the official said.\u000a\u000aKatrina Williams\u000a\u000aPosition: U.K. deputy permanent representative, UKrep\u000a\u000aA Brussels expert, having served in the Cabinet Office\u2019s European secretariat, coordinating Whitehall policy and advising the prime minister in the run-up to and during the U.K.\u2019s 2005 EU presidency.\u000a\u000aChris Jones\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general, DExEU\u000a\u000aResponsible for justice, security and migration.\u000a\u000aTom Shinner\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general, DExEU\u000a\u000aResponsible for cross-government policy coordination.\u000a\u000aJoanna Key\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general, DExEU\u000a\u000aResponsible for liaising with parliament, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the crown dependencies and Gibraltar.\u000a\u000aSusannah Storey\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general, DExEU\u000a\u000aResponsible for strategic advice and economic analysis.\u000a\u000aAntony Phillipson\u000a\u000aPosition: Director general, DExEU\u000a\u000aResponsible for diplomatic engagement, issues relating to the Republic of Ireland and EU institutions.\u000a\u000aPeter Hill\u000a\u000aPosition: Prime minister\u2019s principal private secretary\u000a\u000aThe most senior civil servant inside No. 10 Downing Street, head of the prime minister\u2019s private office of officials. A former European Commission official and trade expert who worked under former Labour Minister and European Commissioner Peter Mandelson in Brussels.\u000a\u000aThe EU27 Brexit negotiating team\u000a\u000aMichel Barnier\u000a\u000aNationality: French\u000a\u000aFormal position: European chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Preserving EU27 unity\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Key to France staging the 1992 Winter Olympics Games in Albertville.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 9/10\u000a\u000aBarnier is the face of the Brexit talks for the EU27. He is officially a top EU civil servant \u2014 a director general in the European Commission \u2014 but Barnier is at heart a politician, meaning it will be very hard for the British team to put one over on him. The center-right pro-Europe Gaullist was elected as a MP in the 1970s. He held several top ministerial positions in France and was twice France\u2019s European commissioner: for regional policy and a decade later for the internal market and financial services. He knows Brussels and the main capitals intimately and has a reputation as a tough negotiator with a clear vision of where his powers and limits are. Some argue that Barnier is more powerful than many commissioners, but he operates within tight guidelines set by the European Council and approved by member countries and so has little room to maneuver.\u000a\u000aSabine Weyand\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: European deputy chief negotiator for the United Kingdom exiting the European Union\u000a\u000aReal position: Staying on top of the details\u000a\u000aCareer highlight\u005clowlight: Deputy director general in the Commission\u2019s directorate general for trade.\u000a\u000aBrussels Influence rating: 7/10\u000a\u000aWeyand\u2019s experience as deputy at the Commission\u2019s powerful trade policy department will be invaluable in the later stages of the negotiations \u2014 plus her skills nicely complement Barnier\u2019s. In her trade role, Weyand is used to long and complex negotiations so she won\u2019t be fazed by anything the U.K. throws at her. In the official organigram of Barnier\u2019s Brexit taskforce, Weyand has direct oversight of the top staffers in charge of detailed aspects of the talks, from aviation to the U.K.\u2019s Brexit bill, meaning she will have to be across vast swathes of the detail. The word in Brussels is that Weyand\u2019s real job is to act as an envoy to Martin Selmayr, the Commission president\u2019s chief of staff, so that he can keep an eye on proceedings. Plus her German nationality keeps Barnier\u2019s team from being too French-dominated at the top.\u000a\u000aMartin Selmayr\u000a\u000aNationality: German\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of cabinet of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission\u000a\u000aReal position: Feared as the hugely powerful \u201cmonster in the Berlaymont\u201d\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: One of the few top Commission officials who makes headlines with his tweets\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 8/10\u000a\u000aThe German former lawyer has run the daily operation of the European Commission since October 2014. Selmayr is powerful and he knows it, although he professes not to be. \u201cMy power is nonexistent. It derives only from what the president instructs me,\u201d he said. In reality, in policy areas from migration to the Greek crisis and of course Brexit, Selmayr has been a key actor establishing the Commission\u2019s position. Selmayr will be at the Brexit table representing the Commission \u2014 but even when he\u2019s not he will be there in spirit through Barnier\u2019s deputy, Sabine Weyand.\u000a\u000aDidier Seeuws\u000a\u000aNationality: Belgian\u000a\u000aFormal position: Head of the European Council\u2019s Article 50 task force\u000a\u000aReal position: Coordinator in chief\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: He was the spokesman of the former Belgian prime minister and now Brexit coordinator in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aSeeuws, a Belgian diplomat, was appointed just days after the Brexit vote to head the Council\u2019s Article 50 task force in the Council \u2014 ahead of Barnier himself. The Council\u2019s swift move was seen by some Commission top officials as a power-grab. But politically savvy Seeuws was not appointed to compete with Barnier but to do his part in the Council, shuttling between national capitals in order to iron out differences in the talks. Seeuws is not seen as a controversial figure and the diplomat, who worked in the Belgian foreign ministry and the Belgian permanent representation to the EU, is credited with unlocking a deal on the European patent system, an issue that had resisted compromise for 30 years. He is a keen cyclist.\u000a\u000aStéphanie Riso\u000a\u000aNationality: French\u000a\u000aFormal position: Director for strategy, coordination and communication\u000a\u000aReal position: To prevent the U.K. dividing the EU27 side on the Brexit bill\u000a\u000aCareer highlight/lowlight: Former head of unit for the EU\u2019s multiannual financial framework\u000a\u000aBrussels influence rating: 5/10\u000a\u000aRiso was one of the first appointments Barnier made to his team, sending a clear message \u2014 there will be no free-riding and the U.K. must pay what it owes. She has in-depth expertise in EU budget talks and their endless financial and legal implications. The context for those talks is almost impossible because it requires unanimity among the EU countries.

President Trump is threatening a major confrontation with Congress over funds to build his proposed border wall with Mexico. He has reportedly decided to end an Obama-era program allowing 800,000 children who were brought to the U.S. illegally to work and live here. The Secret Service, taxed by Trump\u2019s weekend jaunts and big family to protect, is just about out of money.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut more than a month after naming John Kelly, the head of the massive department that deals with all those problems, to be the new chief of staff in his tumultuous White House, Trump has yet to name a replacement as secretary of Homeland Security. Not only that, he appears nowhere close to doing so and has not even interviewed any candidates for the job.\u000a\u000aBig mistake, argues Jeh Johnson, who served as the Obama administration\u2019s DHS chief until Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. In a new interview for The Global Politico, Johnson says, \u201cWe need to have a Senate-confirmed secretary of Homeland Security; we need to have somebody occupying that office full time, 24/7, to keep his or her eye on aviation security, border security, cybersecurity, maritime security, FEMA, the Secret Service, and all the other things that DHS covers.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn particular, he cited the Secret Service\u2019s empty coffers and Trump\u2019s failure to address America\u2019s vulnerable election infrastructure a full year after the Russian tampering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election as crises where having a permanent secretary in place really matters.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time, energy, effort talking about this, but I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019re no less vulnerable to a cyberattack on election infrastructure than we were a year ago,\u201d says Johnson. He designated election systems part of the nation\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d over GOP objections in the waning days of the Obama administration this January, but says the Trump administration has not taken needed follow-up steps and won\u2019t, without a secretary or DHS cybersecurity czar in place. \u201cOne way or another, we need to make it a national imperative to harden the cybersecurity around our democratic processes.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs President Trump has threatened to gut, revise or outright reverse many of the Obama administration\u2019s security policies, Johnson has spoken out increasingly in recent months, appearing on Sunday talk shows and op-ed pages more than almost any other Cabinet-rank official from the Obama era.\u000a\u000aOnly the fourth person to serve as secretary of Homeland Security, Johnson ran for much of Obama\u2019s second term the massive agency of 22 separate fiefdoms and more than 230,000 employees, an unruly behemoth created in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 to put the U.S. government\u2019s sprawling domestic security apparatus under one Cabinet department. (\u201cThere were indeed many days where I felt like I had one-third of the federal government to manage, and two-thirds of the problems,\u201d he jokes in our interview.)\u000a\u000aJohnson, now back at the New York office of the high-powered law firm of Paul, Weiss, retains the cautious demeanor of a corporate lawyer and tends not to criticize Trump personally. But the sheer range of issues he\u2019s called to comment on today is a striking illustration of how much Trump\u2019s agenda is all about blowing up Obama\u2019s entire concept of homeland security.\u000a\u000aConsider the wide array of controversies Johnson covered in the course of our hour-long interview last week, from a national flood insurance program that is \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cgoing bankrupt\u201d amid the devastation of Hurricane Harvey to Trump\u2019s Secret Service budget-busting (\u201ca very serious problem\u201d) and Muslim travel ban (\u201cbad facts made bad law\u201d) to the intelligence agencies\u2019 decision to blame Russia for the election hacking. \u201cIt was a clear case, in my lawyer\u2019s judgment,\u201d he says of the hacking, despite Trump\u2019s public questioning of the spy chiefs\u2019 conclusion. \u201cThe proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of the controversies involve pledges made by Trump the candidate to jettison the policies and programs Johnson championed at DHS: Will Trump really scrap the Obama decision to allow the so-called Dreamers to gain legal status to live and work in the U.S., a move slated to be announced as early as tomorrow that Johnson said would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d and drive hundreds of thousands of people \u201cinto the shadows? Will Trump build his wall on the border with Mexico at a time when, Johnson argues, more \u201csurveillance\u201d is needed, not the thousands of additional agents Trump has promised?\u000a\u000aThe Global Politico Susan B.

Johnson, one of the most senior African-Americans in the Cabinet of America\u2019s first African-American president, spoke publicly in the wake of Charlottesville about his view as the great-grandson of a slave who was born in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War. He says he believes Confederate monuments are increasingly \u201cpublic safety threats\u201d as they become rallying points for a new generation of white extremists, and should be treated accordingly\u2014even if they shouldn\u2019t necessarily all be taken down.\u000a\u000aBut he did not join other Democrats in calling for John Kelly or other senior figures to quit serving Trump in protest at the president\u2019s remarks. Not only that\u2014he reiterated in our conversation that he believes both Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, two generals who fell out with the Obama administration in which Johnson served, should remain in their jobs.\u000a\u000a\u201cSomebody has got to be the custodians of our national security, and these are people who I have a lot of faith in to be custodians of our national security,\u201d Johnson says.\u000a\u000aIn other words, he seems to imply without at all saying it, someone has to defend the homeland\u2014against the president.\u000a\u000aAnd so DHS remains without a leader, while Kelly settles in as White House chief of staff, managing self-generated presidential disasters instead of natural ones.\u000a\u000aSusan B.

aVSen. Richard Blumenthal and other Democrats said they expected Trump Jr. to return to testify in a public session. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images Blumenthal cites 'gaps' in Trump Jr. testimony The Democratic Senator expects the president's son to return for a public hearing on his controversial 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer.\u000a\u000aSen. Richard Blumenthal said Thursday there are \u201cgaps\u201d in Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s closed-door testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and that he expects President Donald Trump's son to return for a public hearing before the panel.\u000a\u000aTrump Jr. testified behind closed doors on Thursday for more than five hours about a meeting he brokered last year at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer with reported ties to the Kremlin.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son told the Judiciary panel that he accepted the meeting \u2014 which was billed as a chance to get dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 because he wanted to learn about Clinton\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d for the presidency, according to his opening statement, which was obtained by The New York Times. He said in his opening statement that nothing ever came of the meeting, but that he would have sought legal counsel before using any damaging information provided by the Kremlin-linked lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.\u000a\u000aTrump Jr.\u2019s interview was conducted by Judiciary Committee staffers, with senators popping in and out to listen to portions of the session. Blumenthal appeared to be the only member of the committee who was present throughout the entire interview, taking just a few short breaks for votes. The Connecticut Democrat described Trump Jr. as \u201ccordial.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of gaps that will need to be filled,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cMy being there gives me a sense of his demeanor, his willingness to answer questions, his pauses and reluctance on some questions and eagerness on others.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added that there were no restrictions on what staffers could ask Trump Jr. but that his testimony was not under oath. He noted that it\u2019s a crime to lie to Congress.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Trump Jr. said he answered every question asked of him "until both sides had exhausted their lines of questioning."\u000a\u000a"I trust this interview fully satisfied their inquiry," he said, thanking the committee for its "courtesy and professionalism."\u000a\u000aTrump Jr. has offered shifting explanations for the June 2016 meeting, organized by the agent for a Russian pop singer whose father is a Russian oligarch with whom Trump discussed a Moscow real estate deal. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was not campaign-related, and later that it focused on U.S. adoptions of Russian orphans.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aBut he was forced to update his story after the release of emails he received showing that Veselnitskaya claimed to have information about illegal Russian campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee. One email said the information would be provided as part of a Russian government effort to assist his father's campaign. "I love it," Trump Jr. replied, in part.\u000a\u000aBlumenthal and other Democrats said they expected Trump Jr. to return to testify in a public session.\u000a\u000a\u201cI fully expect that he will,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI certainly have insisted on it."\u000a\u000aBut Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, said he wasn\u2019t sure Trump Jr. would be coming back. Graham said that would be up to the chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and the committee's top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California.\u000a\u000aGraham added that he wanted to bring former FBI Director James Comey back to Capitol Hill to testify on his decision last year not to file criminal charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. The Judiciary panel released transcripts last week that appeared to show that Comey began drafting an announcement before Clinton had been interviewed by the FBI.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe needs to come back,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think some of the memos that we found need to be explored. When did you really make your mind up about Clinton, and what was the real thinking here?\u201d

aVBritish Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer arrives at the BBC | Andy Rain/EPA Labour to Tories: Help us stop Brexit power grab Keir Starmer says there are several Tories with \u2018pretty fundamental concerns\u2019 about the government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill plans.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 Conservative MPs should vote with Labour \u201cin the public interest\u201d to stop the government using Brexit to adopt sweeping new powers to change the law without consulting parliament, according to the opposition\u2019s Brexit spokesman.\u000a\u000aWith the government\u2019s EU Withdrawal Bill to be debated by MPs Thursday, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer said there were several Tories who had \u201cpretty fundamental concerns\u201d about the government\u2019s plans and urged them to vote with Labour to amend the bill.\u000a\u000aThe bill is designed to absorb many thousands of EU rules and regulations into British law in order to avoid regulatory blackholes when the U.K. leaves the European Union in March 2019. The Department for Exiting the European Union has said there is not enough time to get what it sees as necessary \u201ccorrections\u201d through the House of Commons and so will use so-called Henry VIII clauses to speed up the process by allowing ministers to amend regulation without giving MPs to vote on changes.\u000a\u000aStarmer told POLITICO: \u201cTo pour this sort of power into the hands of ministers is objectionable. It\u2019s as wide a bill \u2026 as I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019m sure there are Tory MPs who think the same way.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe question really for Tory MPs is in what circumstances they will either amend [the bill] themselves or vote for our amendments. I hope they do. It\u2019s in the public interest that they do.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome senior Conservatives have already broken ranks over the Withdrawal Bill. Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general, said in an article in the Evening Standard Wednesday that it risked seeing \u201cour domestic constitution and liberties vandalized.\u201d The chair of the influential treasury committee, Nicky Morgan, also spoke out against the bill, and former Business Minister Anna Soubry warned Theresa May in the House of Commons Wednesday that the bill could represent an \u201cunprecedented and unnecessary government power grab.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Starmer is keen to reach out to Tory backbenchers, there are many in his own party who are concerned about Labour\u2019s new stance on Brexit.\u000a\u000aAsked whether he had reached out to potential Tory allies, Starmer was non-committal: \u201cThere are all sorts of discussions going on all the time in this place,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThe Withdrawal Bill, formerly known as the Repeal Bill, will convert the bulk of EU law into U.K. legislation to avoid disruption on Brexit day.\u000a\u000aThe bill will begin its second reading Thursday, with MPs voting on it on Monday. It is likely that any major amendments will be put forward during the bill\u2019s committee stage, which comes after Monday\u2019s vote.\u000a\u000aWhile Starmer is keen to reach out to Tory backbenchers, there are many in his own party who are concerned about Labour\u2019s new stance on Brexit. The party now backs a transition arrangement, keeping the U.K. in the single market and a customs union for \u201cas long as is necessary.\u201d\u000a\u000aThree Labour MPs from northern constituencies where a majority of people voted for Brexit, who did not want to be named, said they are deeply concerned about the perception they are trying to \u201cblock Brexit\u201d by voting against the bill. One said they may defy Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s orders and abstain.\u000a\u000aA senior party official confirmed there was \u201cmuch nervousness\u201d among some Labour MPs who have \u201cconcerns on how it will look\u201d to vote against the bill. The official said mass abstentions on the Labour benches were \u201cpossible.\u201d\u000a\u000aStarmer said that while he understood the concerns of some Labour MPs, the party\u2019s position remained clear \u2014 that the U.K. would be leaving the EU come what may. He also ruled out a second referendum during the transition period, and set Labour against any post-transition deal that saw the U.K. stay in the single market but without a say in its rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he [Davis] is right to challenge [the EU], he is right, as any government would, to seek to ensure the sum is as low as possible\u201d \u2014 Keir Starmer\u000a\u000a\u201cI understand why different MPs coming from different perspectives and from different constituencies have the concerns they have,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made every effort to take on board the views across the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party].\u201d\u000a\u000aStarmer, who will take on David Davis in the debates over the Withdrawal Bill, has criticized the Brexit secretary for his handling of the negotiations with Brussels.\u000a\u000aHowever, one area where Labour\u2019s stance chimes with the government\u2019s is on the so-called Brexit bill \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the EU upon exit. Starmer said a Labour government would also fight to keep the bill as low as possible.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he [Davis] is right to challenge [the EU], he is right, as any government would, to seek to ensure the sum is as low as possible,\u201d Starmer said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s important to agree the principles but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to put a sum on it at the moment and I have not criticized David Davis for having done so.\u201d

aVA woman leans against a police squad car as she grieves at the scene where five people were shot in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. [Anthony Souffle/Chicago Tribune via Getty Images]\u000a\u000a15 Census Tracts, 97 Fatal Shootings, and the Two Different Sides to American Gun Violence New data released by The Guardian reveal some of the nation's deadliest places.\u000a\u000aWhile President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have emphasized the national murder rate when discussing their strategies for tackling violent crime, The Trace has argued that drilling down to the neighborhood level is the best way to understand gun violence. New data appears to bolster the case that murder inequality is one of the starkest, and most consequential, forms of inequality.\u000a\u000aThe Guardian and the Gun Violence Archive have mapped gun murders in 2015 to the neighborhood level, a project that shows how even within cities deemed \u201cviolent,\u201d risk is not evenly distributed. St. Louis, as a prime example, had the highest homicide rate per capita in the United States over the last three years. The homicide rates in several neighborhoods in the city are so high that \u2014 as we\u2019ve noted \u2014 they exceeded those in Honduras, the deadliest country in the world. In other neighborhoods, especially those that are majority white, the risk is negligible.\u000a\u000aUsing The Guardian\u2019s data, we identified the 15 census tracts where the most lives were lost in fatal shootings in 2015. Five of these tracts appear so high in the rankings because of single incidents that may sound familiar. They are home to places where a total of 31 lives were lost in mass-casualty shootings, including a biker bar in Waco, Texas, where nine people were killed in a shootout, and a home in Houston, where eight people \u2014 including six children \u2014 were killed in a horrific domestic shooting.\u000a\u000aWe would wager that you haven\u2019t heard about the gun deaths that happened in the other 10 census tracts with the most fatal shootings. The people who died in violent parts of St. Louis, or New Orleans, or Chicago, are victims of what we think of as everyday gun violence. Because people are shot so often, and because the victims are overwhelmingly poor, and black, news about individual incidents rarely punches through to the national consciousness.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s an overview of America\u2019s deadliest census tracts in 2015:\u000a\u000a01\u000a\u000aTract 6071007200: San Bernardino, California 16 dead in 1 incident In any given year, the census tract that appears at the top of this list is not so hard to guess. Mass shootings, also known as rampage shootings, attract huge media attention. In 2015, the most lethal of these attacks was carried out in San Bernardino, a down-on-its-heels industrial city east of Los Angeles, in California\u2019s Inland Empire. On December 2, 2015, two attackers who had declared fealty to the Islamic State fatally shot 14 people at a county public health department\u2019s Christmas party. The perpetrators were killed by police later that afternoon.\u000a\u000a02\u000a\u000aTract 22071001751: New Orleans, Louisiana 10 dead in 8 incidents At more than 16 square miles, this tract encompasses a significant portion of eastern New Orleans. However, because it is located on the outskirts of the city, next to a CSX rail yard and with a highway running through it, the area is sparsely populated, with fewer than 1,000 residents, according to the most recent census data. In one killing, a 45-year-old man was found shot dead in his home off the Chef Menteur Highway. A local minister\u2019s son discovered the man\u2019s body on a Sunday morning, when he stopped by to see if he would attend the day\u2019s services.\u000a\u000a03\u000a\u000aTract 41019120000: Roseburg, Oregon 10 dead in 1 incident The sleepy southern Oregon city used to be known, if it was known at all, as a lumber town. On October 1, 2015, it became yet another place in America bloodied by a mass shooting, when a student at Umpqua Community College gunned down a professor and eight of his classmates before committing suicide.\u000a\u000a04\u000a\u000aTract: 29510106400: St. Louis, Missouri 9 dead in 9 incidents St. Louis has the highest murder rate per capita in America, a terrible distinction that stems almost entirely from the extreme rates of violent crime in the northern half of the city. Rivalries, and romantic entanglements, often play a role in gun homicides \u2014 and both seemed to be at play on on June 26, 2015, when a former girlfriend of Jehoward Primus Jr., and the 2-year-old son they had together, were dropped off at Primus\u2019s home by the woman\u2019s current boyfriend. Primus and the boyfriend began arguing in the front yard, and the boyfriend shot him in the stomach \u2014 a few feet from the child. Primus, who was 21, called for his grandmother to help. He later died in the hospital.\u000a\u000a05\u000a\u000aTract 29510110300: St. Louis, Missouri 9 dead in 6 incidents In the city that leads the nation in fatal shootings, young adult black males are at highest risk. Just five days before Primus was fatally shot, another 21-year-old, Edward Dill, was gunned down in broad daylight in the middle of the street a few blocks to the east, in a neighborhood called The Greater Ville.\u000a\u000a06\u000a\u000aTract 22071013400: New Orleans, Louisiana 9 dead in 8 incidents This census area is in the center of downtown New Orleans, running from the Superdome to the banks of the Mississippi River, and borders on the city\u2019s bustling French Quarter. In one shooting in September 2015, a gunman opened fire in the early morning hours on a group of people just one block from Canal Street, the area\u2019s main thoroughfare. Three people were hit in the attack. One of the victims, a 35-year-old man, died at the scene.\u000a\u000a07\u000a\u000aTract 32003000301: Las Vegas, Nevada 9 dead in 7 incidents A 10-minute drive north from the MGM and Bellagio casino hotels sits this census tract, which connects the city\u2019s downtown with North Las Vegas. In one incident, a man was walking down the street when a van pulled alongside him. The front passenger fired a single fatal shot before the driver fled. The killing marked the city\u2019s 50th suspected homicide of 2015.\u000a\u000a08\u000a\u000aTract 48113020400: Dallas, Texas 9 dead in 6 incidents This census tract encompasses a part of the heart of downtown Dallas, including the convention center and the Omni Dallas Hotel. But the neighborhood responsible for this area\u2019s high rate of fatal shootings lies on the south side of Interstate 30, which bisects Dallas. One of those occurred on Joseph Perez\u2019s 21st birthday: July 18, 2015. Perez was celebrating, and was apparently drunk, when he grabbed a handgun and began shooting. His family took the gun away, but he later managed to retrieve it. He accidentally shot himself, and died soon after.\u000a\u000a09\u000a\u000aTract 45019000700: Charleston, South Carolina 9 dead in 1 incident On June 17, 2015, nine people were shot and killed during a bible study at a historically black church. The gunman, Dylann Roof, was convicted of the murders in a federal trial in January, becoming the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime.\u000a\u000a10\u000a\u000aTract 48309002100: Waco, Texas 9 dead in 1 incident On May 17, 2015, a shootout between two motorcycle clubs took nine lives. The groups had been at war for at least two years, the vice president of one of the clubs said, but the skirmish that day was sparked by a patch worn by one of the groups that represented turf.\u000a\u000a11\u000a\u000aTract 17163504500: Brooklyn, Illinois / East St. Louis, Illinois 9 dead in 9 incidents This tract includes the village of Brooklyn, a tiny municipality on the Mississippi River founded by freed slaves, along with a sliver of East St. Louis. Almost every resident is African American and almost half live below the poverty line. In one incident, Oscar Carbajal was leaving a Phillips 66 gas station when a man approached and asked for a beer. A scuffle ensued, and Carbajal dropped a beer can to the pavement. It broke open, and the man who had asked for it was splashed. He went to his car, retrieved his gun, and shot Carbajal dead.\u000a\u000a12\u000a\u000aTract 17031251800: Chicago, Illinois 8 dead in 8 incidents The Austin neighborhood of Chicago consistently ranks at the top for homicides in the city, and this small patch \u2014 .39 square miles \u2014 of land sits right in its center. The area is notorious for gang activity, and retaliatory shootings. In one such incident, three men were shot in broad daylight while driving down the road. A 19-year-old man was killed in the attack. All three victims were documented gang members, police said.\u000a\u000a13\u000a\u000aTract 48201533801: Houston, Texas 8 dead in 1 incident At four million residents, Harris County is America\u2019s third largest county. It\u2019s also earned the distinction of having a exceedingly high number of domestic violence homicides. In a particularly horrific incident, a man with a lengthy, violent criminal history executed his son, his ex-girlfriend, her husband, and their five children.

aVDemocrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much these days, but virtually everyone from both parties agrees that working-class voters in the Rust Belt are struggling. President Donald Trump won the support of the \u201cforgotten men and women of our country\u201d with promises to build a wall and renegotiate trade deals. Democrats have responded with their \u201cBetter Deal\u201d agenda, a policy framework with less chance of becoming law than the New York Mets\u2019 odds of winning the World Series.\u000a\u000aThe upshot is that both parties have a political imperative to aid the Rust Belt, but neither has the capacity to solve the biggest economic problem in the region: a decade long decline in startup activity. Startups are the sinew of the American economy, but the uncomfortable reality is that American businesses are dying. Despite all the money and attention focused on Silicon Valley, far more businesses have gone belly up than started up over the past decade. And where we do see business creation, it\u2019s far too concentrated on the coasts.\u000a\u000aGovernment alone cannot solve this problem, but it also can\u2019t ignore it. The decline of startups in the heartland is real. It must be addressed, and it can be with a program modeled on Race to the Top \u2013 the education initiative that delivered the best return on investment of any Obama-era program. The idea would be to create a modest federal grant program incentivizing state lawmakers to develop a more startup-friendly business environment. Such a program would be a political victory for Democrats and Republicans, and more important, it would deliver real economic benefits to the Rust Belt.\u000a\u000aTo understand the severity of the problem, consider this: Last year, 75 percent of venture capital went to just four places\u2014San Francisco, New York, Boston and Los Angeles. Large legacy businesses like Ford, General Electric and Boeing are vital to sustaining our economy, but at this point, they contribute relatively little to economic growth. By contrast, an often cited study from the Kauffman Foundation revealed that new businesses\u2014startups\u2014account for nearly all net job growth in America. The clear implication is that the future of American prosperity rests with entrepreneurs, specifically, the ones willing to start and stay in the Rust Belt.\u000a\u000aSo how do we achieve that? Congress should start by looking at Race to the Top. The goal for Race to the Top was simple \u2013 incentivize states to pass needed reforms to their school systems by offering federal prize money for whoever was the boldest and the brightest. It focused on four criteria: improving testing, developing teachers, upgrading data and turning around low-performing schools. To qualify, it wasn\u2019t enough to submit a plan. Each state that sought the federal grant had to implement their proposed program. That took legislation and a willingness to overcome entrenched interests that had fought reform for decades.\u000a\u000aThe process was transparent and nonpolitical. It didn\u2019t matter whether the state seeking the grant was red or blue, every submission was judged on its merits\u2014a testament to Arne Duncan, who was secretary of education at the time. Winners were determined by an independent, nonpolitical board of experts that evaluated each application using a scoring rubric that was well-defined and publicly available. It resulted in fierce but productive competition among states that exceeded all expectations: For what turned out to be a rounding error in the federal budget, the Department of Education enticed 50 states to pass meaningful reforms including the creation of charter schools and paying teachers more for better performance.\u000a\u000aThe government can and should design a similar program for helping the Rust Belt. Here\u2019s how it would work: Congress would create a modest competitive grant\u2014$5 billion\u2014to encourage state and local governments to build a friendlier environment for startups. To qualify for the grant, states and cities would enact reforms on criteria like developing a pipeline for local technology talent, eliminating regulations that protect existing monopolies or impede innovation, and investing in next generation technology infrastructure. All the money would be sent to the states: no new federal bureaucracy or permanent entitlement of any kind would be needed.\u000a\u000aSome states would choose to roll back onerous regulations\u2014like occupational licensing requirements and worker noncompete clauses that have nothing to do with consumer safety and everything to do with the desire of entrenched interests to limit competition. Other states would focus on doubling down where they have a comparative advantage\u2013like ag-tech in Iowa, or autonomous vehicle software in Michigan. The idea recognizes that there is no uniform policy playbook for spurring entrepreneurship \u2013 what works in one state may fail in another. But giving states the resources, the flexibility and the political cover to experiment is the best hope we have for addressing the intractable problems contributing to our present stagnation.\u000a\u000aRace to the Top worked in precisely the same way. The federal government articulated a bold, bipartisan vision \u2013 an end to failing schools \u2013 and let the states determine the best path for reaching it. Governors and state lawmakers were told to focus on their state\u2019s needs, not conform to a single national standard. It resulted in entrepreneurial policymaking among the states who had license to get creative, overcome entrenched opposition, pass reforms and celebrate progress. The multiplier effect was enormous, dwarfing the comparatively minor investment to achieve goals that had been sought for decades.\u000a\u000aHad the Obama administration simply commanded states to adopt the administration\u2019s preferred policy changes, Race to the Top would have almost certainly failed. The alternative \u2013 a federal grant program that made a state\u2019s eligibility contingent on the scope and scale of their education reforms \u2013 wasn\u2019t an unfunded mandate, it didn\u2019t infringe on the states\u2019 prerogative to devise their own education policies and it encouraged policy innovation consistent with the belief that states are our nation\u2019s \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aUltimately, what worked for education can work for economic renewal. Congress could adopt the same approach to create tens of thousands of jobs in the Rust Belt, and they could do it without spending a lot of money, without requiring a large new government bureaucracy, even without the usual fighting, scandal and controversy.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the day, what most entrepreneurs want isn\u2019t complicated: They want to be in a city that their employees like living in and they want to operate in a jurisdiction whose regulatory climate is not slanted in favor of entrenched interests. Many startups would be willing to set up shop in Indiana, Ohio or Pennsylvania if they knew the environment was hospitable, the culture welcoming and the playing field fair. By awarding grants only to states willing to pass laws that allow startups to compete, the federal government can help make that happen.\u000a\u000aSeth London is the co-founder of Ground Control and Managing Director at Tusk Ventures.

aVFrom Armed Rebellions to Permitless Carry: A Brief History of Guns in Missouri For nearly 130 years, the state banned concealed weapons. Now it has some of the most relaxed firearms laws in the country.\u000a\u000aIn Missouri, the question of how to regulate the carrying of guns \u2014 and adjudicate the armed conflicts that sometimes result \u2014 is older than the state itself. Lawmakers passed restrictions meant to prevent slave uprisings, and a governor once encouraged the armed expulsion of Mormons. Concealed carry has gone from being banned by the state Constitution, to requiring no permit at all. And while Missouri was a late adopter of \u201cstand your ground\u201d legislation, the new legal protections for self-defense shooters follow a history of residents meting out their own justice with the squeeze of a trigger, as the following timeline shows.\u000a\u000a1803: The Louisiana Purchase\u000a\u000aUnder President Thomas Jefferson, the United States assumes control of 827,000 square miles of untamed territory west of the Mississippi River. The $15 million transaction includes all or part of 15 eventual states, including what becomes the state of Missouri. By 2017, the state\u2019s most prominent city, St. Louis \u2014 the \u201cGateway to the West\u201d \u2014 will have the highest homicide rate in the nation.\u000a\u000a1818: Missouri\u2019s first weapons laws\u000a\u000aThe territory\u2019s legislature passes one of Missouri\u2019s first gun regulations, enacting a law barring slaves from carrying or possessing guns, ammunition, clubs, or other weapons. The statute grants whites the right to seize weapons found in slave possession.\u000a\u000a1820: The Missouri Compromise\u000a\u000aThe territory\u2019s representatives push for statehood, but federal officials are reluctant to grant it, fearing that Missouri\u2019s admission to the Union as a slave state will upset the balance of power between free and slave states. To address this concern, Congress passes the Missouri Compromise, which admits Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state. But the issue is far from settled.\u000a\u000a1833: Extermination order\u000a\u000aTension between residents of Jackson County and the Mormons that have claimed it as sacred ground peaks when a violent mob chases members of the religion from the county. The state of Missouri decides to separate the Mormons from the general population by relocating the former to the newly created Caldwell County. Ongoing tension will lead some Missourians to take up arms against Mormons at the polls when they try to vote. To restore the peace, Governor Lilburn Boggs endorses more violence: His extermination order mandates the expulsion of Mormons by any means necessary, including deadly force.\u000a\u000a1861-1865: Guerrillas beget gun bans\u000a\u000aMissouri becomes a hotbed for pro-Confederate guerrilla warfare, which state officials combat by passing various firearm restrictions. \u201cIn some parts of Missouri, where guerrilla warfare was especially problematic, there were restrictions on the possession of weapons for both loyal and disloyal persons,\u201d says Dennis Boman, professor of history at Lindenwood University. None of the new measures stopped the violence. Missouri is home to about 4,000 guerrilla fighters, a force that eventually requires approximately 60,000 Union troops to subdue.\u000a\u000a1874: No hidden weapons allowed\u000a\u000aPost-Civil War lawlessness in Missouri leads to a rise in vigilantism. \u201cYou had a lot of people fighting who weren\u2019t actually in either army,\u201d says Al Viola, a historian with the Boone County Historical Society. To combat the surge in violence, the state legislature bans concealed weapons in churches, schoolrooms, election polls, courtrooms, and public assemblies. Lawmakers make sure that it is specifically enforced against freed slaves, and thwart their ability to defend themselves, says Kevin Jamison, author of Missouri Weapons and Self-Defense Law. In 1875, the state will effectively ban concealed weapons of any kind, anywhere, for the next 128 years.\u000a\u000aStay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis.

He and about 100 other men start an armed gang that calls itself the Bald Knobbers. Soon after, Eglinton resident Frank Taylor gets into a dispute with local store owners, trashes their property and, with his brother, shoots the owners, who survive. The brothers turn themselves in, but the Knobbers attack the jail and lynch the Taylors. They leave a note that reads: \u201cBeware! These are the first victims to the wrath of outraged citizens. More will follow.\u201d\u000a\u000a1945: State constitution, revised\u000a\u000aLawmakers revise the state constitution of 1875, modernizing the language on the concealed-weapons ban. The clause addressing concealed carry \u2014 which previously read, \u201cBut nothing herein contained is intended to justify the practice of wearing concealed weapons\u201d \u2014 is updated. The new language explicitly bans the practice: \u201dThis shall not justify the wearing of concealed weapons.\u201d\u000a\u000a1977: Prelude to the Castle Doctrine\u000a\u000aVelma Gardner, a Kansas City resident, shoots and kills her husband in the driveway of their home as he attempts to hit her with his car. Gardner is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a year in prison. The courts decide that people may turn to lethal force as a first resort only to defend themselves inside their dwellings; outside them, residents have a \u201cduty to retreat,\u201d which she did not exercise when exiting the front door, approaching the driveway, and opening fire. Thirty years later, the legislature passes the Castle Doctrine, expanding the legal use of deadly force to anywhere on one\u2019s property.\u000a\u000a2003: The return of concealed carry\u000a\u000aThe Missouri House of Representatives overturns the state\u2019s concealed-carry ban after 128 years. Eighty-four of the state\u2019s 162 representatives sponsor the bill. Opponents try to overturn the law, arguing it violates the state constitution. The Missouri Supreme Court says the constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly forbid concealed guns and state lawmakers have the authority to decide who can carry them and under what circumstances. Missouri is one of 46 states allowing concealed carry.\u000a\u000a2005: National birth of \u201cstand your ground\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Florida Legislature passes the nation\u2019s first \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. To critics\u2019 dismay, the new law allows those acting in self-defense to use deadly force in public spaces. By 2017, 24 states will have passed \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws.\u000a\u000a2006: Castle Doctrine becomes law in Missouri\u000a\u000aLawmakers introduce and easily pass Senate Bill 62, Missouri\u2019s version of the Castle Doctrine. Without needing to retreat into one\u2019s home, homeowners may use lethal force to defend themselves, family, home, property or vehicle as long as they \u201coccupy\u201d that property. In another change, gun purchasers no longer need a permit to acquire a concealable firearm, a mandate that has been in place since 2004.\u000a\u000a2010: Prelude to \u201cstand your ground\u201d\u000a\u000aShauntay Henderson shoots and kills DeAndre Parker outside a Kansas City gas station as he tries to run her down with his truck. Henderson says she feared for her life when she reached for her gun. Acquitted of second-degree murder, she\u2019s convicted of voluntary manslaughter and armed criminal action because she failed to retreat before shooting. The court rules that Missouri residents are entitled to use deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves against death, severe injury or \u201cforcible felony.\u201d\u000a\u000a2012: Trayvon Martin\u000a\u000aGeorge Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain in Sanford, Florida, shoots and kills Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, sparking national outrage and debate over the meaning of self-defense, the use of lethal force and the role of race in gun violence. Though he claimed it was a self-defense shooting, Zimmerman did not invoke \u201cstand your ground.\u201d Nevertheless, the case elevates the specter of \u201cstand your ground.\u201d The following summer, Zimmerman is acquitted of second-degree murder.\u000a\u000a2014: Schools and teenagers\u000a\u000aThe Missouri General Assembly passes a law allowing certified school employees to carry guns on campus and decreases the legal concealed-carry age from 21 to 19. The law is sponsored by Republican Senator Will Kraus. Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, vetoes the law but the legislature overrides his decision by a vote of 117 to 39.\u000a\u000a2015: \u201cStand your ground\u201d and permitless carry adopted\u000a\u000aRepublican Senator Brian Munzlinger, a farmer from northeastern Missouri, introduces a bill to eradicate the \u201cduty to retreat.\u201d A separate provision eliminates need for concealed-carry permits. Again, the law passes easily; again, Nixon vetoes it; again, legislators later overwhelmingly override him. Now anyone in Missouri may carry a concealed weapon in most public places without a permit, and claim immunity in armed confrontations.\u000a\u000a2017: The road ahead\u000a\u000aCertain areas \u2014 like airports and courthouses \u2014 remain off-limits to concealed firearms, whether their owner is licensed to carry or not. Uncertainty surrounds the new law in other places, including the state Capitol, where legislators are permitted to carry weapons inside the House and Senate chambers. Colleges may still ban guns on campus. But if Republican Representative Jered Taylor has his way, this too might change. Taylor\u2019s proposed legislation, House Bill 630, was introduced January 17. On April 19, the Standing Committee on Rules voted \u201cdo pass.\u201d There have not been any additional actions on the bill.

aVToday, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the initiation of new antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) investigations to determine whether imports of uncoated groundwood paper from Canada are being dumped in the United States, and whether producers in Canada are receiving alleged unfair subsidies.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe United States is dedicated to free, fair, and reciprocal trade with Canada, and guarantees that this case will be decided strictly on a full and fair assessment of the facts,\u201d said Secretary Ross. \u201cThe Trump administration is committed to enforcing America\u2019s vital trade laws to ensure U.S. businesses and workers have a fair chance to compete.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese AD and CVD investigations were initiated based on petitions filed by North Pacific Paper Company (Longview, Wash.) on August 9. The estimated dumping margins alleged by the petitioner range from 23.45 to 54.97 percent and the unfair subsidies are estimated to be above de minimis.\u000a\u000aIn the AD investigation, the Commerce Department will determine whether imports of uncoated groundwood paper from Canada are being dumped in the U.S. market at less than fair value.\u000a\u000aIn the CVD investigation, the Commerce Department will determine whether Canadian producers of uncoated groundwood paper are receiving unfair government subsidies.\u000a\u000aIf the Commerce Department determines that uncoated groundwood paper from Canada is being dumped into the U.S. market and/or receiving unfair government subsidies, and if the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) determines that dumped and/or unfairly subsidized U.S. imports of uncoated groundwood paper from Canada are causing injury to the U.S. industry, the Commerce Department will impose duties on those imports in the amount of dumping and/or unfair subsidization found to exist.\u000a\u000aIn 2016, imports of uncoated groundwood paper from Canada were valued at an estimated $1.27 billion.\u000a\u000aClick HERE for a fact sheet on these initiations.\u000a\u000aNext Steps:\u000a\u000aDuring the Commerce Department\u2019s investigations into whether uncoated groundwood paper is being dumped and/or unfairly subsidized, the ITC will conduct its own investigations into whether the U.S. industry and its workforce are being harmed by such imports.& The ITC will make its preliminary determinations on or before September 25. If the ITC preliminary determines that there is injury or threat of injury, then the Commerce Department investigations will continue, with a preliminary CVD determination scheduled for November 2017 and a preliminary AD determination scheduled for January 2018, unless these deadlines are extended.\u000a\u000aIf the Commerce Department preliminary determines that dumping or unfair subsidization is occurring, then it will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to start collecting cash deposits from all U.S. companies importing the subject uncoated groundwood paper from Canada.\u000a\u000aFinal determinations by the Commerce Department in these cases are scheduled for January 2018 for the CVD investigation, and April 2018 for the AD investigation, but those dates may be extended. If the Commerce Department finds that products are not being dumped or unfairly subsidized, or the U.S. International Trade Commission finds in its final determinations there is no harm to the U.S. industry, then the investigations will be terminated and no duties will be applied collected.\u000a\u000aFrom January 20, 2017, through August 29, 2017, Commerce has initiated 58 AD and CVD investigations. Commerce currently maintains 407 AD and CVD duty orders which provide relief to American companies and industries impacted by unfair trade.\u000a\u000aForeign companies that price their products in the U.S. market below the cost of production or below prices in their home markets are subject to \u201cantidumping\u201d duties. Companies that receive unfair subsidies from their governments, such as grants, loans, equity infusions, tax breaks and production inputs, are subject to \u201ccountervailing duties\u201d aimed at directly countering those subsidies.

aVBusiness dynamism is the process by which firms continually are born, fail, expand, and contract, as some jobs are created, others are destroyed, and others still are turned over. Research has firmly established that this dynamic process is vital to productivity and sustained economic growth. Entrepreneurs play a critical role in this process, and in net job creation.\u000a\u000aBut recent research shows that dynamism is slowing down. Business churning and new firm formations have been on a persistent decline during the last few decades, and the pace of net job creation has been subdued. This decline has been documented across a broad range of sectors in the U.S. economy, even in high-tech.\u000a\u000aHere, the geographic aspects of business dynamism are analyzed. In particular, we look at how these trends have applied to the states and metropolitan areas throughout the United States. In short, we confirm that the previously documented declines in business dynamism in the U.S. overall are a pervasive force throughout the country geographically.\u000a\u000aIn fact, we show that dynamism has declined in all fifty states and in all but a handful of the more than three hundred and sixty U.S. metropolitan areas during the last three decades. Moreover, the performance of business dynamism across the states and metros has become increasingly similar over time. In other words, the national decline in business dynamism has been a widely shared experience.\u000a\u000aWhile the reasons explaining this decline are still unknown, if it persists, it implies a continuation of slow growth for the indefinite future, unless for equally unknown reasons or by virtue of entrepreneurshipenhancing policies (such as liberalized entry of high-skilled immigrants), these trends are reversed.

aVAn anti-racism event in Brussels in March 2017 | John Thys/AFP via Getty Images Opinion Brussels bubble has a diversity problem European institutions urgently need to promote a more racially, ethnically and religiously varied staff.\u000a\u000aEthnic and religious minorities make up at least 7 percent of the European Union\u2019s population. And yet, if you work in the Brussels bubble, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s exceedingly rare to meet an EU civil servant who isn\u2019t white.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission urgently needs to take action. Failure to tackle this issue prevents fresh talent from participating in the EU\u2019s decision-making and contributes to Brussels\u2019 image as an exclusive club out of touch with its citizens.\u000a\u000aIn response to calls to address the lack of diversity in EU institutions, the Commission published a strategy last month to include more women, people with disabilities, older workers and LGBT people in its ranks.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the strategy makes no mention of measures promoting a more racially, ethnically or religiously diverse staff \u2014 despite repeated calls from rights groups and MEPs.\u000a\u000aThe omission is particularly alarming in light of a series of racist, sexist and homophobic remarks made last year by Günther Oettinger, the EU commissioner for budget and human resources.\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s strategy reflects a long-standing colorblind approach to diversity.\u000a\u000aOettinger\u2019s mandate to come up with a diversity strategy allowing the Commission \u201cto reflect the diversity of our society in terms of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation\u201d was an opportunity for him to make up for his poor track record.\u000a\u000aInstead, his strategy\u2019s failure to mention race, ethnicity or religion sends the message to current and future minority Commission employees that their concerns are not a priority of this administration.\u000a\u000aTo be sure, this is nothing new. The Commission\u2019s strategy reflects a long-standing colorblind approach to diversity. While the EU institutions have embraced positive action when it comes to hiring women, it still rejects similar measures aimed at improving racial and ethnic diversity as \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis attitude ignores the tangible effects of racial discrimination and the steps needed to rectify it. On this front, the EU is falling behind a large number of national governments that recognize the need for affirmative action to push back against structural racial discrimination in their workforces.\u000a\u000aThe Commission urgently needs to develop strategies to ensure the institution is a fair and equal workplace for minorities. As we have detailed in an open letter to Oettinger and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, these measures must address the glaring lack of representation of racial, ethnic and religious minorities, particularly at senior levels, and make accommodations for the cultural and religious needs of Commission staff.\u000a\u000aThere is no way to analyze the EU\u2019s performance on racial, ethnic and religious diversity.\u000a\u000aThe strategy should also pay particular attention to all forms of discrimination, for women, staff with disabilities, LGBT staff and older staff belonging to ethnic or religious minorities.\u000a\u000aAs part of this process, the Commission and other EU institutions should commit to collecting anonymous, self-identified data on the racial and ethnic makeup of their workforce. In the absence of data, there is no way to analyze the EU\u2019s performance on racial, ethnic and religious diversity or for its hiring managers to adopt specific policies to address problem areas.\u000a\u000aMost urgently, the Commission has to abandon its colorblind approach to diversity. If it fails to do so, the EU will appear increasingly impenetrable to talented potential employees from minority backgrounds and fail to truly represent European society in all of its diversity.\u000a\u000aAmel Yacef is chair of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR).

aVAn Illegal Gun on the Streets Is No Slam Dunk in Court To reverse a sharp decline in firearm convictions, New York City is pursuing another experiment with specialized gun courts. But making illegal weapons charges stick can be vexingly hard to do.\u000a\u000aNew York Police Department Detective Matthew Jogoda was working a funeral detail last December when he says a traffic infraction and a whiff of marijuana led him to put his hand down a Brooklyn man\u2019s pants and pull out a Smith & Wesson .380 Bodyguard, a compact little weapon that holds six bullets in the magazine and one in the chamber.\u000a\u000aRayon Gordon was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon, setting in motion one of the dozens of cases to come before New York City\u2019s latest experiment with specialized gun courts.\u000a\u000aEstablished by the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, the courts are part of Project Fast Track, a multi-pronged effort to reduce gun violence launched this January. Amid a rise in shootings in cities across the country (an increase from which New York City has largely been spared), the initiative is testing a larger question: how to dissuade people from unlawfully carrying firearms, and thus reduce the opportunities for confrontations to turn deadly.\u000a\u000aStay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis.

Share on Facebook\u000a\u000aShare on Twitter\u000a\u000aShare via Email Close\u000a\u000aOne response to a surge of gunfire, embraced by Democratic mayors in Milwaukee and Chicago, is to seek tough minimum sentences for people caught with firearms they shouldn\u2019t have \u2014 the very kind of mandates that have been rejected by policymakers on both sides of the ideological divide, due to the racial disparities those minimums produced in the mass incarceration that resulted from the war on drugs. New York City\u2019s approach to gun courts provides an alternative, where the goal is not to make punishment more severe, but instead more certain and swift.\u000a\u000aAchieving that objective seems straightforward: Someone is caught with a gun they aren\u2019t supposed to own; that someone is brought before a judge to receive their due punishment.\u000a\u000aThe speed gun courts aim for is important because defendants in cases that linger are harder to convict. With more gun arrests sticking, and sticking more quickly, the rapidity and consistency generate benefits of their own as word gets out among the young people who are responsible for the bulk of urban gun violence.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn that age group, if you don\u2019t move swiftly you lose the impact of the punishment,\u201d says says Richard Ahorn, the head of the Citizens Crime Commission, a nonprofit group that advocates for measures to reduce crime. \u201cThe immediacy is important because you want to send a message.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe message being, of course, that carrying illegal firearms poses too high a risk of getting caught, and being convicted of a gun charge.\u000a\u000aStraight gun possession cases are not uncomplicated\u201d Eugene O\u2019Donnell John Jay College professor and former NYPD officer\u201dJohn\u000a\u000aAs part of Project Fast Track, the NYPD set up a 200-member gun suppression division that will use a database to track trends and identify offenders in high-crime precincts. When those offenders are apprehended, the division will also provide a dedicated officer to follow each gun case through the courts and work closely with prosecutors to build a case most likely to lead to conviction. Through their rulings, the courts are supposed to complete a virtuous cycle, providing consistent evidentiary standards that can give cops and prosecutors a better roadmap for how to raise the rate of gun possession convictions.\u000a\u000aBut what happened to Rayon Gordon after he was arrested outside that Brooklyn funeral shows how complicated it can be for gun courts to deliver the kind of straightforward results politicians promise. Just as in traditional judicial proceedings, cases can be thrown out because police were deemed to have violated constitutional safeguards, or because officers secured weapons in the course of by-the-books police work whose nature makes proving illegal possession inherently difficult.\u000a\u000a\u201cStraight gun possession cases,\u201d says former NYPD cop and current John Jay College Professor Eugene O\u2019Donnell, \u201care not uncomplicated.\u201d\u000a\u000aPolice unions and right-wing tabloids have cultivated a myth of rising violence during de Blasio\u2019s administration, but the reality is that the city is remarkably safe. There have been 131 fewer shootings in the city so far this year compared to the first seven months of 2015, a year that saw a the third-fewest number of homicides in the city\u2019s modern history.\u000a\u000aPolice are also making lots of weapons arrests. In 2015, there were more than 13,000 arrests where weapons charges were the top offense, 54 percent more than in crime-fighter Rudy Giuliani\u2019s final year in office.\u000a\u000aConviction rates, however, have not kept pace with the climbing case load. Statistics from the state\u2019s Division of Criminal Justice indicate that the ratio of convictions to arrests in cases where a weapons charge was the top offense dropped to 18 percent from 2009 to 2013, down from 40 percent in the 1994 to 1998 period.\u000a\u000aThe drop in convictions, law enforcement officials say, is at least partly because of changes in state law that stiffened penalties for gun possession, reducing the number of plea bargains and sending more cases to court. (It was this statutory change that undermined a previous gun court experiment in Brooklyn, where the new surge of cases overwhelmed district attorneys and judges.)\u000a\u000aBoosting that conviction rate is the goal of Project Fast Track.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real problem has been their inability to make gun cases \u2013 not that the process wasn\u2019t efficient or quick,\u201d says City Councilmember Rory Lancman, a Queens Democrat who stood with the mayor when Project Fast Track was announced. And changing that, he argues, \u201cmeans good police work, good evidence collection.\u201d For a prosecutor to win a gun possession case, she has to prove several critical facts: that the defendant actually possessed the gun in violation of the law (in New York, it is nearly impossible for average residents to secure a permit to carry a gun in public), and that the police officers who found the weapon were in their rights to search for it in the first place.\u000a\u000aProving the former is fairly easy when the illegal gun is found tucked in a waistband or secured in an ankle holster, says David LaBahn, president of the National Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. But such clear-cut busts are also rare, he says.\u000a\u000aThe farther the gun from the body, the easier it is for defense lawyers to raise doubts about who actually possessed the weapon. A gun jammed into the pocket of a jacket? The arrestee could say he grabbed the wrong jacket at a party, Le Bahn says.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe most common gun case,\u201d Le Bahn says, \u201cis the gun in the car, it\u2019s not lying there in plain site. It\u2019s under a seat. It\u2019s in a glove compartment.\u201d The person nearest to the weapon can say he\u2019s just a passenger, and has no idea where the gun came from.\u000a\u000a\u201cWho can you say truly possessed it?\u201d LaBahn asks, channeling a defense lawyer.\u000a\u000aCutting through the fog of doubt might require an affidavit from someone attesting to the fact that the person arrested did, in fact, own the gun; or finding social media posts that show the person holding a gun of the same make and model.\u000a\u000a\u201cOr you might get really lucky,\u201d LaBahn says, \u201cand get fingerprints or DNA off the weapon or a cartridge.\u201d Without that kind of direct, physical proof, the door is open to the defense that \u201cthe gun wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d\u000a\u000aDetermining whether physical evidence exists to tie suspects to firearms is part of the daily grind at Brooklyn\u2019s gun court. In Gordon\u2019s case, at least, the process appeared neither fast nor simple. On May 25, five months after the arrest, prosecutor Elaine Albenda told Judge Susan Mondo \u201cthe gun has been swabbed.\u201d But it was still unclear whether there was enough DNA on the gun to warrant testing Gordon for a match.\u000a\u000aThe real problem has been their inability to make gun cases \u2014 not that the process wasn\u2019t efficient or quick. [Change that means good police work, good evidence collection.\u201d Rory Lancman City Councilmember\u000a\u000aIn some cases, fingerprinting the firearm might help prove possession. But Fordham law professor Jim Cohen says that tool is not often employed in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely unusual to have a gun possession case in which the police have subjected the gun to fingerprint analysis. Fingerprinting is not what the NYPD does, except in the most heinous and highest profile of crimes, and not always in those.\u201d\u000a\u000aCircumstances also often conspire to obstruct evidence collection: Often, police officers encounter illegal guns amid the tension and danger inherent in a street encounter, where their first job is to make sure the gun isn\u2019t used to injure or kill someone, and their second task is to make sure the suspect doesn\u2019t flee. Ensuring that evidence is collected in a fashion that will best preserve it for use in building a case is a tertiary priority in those situations, says Cohen.\u000a\u000aIn other situations, a cop reaching under a car seat or into a tightly packed bag may accidentally touch a gun he didn\u2019t expect to find, contaminating the evidence.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s no certainty that even if you\u2019ve properly handled it, that you\u2019re going to pull prints off it,\u201d LaBahn notes. It can be easier to get gun evidence at a crime scene where a gun has actually been used and discarded, he says, because police can take their time in treating the gun as evidence, not a direct threat.\u000a\u000aEven when a gun is found in a waistband, and there\u2019s no doubt about who possessed it, prosecutors aren\u2019t home free. For starters, there is the obvious obstacle of the defense attorney, who will be in no hurry to move things along. \u201cThe system is very, very difficult to move,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cDefense attorneys are not going to cooperate with that. They understand very, very well that time is their friend in terms of getting adjournments.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd then there is the important question of why cops had their hands in that waistband to begin with. If prosecutors cannot prove that the officers had the right to find the gun, the case could run into trouble under what\u2019s called the exclusionary rule.\u000a\u000aThat rule, established in a series of U.S. Supreme Court cases that includes the 1966 Miranda decision, holds that evidence obtained through illegal means \u2014 such as an unconstitutional search \u2014 cannot be used against a defendant. \u201cThere must be reasonable, articulable suspicion in order to do that stop,\u201d says LaBahn, \u201cand there must be further evidence for why you went ahead with an actual search.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe legal standard creates opportunities for police to make mistakes that will upend a gun case, says Bennett Capers, a professor at Brooklyn Law School. \u201cThere are officers out there who will frisk as a matter of course. Unless that officer can articulate why that person was dangerous, that frisk \u2014 if it uncovers a gun \u2014 will be thrown out.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs an officer enters a residence, other potential pitfalls await. \u201cSometimes officers go into a home and end up seeing a gun. Did they have proper justification for going into a home without a warrant?\u201d Capers adds. \u201cSo much of this is fact-specific, which is why officers have a difficult time because they\u2019re not legal experts.\u201d\u000a\u000aNationwide research indicates that the exclusionary rule is invoked successfully by defense lawyers in a minority of cases, and many scholars say the Supreme Court under Justice John Roberts has reduced the rule\u2019s scope, mainly by carving out wider good-faith exceptions for cops who unintentionally violate it (say, by pulling over a car based on a misinterpretation of what type of vehicle an all-points bulletin described). And Cohen notes the enormous political pressure on judges \u2014 and the politicians who appoint them \u2014 to punish alleged violent criminals and avoid setting free someone who goes on to commit a heinous crime.\u000a\u000aBut those curbs notwithstanding, the exclusionary rule remains a potent play for defenses. \u201cGun cases are won or lost at the suppression hearing,\u201d Lancman, the Queens councilman, notes. At those pretrial hearings, a defense attorney can try to prevent a gun from being admitted as evidence \u2014 and thereby destroy the case against their client.\u000a\u000aWhich is how Rayon Gordon beat the gun rap he was facing.\u000a\u000aSupport Our Work Help us tell the story of America\u2019s gun violence crisis. Donate Now\u000a\u000aThe brief hearing was held in the new gun court in Brooklyn \u2014 really just a set of regular courtrooms in the massive Supreme Court building in the borough\u2019s downtown. During testimony, the arresting officer, Jogada, explained that he and colleagues were patrolling outside the memorial service for a slain gang member late last December, collecting intelligence on which gang members showed up and keeping an eye out for violence, when he saw a Nissan Sentra drive into a bus lane on a street where traffic was partially obstructed and then change lanes twice without signaling. Approaching the car, he said he smelled marijuana and saw flakes on Gordon\u2019s pants. The police officer ordered Gordon out of the vehicle. As he was frisking him, he felt the gun in Gordon\u2019s jeans. Jogada told Gordon he was getting a ticket for the pot, cuffed him, then pulled the gun out. Jagoda testified that Gordon admitted he had a gun when asked.\u000a\u000aWhen Jagoda and a fellow detective were cross-examined in gun court in May, however, they offered conflicting rationales for why they pulled the car over in the first place. The other detective said nothing about smelling marijuana, and when he spoke to an assistant district attorney shortly after the arrest, he told a different story about where the gun was found. No pipes or rolling papers were in the car, and city policy is now to issue a ticket \u2014 not cuff people \u2014 for small amounts of pot.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, the arrest documents prepared separately for Gordon and two other occupants of the car indicated that each of the three arrested men were individually responsible for possessing the .380 \u2014 which is not possible, under the law. \u201cAll of this raises serious questions about the credibility of the account,\u201d Judge Alan Marrus said. \u201cOn that basis alone, I am unable to credit their account.\u201d With that, the defense\u2019s motion to exclude the gun from the evidence that the gun court could consider was granted. The Brooklyn district attorney decided not to appeal, and the case against Gordon was dismissed.\u000a\u000aFor now, the latest experiment with New York gun courts is limited to Brooklyn. City officials are monitoring its performance to see if the idea warrants expansion citywide. As cases make their way through the docket, Project Fast Track is filtering lessons about evidence collection back to the NYPD to improve procedures and training, so that arrests are standing on firmer foundations when they reach prosecutors.\u000a\u000aJohn Jay College professor Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a former cop, says that officials ought to be careful not to tie success in reducing gun violence too closely to conviction rates. People carry guns for different reasons, he notes, and not everyone caught carrying a firearm should face the same consequences.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat do you do about the person who\u2019s trying to protect themselves? Or who didn\u2019t know the gun laws? We have all these laws predicated on the idea that there\u2019s no reason to have a gun. There\u2019s going to have to be exceptions because otherwise you have injustice\u201d.\u000a\u000aAs powerful as the desire to remove guns from circulation might be, Capers wonders if resources might be better spent focusing on the guns that actually have been used to commit crimes. \u201cI\u2019m always sort of thinking, our homicide clearance rate is still way too low. We only solve two thirds of homicides,\u201d he says. Nationally, the FBI reports a homicide clearance rate of 64 percent; it can be much lower in high-crime cities. \u201cThere are people who\u2019ve already been shot. We ought to address that too.\u201d\u000a\u000aOr maybe the effectiveness of gun courts at surmounting the challenges of evidence en route to swift and certain justice is beside the point. As LaBahn notes, even when an illegal gun is ruled inadmissible in court and the person accused of carrying it goes free, they don\u2019t get their firearm back.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt a minimum,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re taking that gun off the street.\u201d\u000a\u000a[Photo: AP Photo/John Minchillo, File]

aVPresident Donald Trump was already feuding with top Republicans even before this week\u2019s debt ceiling deal with Democrats. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Amid feud over debt deal, Trump scolds GOP over Obamacare, filibuster\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump chided members of his own party once again Friday morning, complaining on Twitter that Republicans have failed thus far to pass legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and urging the Senate once more to do away with its filibuster rules.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepublicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning. \u201cEven worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn another online post, the president urged Republicans to start work right away on another of his legislative priorities, tax reform. \u201cRepublicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s feud with Republican lawmakers hit a high-water mark this week when the president struck a deal with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to raise the debt ceiling, avert a government shutdown and provide relief funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf Coast last month.\u000a\u000aThe deal struck by Trump, which raised the debt ceiling and funds the government for three months, had been panned by Republican leaders, who appeared caught off guard by the president\u2019s bipartisan deal.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

aVPARIS \u2014 The big reform that\u2019s put an even bigger dent in Emmanuel Macron\u2019s popularity was finally unveiled Thursday.\u000a\u000aHis sweeping overhaul of labor rules aims to inject greater flexibility into the job market and kickstart hiring after decades of high unemployment.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with Le Point magazine, the French president described the controversial reform, which was negotiated in secret, as a \u201cCopernican revolution\u201d for French labor rules. However, his popularity has plummeted over the past month, partly due to controversy over the reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe said what we were going to do and the French voted for it,\u201d Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said while unveiling the decrees containing the reform.\u000a\u000aHere are the most important points from the reform plans. (The substance of the plans is subject to change by the government, and could potentially be blocked by France\u2019s Constitutional Court, which is due to review the decrees starting September 28.)\u000a\u000a1. More emphasis on in-house labor talks as opposed to sector-level discussions\u000a\u000aThis is a major change. Workers and employers would be free to negotiate agreements within the confines of an individual firm, as opposed to during sector-wide talks comprising dozens of firms that often have little connection to one another. In the case of a downturn, a company would be able to strike a rapid, \u201csimplified\u201d deal with a union or works council to change wages or working hours to better suit the new market conditions.\u000a\u000aThis is a move toward German- or Swedish-style labor negotiations, depriving formidable French unions such as the CGT of some of their power. What remains to be seen is exactly what terms can be negotiated in-house, and how the legal system responds to the change.\u000a\u000a2. A firm\u2019s global economic health can\u2019t be used to oppose plans to fire workers\u000a\u000aIn France, any plan to lay off multiple workers needs to be approved by a chamber of commerce. In the past, a judge could block layoff plans or penalize the firm by pointing out that its global operations were profitable and the dismissals were not justified. Under the new plans, judges could only refer to the firm\u2019s performance in France when deciding whether to approve a layoff plan. This is a major shift as global profitability was the central issue in many recent controversies over company shutdowns, including at ArcelorMittal\u2019s Florange steelworks in 2013.\u000a\u000a3. A set scale for damages in the event of wrongful dismissal\u000a\u000aThis one is guaranteed to anger unions. In the event of wrongful dismissal, a firm would have to pay damages according to a set scale starting at three months\u2019 salary for every two years of employment. At present, every professional sector has guidelines on wrongful dismissal damages, but these are notional. Most cases are handled in an arbitration process that can result in massive payments, a process that many firms find unpredictable. Companies have long demanded more clarity. As an olive branch to unions, the government is offering to increase minimum damages for dismissal.\u000a\u000a4. Red tape slashed for firms with more than 50 employees\u000a\u000aThis is sure to cause cheers in many boardrooms. Currently, when a company hires its 50th employee in France, it must comply with a long list of requirements, notably the nomination of workers\u2019 representatives and the setting up of a works council and a health and safety committee. Under Macron\u2019s reform plans, all three of these groups will be folded into a single structure, cutting down on costs. Separate health and safety committees will remain in high-risk sectors like nuclear power.\u000a\u000a5. Changes to short-term job contracts, but not to long-term ones\u000a\u000aThe terms of France\u2019s most common short-term job contract (the CDD) had been set by law, which determined its minimum length and how many times it could be renewed (a maximum of twice). The system is open to abuse, with firms routinely rehiring employees on short-term contracts after a hiatus to avoid the cost of giving the worker an ironclad, long-term contract (the CDI). If the decrees are approved, duration and renewal terms will be set at the level of the professional sector, not by national law. So for example, the newspaper industry could decide that the minimum duration for a short-term contract is 4 months, and it can be renewed 6 times.\u000a\u000aHowever, the government is making no change to the CDI contract. Its strong protections are often blamed for France\u2019s \u201cinsider-outsider\u201d labor system, under which some employees enjoy top-notch job security, while others struggle from one short-term contract to another. Bank loans and all forms of credit are heavily conditioned on the possession of a CDI job contract.

aVSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Sen. Dianne Feinstein has dominated California politics for more than a quarter of a century. But facing blistering criticism that she\u2019s out of touch with the progressive left following her recent comments about President Donald Trump and DACA, it\u2019s increasingly looking like the Democratic lawmaker will face a major primary challenge if she runs for a fifth full term.\u000a\u000aFeinstein, the oldest member of the Senate, has been the target of sustained liberal criticism since January. Her centrist brand of politics, skeptical view of single-payer health care and support for some of the president\u2019s earliest nominees have drawn the ire of progressives who have little tolerance for Feinstein\u2019s pragmatic approach in the Trump era.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAt times, the senator has been highly critical of Trump. But her recent suggestion that, given time, Trump \u201ccan be a good president\u201d \u2014 and her concession Tuesday that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program might be on shaky legal ground \u2014 have emboldened her critics and turned a spotlight on her reelection plans.\u000a\u000aBuzz in state political circles increasingly centers on one prospective Democratic challenger, Kevin de León of Los Angeles, the first Latino to hold the powerful position of state Senate president pro tempore in more than 120 years.\u000a\u000aDe León, the son of immigrants \u2014 his father was Chinese and Guatemalan, his mother Guatemalan \u2014 has joined forces with billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer to become a leading advocate on the issue of climate change. And, with his introduction of the California Values Act, also dubbed the Sanctuary State bill, he has assumed a leading role in the branding of California as the \u201cstate of resistance\u201d against Trump.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aDe León drew national notice last week when he took public umbrage after Feinstein\u2019s seemingly conciliatory remarks about Trump. His public rebuke, the toughest from any prominent state Democrat, was pointed: \u201cThis president has not shown any capacity to learn and proven he is not fit for office. It is the responsibility of Congress to hold him accountable \u2014 especially Democrats \u2014 not be complicit in his reckless behavior.\u201d\u000a\u000aAppearing Wednesday on CNN, de León again countered Feinstein \u2014 though not directly \u2014 forcefully asserting that over 100 legal scholars have said DACA is fully legal and constitutional.\u000a\u000aThose comments \u2014 and the implicit contrasts between the 50-year-old Los Angeles Democrat and the 84-year-old senator from San Francisco \u2014 caught the notice of California Democrats looking at the 2018 landscape.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he\u2019s looking for a place to go. He\u2019s got a lot of money,\u2019\u2019 notes Democratic strategist Katie Merrill, in a reference to de León\u2019s $2.8 million war chest, officially set up as a \u201cDe León for Lt. Governor 2018\u201d committee. That money couldn\u2019t be used for a federal campaign, she notes, but it provides a measure of de León\u2019s fundraising heft.\u000a\u000aCourtni Pugh, de León\u2019s political director, sought to tamp down any 2018 talk. \u201cSenator de León has his head down and is focused on California\u2019s Legislative business,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in an email responding to questions about a possible Senate run.\u000a\u000aStill, some de León supporters privately say that in recent days, the Senate president pro tem \u2014 once viewed as a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate \u2014 has gotten a groundswell of support from backers urging him to look beyond the Capitol dome in Sacramento. They say he may begin to assess some new opportunities later this month, but his first goal is delivering on key state issues like the sanctuary bill, a housing package and his 100-percent clean energy bill, in addition to parks and water bonds.\u000a\u000aMany Democrats say that whether it\u2019s de León or another up-and-coming Democrat, Feinstein will almost certainly have a race on her hands.\u000a\u000a\u201cI, frankly, will be surprised if she doesn\u2019t draw a challenger,\u2019\u2019 says Democratic strategist Garry South, who notes that in a state where the Republican Party has shrunk to just 25 percent of the electorate, California\u2019s \u201ctop two\u201d primary election format has completely changed the equation for Democratic Party upstarts hoping to take on a powerful senator like Feinstein.\u000a\u000aThe primary rules, which call for the top two finishers \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 to compete in the general election, mean that a viable Democratic candidate doesn\u2019t necessarily have to beat Feinstein in the June Senate primary. The challenger need only come in second place to end up in a November showdown with her, South notes.\u000a\u000aSouth says Feinstein\u2019s comments last week about Trump struck many California Democrats as a major misstep in a state where the party\u2019s progressive wing, as evidenced by de León, is increasingly muscular.\u000a\u000aTo progressives and millennials who are expected to become an energized voting bloc in a 2018 race, \u201cwaiting for Donald Trump to a be a good president is like leaving the landing lights on for Amelia Earhart,\u2019\u2019 he told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aBy sharpening the contrast with Feinstein, de León may be best positioned to take advantage of the rift.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe has nowhere to go. He\u2019s term-limited out, and he will have to hand over the gavel of the pro tem sometime next year,\u2019\u2019 South noted. With the 2018 June primary just nine months away, he says, \u201cit\u2019s too late to get into the governor\u2019s race unless you\u2019re Don Quixote.\u2019\u2019\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s because with an already-crowded Democratic gubernatorial field \u2014 where several candidates have already amassed millions of dollars \u2014 that door appears to be closing. Other statewide contests, including the lieutenant governor\u2019s race, are also quickly solidifying.\u000a\u000aThat leaves few statewide options for de León and other ambitious Democrats like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, all of whom have been mentioned as possible hopefuls should Feinstein choose not to run for reelection.\u000a\u000aFor some of those pols, the Senate race is a now-or-never move \u2014 because if Feinstein is reelected in 2018, it\u2019s six more years before the seat comes up again.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you\u2019re one of these younger aggressive, progressive Democrats who wants to find a place to land \u2014 and you think the U.S. Senate is a cushy spot \u2014 you almost have to be thinking of 2018,\u201d says South. \u201cTo allow her to be reelected with no Democratic competition means that even if you think you\u2019re a bright star \u2026 by the time 2024 rolls around, there will be some other bright people out there who are younger than you.\u2019\u2019\u000a\u000aMerrill, the Democratic strategist, says ambition alone won\u2019t be enough to overcome Feinstein\u2019s considerable advantages \u2014 and she\u2019s betting against a high-profile Democrat jumping in to counter her.\u000a\u000a\u201cFeinstein\u2019s polls show she enjoys over 50 percent approval among state voters, and nearly 100 percent name ID in the state,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cSo if you are a challenger, you\u2019ll have to raise $40 million to get there.\u201d\u000a\u000aSome of the senator\u2019s friends and longtime allies say Feinstein won\u2019t be surprised if she faces challengers. They insist that opponents won\u2019t be able to match the senator\u2019s experience and considerable Senate clout.\u000a\u000aAs the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and a formidable presence on the powerful Appropriations and Intelligence committees, Feinstein \u201chas the ability to get a lot of stuff done in California,\u2019\u2019 said former California Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, a longtime friend. \u201cShe is enormously respected, and very, very hardworking. \u2026 So selfishly, we should all be on our knees every night and pray she decides to run.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd, especially in these times, Tauscher added, many Democrats may want a steady hand on the tiller.\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t forget if there is some kind of action from the House on impeachment, it\u2019s the Senate that will serve as the jury,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why, out of respect for her responsibility, she is keeping her powder dry, because she could be a future juror.\u201d\u000a\u000aTauscher cautions that Feinstein has always maintained an uncanny instinct for political survival. \u201cShould she decide to run,\u2019\u2019 Tauscher insists, \u201cshe will run a tough race \u2014 and she\u2019ll run to win.\u201d

aVAs homicide rates climbed around the country in the 1980s and 1990s, dozens of police departments began to upend the way they patrolled inner-city neighborhoods. Officers started getting out of their cars and making the rounds on foot, talking to residents and looking for opportunities to prevent crime \u2014 not just respond to it after the fact. Called \u201ccommunity policing,\u201d the efforts coincided with drops in crime in some cities, making the approach seem like a great success.\u000a\u000aBut there is no evidence that lower crime rates had anything to do with community policing. An analysis based on 65 before-and-after assessments of community-oriented policing initiatives by a small group of criminologists found there was no statistically significant reduction in crime, or even in citizens\u2019 fear of crime, as a result of these programs.\u000a\u000aThe research by these criminologists, led by David Weisburd of George Mason University\u2019s Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy, has refined the way that policing strategies get evaluated, yielding a new perspective on the state of the art \u2014 and sometimes directly contradicting conventional wisdom.\u000a\u000aWeisburd is lead editor of a new book, What Works in Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation, which is the most comprehensive examination yet of policing strategies deployed by departments over the past two decades. Too often, the criminologists\u2019 research shows, policing initiatives are driven by shifts in local crime rates or by theories that seem to make intuitive sense \u2014 like putting cops in closer contact with the communities they serve \u2014 rather than by hard empirical evidence. As a result, American cities tend to alternate between a breathless search for silver bullets to stop violent crime, and a narrative of failure in which new strategies themselves are blamed for perpetuating urban bloodshed \u2014 even when those strategies haven\u2019t been given enough time to show results.\u000a\u000aThe good news, Weisburd says, is that the criminologists identified successful strategies to combat violent crime, especially gun crime, when properly deployed. By using more rigorous methods of evaluating programs, he explains, \u201cwe ended up with a strong body of evidence that crime prevention can work. And that\u2019s an important message.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne of the most effective policing methods, Weisburd and other researchers found, is pinpointed targeting by police of the most dangerous people and places in communities. It is also helpful, they found, when police or communities work to try to solve underlying social problems that can\u2019t be erased by heavy-handed policing. These approaches are the core of one of the most consistently successful programs, called focused deterrence, in which cops and social services groups sit down with gang members to steer them away from lives of violence, rather than simply put them in handcuffs. Started in Boston in 1995, the approach has since been used in dozens of cities, including current programs in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.\u000a\u000aOther policing strategies have shown promise, but have been discredited after spikes in urban gun violence pressure law enforcement officials and politicians to seek quick fixes. In Chicago, for instance, years of experimentation with aggressive seizures of illegal street guns and varieties of violence intervention under former Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy have been called into question by record-setting homicide totals and racial outrage over ugly police killings.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, the seemingly successful results of a crime-reduction policy can often lead to overly broad assumptions. Critiques of the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s cleanup of MacArthur Park, for instance, have credited trimming shrubs and picking up trash with a drop in muggings and other crimes.\u000a\u000aWeisburd\u2019s book and other major studies like it employ analytical tools called meta-analysis and systematic reviews \u2014 in essence, studies of studies that can compare results across thousands of individual evaluations to find significant impacts on crime rates. By taking a wide-angle view, researchers can discover sometimes-hidden patterns that aren\u2019t changed by one study or two. They are also insulated from the politically motivated interpretations that sometimes drive the conclusions taken from smaller, individual inquiries.\u000a\u000aThe impulse to declare a crime prevention strategy a success or failure based on a narrow examination can lead to bad public policy decisions, says Daniel Webster of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. Take gun seizures. When they\u2019re carried out as stop-and-frisk street sweeps, they can leave law-abiding citizens feeling as though the police are an occupying force. But that doesn\u2019t change what the research shows about the approach when it is carried out in the prescribed way: using data to target the specific blocks and even specific people to search. \u201cFocusing on gun offenders and their possession of guns is one of the most important things you can do for public safety in many communities,\u201d says Webster. \u201cWe\u2019ve largely forgotten that.\u201d\u000a\u000aOther prominent researchers have echoed Weisburd\u2019s findings about crime prevention programs. Among the most notable big-picture analyses are papers by Rutgers\u2019 Anthony Braga on policing, Harvard\u2019s Thomas Abt on gun-violence prevention, and Anthony Petrosino of the WestEd Justice & Prevention Research Center on violence prevention.\u000a\u000aThe overall picture can still look messy, with many research gaps and unanswered questions remaining. Gun control and mass shootings, for example, get no attention in Weisburd\u2019s book or in the other major studies mentioned here because there have not yet been enough smaller studies to form the basis for a larger analysis. Likewise, many specific programs and strategies \u2014 such as gunfire-detection systems like ShotSpotter \u2014 at this point remain unassessed by big-picture studies.\u000a\u000aBy combing through the latest crop of research, The Trace has devised the following report card on policing strategies aimed at reducing gun violence. That very specific language \u2014 policing strategies to curb gun violence \u2014 is key to understanding this score sheet, as we have excluded programs and strategies focusing on other kinds of crime or carried out by players other than the police. (One exception is the community-based violence intervention approach called Cure Violence, which we included because of how closely related it is to a similar crime reduction strategy.)\u000a\u000aAs the examples below show, some of the most well-known uses of certain programs can lead to ambiguous conclusions about whether a strategy works. But that is the point of the big-picture research: to go beyond single experiments to find the larger trends.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s what the new mega-studies can teach policymakers, law enforcement leaders, and the journalists who cover urban crime.\u000a\u000a[Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images]

aVFreshman Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has recently become the subject of much speculation about a potential 2020 presidential run. Several major news outlets have run feature-length profiles of Harris, and top Democratic donors are starting to coalesce around her as their preferred candidate to take on President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aBut not everyone on the progressive left is feeling Harris-fever, and if the senator wants to win the Democratic presidential primary in three years, she\u2019ll have to start making inroads with a growing grassroots movement that remains highly skeptical of Harris\u2019s progressive bona fides.\u000a\u000aNomiki Konst, a Bernie Sanders supporter who serves on the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Unity Commission had three words for Democrats interested in Harris as a candidate: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Democrats will not win until they address income inequality, no matter how they dress up their next candidate,\u201d Konst said. \u201cIf that candidate is in bed with Wall Street, you may as well lay a tombstone out for the Democratic Party now. Voters are smart; they can follow the money.\u201d\u000a\u000aKonst\u2019s skepticism about Harris\u2019s alleged ties to Wall Street and insufficient commitment to populist economic issues reflect a broader trend among the residents of Bernieland. In a recent New York Times profile of Harris, another high profile Sanders supporter, executive director of National Nurses United RoseAnn DeMoro dismissed Harris\u2019s prospects as a progressive 2020 contender, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s not on our radar.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cShe\u2019s one of the people the Democratic party is putting up,\u201d DeMoro told the Times. \u201cIn terms of where the progressives live, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any \u2018there\u2019 there.\u201d\u000a\u000aSen. Bernie Sanders with RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United. Source: Rich Pedroncelli/AP\u000a\u000aHarris\u2019s defenders immediately took issue with DeMoro\u2019s lack of enthusiasm.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen it comes to where progressives live, uh, which ones are she referring to? The white ones?\u201d Essence contributor Michael Arceneaux wrote, alluding to the long-standing criticism that the Bernie-wing of the party has failed to make inroads with minority voters. \u201cOK, but they don\u2019t make the party. See the results of the last primary.\u201d\u000a\u000aSince coming to Washington, Harris has engendered some progressive support by being a leading voice in the fight against Trump\u2019s agenda, earning praise from the left for her aggressive grilling of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees during the confirmation process.\u000a\u000aThere are reasons for the suspicions about Harris\u2019s fealty to big financial interests. Despite opposing the nomination of treasury secretary and former Wall Street titan Steve Mnuchin, in a previous life as California attorney general, Harris was criticized for essentially letting Mnuchin\u2019s bank off the hook during the foreclosure crisis.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, prosecutors in her office drafted a memo that claimed they had \u201cuncovered evidence suggestive of widespread misconduct\u201d at Mnuchin\u2019s OneWest Bank. According to the Intercept\u2019s David Dayen, who first reported the memo, those prosecutors recommended Harris file a civil enforcement action against the bank. Instead, Harris did nothing. Later, it was revealed that Harris was the only 2016 Democratic senate candidate to receive a donation from Mnuchin.\u000a\u000aU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Source: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\u000a\u000aBut as Dayen himself noted in his book Chain of Title, Harris does have a record of standing up for homeowners during her time as California attorney general. Specifically, Harris used her attorney general tenure to push back against the Obama administration during negotiations on a major settlement for homeowners and held out for a better deal.\u000a\u000aStill, some progressives fear that big money donors within the Democratic party will have considerable sway over Harris.\u000a\u000a\u201cShe is the preferred candidate of extremely wealthy and out-of-touch Democratic party donors,\u201d said Winnie Wong, co-founder of the group People for Bernie, which played a prominent role the grassroots movement behind Sanders in 2016. \u201cHer recent anointing is extremely telling. These donors will line her coffers ahead of 2020 and she will have the next two years to craft a message of broad appeal to a rapidly changing electorate.\u201d\u000a\u000aStill, organizers like Wong have signaled that there is still time for Harris to win over their side of the party in order to present a unified Democratic message in 2020.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf she wants to advance her political career, she will have to come out authentically and honestly in support of universal healthcare, free college, a federal $15 hour minimum wage, criminal justice reform and the expansion of social security programs,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAnything less than this means the party will continue to bleed voters.\u201d\u000a\u000aHarris has already come out supporting all five of those policies in one form or another. Whether or not that will be enough for her critics remains to be seen.\u000a\u000aAug. 1, 2017, 10:39 a.m.: This story has been updated.

aVLONDON \u2014 Never mind the fight between Brussels and London. A different Brexit battle has been playing out of public view within the British government ministry charged with delivering the U.K. out of the EU.\u000a\u000aThe talk of the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) is a \u201cschism\u201d between Brexit Secretary David Davis and his top official, Oliver Robbins, the department\u2019s permanent secretary. Their dispute is about style, substance and \u2014 of course \u2014 power.\u000a\u000aIn the months after the 2016 Brexit vote, the department struggled for solid footing, officials said. Critics in Brussels and London said it was too slow to clarify its negotiating position with Brussels. Behind the scenes, its top officials weren\u2019t on the same page.\u000a\u000aThen came the June snap election. Prime Minister Theresa May squandered her party\u2019s majority and subsequently lost her two chiefs of staff along with much of her authority over her Cabinet.\u000a\u000aBut the vote helped clarify matters at DExEU. The victor in this bureaucratic power struggle is Davis, not Robbins. And his apparent triumph puts in charge of the talks a politician more committed to Brexit than either Robbins or his champion, Prime Minister May.\u000a\u000aDavis and Robbins have opposing styles and little personal warmth.\u000a\u000aThe result is a more muscular, self-confident Department for Exiting the European Union which \u2014 despite the perception in Brussels of chaos in London \u2014 is asserting more control over Britain\u2019s divorce proceedings, said one former senior government official.\u000a\u000aThis article is based on interviews with half a dozen current and former government officials, most of whom didn\u2019t want to be named.\u000a\u000aOpposites that don\u2019t attract\u000a\u000aAt the start of the Brexit talks this spring, Robbins was most often mentioned in London or Brussels as the man who would run the Brexit show day to day. His dual roles as head of the Brexit department and May\u2019s chief EU adviser put him at the center of decision-making on Brexit.\u000a\u000aDavis was frequently frozen out of key decision-making, according to four current and former government insiders.\u000a\u000a\u201cRobbins had clashes with David Davis, undoubtedly,\u201d said one former government insider familiar with the two men. \u201cPart of the problem was that he tends to go and do stuff, not necessarily by reference to David, and that irritated him.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey had \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say an altercation \u2014 but David was very forthright with him and reminded him who\u2019s in charge of the department,\u201d the official added, saying that the incident occurred at the height of tensions in early 2017.\u000a\u000aDavis and Robbins have opposing styles and little personal warmth.\u000a\u000aRobbins is the consummate Whitehall official \u2014 meticulous and dispassionate \u2014 and \u201cextremely high caliber,\u201d according to one former official who has worked alongside him.\u000a\u000aDavis, though more analytical and measured than his \u201cBrexit bulldog\u201d caricature suggests, is more of a maverick, and, most importantly, a bullish and long-term supporter of Brexit. The two men have developed a functional working relationship, according to one official, but do not fraternize outside of work.\u000a\u000aThough some suggested tensions remain, the dynamic between the two men has improved in recent months, according to several officials.\u000a\u000aPrior to the arrival in April of Philip Rycroft as Robbins\u2019 No. 2 official, the extreme workload required of someone running a brand-new Whitehall department, managing a negotiating strategy and advising the prime minister, led Robbins to neglect his working relationship with Davis, another senior official said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat Robbins-May dynamic is a constant source of frustration for David Davis\u201d \u2014 A senior official\u000a\u000aRycroft has taken on much of the day-to-day running of the Brexit department, along with the highly-rated director general Sarah Healey \u2014 relieving some of the pressure on Robbins. Colleagues at the department are nevertheless fond of the permanent secretary, one official said, who takes a keen interest in ensuring his staff remains motivated in what the official characterized as a highly productive but high-stress department.\u000a\u000aRobbins has a longstanding relationship with May, having served with her at the Home Office. They are \u201cunbelievably close,\u201d a former colleague of them both said. An ex-official added: \u201cShe clearly trusts him, more so than some of the other senior Europe advisers, and other permanent secretaries. You can see it whenever they interact, she takes his steer on a lot of this stuff.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is this closeness that is the root of the schism with Davis.\u000a\u000aPrior to the election, there were \u201csignificant numbers of written advice items which went straight from Olly to the prime minister and weren\u2019t necessarily seen by David Davis beforehand,\u201d the ex-official said, adding that Davis was even frozen out of the early drafting of May\u2019s pivotal Lancaster House speech in January, in which the prime minister laid out her vision for Brexit.\u000a\u000aOne senior official said problems remain. \u201cOlly does things which DD isn\u2019t aware of,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat Robbins-May dynamic is a constant source of frustration for David Davis.\u201d\u000a\u000aJill Rutter, a former Whitehall official who is now a director at the Institute for Government think tank, said the tensions were built into Robbins\u2019 dual role. \u201cThe creation of a freestanding Brexit department always had a potential for tension and overload,\u201d she said. \u201cFor that structure to work needs absolute unity of purpose and trust between the PM and her Brexit secretary.\u201d\u000a\u000aResponding to allegations of tension between Davis and Robbins, a DExEU spokesman said, \u201cThe secretary of state and the permanent secretary are working closely together to deliver a Brexit deal that works in the best interests of the whole U.K.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth Robbins and Davis declined to comment.\u000a\u000aJune aftermath\u000a\u000aThe resignations of May\u2019s powerful chiefs of staffs, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, shortly after the election caused a significant change in the May/Davis/Robbins dynamic.\u000a\u000aRobbins was not in May\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d with Timothy and Hill, one former colleague said, but was firmly in \u201cthe next circle out.\u201d At the same time, the departure of \u201cthe chiefs,\u201d who kept an iron grip on government strategy and communications ,empowered cabinet ministers and government departments \u2014 not least Davis and DExEU.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo. 10 has had less of a leash on them since the election, and they have taken the opportunity,\u201d said the ex-official. \u201cThis is partly DD telling the department to do this.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavis has shored up his influence by strengthening his own long-standing political relationship with May. Though touted as a possible successor to the prime minister, he has sought to position himself as a scrupulous loyalist.\u000a\u000a\u201cOn the morning of 9th June, the day after the election, DD was in there being an adviser, trying to stake his position,\u201d the ex-official said. \u201cHe tried to place himself very firmly in the inner circle in the immediate post-election aftermath. Since, he has placed himself at the center of the negotiations and used the changed dynamic at No. 10, the prime minister\u2019s relative weakness at Cabinet, and the departure of Nick, to get more of a grip.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe must have been the first minister to speak to her that day,\u201d a current official said of Davis\u2019 alignment with May the day after the election.\u000a\u000aDavis\u2019 allies, nevertheless, speak of him as a serious leadership contender and point to that as the cause of the improved relationship but also a potential source of future tension.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe prime minister is personally weakened since the election. David Davis, personally, I would say, is in a strengthened position. I think that Robbins probably recognizes that shift in strength,\u201d said one senior MP and Davis ally.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not overlook the fact that Robbins is a highly, highly competent operator\u201d \u2014 Senior MP\u000a\u000aOne of the senior officials said that Robbins would not be thinking in terms of his own Whitehall future, but another suggested that the political change in fortunes may have affected him: \u201cOlly made a bad political choice. He tied his colors to May\u2019s mast and burned his bridges with Davis. He pinned everything on his relationship with Theresa May. If the prime minister is gone by October, what happens to Robbins?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe senior MP agreed that if May were to go, \u201ccertainly, Robbins\u2019 position would be weakened.\u201d\u000a\u000aMasters and servant\u000a\u000aThe upshot, one official said, is that Robbins is now much more clearly a servant of two masters than he was before.\u000a\u000aEvidence of Davis and the Brexit department\u2019s more assertive approach to Brexit, meanwhile, has been on show all summer, with the publication of a series of position papers, briefed to journalists, EU ambassadors and others on DExEU\u2019s terms.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously they went through Cabinet and were agreed by the people on the relevant cabinet committee,\u201d said the ex-official. \u201cBut the way that DExEU then went about briefing them and choosing when they were published, that was far more autonomous than would have been the case pre-election.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother current government official denied that the Brexit department\u2019s recent shift in tone and its more forthright communications strategy were consequences of a change in the political balance of power, insisting that Davis had been just as willing to assert himself prior to the election.\u000a\u000aOfficials also questioned whether the shifting power dynamics would substantially alter the U.K.\u2019s Brexit approach. May and Davis remain close allies and one ex-official said the disagreement between Davis and Robbins had been \u201cless about the substance and more about [Davis\u2019] role.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, for the future career trajectories of the two men at the heart of Brexit, the shifting balance of power could have major implications; much will depend on whether Robbins acknowledges that the scales could be tipping in Davis\u2019 favor.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou must not overlook the fact that Robbins is a highly, highly competent operator,\u201d the senior MP said. \u201cHe\u2019s tipped to be the next cabinet secretary [the head of the British civil service], or at least he was. You don\u2019t get into that position in the British civil service if you\u2019re not well capable of looking after yourself and assessing the political climate and trimming your position to suit it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think Olly is relatively safe,\u201d the MP added. \u201cBut to the extent that he has allied himself with the prime minister, that\u2019s obviously going to be a consideration. And if she does go, then it may well be the case that he goes too.\u201d

aVHere\u2019s What Happened the Last Time Jeff Sessions Got Aggressive on Gun Crime In his final year as U.S. Attorney, the new Justice Department boss dramatically increased firearms prosecutions. The majority of cases targeted non-violent offenders.\u000a\u000aThe marching orders came down from Washington: Boost prosecutions of federal gun cases, especially those involving drug dealers and gang members.\u000a\u000aIn Mobile, Alabama, the federal prosecutor charged with carrying out the directive, known as Operation Triggerlock, did so with zeal. In 1991, Jeff Sessions, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, prosecuted 31 gun cases \u2014 up from zero the year before. Over a three year span, Sessions\u2019s office would prosecute nearly every gun case referred to it.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis office was pretty aggressive,\u201d said Donald Partridge, who worked as a defense attorney in federal court in Mobile at the time. \u201cIt was my understanding that if there was any indication a gun was used, that they were gonna pursue it.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Sessions was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States. He assumes the post at a time when violent crime is significantly less prevalent than when he was a federal prosecutor \u2014 but when homicide, especially gun homicide, is on the increase in many major American cities. He serves a president who has sworn to restore \u201claw and order.\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the confirmation process, Sessions signaled that he intends to revive the tough-on-guns prosecutorial approach of his past. More gun charges \u2014 especially those that carry stiff, mandatory five-year sentences \u2014 will send a message to those who are pulling the trigger that they are best off leaving their guns at home, he has argued.\u000a\u000aStay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis.

Share on Facebook\u000a\u000aShare on Twitter\u000a\u000aShare via Email Close\u000a\u000a\u201cCriminals are most likely the kind of person that will shoot somebody when they go about their business,\u201d Sessions said during his confirmation hearing. \u201cAnd if those people are not carrying guns because they believe they might go to federal court, be sent to a federal jail for five years, perhaps they\u2019ll stop carrying those guns during that drug dealing and their other activities that are criminal. Fewer people get killed.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trace reviewed the 70 gun cases that then-U.S. Attorney Sessions brought against criminal defendants in his busiest year, 1993. The cases are more than a quarter-century old, and the implementation of any order from a Sessions-led Justice Department to prosecute more gun cases would be up to a new crop of federal prosecutors to implement. But the analysis shows how Sessions himself carried out an order of the type he has signaled he is likely to issue.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019s office was able to make lots of gun cases in a few short years, and some of those who were charged were exactly the type of offender that Sessions has said he wants to think twice before leaving home with a gun in their belt. But in most cases, gun charges were piggybacked on top of another type of charge, usually a drug violation, sometimes substantially lengthening what would have otherwise been a short sentence.\u000a\u000aA significant share of the cases involved so-called felon-in-possession: people with criminal records caught with a firearm. Other cases seemed to have involved federal lawyers picking through state records to identify people with criminal records fined for violating hunting ordinances.\u000a\u000aJim Burch, vice president for strategic initiatives at the Police Foundation, a nonprofit law-enforcement think tank, said taking \u201ca shotgun approach\u201d to gun prosecutions yields \u201can unsustainable level of incarceration\u201d \u2014 and would not effectively target or deter \u201cthe people committing or contributing to violent crime.\u201d\u000a\u000aOf the 70 gun cases that came out of Sessions\u2019s office in 1993, just 19 were tied to a clearly violent crime. Those cases carry the biggest penalty: a mandatory five-year sentence that must be served after completing the sentence for the underlying crimes. The charge functions as what lawyers call a \u201ctack-on\u201d that substantially increases prison time, or the sentence prosecutors can threaten in order to secure a guilty plea in cases that would have been prosecuted regardless.\u000a\u000aGerry Sanders, indicted September 23, 1993 in federal district court in Mobile for bank robbery, received an eight-year sentence \u2014 three for the robbery, five for using a gun. Marvin Osbey received a 10-year sentence for a 1993 carjacking and five more years for possession of a gun during the crime. David Hodge and Randy Powell, charged in an armed bank robbery in 1993, both pleaded guilty to gun charges, drawing five-year sentences, while dismissed the bank robbery charges. There is no record in the case dockets that any of the 19 men fired weapons during their crimes, actions that would have carried additional punishment.\u000a\u000aSessions also took frequent advantage of a 1986 law that allows prosecutors to add gun charges on top of already-stiff mandatory sentences for drug trafficking. In 1993, his office pursued 11 cases in which using a gun in a drug deal had a mandatory sentence of five years. If the defendant carried a gun in two transactions, even on the same day, prosecutors in a single case could charge that person as a \u201crepeat offender,\u201d with penalties from 25 years to life.\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019s office used this statute to increase the sentences of dealers accused of carrying weapons while trafficking dozens of kilograms of cocaine across state lines, against defendants accused of possessing gun while selling marijuana, and against defendants caught attempting to buy crack and found to have a weapon on them. Benny Ray Harness was sentenced to five years in November 1993 for carrying a gun during a drug transaction. He was originally also charged with attempt to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute but the drug charge was dropped when he took a plea deal.\u000a\u000aAt the time, prosecutors in Sessions\u2019s office drew notice for relying heavily on the testimony of informants who implicated others to reduce the long sentences they themselves faced. A 1999 PBS documentary, \u201cSnitch,\u201d focused largely on the use of informants by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Mobile under Sessions and his successor.\u000a\u000a\u201cOf all the places I\u2019ve been, I think that district was especially draconian in seeking high sentences and dragging a lot of people in that probably didn\u2019t need to be in federal court,\u201d said Alex Bunin, who became chief federal defender in the district in 1995, working on many cases still active from the early 1990s.\u000a\u000aBunin said many of gun cases prosecuted under Sessions would have been left in state courts in other districts, where sentences were generally more lenient.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny drug case where there was a gun, they would tack on a gun charge,\u201d Bunin said. \u201cThose made great stats and really jacked up the sentences.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of those convicted under Sessions in the early 1990s on drug and gun charges remain in prison today. One of them, Lawrence Powe, convicted in 1992 at age 26 for drug trafficking, was among the 1,715 offenders granted clemency by President Obama before leaving office. Powe, a father of four given a life sentence for selling crack cocaine (which was later reduced to 35 years), received two additional five year sentences \u2014 to run simultaneously \u2014 for \u201cuse\u201d of a gun. Those gun charges were based on claims by a confessed drug dealer who cooperated with Mobile police after he was arrested with crack and a gun in his car. The dealer told police that Powe gave him .38 caliber guns to use for protection while selling drugs.\u000a\u000aIn one of dozens of failed motions for a sentence reduction citing his unblemished disciplinary record in four federal institutions, Powe wrote in 2008 that he was having \u201csome fast fun and enjoying some fast money\u201d at the time, but was \u201cnot a murderer.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt least three cases were brought against those selling stolen or unregistered guns, federal charges that can be used to prosecute gun trafficking. (In his Attorney General confirmation hearings, Sessions promised to prioritize the \u201creduction of illegal interstate trafficking of firearms,\u201d despite the fact that there is no federal law that explicitly bans such activity.)\u000a\u000aThe gun cases most commonly prosecuted under Sessions came under a section of the 1968 Gun Control Act that bars convicted felons from possessing guns. According to current and former federal law-enforcement officials, these cases are generally seen by U.S. Attorneys\u2019 offices as too minor to spend much time on, but an easy way to boost their total number of gun prosecutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey tend to be on and off, like a spigot,\u201d said Arthur Madden, a longtime prosecutor in Mobile. \u201cYou can just do those forever, just taking cases from the state.\u201d\u000a\u000aSessions\u2019s office did not record prosecuting any cases in which felon-in-possession of a firearm was the lead charge between 1986 and 1990, records show. In 1993, it pursued cases against 25 defendants on felon-in-possession charges. Eighty percent of those defendants were were not accused of other crimes.\u000a\u000aLawyers in southern Alabama said those defendants were likely caught by federal officials reviewing state court records for infractions like hunting violations by people with felony records, and were then charged in federal court.\u000a\u000a\u201cATF would see if they had any felons in possession in the district,\u201d said E.T. Rolison, who spent 35 years as a senior prosecutor in the Southern District of Alabama before retiring in 2010. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the cases got the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe felon-in-possession cases were easy for prosecutors to find, but actual outcomes were mixed. Some of the defendants charged served four- or five-month sentences after plea deals. Others received sentences of three years or more and, in many cases, returned to prison after their release because of parole violations. For example, in August 1993, Gene Ware was sentenced to 37 months on felon-in-possession charges. He was paroled in 1996 on the conditions that he avoid firearms, drugs, and alcohol \u2014 but his parole was revoked the next year, and he was returned to prison for 24 months.\u000a\u000aSessions was hardly the only federal prosecutor making lots of gun cases in the early 1990s. But his office was more aggressive than most. From 1991 to 1993, his office prosecuted 90 percent of gun cases referred by law enforcement, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Between 1994 and 2004, the decade after Sessions had served as U.S. Attorney, his former office accepted 65 percent of such cases.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt was all stat driven,\u201d Rolison said. \u201cThere was nothing sinister about it, but when the Attorney General or the U.S. Attorney put an emphasis on something, they\u2019d pass it down to guys like me.\u201d\u000a\u000aRolison said the office prosecuted gun cases before 1991, but \u201conly started counting\u201d them \u2014 and increased the number of cases prosecuted \u2014 once Washington began pushing U.S. Attorneys for more firearm prosecutions in the early 1990s. (The current U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and the Department of Justice declined to comment.)\u000a\u000aThe federal gun statutes that federal prosecutors in Mobile wielded under Sessions remain on the books. Obama\u2019s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, instructed U.S. Attorneys to exercise discretion regarding how they prosecute gun cases, undoing guidance that required them to prosecute gun charges in federal court whenever possible.\u000a\u000aHolder specifically told federal prosecutors to generally avoid using charges that included a mandatory five-year sentence to pressure defendants to plead guilty. After that directive, such prosecutions fell. The total number of federal firearms-violations cases cases filed by U.S. prosecutors in fiscal year 2015 was 8,528, down from 11,067 in FY 2004, according to annual statistical reports issued by U.S. Attorney offices.\u000a\u000aSessions criticized Holder\u2019s efforts at the time. Now, as Attorney General, Sessions is tasked by President Trump with taking on \u201ccarnage\u201d in cities, and can push federal prosecutors to resume the kinds of prosecutions he himself carried out as a U.S. Attorney. Lawyers familiar with Sessions\u2019s record in Alabama have little doubt he will do so.\u000a\u000aLocal police groups and elected officials representing cities that are grappling with gun violence have said they\u2019d prefer the Justice Department provide more resources for local policing efforts. They\u2019d also welcome the help of federal prosecutors, so long as gun charges don\u2019t simply become a numbers game: A recent report from the Police Foundation concluded that \u201cthe greatest value in reducing violent crime may come from the strategic and realistic threat of federal prosecution, rather than the actual number of firearms prosecutions.\u201d\u000a\u000aMajor-city police chiefs, surveyed as part of the report, ranked more \u201cenforcement resources\u201d as the most important way the Justice Department can assist them in addressing crime.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe response to local violent crime problems must be based on the specific problem identified in the local area, not merely on what federal agencies have identified as national problems,\u201d the report said, warning against efforts that \u201ccause an undue strain on resources (e.g., mass incarceration).\u201d\u000a\u000aDaniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who worked as federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, said Sessions might move in the direction that law enforcement has asked for, and facilitate federal partnerships, like embedding FBI or ATF agents in local homicide units.\u000a\u000aRichman said it is uncertain what impact an increase in prosecutions like those Sessions pursued in Mobile would have on their own.\u000a\u000aGun prosecutions \u201ccan cover a range of people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are getting someone with a gun, and that\u2019s something, but the likely effect on violence is far from clear.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaura Ewing contributed to this report.

aVBelgian authorities are trying to stop cocaine smuggling in the port of Antwerp | Mark Renders/Getty Images Euro-press review Belgium\u2019s cocaine problem Macron\u2019s Greek visit, Hurricane Irma and British government squabbles on Europe\u2019s front pages.\u000a\u000aFrance\u000a\u000aFrench front pages focused on the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in France\u2019s overseas territories. At least 12 people died in the Caribbean and dozens were injured. The French islands of Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthélemy were particularly affected, according to the report. Le Figaro covered the French president\u2019s state visit to Greece Thursday on its front page. \u201cIn Athens, Emmanuel Macron wants to rebuild Europe,\u201d the paper wrote. Macron called for solidarity and for all EU countries to debate a new common European project.\u000a\u000aUnited Kingdom\u000a\u000aThe Guardian wrote about a call by Labour MP David Lammy to tackle the \u201cracial bias\u201d in the British criminal justice system. In a report, Lammy called for prosecutions against some black and minority ethnic suspects to be be deferred or dropped to help tackle the bias against them.\u000a\u000aBritish papers also covered Irma on their front pages, with the Times reporting the U.K. had been criticized for delays in sending help to affected islands. Pro-Remain Conservative MPs have urged Theresa May to sack a minister and a Treasury aide, who were accused of supporting a letter designed to lock the prime minister into a hard Brexit, the Times also reported.\u000a\u000aGermany\u000a\u000aDiesel summits will not solve the car emissions crisis, Baden-Württemberg\u2019s Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann said in an interview with FAZ. Die Welt reported on Germans losing their patience with Turkey, with a record 84 percent opposed to the country joining the EU in a Deutschlandtrend survey. In the same survey, 77 percent said they wanted the federal government to impose economic sanctions on Ankara.\u000a\u000aSecurity experts have found serious deficiencies in software to be used in Germany\u2019s upcoming federal election, Die Welt wrote. The software, which collects results in municipalities and transfers them to regional offices, was not secured by encryption or authentication. The manufacturer is working on updates, according to the report.\u000a\u000aBelgium\u000a\u000aBelgian police are preparing an action plan to tackle record-level cocaine smuggling in the port of Antwerp, according to De Standaard. Some 30,000 kilograms of cocaine was seized in 2016, up from just under 5,000 kilograms in 2013. Police fear the sharp increase in violent crime in Antwerp is linked to drug crime and cocaine trafficking.\u000a\u000aA survey published in Le Soir suggested the social-liberal Défi party will be the biggest winner from the ongoing political crisis in the French-speaking part of Belgium. Support for the party has doubled since March: If elections were held today, it would receive 18.4 percent of the vote, up from 9.3 percent. Défi leader Olivier Maingain emerged as the most popular politician in the capital. Support for the Socialists has fallen amid a series of scandals to 12.1 percent from 18.1 percent.

aVSeven years after the European Union got its own diplomatic service, it still punches below its economic weight in diplomatic terms \u2014 and foreign ministers will spend the next two days trying to fix that.\u000a\u000aMeeting in Estonia\u2019s capital Tallinn Thursday and Friday, they will brainstorm practical steps to enable the EU to talk with one voice on global issues where national diplomacy still trumps the collective.\u000a\u000aThe fundamental problem with the EU\u2019s foreign policy and the European External Action Service (EEAS) \u2014 the EU\u2019s foreign ministry and diplomatic corps \u2014 is that it lacks the capabilities that underpin traditional diplomacy. Sometimes, as with North Korea, it simply lacks any leverage. Elsewhere, such as Syria, the EU is the largest aid donor but has no collective military capability to impose its will \u2014 in the sometimes seemingly unlikely event it can agree on a policy.\u000a\u000aAfter an EU summit last December, German Chancellor Angela Merkel lamented that she and her EU colleagues \u201chave to stand there watching\u201d while Syria falls apart.\u000a\u000aThe veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, the first secretary-general of the EEAS, said ambiguous attitudes among the largest EU member countries are a major part of the problem. \u201cThey are interested in a European foreign policy but at the same time they want to retain national powers as much as possible,\u201d he said. This tends to hamper what the EU can do collectively.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the very start, the external service has never worked properly\u201d \u2014 EU diplomat\u000a\u000aOne recent example of a large European country pursuing its own agenda was the response to migration across the Mediterranean via Libya. Instead of agreeing an EU-wide approach, Italy struck a unilateral deal with local powers in Libya to stop people setting sail \u2014 then asked for European backing.\u000a\u000aThe EU can\u2019t even agree on an apparently simple question like what constitutes a country: For example, five countries in the EU (Greece, Romania, Spain, Slovakia and Cyprus) still don\u2019t recognize Kosovo as an independent state.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the very start, the external service has never worked properly,\u201d said an EU diplomat.\u000a\u000aThe general\u2019s dream\u000a\u000aA truly collective foreign policy has been an elusive goal for European federalists ever since French President General Charles De Gaulle suggested regular meetings of foreign ministers in 1959.\u000a\u000aFederica Mogherini, the current EU foreign policy chief, is well aware of the External Action Service\u2019s flaws. \u201cToday the service is still in its infancy and we\u2019re working hard to use all the tools provided by the treaties,\u201d she wrote two years ago, noting that the EEAS is more complex than a simple foreign service since \u201cit incorporates elements of a development and a defense ministry.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the Italian politician who put the self-reflection session on the agenda for this week\u2019s meeting in Tallinn. As it is an \u201cinformal\u201d gathering that doesn\u2019t need to take any grand decisions, she hopes EU ministers will feel free to float ideas or express grievances.\u000a\u000aThe EEAS, which became fully operational in January 2011, has its own staff and budget and Mogherini straddles both the European Commission, where she is a vice president, and the Council, where she chairs the Foreign Affairs Council, which gathers EU foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aThe primary function of the EEAS is to support the EU institutions and member countries, but since foreign policy remains a national prerogative, she is more of a coordinator than a minister.\u000a\u000aThat means Mogherini has little room for maneuver. \u201cIt\u2019s always very difficult because member states resent it when the High Representative [Mogherini\u2019s official title] and EEAS try to work on their own,\u201d said Vimont.\u000a\u000aIn any case, it is the capitals who are in the driving seat \u2014 and others understand that too.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s probably why, as an organization which tries to influence the way foreign policy is made, we focus our advocacy attention to the capitals because we know that, when it comes to foreign policy, it is still the capitals where key decisions are made,\u201d said Susi Dennison, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.\u000a\u000aIn this regard, not all voices are created equal \u2014 and EU member countries\u2019 historical and post-colonial ties around the world count for a lot. So the EU would be hesitant to pursue a bold line in Latin America, for example, without the blessing of Spain.\u000a\u000aAnother issue is that the EEAS remains \u201can understaffed, and under-resourced service,\u201d said Steven Blockmans, a professor of EU external relations law at the University of Amsterdam. But that is changing. Since the service\u2019s creation, \u201cit has shown that it can add value,\u201d said Blockmans. With 140 delegations around the globe, the EEAS has a network to rivals those of bigger European countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn many cases, individual member states\u2019 interests \u2026 are better served by working collectively through the EU at international level, rather than individually,\u201d said Blockmans.\u000a\u000aClosed-door debate\u000a\u000aBrussels tried to deflect expectations that the closed-door sessions in Tallinn would place the EEAS\u2019 performance under scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s not a discussion on the working methods of the EEAS but about the Foreign Affairs Council,\u201d said an EU official. Mogherini was eager to reflect on \u201cthe innovations\u201d she has introduced halfway through her term, said the official, who described the feedback from member countries as \u201cappreciation\u201d for the service\u2019s coordinating role.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t expect therefore discussions on the EEAS,\u201d said the official.\u000a\u000aHowever, one diplomat said the talks were certain to involve operational issues such as the lack of \u201ctimely distribution of documents from the external service to member states\u201d and, on the other hand, the need for member countries \u201cto indicate to the external service early enough when they have problems, instead of blocking the adoption of a common position at the last moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike many other policy areas, the Lisbon Treaty, which created the EEAS, requires unanimity on foreign policy.\u000a\u000aWith 28 member countries, last-minute changes of position by individual national delegations are hard to avoid, but they can be deeply frustrating for diplomats trying to hammer out a common EU position. One example of a last-minute intervention that nearly torpedoed an EU foreign policy move was a statement on Israel last year that had been agreed by EU officials and was due to be agreed by EU foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aJust ahead of the meeting, Greece wanted to reopen the text because it felt the wording would inflame relations with Israel. It then complained that it did not have enough time to examine the document to give it a final green light before approval by foreign ministers, a claim rejected by other diplomats.\u000a\u000aIn their private discussions, ministers are expected to look at fundamental questions about the role of the Foreign Affairs Council.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt European level, and also at national level, foreign policy is the prerogative of heads of state or heads of government,\u201d said Vimont, meaning that the real power lies with the European Council, made up of European heads of state and government. Foreign ministers, he argued, must \u201cadmit once and for all that the Foreign Affairs Council works under the tutorship and the instructions of the European Council.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile EU diplomats and officials may be able to make incremental changes to EU foreign policy and how it functions, they won\u2019t be able to change some fundamental issues that go against streamlined decision-making. Unlike many other policy areas, the Lisbon Treaty, which created the EEAS, requires unanimity on foreign policy. Changing that would require a surrender of power by national governments and a treaty change, making that option a virtual non-starter.

The first use of the exact phrase I managed to find is this: In 1817, John Fitzgerald Pennie\u2019s \u201cThe Varangian, or Masonic Honor,\u201d offered this dialogue of two servants working a large banquet hall filled with contriving earls and knights.6\u000a\u000aSecond servant: \u201cOh, could I but pry into these deep state secrets! I would give my very head to\u20147 Third servant: \u201cThus mayst, for aught \u2019tis worth.\u2026 Would I could pry into a venison pasty\u2026. I will see what cheer the buttery yields.\u201d8 Second servant: \u201cThen art thou come in right good time: there\u2019s glorious feasting here. But thou, dull fellow, hast no great regard for plots and state affairs.\u201d9 Third servant: \u201cNo; but I have for the sad state of my deserted bowels.\u201d10\u000a\u000aTrump might not have control of the deep state, but he does preside over a very sad state.11\u000a\u000aThe problem with the phrase \u201cdeep state\u201d is that it is used to suggest that dishonorable individuals are subverting the virtuous state for their private ambitions. A good Marxist, and even an intelligent liberal, however, knows that under capitalism, ambition is considered a virtue, not a vice, and that the whole point of government is to collectively organize subversion. What do you think the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d means? It\u2019s this public virtue/private vice false opposition that makes so much of the \u201cdeep state\u201d writing slide into, if not noxious Bilderberg anti-Semitism, then \u201cwe are a republic, not an empire\u201d idiocy.12\u000a\u000aBut the concept resonates, especially since the modern state is not just an instrument to execute elite ambition but a site of popular demands and class struggle. The private, organized backlash to those demands and struggles is often understood as a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy, and that understanding is more often than not correct. The Koch brothers know this, at least according to Jane Mayer\u2019s Dark Money. Kevin Ovenden tells me the term \u201cdeep state\u201d was regularly used to discuss Turkish politics in the 1990s, especially the secretive power exercised by the military, bureaucracy, and courts against democratic action.13 \u201cConspiracy, one is tempted to say, is the poor person\u2019s cognitive mapping in the postmodern age.\u201d \u2014Fredric Jameson\u000a\u000aOver the last few decades, with the concurrent rise of finance capitalism and the privatization of many facets of national security associated with what we call neoliberalism, \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies have grown. Some of them are nutty and only add to the fetish, as described (three years before 9/11) by Fredric Jameson: \u201cconspiracy, one is tempted to say, is the poor person\u2019s cognitive mapping in the postmodern age; it is a degraded figure of the total logic of late capital, a desperate attempt to represent the latter\u2019s system, whose failure is marked by its slippage into sheer theme and content.\u201d Slippage between theme and content seems like a nice way of describing the hope held by many liberals that a CIA program of domestic destabilization will save us all from Donald Trump.14\u000a\u000aBy my count, the current usage of \u201cdeep state,\u201d as it supposedly relates to Trump\u2019s troubles, entails three overlapping understandings: The first has to do with war, militarism, and intelligence, the secret institutions that have deep roots but were fused together in a powerful way under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama (Marc Ambinder\u2019s book, Deep State, along with this recent essay in Foreign Policy, are good guides); the second with private corporate power, especially associated with finance, the arms trade, and fossil fuels; and the third with the many embedded bureaucrats of the US government\u2019s many administrative agencies, who, we hope, are leading a passive resistance to Trump\u2019s program of privatization and deregulation. \u201cWhen the great lord passes the peasant bows deeply and silently farts\u201d\u2014and then tweets about it from a rogue NASA account.15 Ready to Fight Back? Sign Up For Take Action Now\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a fourth way the term is used, to refer to an almost hereditary covert caste, running from the men who in the early days of the Cold War set up the modern national security state to the elite who make up today\u2019s \u201cintelligence community.\u201d In 1964, Random House published the bestselling The Invisible Government, by journalists David Wise and Thomas Ross (here\u2019s the CIA\u2019s declassified review of the book, which takes exception to its thesis). More recently, Michael Glennon\u2019s National Security and Double Government updated the argument. Peter Dale Scott was the first, as far as I know, to use the phrase \u201cparapolitics\u201d and \u201cdeep politics\u201d to discuss what is now described as the deep state, and he\u2019s the author of numerous books on the dense connections between illegal drugs, covert action, and finance. I\u2019ve always been a bit agnostic about Scott\u2019s work, overwhelmed by the sheer detail, but then I remember that Iran-Contra really did happen. As Michael Parenti likes to point out, conspiracies do in fact exist, both in legal theory and in politics: Watergate, Iran-Contra, the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s/90s, \u201cdescribed by the Justice Department as \u2018a thousand conspiracies of fraud, theft, and bribery,\u2019 the greatest financial crime in history\u201d (that we know of).16\u000a\u000aMuch of the writing frames the question as Trump versus the Deep State, but even if we take the \u201cdeep state\u201d as a valid concept, surely it\u2019s not useful to think of the competing interests it represents as monolithic, as David Martin in an e-mail suggests. Big Oil and Wall Street might want deregulation and an opening to Russia. The euphemistically titled \u201cintelligence community\u201d wants a ramped-up war footing. High-tech wants increased trade. Trump, who presents as pure id wrapped in ambition motived by appetite, wants it all\u2014which makes him both potentially useful and inherently unstable, simultaneously a product and target of the deep state. In 1956, C. Wright Mills wrote that \u201cthe conception of the power elite and of its unity rests upon the corresponding developments and the coincidence of interests among economic, political, and military organizations.\u201d If nothing else, the \u201cTrump v. Deep State\u201d framings show that unity is long gone.17 \u201cThere is a great difference between locating conspiracies in history and saying that history is\u2026a conspiracy.\u201d \u2014Richard Hofstadter\u000a\u000aThe literature on the \u201cdeep state\u201d is overwhelming, and includes many of the books that were the production of the first generation of New Left investigative journalists, including those found in Mark Lombardi\u2019s library. Here\u2019s a very small starting bibliography, based on a Facebook survey. Apologies for omissions. Let\u2019s first, however, start with this caution by Richard Hofstadter, which Mills cites in The Power Elite : \u201cThere is a great difference between locating conspiracies in history and saying that history is, in effect, a conspiracy, between singling out those conspiratorial acts that do on occasion occur and weaving a vast fabric of social explanation out of nothing but skeins of evil plots.\u201d18\u000a\u000aDavid Talbot, The Devil\u2019s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America\u2019s Secret Government19\u000a\u000aJane Mayer, Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Radical Right20\u000a\u000aTom Engelhardt, Shadow Government: Surveillance, Secret Wars, and a Global Security State in a Single-Superpower World (Tom is the editor of the invaluable tomdispatch.com)21\u000a\u000aBruce Cumings, The Origins of the Korean War, Volume 2 (The historian Brad Simpson writes that the first 185 pages of the second volume of this book is terrific at explaining the onset of the Korean War.

aVSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy says he "will do whatever is needed without relinquishing anything, to prevent\u201d the Catalan independence referendum | Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP via Getty Images Mariano Rajoy on Catalonia: \u2018There won\u2019t be a referendum\u2019 Spain\u2019s PM warns Catalan officials not to \u2018underestimate the strength of Spanish democracy.\u2019\u000a\u000aMADRID \u2014 Mariano Rajoy on Thursday unleashed the full power of the Spanish legal system against Catalan leaders\u2019 plans to hold a binding referendum on independence on October 1.\u000a\u000aThe Spanish government went to the Constitutional Court to challenge the Catalan government\u2019s decision on Wednesday evening to call the vote.\u000a\u000aMadrid asked the court to provisionally suspend the referendum law approved by the Catalan parliament and all the measures taken by the Catalan cabinet, and to urge every member of the regional government, all the mayors in Catalonia and other officials to comply with the decision. The Constitutional Court has the power to force officials to comply with its decisions and can suspend them from office if they refuse to do so.\u000a\u000aLate Thursday, the Constitutional Court decided to proceed with the government\u2019s appeal, suspend the referendum bill and all related measures, and warn officials of their duty to comply with its decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere won\u2019t be a self-determination referendum,\u201d Rajoy told reporters. \u201cI will do whatever is needed, without relinquishing anything, to prevent it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe all decide together about what belongs to all of us, which is our country,\u201d he added, warning Catalan officials not to \u201cunderestimate the strength of Spanish democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Spain\u2019s public prosecutor announced he was launching criminal actions against the entire Catalan cabinet and regional lawmakers involved in processing the referendum bill. The prosecutor also urged the police to watch out for referendum-related activities, with local media reporting that a printer in Tarragona was raided on suspicion that ballot papers were being made.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the Catalan government led by Carles Puigdemont sent a letter to all city halls asking for help setting up the vote. Some mayors expressed support publicly despite a letter being sent by the Spanish government to all public servants in Catalonia warning them that the planned referendum is illegal and asking them to disregard Puigdemont\u2019s request for support.\u000a\u000aThe Catalan chamber on Thursday started to debate a law on a transition period following a successful independence vote. If approved, its legality would almost certainly be challenged by Madrid.

aVJust like that, he went from \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck\u201d to the president\u2019s pal \u201cChuck,\u201d and she went from an \u201cincompetent\u201d shepherd of House Democrats who has \u201cdone a terrible job\u201d to just \u201cNancy.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s how President Donald Trump was referring to the country\u2019s top Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, moments after striking a not-so-grand bargain with them that funds the government and raises its borrowing limit through mid-December.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe president has made clear he has little interest in leading the Republican Party \u2014 whether that means acting to defend its majorities or serving as its ideological ballast. He\u2019s insulted the GOP\u2019s previous presidential nominees and railed against lawmakers on whose reelection its congressional majorities depend.\u000a\u000aTrump tends to govern more by sentiment than by substance, and he likes Schumer and Pelosi more than House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have stomached him but never done a good job disguising the fact that he makes them nauseous.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the Republican leadership to keep thinking Donald Trump is on their team is like Charlie Brown letting Lucy hold the football,\u201d said Matthew Continetti, editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cHave people not been watching Donald Trump for two years?\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s thinking wasn\u2019t complicated. The administration had been pressing Congress to raise the debt ceiling for months and Republican leaders had promised to do so before the August recess, according to a senior administration official. The president was frustrated when that didn\u2019t happen and he wanted to strike a deal, even if it outraged the leaders of his own party.\u000a\u000aBut on the substance, his interests also aligned more with Chuck\u2019s and Nancy\u2019s than with Mitch\u2019s and Paul\u2019s. Trump wanted the debt ceiling raised, he wanted money sent to recently ravaged Texas, and he wanted Republicans focused on passing his tax-reform proposal. By clearing the deck of the first two\u2014the Senate voted 80-17 on Thursday in favor of raising the debt ceiling and sending $15 billion in hurricane relief to the Lone Star State \u2013 the president believes he\u2019s making it easier for Republicans to get a tax bill done.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

In the meantime, Democrats and Republicans alike are left wondering whether Wednesday\u2019s deal was a one-off or a signal of a longer-term strategy on the president\u2019s part.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s going to be calling Chuck Schumer names on Twitter in the next 10 days,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \u201cBut I think there\u2019s a chance. Maybe he sees some benefit to working with us a little bit more.\u201d\u000a\u000aOthers said that while bipartisan deal-making would ordinarily benefit the president, Trump\u2019s unpredictability may undermine the effectiveness of his negotiating power with his fellow Republicans. \u201cIt's impossible to know anything,\u201d said Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWith a normal president, I'd say it's a savvy move and a reversion to constitutional form\u2026But that's with a normal president. With this guy...who knows? Maybe tomorrow he'll blow up the whole thing.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s deal blindsided not just Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, who wanted to push the debt-ceiling fight 18 months down the road, beyond the midterm elections, but also his own treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who had put a six-month counteroffer on the table. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like it before,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said of Trump\u2019s attacks on GOP leaders and his decision to work with Democrats. \u201cI have no way of divining his motives. I\u2019m a pretty intelligent guy, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u000a\u000aA senior White House aide conceded that the president\u2019s relationship with Congress operates on a feedback loop \u2013 what happens in one conversation can affect all the others. In this case, a further erosion of trust between Trump and Republican leaders comes after the painful demise of efforts to repeal Obamacare\u2014which many on the Hill believe the president helped undermine by calling the House bill \u201cmean\u201d\u2014and just as Trump embarks on his next big legislative push.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf this means the beginning of a turn toward more cooperation with the Democrats, it could have enormous implications, although I don\u2019t know that the Democrats are really free to work with him and I don\u2019t know what they would really be trying to gain substantively from working with him,\u201d said Yuval Levin, the editor of the policy journal National Affairs.\u000a\u000aA number of House Democrats are furious about the deal, and several of them held an emergency meeting in the Capitol late last night to vent and discuss whether to vote against the Harvey aid package. Ultimately most House Democrats are expected to vote in favor of the package, as their Senate counterparts did Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe exclamation point on Wednesday\u2019s events was the president\u2019s appearance in North Dakota \u2013 an event ostensibly designed to pitch his tax plan, but which turned unexpectedly into a campaign rally of sorts for Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp. The president ushered the embattled senator, who is facing reelection in 2018, onstage during his speech. \u201cEverybody\u2019s saying, \u2018What\u2019s she doing up here?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what: Good woman.\u201d\u000a\u000aHeitkamp has also worked to ingratiate herself with Trump, calling Democratic resistance to the president \u201ca waste of my time\u201d and indicating she was eager to welcome Trump to North Dakota. An administration official said the president\u2019s praise was merely a pressure tactic \u2013 an attempt to win Heitkamp\u2019s support for the forthcoming tax-reform bill.\u000a\u000aBut now Trump may find he\u2019s got to go back to courting the Republican establishment, too. \u201cIn the end the president\u2019s going to have to work with the Republican leadership in the Congress to get his major items done,\u201d said South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t agreement with Democrats on some of these major issues.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe question is, at that point, whether Trump or Republican leaders will have the upper hand.\u000a\u000a

Carter also understood the value of hospitality. His New York restaurants The Waverly Inn and The Monkey Bar remain hotspots, and Vanity Fair\u2019s Oscars party and White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner afterparty have long been the hottest tickets in Los Angeles and D.C.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u2014The New York Times has an interview with Carter, including more on this \u201cthird act.\u201d \u201cHe has \u2018the rough architecture\u2019 of a future project in mind, perhaps involving new forms of storytelling, but he demurred on the details. \u2018I\u2019m not a big announcer,\u2019 Mr. Carter said, tortoiseshell glasses in hand. \u2018Best to fail quietly at the beginning of something rather than make grand pronouncements.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2014So who could replace him? There are a few names that have long been mentioned, most notably Janice Min, who is currently co-president of The Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, and who previously led US Weekly. New York magazine\u2019s Adam Moss and former Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles have also been mentioned.\u000a\u000a\u2014Then there is President Donald Trump. Carter has antagonized Trump since the 1980s, when, at Spy magazine, he referred to the then-real estate developer as a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian.\u201d That line remained a sore spot for Trump, who made Carter a regular target of his tweets over the years. Spy also memorably pranked Trump by sending checks with smaller and smaller donations to New York\u2019s wealthiest, to see who would bother cashing them. Trump cashed a check for 13 cents. After his election, Trump traveled to One World Trade Center, where he held court with Condé Nast executives, including Carter, who did not sound thrilled to be there.\u000a\u000a\u2014Carter and Vanity Fair even squeezed in one final joke, at Trump\u2019s expense. In the press release announcing his retirement, his biography included this line: \u201cIn 1986, he founded, with Kurt Andersen and Tom Phillips, Spy magazine, the satirical monthly whose voice, style, and design remain influential to this day, and whose articles played a large hand in fingering the era\u2019s villains and their shortcomings.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a** A message from Service Year Alliance: Hundreds of dinosaurs rallied at the Capitol to tell Congress to stop national service extinction.

aVIt looked just like a campaign launch, from the line winding around the Fellowship Chapel Church, to the tailgaters giving away hot dogs, to the 2,000 voters who eventually packed inside.\u000a\u000aBut when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) arrived, there were no waving signs. They were there to kick off the push for universal health care, with legislation queued up for September, and no expectation that the Republican-controlled Congress would pass it.\u000a\u000a\u201cEvery major country in the world, they\u2019ve already got it,\u201d said Conyers.\u000a\u000a\u201cMore and more people agree with us,\u201d said Sanders.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs Washington prepares for a month of spending deadlines, and as Republicans and business groups try to shift the conversation to tax reform, Sanders is trying to drive a discussion about single-payer health care \u2014 a debate that he admits would last for years before any legislative action.\u000a\u000aThe campaign will put the Senate\u2019s only democratic socialist in a unique position. Republicans have already begun attacking Democrats over \u201cgovernment-run health care,\u201d daring them to endorse Sanders\u2019s plan. On the left, activists inspired by Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential bid intend to browbeat Democrats who don\u2019t back Sanders\u2019s and Conyers\u2019s legislation.\u000a\u000a[Centrist Democrats begin pushing back against Bernie Sanders, liberal wing]\u000a\u000aIn an interview after his three-state Midwestern tour, Sanders said he was formulating an \u201cinside/outside strategy,\u201d attracting as much support as possible from his colleagues while expecting most of them to recoil. It would be up to activists to make single-payer politically possible for the holdouts.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, as the chair of the Senate Democrats\u2019 political outreach, he would continue to support colleagues in tough races, even if they rejected his bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cIs this a litmus test? No, you have to look at where candidates are on many issues,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cBut you\u2019re seeing more and more movement toward \u2018Medicare for All.\u2019 When the people are saying we need health care for everyone, as more and more Americans come on board, it will become politically possible.\u201d\u000a\u000aRepublicans, looking hungrily at a 2018 Senate map where 10 incumbent Democrats will compete in states won by Trump, were hoping for a litmus test. But in just two states, West Virginia and North Dakota, are incumbents being challenged by progressives in primaries. Neither challenger is being backed by Sanders.\u000a\u000aStill, as Sanders wove through Indiana, Ohio and Michigan, local conservatives mocked those states\u2019 Democratic senators, even those who didn\u2019t appear with Sanders.\u000a\u000aWhen Sanders stumped in Ohio\u2019s Scioto County, one of the places that had seen a tight presidential race in 2012 but delivered a landslide for Donald Trump in 2016, Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken pointed out that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) had frequently supported the idea of single-payer health care. (Brown did not appear at the event, though former governor Ted Strickland sat in the front row.)\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only place Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialist sales pitch will be welcomed today is in Senator Sherrod Brown\u2019s office,\u201d said Timken in a statement. \u201cScioto County voters rejected socialized health care and the job destroying economic policies of Sanders and Brown last year by overwhelmingly electing President Trump.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Web ads, Republicans and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC spent July and August attacking vulnerable-seeming Democrats on single-payer, frequently using the image of Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to argue that Trump-state Democrats had become extremists.\u000a\u000aSanders, who chose his Midwest event sites carefully, sees Republicans getting over their skis. In national polling, he\u2019s frequently viewed more favorably than either the president or the Democratic Party itself. Last week, in polls of the three Midwestern states won by Trump, NBC found Sanders\u2019s favorable rating at 58 percent in Michigan, 53 percent in Wisconsin, and 51 percent in Pennsylvania. In each state, the president\u2019s approval rating had tumbled below 40 percent.\u000a\u000aOn the merits of \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 itself, Sanders said that the \u201clandscape had changed\u201d as a result of the seven-month debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act: The concept of universal health care had grown more popular, while the market-based Republican replacements were undone, in large part, because of the unpopularity of reducing Medicaid rolls.\u000a\u000a\u201cPeople are saying \u2018the ACA did some good things, and the Republicans wanted to throw 22 million people off of it,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s an absurd idea to most people.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut single-payer was not going to start with clear partisan support. Sanders intends to release a single-payer bill in the Senate, a companion to Conyers\u2019s House Resolution 676, in the weeks after Labor Day.\u000a\u000a[In a swing district, a Democrat runs on (eventual) single-payer health care]\u000a\u000aSanders does not expect a majority of his Senate colleagues to endorse it, as a majority of House Democrats had in backing Conyers\u2019s bill. And he admits it would take work, perhaps years of it, to reframe single-payer health care as an aggregate cost-saver, instead of an expensive entitlement in any debate.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe pay-for is going to be a separate piece of legislation,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cIt will not be radically different from the proposal we introduced during the presidential campaign. It will exempt lower income people from making any payments at all. But people in the average middle class family, when they recognize they don\u2019t have to pay for private insurance anymore, are going to save tremendously.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Sanders\u2019s rejection of the \u201clitmus test\u201d hinted at where Democrats, pressured by their base, would be allowed to go. Few of the most vulnerable 2018 Democrats are expected to get behind his bill, but progressive groups have talked increasingly about \u201cMedicare for All\u201d becoming a do-or-die position.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur view is that within the Democratic Party, this is fast-emerging as a litmus test,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, the pollster for Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign, in an August interview with Politico.\u000a\u000aSanders, however, is allowing his colleagues plenty of room to maneuver \u2014 so long as they come out for expanding health insurance. He complimented Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who last week rolled out a proposal to allow anyone to buy into Medicaid if their states allowed it.\u000a\u000a\u201cBrian is doing good work,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cI think we need to have short-term solutions to the health-care crisis, while working toward Medicare for All. I would hope we could get some support for making more people eligible for Medicaid. We need to substantially lower the prices for prescription drugs. I\u2019d favor a public option, right now, and we\u2019re working on that in the [Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions] Committee.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe midterms will be one test; the 2020 presidential race will be another. Sanders, who has not ruled out a second presidential bid, suggested that whatever happened in 2018, it would be difficult \u2014 if advocates kept working at it \u2014 for any 2020 Democrats to back down from single-payer.\u000a\u000a\u201cCould people run? Sure,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cDo I think they can win without supporting single-payer? I\u2019m skeptical. Among the people who consider themselves progressive, who vote in the primaries, there\u2019s clearly movement toward Medicare for All.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead more at PowerPost

aVFifty-three percent of those polled said they hold either very or somewhat negative feelings toward Hillary Clinton, while 52 percent said the same of President Donald Trump. Trump hits new low in public opinion \u2014 but he's still beating Hillary Clinton\u000a\u000aThe number of Americans who say they hold positive views of President Donald Trump has dropped to its lowest point since his inauguration, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBut the survey offered Trump at least one potential bit of solace: He\u2019s still beating Hillary Clinton.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aJust 36 percent of those reached by pollsters said they have either very or somewhat positive feelings about Trump, 2 points lower than in the poll\u2019s June iteration. But at 36 percent, Trump still finished 6 points higher than Clinton, his 2016 Democratic opponent, about whom just 30 percent of respondents said they feel either very or somewhat positive.\u000a\u000aThe 2016 rivals were nearly deadlocked among those with negative feelings. Fifty-three percent of those polled said they hold either very or somewhat negative feelings toward Clinton, while 52 percent said the same of Trump.\u000a\u000aWhile the president has struggled at times through the early months of his presidency, feuding with members of his own party, fueling racial tensions and failing thus far to push through a major legislative victory, Clinton has mostly stayed quiet, aside from an occasional speaking engagement.\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

aVThink about how it\u2019ll look on TV, Barack Obama told Donald Trump. All those kids being rounded up \u2014 teenagers, good kids. It\u2019ll be all over cable news. Then he\u2019d have to come out full blast himself, Obama told Trump, according to an aide to the former president who recounted the exchange.\u000a\u000aThe two of them were sitting in the Oval Office barely 30 hours after their first conversation ever, when Obama called Trump to say, \u201cCongratulations, Mr. President-elect.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d gotten through, Obama told people afterward. But if not, and Trump still revoked protections for hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, it \u201cwould be something that would merit me speaking out,\u201d Obama promised at his final news conference.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThat moment arrived on Tuesday afternoon, and Obama issued a statement. It was the longest and most confrontational statement of his post-presidency. But it referred only to \u201cthe White House,\u201d not the president, or Trump. It called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals decision \u201ccontrary to our spirit, and to common sense\u201d and \u201cself-defeating,\u201d \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201ca political decision, and a moral question.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Obama won\u2019t be leading any rallies or doing any interviews. Just as he did during the Obamacare repeal fight, he\u2019s purposefully keeping quiet \u2014 even as his team was already quietly consulting on steps forward Tuesday with activists and strategists.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aObama can see just as well as everyone else that the most reliable predictor of what Trump will do as president is the opposite of what he said or did. He\u2019s decided the best play is to not give Trump any more to play off of than his successor already has.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are mindful of the dynamic that we\u2019re in \u2014 which is the risk of backlash is real, and so we don\u2019t want to give this administration an excuse to do the wrong thing, and we also don\u2019t want to give Congress an excuse to do nothing,\u201d said an Obama adviser involved with the deliberations on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aHis nine-paragraph statement \u2014 written in his Washington office on Tuesday and so much in Obama\u2019s voice that it even includes his \u201clet\u2019s be clear\u201d tic \u2014 there\u2019s nothing about what to put in a bill, only the principles at stake and the need to do something. Obama sees protecting Dreamers as a major part of his legacy, but he doesn\u2019t want Republicans to back away from a bill because they\u2019re supporting something that their base's favorite boogeyman wants.\u000a\u000aObama and his aides spent the past week bouncing between cynical dread and insistent optimism. Maybe Trump wouldn\u2019t really do it. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as bad as they thought.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat he wants to do and what the Dreamer community wants from him is to speak for them, show support for them, but never to do anything that would backfire and cause harm \u2014 and that\u2019s a very tricky line to walk,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, Obama\u2019s former White House communications director and currently an adviser to the Emerson Collective and Center for American Progress, who was involved in some of the discussions Tuesday.\u000a\u000aObama\u2019s statement included pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s stated rationale for rescinding DACA \u2014 \u201cthe previous administration\u2019s disrespect for the legislative process,\u201d as Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in making the announcement.\u000a\u000a"For years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill," to protect Dreamers, Obama wrote. "That bill never came."\u000a\u000aAccording to the people who helped Obama with the drafting, that was less defense and more about putting the responsibility on the House and Senate going forward. Making that point was \u201cimportant in the telling of how we got here,\u201d the Obama adviser said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the imperial Barack Obama presidency, it was the lack of action from Congress.\u201d\u000a\u000aObama and Trump haven\u2019t spoken since the former president got in the helicopter after the inauguration ceremony in January. Obama\u2019s office declined to comment on his conversation with Trump in November or the fact they haven't spoken since. The White House did not return a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDemocrats have been eager for more Obama almost since 12:01 on Jan. 20. On Tuesday, more calls for him went out, even before the statement.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need his voice more than ever in inspiring Americans to speak out about the American dream, and Dreamers,\u201d said New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, who is looking at suing Trump over the move. \u201cI do think it would be pivotal to this debate that we\u2019re having \u2014 especially in a broader debate on civil rights.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is such a critical moment, a critical opportunity to step into that role to speak up more,\u201d said Jonathan Paik, the Orange County director of the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium. \u201cHe has a platform that very few people have. \u2026 Will it eventually be enough? It\u2019s hard for me to say now. Would we like to see more? That\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see.\u201d\u000a\u000aObama has been having this debate at least monthly since he was still windsurfing in the Virgin Islands with Richard Branson on his January vacation. His statement on Trump's travel ban was purposefully attributed to a spokesman, so his own name technically wasn\u2019t on it. His statements on Obamacare and exiting the Paris climate accord didn\u2019t mention Trump by name.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been a post-presidency by subtweet, exemplified by his decision, in the hours after Trump\u2019s \u201cmany sides\u201d comment about the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, to scrap a statement his aides were discussing in favor of tweeting a Nelson Mandela quote. (The response, which included a photo of Obama greeting African-American and Caucasian toddlers, turned out to be the most "liked" tweet ever.)\u000a\u000aAs dismayed as he and his circle are by Trump\u2019s decisions, Obama dwells on his role in history, from his obligations to stay out of the fray as a former president to his perennial insistence on taking the long view over day-to-day flare-ups. Everything he does now, according to people close to him, he thinks of as in some way shaping what\u2019s likely to be decades of a post-presidency to come.\u000a\u000aThat means always be cautious about how far he goes, leaving room to ratchet up what he says in case of what he considers a true crisis. He gets only one chance to take on Trump directly for the first time \u2014 or, if he ever feels the need, to say something more significant about Trump\u2019s fitness for office, as many wanted him to in the wake of Charlottesville.\u000a\u000a\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect that this is the last you\u2019ll hear from him,\u201d Palmieri said, \u201cbut you should always expect that you\u2019re only going to hear from him when he\u2019s certain that he has a productive role to play.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s leaving it to others for now.\u000a\u000aDuring August, Organizing for Action did a \u201cDefend DACA\u201d day of action in a dozen states. On Tuesday, the group, initially formed to advocate for Obama's agenda, set up a new online call tool to flood the offices of members of Congress demanding support for Dreamers legislation. OFA has been riling up supporters since an immigration-focused call last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s in Trump\u2019s interests for Barack Obama to be the foil,\u201d said the Obama adviser. \u201cBut it\u2019s in nobody else\u2019s.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVPrime Minister Theresa May and President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani at Downing Street | Pool photo by Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA Tajani: Brexit phase 1 might not be over till Christmas The European Parliament president sees little in the way of \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 but plenty of \u2018foggy proposals.\u2019\u000a\u000aIf it were up to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, Britain would have to wait until nearly Christmas to start discussing its future relationship with the EU.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with POLITICO, Tajani said he would formally propose to senior MEPs on Thursday postponing until December the European Council\u2019s assessment of whether there has been \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the first phase of Brexit negotiations. The decision is currently expected in October.\u000a\u000aThe EU27 insists there must be sufficient progress on the main divorce terms, including citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement, before moving to a second phase of negotiations focused on the future relationship with the U.K. In May, leaders said they would issue a verdict at a summit on October 19-20.\u000a\u000aBut, speaking over lunch of tartines and fruit in his office on the ninth floor of the Parliament building, the Italian conservative politician said it was clear to him the U.K. is not yet ready for the next phase.\u000a\u000aThe next regular summit after the October meeting is scheduled for December 14-15. That means that even if the Council judges \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been achieved, the second phase of talks would likely not start until after the Christmas and New Year holiday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have three irrevocable priorities which are: rights for three-and-a-half million EU citizens living in the U.K.; the payment of what the EU deserves \u2014 not a euro more nor a euro less; third point, the Good Friday Agreement, that has to give us a positive solution for the border between Ulster and the Republic of Ireland,\u201d Tajani said in the interview, which was in Italian.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce we have reached an agreement on these three points, we can talk about the future. Without an agreement on this, we cannot talk about the future. So far we have noted that no concrete proposals have arrived, only very foggy proposals,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aA delay, Tajani said, would not necessarily be \u201ca tragedy,\u201d but London had more to lose. \u201cThe Brits are the ones that will be mostly affected by it.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Buying time\u2019\u000a\u000aTajani, a former journalist who was a spokesman for Silvio Berlusconi when he was prime minister, accused U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s negotiators of stalling for domestic political reasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do realize we are at the gates of the Conservative Party congress and therefore they are trying to buy time,\u201d Tajani said. \u201cBut we cannot afford to delay too much.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile some EU officials want discussions of the bloc\u2019s next multi-year financial plan to be delayed because of uncertainty over Brexit and the potential revenue shortfall caused by the U.K.\u2019s departure, Tajani said he wanted the long-term financial plan settled on schedule.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the Parliament must approve any final withdrawal agreement with the U.K., and its Brexit Steering Committee this week issued a report on citizens\u2019 rights that showed negotiators had a long way to go. MEPs on the steering committee said the U.K. was not offering sufficient protection and certainties to EU citizens living in Britain, while creating a tangle of unnecessary red tape.\u000a\u000aTajani made it clear that he was keenly aware of the powers that the European Parliament wields over the Brexit process, and he believed the British were similarly aware.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Parliament is fundamental, because if we vote no, it\u2019s no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can block everything and they know it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Parliament plans to issue a resolution in early October expressing its own view on whether sufficient progress has been reached. That resolution is still being drafted but Tajani citizens\u2019 rights would be one area of focus.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Tajani said he is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, whom he knows well from their time as European commissioners (Tajani held the transport and industry portfolios).\u000a\u000aIn the interview, Tajani confirmed he had invited May to address the European Parliament but there was no firm answer yet from No. 10 Downing Street.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor sure she will not come before the Conservative congress, but I invited her before the elections, and she did not exclude the possibility of actually coming, \u201d said Tajani, who sees security as an area where maintaining close cooperation with Britain is vital.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we received the first letter from May I said immediately we could not mix up Brexit with the fight against terrorism, because the latter is linked with the lives of human beings and has nothing to do with the U.K. leaving,\u201d he said, adding that the EU should keep sharing informations with Britain as it does with other allies in the fight against terror.

aVNewly minted Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in St. Louis, the latest stop on his tour to promote his muscular solution to what he called the \u201cdangerous new trend\u201d of the rising national violent crime rate. Addressing a crowd of more than 200 federal and local law enforcement officials at the city\u2019s towering federal courthouse in late March, he vowed to \u201cuse every lawful tool we have to get the most dangerous offenders off America\u2019s streets.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Trump Justice Department has pushed a variety of strategies for reducing violent crime. But the tool that Sessions prefers, the one he calls the \u201cexcellent model,\u201d is to steer more gun-crime cases to federal court, where offenders face an average of six years in prison, compared with the lighter punishments that can result from state convictions\u2014in Missouri, for instance, gun offenders charged under state laws generally get probation. Sessions has instructed his U.S. attorneys to step up their gun-case loads, and they are heeding his mandate: In the second quarter of this year, federal firearms prosecutions jumped 23 percent over the same period in 2016.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn his St. Louis speech, Sessions praised the city\u2019s U.S. attorney\u2019s office for its aggressive pursuit of gun-law violators, framing its work as the first half of a tidy formula.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe more of them we put in jail,\u201d he said, \u201cthe fewer murders we will have.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Sessions is dramatically overselling the effectiveness of his prosecution-heavy prescription, those who study gun violence say. Researchers, in fact, long ago concluded that the long prison sentences and elevated incarceration rates that result from increasing federal prosecutions have scant influence on violent crime rates. And St. Louis is a signal example of why Sessions\u2019 strategy does not work as he promises.\u000a\u000aNo other city has already tried harder and longer to do exactly what Sessions is pushing for nationwide. Since the 1990s, the St. Louis-based Eastern District of Missouri has remained in the top 10 federal court districts for per capita gun prosecution rates, according to data from Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). In more recent years, the St. Louis office has only increased its intake of gun cases, leading the nation in 2016.\u000a\u000aThis story was co-published with The Trace, an independent nonprofit news organization that covers gun issues.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, St. Louis\u2019 rates of homicide and serious crimes of all types are the worst in the country, and have been stuck at or near the top of that dubious list for at least 20 years. The city recorded 188 homicides in each of the past two years\u2014a two-decade high. During the first six months of 2017, murders kept pace with those brutal levels. Nonfatal shootings were up an alarming 22 percent.\u000a\u000aIf St. Louis shows why Sessions\u2019 approach to gun violence is destined to fail, what is a more effective role for federal authorities to play in reducing violent crime? Public safety scholars say that it starts with recognizing that no two cities\u2019 crime problems are exactly alike. The next step is to create a menu of interventions tailored to meet local needs\u2014and support them with reliable funding.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt the end of the day, you need a balanced, evidence-informed strategy that is not just about a program or two,\u201d says Thomas Abt of Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, who formerly served as New York state\u2019s head of public safety and was chief of staff in the grant-funding arm of the Obama Justice Department. \u201cIt\u2019s about how multiple programs interact to produce a cumulative effect.\u201d That argues in favor of federal officials as researchers, advisers and funders\u2014not just enforcers. Says Abt: \u201cWe should leverage the soft, supportive power of the federal government a bit more, and the hard power a bit less.\u201d\u000a\u000aA few miles from where Sessions delivered his March speech, a soldier turned social worker named James Clark runs an anti-violence program that would be grateful for whatever federal support it can get. His organization, Better Family Life, practices a form of intervention that multiple studies have shown can work to reduce bloodshed if properly implemented.\u000a\u000aFor the better part of two years, Clark has tried in vain to raise the money to hire dozens more outreach workers to counsel young men against resolving disputes with lethal force. If the federal government were serious about reducing homicides and assaults, he argues, it would deploy personnel to spend time understanding the dynamics of violent crime at the ground level, rather than impose solutions \u201cfrom the perspective of a conference room.\u201d\u000a\u000aTop: James Clark, from left to right, vice president for community outreach for the nonprofit Better Family Life, speaks to Errion Stallings, 17, and Travonn Bush, 17, in the Wells Goodfellow neighborhood in St. Louis.

Bottom right: Clark speaks to residents during a Wells Goodfellow neighborhood meeting on August 19. | Whitney Curtis for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aClark doesn\u2019t foresee that happening. Under the Trump administration, Justice Department and congressional budget cutters have done their best to whack funding for effective violence-reduction programs in their respective spending proposals, and there\u2019s no sign people on the ground will change their minds.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo take a deeper dive, you have to go places that most people won\u2019t feel comfortable going,\u201d Clark says. \u201cYou have to talk to people that most people don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIn late 2012, gun violence in St. Louis had local officials feeling overwhelmed. Shootings had spiked over the summer, capped by the murder of a former St. Louis University volleyball player visiting campus for an alumni game. To try to quell the carnage, city officials turned to federal authorities for a special show of force.\u000a\u000aOut of their call for help came a pair of sting operations by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bureau launched the push in secret in January 2013. Under the code name Operation Hustle City, 80 federal agents swooped into the city to take illegal guns and their carriers off the streets. In one sting, undercover ATF agents opened a tattoo parlor called Ink Pimp, where agents posing as outlaw bikers put out the word that they would pay cash for black-market guns. The phony deals netted charges against 25 people and the seizure of 129 firearms and small amounts of drugs. Another team recruited people willing to stage a violent robbery of a fictitious drug stash house. That led to 40 more arrests.\u000a\u000aAt the operation\u2019s grand-finale news conference in July 2013, the weapons haul was laid out on a table for the obligatory photo op. Then-Mayor Francis Slay took his turn at the microphone to proclaim mission accomplished. \u201cIt will reduce gun violence,\u201d Slay said. \u201cIt will make us safer.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not how others saw things. While all two-dozen Ink Pimp arrests resulted in convictions and prison terms of one to 12 years, a highly critical report by the Justice Department\u2019s own inspector general concluded last fall that Operation Hustle City generated mostly insignificant prosecutions and no valuable informants or intelligence. The IG\u2019s office called the operation and others like it around the country poorly managed, thanks to ATF\u2019s \u201clack of specialized training, poor planning, and lack of oversight.\u201d The fake Ink Pimp shop had cost $260,000 to run, but ATF agents were so heedless that they failed to notice an after-school program just one block away from where the ersatz tattoo parlor was luring gun-toting felons.\u000a\u000aLeft: The former location of Ink Pimp, a storefront where ATF agents paid cash for black-market guns. Right: Some of the guns that were seized from the operation. | FBI Photos\u000a\u000aAs a violence-reduction tool, Operation Hustle City failed miserably. Citywide, shootings have since surged. Ink Pimp\u2019s neighborhood, in particular, ranked among the nation\u2019s worst for concentrated violence in 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe clients I had who were swept up in those things were people who I would say in several cases would not have been involved in what they did but for the possibility of a safe sale to these yahoos in this phony store, or being persuaded to engage in this phony robbery of a stash house,\u201d says Michael Dwyer, an assistant federal public defender who represented people nabbed in the stings. \u201cBecause these yahoos were promising them easy money.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know of a single credible evaluation that shows us that sting operations bring down rates of violent crime and help keep them down,\u201d says Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis.\u000a\u000aThat reality has not dampened federal law enforcement\u2019s long-running enthusiasm for short-term operations like Hustle City\u2014nor for efforts to funnel more gun cases into federal courts. In St. Louis, local authorities have been happy to cooperate.\u000a\u000aLt. Col. Jerry Leyshock, a 37-year veteran of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, says the department likes having an alternative to state courts, which local police complain can be too lenient. \u201cSometimes we do a little shopping,\u201d he says, to see \u201cwhere we can get the best bang for our buck.\u201d TRAC data show where its shopping frequently leads: In St. Louis, city police and prosecutors refer gun defendants for federal charges at a rate seven times the national average.\u000a\u000aIn fiscal year 2015, the Eastern District of Missouri took on 228 gun cases, good for 78 per 1 million people, the third-highest rate among the nation\u2019s 94 federal court districts. In 2016, prosecutions rose by another third to 301, or 103 per 1 million residents. The rate put the district in a tie for first with the district based in Mobile, Alabama\u2014not coincidentally, the district where Jeff Sessions served as U.S. attorney in the 1990s and adopted a forerunner to the hard-nosed policy he is now using as AG .\u000a\u000aSt. Louis is a lot like other cities, however, in one important respect: It does little to target the sources of the guns. Busts of scofflaw stores are rare. In the Eastern District of Missouri, federal prosecutors tend not to pursue charges against straw purchasers\u2014people who buy firearms on behalf of someone whose criminal background would make them ineligible\u2014because they regard the cases referred to them by the ATF as too trivial, says Richard Callahan, the former U.S. attorney in Missouri\u2019s Eastern District. \u201cThere was certainly never any source of supply of guns to the bad guys that was ever brought to our attention.\u201d He adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think they existed\u201d in eastern Missouri, where he and others blame state gun deregulation and a rash of gun thefts for keeping the criminal market well stocked.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know of a single credible evaluation that shows us that sting operations bring down rates of violent crime and help keep them down,\u201d says Richard Rosenfeld, above, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. | Whitney Curtis for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aRather than tackle the supply side, federal gun prosecutions tend to focus on unlawful possessors or users. Proponents see the cases as having a multiplier effect: For every individual offender sent away to prison, many more will be dissuaded from illegally carrying a firearm. The more cases you prosecute and the longer their sentences, the theory goes, the fewer illegal gun users at large and the safer the streets.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a model that came into vogue in the crack cocaine and gang crime waves of the 1980s and found its clearest expression in an initiative called Project Exile. Launched in 1997, Project Exile shifted gun crimes to federal court to take advantage of its mandatory minimum sentences. It was revived in last year\u2019s presidential campaign via a Trump position paper that called for the restoration and expansion of the \u201ctremendous\u201d program and offered a preview of the promise Sessions has been making since his confirmation hearings: \u201cWhen we do, crime will go down and our cities and communities will be safer places to live.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile one 2005 report (authored by Rosenfeld, as it happened) found Exile worked in its pilot city of Richmond, Virginia, other research has generally panned it as ineffective at reducing violence. By teasing out the possible multiple causes of drops in homicides, one study concluded that \u201calmost all of the observed decrease probably would have occurred even in the absence of the program.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe problem with leaning on lengthy federal sentences to scare potential violators straight is that it uses the wrong lever, according to the Justice Department\u2019s own research arm, the National Institute of Justice. As the institute notes in a 2016 summary, it\u2019s \u201cthe certainty of being caught\u201d\u2014not the severity of the possible sentence\u2014that can have a strong deterrent effect on potential criminals.\u000a\u000aBut as local police departments well know, illegal gun charges are notoriously hard to make stick. In state courts in New York City, for instance, the rate has hovered around 50 percent. Cases fall apart for a number of reasons: The heightened danger officers perceive when a Glock is discovered poking out from under a waistband during an already tense stop can lead to imprecise evidence handling. In court, defense attorneys succeed in raising doubts about the true ownership of street guns that may be shared by a group of friends. Thanks to a Missouri law that allows guns in cars without a permit, 4 out of 10 gun arrests in St. Louis, according to a recent study, never resulted in charges at all.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s one more reason why it doesn\u2019t make sense to expect federal firearms prosecutions to reduce gun violence: The strategy misunderstands the nature of most shootings.\u000a\u000aSelling his approach, Sessions has linked gun crime to gangs and drug trafficking, arguing, \u201cIf you want to collect a drug debt, you can\u2019t, and don\u2019t, file a lawsuit in court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun.\u201d But city-level law enforcement data suggest that in homicides where a primary motive can be determined, drugs drive fewer killings than more prosaic arguments, fights and personal disputes. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of homicide data from five cities further found that even among gang killings specifically, \u201chomicides commonly were not preceded by drug trade and use or with other crimes in progress.\u201d\u000a\u000aLt. Col. Jerry Leyshock, a 37-year veteran of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, has found that most murders he has looked at were over \u201cthe most senseless things you\u2019ve ever heard of\u201d\u2014minor personal disagreements that culminated in shootings. | Whitney Curtis for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aA federally funded report on violent crime in St. Louis released this March reached a similar conclusion about the city\u2019s gun violence, determining that personal conflicts among young black men make up a vastly disproportionate share of shootings.\u000a\u000aIn his police work, Jerry Leyshock has observed the same phenomenon. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many murders that I looked at last year, when we finally just got to the meat of it, it had nothing to do with gangs, dope, or anything,\u201d he says. Instead, \u201cit was over the most senseless things you\u2019ve ever heard of.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aThere should be no mystery about what Washington could do to more productively help bring down shootings in St. Louis. It\u2019s all spelled out in the same March white paper that traced most of the city\u2019s violence not to drug syndicate shootouts, but interpersonal beefs. The report was produced by the federal Office of Justice Programs\u2019 Diagnostic Center, with Rosenfeld among the contributing scholars, and included a list of violence-reduction strategies that consistently prove most effective.\u000a\u000aOne of those, called \u201chot spots policing,\u201d uses data-driven hit lists to search for contraband firearms or known shooters in an area where gun violence is concentrating. In another, \u201cfocused deterrence\u201d (often referred to as the Ceasefire method), a team of law enforcement and social workers summons likely shooters to sit-downs. At these call-ins, the suspects are presented with a choice between a swift arrest, if any more shootings occur, or counseling and job training to put their lives on a safer track.\u000a\u000aSt. Louis has actually already tried these tactics, too. Much of the funding for them came from the $1.7 million the city took in over a nine-year period through Project Safe Neighborhoods, an initiative born under George W. Bush that allowed cities to funnel the dollars toward either violence intervention programs or the hammer of stepped-up prosecutions. When the Obama Justice Department unveiled the Violence Reduction Network, offering 15 high-crime cities free consulting on best practices, St. Louis was a grateful participant in that new initiative as well.\u000a\u000aOn the front lines in St. Louis, where financial constraints have left the police department operating 100 officers below its authorized force, officials are just grateful for the carousel of federal interventions. \u201cI say thank goodness for all of it,\u201d Leyshock says. \u201cBecause if we didn\u2019t have that, how much worse would my problem be?\u201d\u000a\u000aBut paradoxically, DOJ itself, through the Office of Justice Programs\u2019 report, has a cutting assessment of why the different forms of federal assistance directed toward St. Louis haven\u2019t made a bigger dent in its gun violence problem. The city\u2019s crime-prevention efforts, the report concluded, have been hampered by a \u201clack of follow-up and sustained action.\u201d\u000a\u000aCities like St. Louis desperately need federal crime-fighting support that is both customized and consistent, says criminologist David Kennedy of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. What they get instead is programs that ebb and flow as priorities change with new administrations and budget crises come and go. Most of the strategies that St. Louis has experimented with ran for short intervals, say two years, and were limited to a handful of neighborhoods.\u000a\u000a\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d says Kennedy, simply, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been that much federal support for the things that work.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor all the free pointers St. Louis picked up through the Obama-era Violence Reduction Network (to be continued by the Trump administration under a new moniker, the National Public Safety Partnership), that program provided only technical assistance, and did not include money for local law enforcement to implement the tactics it recommends.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s 2018 spending blueprint called for reviving the moribund Project Safe Neighborhoods with a robust $70 million budget\u2014but House appropriators chopped that down to $10 million. The Trump budget, meanwhile, is less generous with a line item that has paid for focused deterrence programs. The spending would be eliminated, for a savings of $8 million.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aJames Clark believes preventing violence requires changing behavior, not just prosecuting crime after it happens. It\u2019s a concept that has support from the Office of Justice Programs, which recommended the approach in its report on St. Louis. And it is the foundation of a program that Clark runs at his nonprofit agency Better Family Life, working with crime victims and suspected shooters to head off violent conflicts. The strategy has a mixed record, but studies have shown that under the right circumstances this kind of outreach can discourage young men\u2019s willingness to resort to violence.\u000a\u000a\u201cNow, in these neighborhoods, crime is both accepted and expected,\u201d says Clark, a 50-year-old, muscular Army veteran with the cadence of an evangelist. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a culture where the people are saying, \u2018I will kill you! I will shoot you dead!\u2019 That\u2019s a mentality. And the federal programs are not equipped to address the mentality.\u201d\u000a\u000aClark prefers to hire former criminals to staff his small outreach team, a common tactic in violence interruption programs, whose success depends on the credibility of their messengers. \u201cThey are the ones who can take that 12-, 13-, 14-year-old boy and mentor him out of his fixation with guns,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to meet them on the street corner, in the alley, at the barber shop, and you have to be able to change their life\u2019s trajectory.\u201d\u000a\u000aSometimes, Clark walks the blocks himself, asking residents what they\u2019re hearing and seeing. On a mid-August Saturday morning, after making two of his regular weekly stops, at a church and community group, he headed to the Wells Goodfellow neighborhood to meet with a 17-year-old high school student. Ostensibly, he went there to drop off some money to help pay for shoes that the teenager needed for his school uniform. The gesture was an opening for his real and graver purpose: to chastise the student for posting a photo of himself on Facebook brandishing a gun.\u000a\u000aClark arrived to find three other young men hanging out on the stoop at the teen\u2019s house. It offered Clark the sort of opportunity he and his outreach workers crave: a casual chat, \u201cgiving them the support that a man in my position should give them.\u201d He reminded them, \u201cYou gotta be careful out here,\u201d and commended them for staying out of trouble.\u000a\u000a\u201cI can say in no uncertain terms that all of them were good guys,\u201d Clark says. That one of them had posed for a snapshot while holding a gun is to Clark not evidence of violent intentions, but rather of the desperate need such youth have for mentors willing to help them avoid danger.\u000a\u000aJames Clark, from left to right, speaks to Errion Stallings, 17, and Travonn Bush, 17, Errol Stallings, 19, and DeAndre Kelley, 18, in the Wells Goodfellow neighborhood in St. Louis on Saturday, August 19. | Whitney Curtis for Politico Magazine\u000a\u000aLater that afternoon, Clark was relaxing at home when his phone rang. Over the sound of screams and moans, he heard the voice of the teen he\u2019d sought out that morning.\u000a\u000a\u201cMr. Clark, they came by shooting. We got shot,\u201d the boy told him.\u000a\u000aClark raced to the scene, calling 911 on the way. The three other young men Clark met earlier had been hit in a drive-by. They limped out of the house \u201cbloodied up\u201d and piled into Clark\u2019s truck to be rushed to a nearby hospital. They were treated and released by the next morning.\u000a\u000aFive days later, Clark took another call, this time from a distraught woman. Her nephew, 18-year-old DeAndre Kelley, was one of the three casualties from the earlier drive-by. She started by thanking Clark for helping her relative.\u000a\u000aThen, the woman said, \u201cMr. Clark, they\u2019re dead, all of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aClark was confused \u2014the young men, he knew, had survived the shooting\u2014but gradually he realized the woman was talking about another, newer attack.\u000a\u000aOn August 24, Kelley was one of four people slain in a north St. Louis County home. He had a job interview at a Target lined up for the same day. Police so far have no motive for the slaying. They describe Kelley and the others as \u201ctrue victims\u201d who simply lived in a place where senseless killings are commonplace.\u000a\u000aClark is certain the two shootings are unrelated. But they have provided him with a pointed reminder of the need to put more outreach workers on the streets, to intervene before more bullets fly.\u000a\u000aAs of last October, Clark was seeking $1.2 million in grants to expand his outreach team from 11 to 50 members. Now, it\u2019s down to eight workers. Though he hasn\u2019t entirely given up on securing some federal support, Clark now thinks he may fare better with private funders. \u201cThings are going slow,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aThe killings are not. Through July 31, St. Louis has had 107 gun homicides, up 8 percent over last year\u2014a new person shot dead in the city roughly every other day.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t need to study this no more,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another case study. We are just sitting back and letting it happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aMark Obbie is the former executive editor of American Lawyer and a regular contributor to The Trace.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) listen as Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) talks about Harvey relief efforts after a meeting with House Republicans on Sept. 6 on Capitol Hill. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP House sends Harvey aid package to Trump with debt ceiling boost\u000a\u000aThe House easily cleared a package Friday to provide more than $15 billion in disaster aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey, raise the debt ceiling and fund the government for three months.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump is expected to swiftly sign the bill, which delivered on the fiscal deal he struck with Democrats earlier this week. The House passed the legislation 316-90, a day after the Senate passed it, 80-17.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe measure takes care of most of Congress\u2019 must-pass items this month, with extensions still needed by Sept. 30 for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the Federal Aviation Administration.\u000a\u000aTrump administration officials have said the president wanted to clear the legislative decks to ensure tax reform remains the policy focus this fall.\u000a\u000aBut House Republicans, who have derided the strategy since the president first settled on it, continued to condemn Trump\u2019s move as they headed to vote Friday morning on the package many felt forced to support.\u000a\u000aPunting on the debt limit until Dec. 8, Republican lawmakers argue, will give Democrats the upper hand, since the GOP likely will have to bargain with the minority party for votes to continue government funding \u2014 now set to expire on the very same day.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sentiment that the president\u2019s decision empowers Democrats in December to withhold support for a further debt extension and a funding bill, that it emboldens them and it empowers them to make our job much more difficult in December," Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said. "It empowers the Democrats to bargain, when they really had no bargaining position the way we were headed.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany Republicans expressed disappointment that House leaders and Trump administration officials didn\u2019t entertain debate on cutting spending along with raising the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000aIn a House GOP meeting Friday morning with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, several Republicans pressed the Cabinet officials to commit to a strategy for handling deficit spending the next time Congress must vote to raise the debt limit, according to lawmakers who attended the meeting.\u000a\u000a\u201cShow us a plan,\u201d Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said he told Mnuchin. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep borrowing money. We\u2019re going to be $22 trillion in debt.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

It\u2019s this mess, where they combine all this, that bothers me,\u201d said Duncan, who represents the northwestern portion of South Carolina, bordering Georgia. \u201cAnd if next week South Carolina or Georgia or Florida comes back because of the hurricane, I\u2019ll vote for pure disaster relief funding then, just like I did this week.\u201d

aVRaised in Orange County before he earned a fortune on Wall Street, Joseph Sanberg had been mulling a governor\u2019s run. | Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Jefferson Awards Foundation New primary challenger to Feinstein emerges\u000a\u000aSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Add another name to the list of progressive Democrats seriously considering a primary challenge to California\u2019s senior Senator Dianne Feinstein: wealthy financial entrepreneur Joseph N. Sanberg.\u000a\u000aSanberg, 38 \u2014 co-founder of Aspiration.com, a socially-conscious investment firm, and a founding investor in Blue Apron, the home delivery meal service \u2014 has burnished his progressive credentials in recent years by successfully lobbying for the creation of CalEITC4Me, the earned income tax credit program which he\u2019s advocated as a means of delivering economic relief to low-income families. His work has earned praise from Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s right hand, Nancy McFadden, who called him \u201cthe spark\u201d of a major economic effort.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aRaised in Orange County by a single mom before he earned a fortune on Wall Street, Sanberg had been mulling a governor\u2019s run, sources familiar with his planning told POLITICO, and he delivered a speech to the last state Democratic convention that appeared to lay out a rationale for that race.\u000a\u000aBut that contest has become crowded with well-known Democrats like Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Treasurer John Chiang, all already heavily financed \u2014 and the door to that race appears to be closing.\u000a\u000aNow, sources close to Sanberg say he is being strongly encouraged to make a play for the Senate \u2014 and take Feinstein on from the left. POLITICO reported this week that State Senate Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, 50, is also being pushed by some progressives to mount a challenge to Feinstein, should she seek a fifth full term in 2018.\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Sanberg's team \u2014 in a move that appears to mirror a campaign start-up \u2014 announced the statewide digital media buy starts Thursday and that the spot is available in four languages: English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Vietnamese.\u000a\u000aThere are other signs that he\u2019s gearing up for a Senate run: Sanberg has hired on two powerhouse Democrat consultants. They are Laura Capps, the daughter of former Rep. Lois Capps, and Rebecca Katz, whose past resume includes serving as Special Advisor to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, running Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid\u2019s war room, and assisting with White House communications strategy for Judge Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s confirmation.\u000a\u000aSeveral Democrats who\u2019ve long known Sanberg and his work insist he\u2019d be an attractive progressive candidate for office with a passion for issues and knowledge of the concerns of working class Democrats.\u000a\u000aAmong them is Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who has known Sanberg for decades and was a classmate at Harvard. He says Sanberg \u201cwas a progressive leader from Day 1 \u2014 pushing progressive values and issues\u2019\u2019 on campus.\u000a\u000aGallego says both he and Sanberg were the product of working class families, and that Sanberg \u2014 who was then president of the college Democrats \u2014 \u201cactually recruited me" into the party. \u201cHe convinced me to get more involved in politics, and has been a good guiding post for me since then,'' he said.\u000a\u000aThe Arizona congressman says Sanberg's political talents were on display at this year's Netroots Nation convention, where he said Sanberg talked about the impact of California's earned income tax credit program, which Sanberg has said in its first two years has put over $2 billion in state and federal tax credits "back in the pockets of the lowest-income Californians."\u000a\u000aGallego said the California businessman fired up progressives with a message \u201cabout making working families stronger.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s a thought leader,\u2019\u2019 Gallego said, adding that Sanberg understands \u201cthe scope of who we need to be attracting to the Democratic party,\u2019\u2019 working people who are facing concerns about the economy and their jobs. He said Sanberg\u2019s work on California\u2019s EITC program proves it has been \u201ca really good model for the rest of the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked specifically about a race against Feinstein, Gallego said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to him where he wants to go in the future.\u2019\u2019 But he added: \u201cHe\u2019s done everything right in terms of doing the service for the people of California.\u2019\u2019\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Dianne Feinstein\u000a\u000aElections\u000a\u000aCalifornia

aVSALZGITTER, Germany \u2014 Sometimes it\u2019s better to be the supporting actor than the main star.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s something Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, has proved since stepping down as leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) and handing the job \u2014 and the chance to challenge Angela Merkel for the chancellorship \u2014 to former European Parliament President Martin Schulz.\u000a\u000aWhile Schulz is struggling to make headway in his campaign to oust Merkel in this month\u2019s general election, Gabriel is enjoying an extraordinary resurgence in popularity. That turnaround puts him in a strong position to be the more influential of the two if the SPD ends up reprising its current role as junior partner to Merkel\u2019s conservatives after the election.\u000a\u000aAs part of a reshuffle of roles among senior Social Democrats in late January, Gabriel announced he was giving up the party leadership, wouldn\u2019t run for chancellor and would switch from economy minister to foreign minister. At the time, that looked like a humiliation for him, with the foreign ministry something of a consolation prize.\u000a\u000aIn his new job, however, the combative 57-year-old has thrived, making headlines every other day with bold statements on Turkey, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia \u2014 as well as on issues only loosely related to foreign policy such as the German car industry.\u000a\u000aGabriel\u2019s newfound popularity and high profile have irritated some SPD officials.\u000a\u000a\u201cI like to say Angela Merkel is a good chancellor, as long as the SPD takes care of her\u201d \u2014 Sigmar Gabriel\u000a\u000aWhile some high-ranking party officials said Gabriel is just doing his job as Germany\u2019s top diplomat \u2014 \u201cand doing it well,\u201d as one said \u2014 others believe he is preparing the ground to secure his own political future after the September 24 election.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s just warming up,\u201d said a party official in the Bundestag, speaking on condition of anonymity.\u000a\u000aGabriel country\u000a\u000aA couple of weeks ago, Gabriel began \u2014 to the surprise of many \u2014 to point increasingly to what the SPD achieved in government with Merkel\u2019s conservatives during the last four years.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe achieved a lot, although the SPD only scored 26 percent and Merkel\u2019s conservatives more than 40 percent of the votes [in the 2013 election],\u201d Gabriel told a campaign rally last week in a market square in his parliamentary constituency of Salzgitter, as the audience, sipping on beer and munching bratwurst, waited for Schulz to arrive.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were lucky that Merkel primarily wanted to become chancellor and otherwise left it to us to make policy,\u201d he added. \u201cI like to say Angela Merkel is a good chancellor, as long as the SPD takes care of her.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis underlying message seemed to be: More of the same wouldn\u2019t be so bad. It triggered applause in Salzgitter, a community of 31 villages and towns divided by fields and factories.\u000a\u000aBut Schulz has been trying to strike a different note \u2014 suggesting he would prefer his party did not spend another four years in Merkel\u2019s shadow.\u000a\u000aAfter Schulz arrived and took the stage, he was at pains to stress how warm his relationship with Gabriel is. He opened by saying that Salzgitter was the right place \u201cto make clear that something exists in politics which many people deny: the friendship between two men who carry responsibility for the SPD.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut, perhaps in jest, he also offered a less than ringing endorsement of Gabriel\u2019s presence at the rally.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m particularly glad that he sits here in the first row,\u201d he said, \u201cand that he supports me and won\u2019t interrupt me with interjections during my speech.\u201d\u000a\u000aFrom the moment he became the party\u2019s nominee for chancellor, Schulz accepted he would sometimes not be able to predict Gabriel\u2019s actions, according to an SPD official close to the candidate. But Schulz has become increasingly irritated by some of Gabriel\u2019s recent statements, including his explicit embrace of the past \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with Merkel, the official said.\u000a\u000a\u2018Kamikaze candidate\u2019 to comeback kid\u000a\u000aWhen Gabriel announced in January that he would not be the SPD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, he described the move as a \u201cservice to his party\u201d and did not hide the fact that it was difficult for him.\u000a\u000aFor more than seven years, Gabriel \u2014 a Social Democrat to his core who says he went into politics as a reaction to the Nazi ideologies of his father \u2014 had toiled as party chief, trying to drag Germany\u2019s oldest party from the worst crisis of its history.\u000a\u000aDuring that time, he became the party\u2019s scapegoat for essentially everything that went wrong. Particularly after he took over the economy ministry in 2013, he struggled to reconcile the wishes of his crisis-ridden party with policy decisions he had to make as a minister \u2014 sometimes alienating the left of the SPD, at other times frustrating centrists.\u000a\u000aHis popularity fell so low that the idea of him running for chancellor prompted party officials in the parliament to christen him the \u201ckamikaze candidate.\u201d\u000a\u000aYet just seven months later, Gabriel has risen to become Germany\u2019s third most-popular politician \u2014 behind only Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, and significantly ahead of Schulz, in seventh place, according to a recent survey by pollsters Forschungsgruppe Wahlen.\u000a\u000aAlthough whoever occupies the foreign ministry is usually relatively popular, this ascent is remarkable \u2014 particularly as it happened at the same time as his party lost support, after an initial bounce when Schulz was announced as the candidate for chancellor.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermany remains a power of peace in Europe and not an armed power\u201d \u2014 Sigmar Gabriel\u000a\u000aGabriel also appears to have undergone something of a personal transformation. He has lost a significant amount of weight and now comes over as less aggressive and more humorous in media interviews, speaking appreciatively about how he gets to spend entire weekends with his young daughters.\u000a\u000aPeace push\u000a\u000aHe has also campaigned heavily on a theme that seems close to his heart, railing against the idea that Germany should almost double its military spending to 2 percent of GDP to conform to a NATO guideline \u2014 and the demands of Donald Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cGermany remains a power of peace in Europe and not an armed power,\u201d Gabriel said in Salzgitter, as the crowd burst into applause.\u000a\u000aSuch issues fall into his portfolio as foreign minister, but opinions inside the SPD differ over whether his prominent role is helping the party in the campaign.\u000a\u000aWhile some argue that Gabriel helps boost the SPD\u2019s standing, others fear his visibility draws attention away from Schulz and overshadows some of the candidate\u2019s attempts to make waves.\u000a\u000aPrivately, officials caution that, when it comes to his own political career, Gabriel has little to gain from a Schulz victory.\u000a\u000aIf Schulz, against all expectations, somehow manages to turn the tide at the last minute and become chancellor, Gabriel\u2019s prestigious office of foreign minister would most likely go to a coalition partner.\u000a\u000aThings will look different, however, if Germany ends up with another grand coalition between Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the SPD as their junior partner. The foreign office would then most likely remain in the hands of the Social Democrats.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd who do you think the SPD would want to see in the foreign office?\u201d one SPD official asked. \u201cA failed candidate \u2014 or someone who voluntarily stepped down from being party chief for the sake of the party?\u201d

aVIn a Facebook post, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) on Friday deemed it "unconscionable to repeal" the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program without a legislative solution in hand. With President Trump toying with doing exactly that, Bush emphasized the importance of providing DREAMers with "certainty."\u000a\u000a"Congress must act urgently to provide DREAMers certainty, through the BRIDGE Act and other legislative options that provide a path to legal status for children brought to the United States illegally," Bush wrote. The BRIDGE Act, which has not been passed into law, is a bipartisan measure that proposes allowing those who have received work authorization "temporary relief from deportation."\u000a\u000aBush is one of many to weigh in as Trump is rumored to be contemplating the end of DACA, which has granted temporary work and residency status to roughly 780,000 DREAMers, or undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before age 16. A group of 300 corporate executives is publicly pushing to save the program, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) have both indicated they would disagree with Trump if he were to end the program.\u000a\u000aTrump's final decision on DACA will be announced Tuesday. Becca Stanek

aVOutgoing White House spokesman Sean Spicer walks into the West Wing of the White House on July 29, 2017 in Washington, D.C. | Pool photo by Chris Kleponis/Getty Images Spicer lands post-White House gig President Donald Trump\u2019s former press secretary will go on the paid speaking circuit.\u000a\u000aSean Spicer is cashing in on \u201ccandor.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s first press secretary \u2014 who ceded his high-profile post to Sarah Huckabee Sanders in July but celebrated his official last day in the West Wing on August 31 \u2014 has signed with Worldwide Speakers Group, the company confirmed to POLITICO.\u000a\u000a\u201cAudiences around the world will benefit from the same candor, wit and insight that Spicer brought to the White House briefing room,\u201d Worldwide Speakers Group writes about Spicer in its pitch to potential customers, an early copy of which was reviewed by POLITICO.\u000a\u000aBut at his first briefing in January, Spicer falsely claimed the size of the crowd at Trump\u2019s inauguration was bigger than President Barack Obama\u2019s crowd eight years earlier, despite photographic evidence to the contrary \u2014 and then refused to take questions from reporters. In July, CNN preemptively said it would not hire Spicer, citing credibility issues related to that and other false statements made from the podium.\u000a\u000aSpicer\u2019s tenure in the White House often put him in what seemed to be an impossible position, being forced to defend claims by the president for which there was no basis in fact. But he remains in high demand on the speaking circuit, in part as an inside player with a unique vantage point on a historic election and on the opening months of the Trump presidency.\u000a\u000aHis first paid speaking gig will be in New York City on September 11, at the annual conference of the investment bank Rodman & Renshaw, according to two people familiar with his schedule.\u000a\u000aA spokesman for Worldwide Speakers Group said in a statement: \u201cWe are thrilled to provide Sean for our major trade association, corporate, university and public lecture series customers around the world. With his well-known candor and extensive experience, Sean is uniquely qualified to help audiences understand how the political environment will impact them now and in the future.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe spokesman declined to comment on how much Spicer would be paid per speech. Spicer declined to comment for this story.\u000a\u000aDelivering paid speeches \u2014 the lucrative and well-trod pasture of former lawmakers and their name-brand aides \u2014 will be one of the main components of Spicer\u2019s post-White House life, according to multiple people briefed on his plans. But he is also planning to pitch a book proposal and his agent, Robert Barnett, as of last week was making the rounds to networks to negotiate a possible deal for his client. So far, he has yet to nail down a paid television talking-head gig.\u000a\u000aFor months, agents in Washington have been playing the guessing game about who would be the first Trump insider to cash in on a book about the administration. In a saturated news environment, it is not exactly clear what that book would be.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is simultaneously the most opaque and the most transparent administration in history,\u201d said Keith Urbahn, whose company, Javelin, represents former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic operative Donna Brazile. \u201cThere are not a lot of secrets. They are leaked every day in the newspapers. So you really have to think through what the book is, because publishing into a news cycle like this is a challenge.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Spicer, other agents have said, could have an interesting story to tell about his interactions with the media and his relationship with the press when the cameras were off.\u000a\u000aThe most famous former press secretary to pen a book about his experience inside the bubble is Scott McClellan, the former spokesman for President George W. Bush whose tell-all, \u201cWhat Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington\u2019s Culture of Deception\u201d criticized his former boss for the way he sold the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. The book was widely criticized by other Bush operatives, who painted McClellan as an opportunist who never voiced any skepticism about the administration\u2019s foreign policy decisions when he was on the inside.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe criticism from some in Washington will be directed at those that write an honest account, versus those that write a book simply because they have an opportunity to leverage it for their own personal reasons,\u201d McClellan said in an interview. \u201cMy intention was totally different when I wrote it. I decided if I tell it from my perspective, based on what the truth is, I\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpicer is joining Worldwide\u2019s roster of paid talent, which includes former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox contributor Tomi Lahren, former Obama communications director Jen Psaki, and former Trump campaign deputy manager David Bossie, among others.\u000a\u000aSince late July, when Spicer resigned as White House press secretary following the appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, he has been exploring opportunities available to a former Republican National Committee spokesman who virtually overnight became a household name \u2014 thanks to the country\u2019s obsessive focus on all things Trump, as well as to comedian Melissa McCarthy\u2019s recurring impersonation of Spicer as a surprisingly endearing rage case on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe turned down an opportunity to appear on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d But he has been exploring others ways to make a living based on his unique position as one of the best-known faces of the opening months of the Trump administration \u2014 interviewing about 10 speakers\u2019 bureaus over the past month that had expressed interest in signing him as a client.\u000a\u000aWhen Scaramucci announced that Sanders would be replacing Spicer, he wished him success in his next chapter. \u201cI hope he goes on to make a tremendous amount of money,\u201d Scaramucci said at his one-and-done press conference in the White House briefing room.\u000a\u000aTrump also sent him off with well-wishes, tweeting that Spicer is \u201ca wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media \u2013 but his future is bright!\u201d

aVAfter nearly a year of disappointment, triumphalism, hand-wringing, head-scratching and confusion, Brexit talks are finally underway. The two teams met on schedule Monday with an exchange of gifts and an agreement on how the talks would proceed. The U.K. made a significant concession by agreeing to talk about what the EU wants to talk about (the terms of the divorce) before moving on to what it wants to talk about (trade and the future relationship between the two sides).\u000a\u000aOne key issue that must be tackled early on is settling the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations to the rest of the bloc \u2014 the so-called Brexit bill. That impacts on everything else because unless the EU27 deems \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made in the money negotiations, they say they aren\u2019t willing to move on to other things. Here\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to what is at stake in 16 different policy areas once that\u2019s out of the way.\u000a\u000aTRADE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K. and EU27 economies are interlinked to the closest possible degree, and any disruption in trade in goods or services will hit companies, banks and consumers on both sides hard \u2014 particularly the British. Hammering out a good trade deal will be difficult though \u2014 politically and in terms of time and negotiations constraints \u2014 and there\u2019s also trouble ahead at the World Trade Organization.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? EU trade deals with third countries will be affected but will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British business and consumers; German and Japanese carmakers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU businesses that snap up British counterparts (e.g. airlines, banks); EU hubs like Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris (as British businesses relocate).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a softer Brexit preserves single market access (like Norway) or an interim deal is struck, buying time for more talks on a full trade deal.\u000a\u000aKey people on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft, second permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), Catherine Webb, director of market access and budget at DExEU and Simon Case, director general for the U.K.-EU partnership at the U.K. Representation to the EU (UKRep).\u000a\u000aKey people on EU side: Deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand, Antonio Fernandez-Martos (head of international agreements, trade and customs in the EU\u2019s Brexit team).\u000a\u000aCUSTOMS/SURFACE TRANSPORT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The U.K.\u2019s biggest freight port and carmakers like Nissan, Toyota and BMW have issued stark warnings that leaving the EU customs union will put their businesses at risk. For the port of Dover, any border checks for truck transit would clog up roads almost immediately. Carmakers say they need access to EU markets for the output from plants in Brexit-voting areas of England like Sunderland and Derby, and they have called for interim single market and customs union access beyond 2019.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s rail and road systems will likely operate as normal, although London will have to figure out whether or not to follow EU policy on things like road tolling and social rules for road transporters in the medium-term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Car manufacturers worried about their supply chains and factory workers in their plants. Spare a thought for Ireland too \u2014 without easy access for road freight to and from the Continent via the U.K., the Emerald Isle\u2019s trade will suffer.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Everyone loses if traffic through Dover is disrupted as alternatives are slower and more expensive. But BMW has hinted it might shift production of the iconic Mini from a site near Oxford to one in the Netherlands.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. strikes a deal for tariff-free, and crucially check-free, access to the EU customs union \u2014 commonly described in London as \u201cfrictionless\u201d trade.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Philip Rycroft and Catherine Webb. Oliver Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s EU adviser who has been assigned to the thorny issue of an Irish border, assisted by Simon Case.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Antonio Fernandez-Martos. Sabine Weyand will be Robbins\u2019 counterpart on the Irish border.\u000a\u000aCITIZENS\u2019 RIGHTS\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Roughly 4.2 million EU citizens on either side of the Channel will be affected by Brexit \u2014 from British pensioners living in southern Spain to health professionals in the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. The EU has made a priority of settling rights for citizens like pensions and the protection of \u201clife choices\u201d after March 2019. Life choices implies the rights to residence, to work and to enjoy equal treatment with nationals when it comes to employment access, working conditions, benefits and taxes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? If the U.K. is genuine about its \u201cgenerous offer\u201d on citizens\u2019 rights, Brussels won\u2019t try to prevent the U.K. from cutting immigration after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, British universities and London\u2019s banking sector.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU citizens on both sides of the Channel worried about their future status.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How will rights be enforced and protected? A role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is Brussels\u2019 preference and is enshrined in EU law, but that would be contrary to the \u201ctake back control\u201d desired by the U.K.\u2019s Hard Brexiteers.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Glyn Williams, director general at the Home Office.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Marie Simonsen, who is in charge of free movement of citizens and employment on Barnier\u2019s Brexit task force. Her boss is François Arbault, who is responsible for internal market and sectoral policies, but Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, will also follow this strand of the negotiations very closely.\u000a\u000aDEFENSE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake: The EU will lose a country with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, a nuclear deterrent and an army that can be deployed around the world. On the plus side, the bloc will be free to pursue defense integration \u2014 something London has always opposed. The U.K. will want to ensure it can maintain leverage in areas like the Balkans and coordinate with EU partners outside of NATO operations.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not: The EU is unlikely to create a unified army with a Pentagon-style headquarters. At least not in the short term.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. defense companies like BAE Systems if they cannot maintain access to the new EU fund for defense research; EU defense if it loses British military and technical expertise.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: The French, who currently steer EU foreign policy and will now dominate defense policy too; those in the EU who want defense integration.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether \u201cthird countries\u201d \u2014 as the U.K. will be post Brexit \u2014 will have access to EU funds and military operations.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill, national security adviser to the prime minister.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier, responsible for external relations and foreign and security policy on the Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCRIME/TERRORISM/SECURITY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Information sharing will be the key issue in negotiations on security. The U.K. is among the top four contributors to Europol\u2019s main database on crime and the fifth largest user of the agency\u2019s platform to exchange information. Britain will almost certainly lose access to both databases, which would leave EU and U.K. citizens less safe as a result.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Intelligence cooperation mainly occurs at a bilateral level, meaning that the U.K.\u2019s intelligence services will continue to partner with EU allies.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Europol; U.K. police and citizens.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Organized criminals and terrorists operating out of the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. can obtain access to Europol\u2019s databases and the Schengen Information System \u2014 something that would require ECJ oversight.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Sedwill and Chris Jones, director general at DExEU.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Nina Obermaier.\u000a\u000aDIGITAL ECONOMY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? If London wants to keep its top reputation for startups and data innovation, it will have to negotiate ways to transfer data smoothly to and from the EU. The country\u2019s invasive surveillance practices could stand in the way of that. Migration is also high on the agenda for techies, who fear a brain drain of coders and entrepreneurs. The EU, on the other hand, stands to lose a tech-savvy member with the skills and pro-business agenda the Commission likes.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The digital economy \u2014 everyone loves the digital economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Startups in London; research departments across Europe.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Privacy advocates; EU countries that take up Britain\u2019s lead role on tech.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a data transfer deal is struck.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Gila Sacks, director for digital and tech policy at the U.K.\u2019s department of culture, media and sports, will support the DExEU team with expertise.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: François Arbault, key person in charge of internal market and sectoral policies.\u000a\u000aAVIATION\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Some 50 percent of U.K. passenger travel is to or from the EU, and Brexit will also impact trips between the U.K. and trading partners with an open skies agreement with the EU, like the U.S. In total, 42 of the U.K.\u2019s air services agreements are through its membership of the EU and will have to be renegotiated.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Heathrow airport believes it will benefit from Brexit, provided the U.K. puts a system in place allowing for swift entry of passengers and goods.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: U.K. airlines \u2014 such as Thomas Cook, EasyJet and jet2.com \u2014 which run a lot of flights to or within EU countries; Passengers, who are likely to pay more due to reduced competition; Ireland, because it has more air traffic to the U.K. than any other EU country.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Some national airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and Alitalia are looking forward to less competition from U.K. budget airlines.\u000a\u000aKey decision: If a new air services agreement is in place by the time the U.K. leaves the EU and the single aviation market.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Peter Sorensen, who is responsible for aviation, and François Arbault, head of internal market in goods and non-financial services in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force.\u000a\u000aCLIMATE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? The EU has benefited from the U.K.\u2019s participation in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost renewables and energy efficiency. Britain is one of the EU\u2019s biggest emissions-cutters and a heavyweight country in favor of toughening climate policies such as the Emissions Trading System.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K.\u2019s national Climate Change Act, which aims to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050, is unlikely to be affected. Nor are its policies pricing emissions from power plants and phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2025.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The EU27, which will have to divvy up the U.K.\u2019s national emissions reduction responsibilities, and the U.K., which will lose its influence as a larger member of a big bloc in international climate negotiations.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: EU27 countries that resist tougher future emissions cuts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. pulls out of the Emissions Trading System, and whether it will continue to participate in the bloc\u2019s emission reduction efforts.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain, responsible for energy and climate and environment in the Commission\u2019s Brexit task force and Nicola Pesaresi, who is in charge of regulatory issues on subjects like climate change and financial stability that could be impacted by the U.K.\u2019s departure.\u000a\u000aENVIRONMENT\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? After Brexit, London will be free to decide whether to keep in place environmental rules and standards set by the EU over the years. If the U.K. lowers air quality standards, the EU could be directly impacted, as dirty air doesn\u2019t respect national borders. MEPs have also warned that products imported from the U.K. could, in the future, be made to lower environmental standards, undercutting EU goods.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The U.K., home to a strong tradition of environmental activism, is unlikely to overturn environmental rules en masse, even if it does eliminate regulations it deems unuseful and uncompetitive.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Animal and plant species protected under the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, deemed \u201cEU red tape\u201d by British Brexiteers; the U.K. environment.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British housing developers \u2014 who may no longer have to worry about great crested newts.\u000a\u000aKey decision: How environmental standards will be embedded in a future trade deal between the U.K. and EU countries.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aENERGY\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? New tariffs or other trade barriers could push up the price of gas and power supplies, putting the U.K., Ireland and others at risk of shortages. In another blow to Britain, they could get in the way of new investment, equipment and expertise for energy infrastructure (particularly nuclear plants).\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? The continued flow of electricity and gas between the two sides. Costs and volumes may change, planned new links might run into complications, but existing interconnectors will not disappear after Brexit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The Irish-Northern Irish single electricity market; U.K. energy companies in the EU; EU energy companies in Britain; the British nuclear safeguarding regime; new nuclear energy developers in the U.K.; British energy bill payers.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Not many. Maybe a few small local energy companies, like those developing shale gas, that would benefit from less international competition.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. leaves the EU\u2019s internal energy market, and whether it continues to follow a complex set of power and gas network rules that make it easier to trade between EU markets.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Tadhg O\u2019Briain and Nicola Pesaresi.\u000a\u000aFISHING\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Access is the key word in fisheries negotiations. Thousands of EU fishermen rely on U.K. waters for their daily catch. However, the EU is the largest buyer of British fish. This co-dependency means Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s promise to wrangle back control of British seas will be difficult to keep.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? British waters are unlikely to become the Wild West of fishing because the U.K. ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British fish processors and exporters; EU fishermen.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: U.K. fishermen; EU fish processors.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether there will be a deal brokered to swap fishing rights in British waters for access to the world\u2019s largest fish market: the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth, responsible for agriculture, fisheries and maritime policy on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aHEALTH\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brits and Europeans could lose their health insurance for emergency care when policyholders travel abroad. The way medicines will be approved in the U.K. could also be affected once it leaves the bloc. Britain also risks shortages of doctors and nurses, as those from the EU will either leave the U.K. or no longer work in its National Health Service.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Big British pharmaceutical companies will continue to do business in the EU, even if they will probably have to rely more on their continental subsidiaries inside the bloc.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: Holidaymakers, patients and the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Insurance companies providing travel insurance; the EU country that gets the European Medicines Agency once it\u2019s relocated from the U.K.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps the British medicines approval process aligned with that of the EU; and whether it remains in the European Health Insurance Card scheme, which provides the right to free emergency medical care in the EU.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Stefan Fuehring, who\u2019s responsible for health and food safety, as well as justice and home affairs on Barnier\u2019s task force.\u000a\u000aUNIVERSITIES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Brexit could lead to a decline in the number of EU students coming to study in the U.K. because they would be recruited as international students, meaning their fees would rise significantly. British universities also risk losing the roughly 15 percent of their budget they get from the EU in research funding. Academics are likely to find it harder to collaborate on research projects with colleagues on the Continent. A change in visa arrangements for other European countries might also prevent them from joining British universities.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Demand for higher education is so high that even if fewer EU students came to study in Britain, universities would be no worse off financially as they compensate by taking more domestic students.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: EU students, and foreign staff and academics; the European Commission\u2019s Erasmus student-exchange program.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: British students (who will have better chances of getting a place at university); U.K. universities (that can raise tuition fees for EU nationals and so increase budgets).\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether a deal is struck giving EU students and academics access to U.K. universities and vice versa.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aFINANCIAL SERVICES\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Hundreds of international firms do business across the EU from their London headquarters thanks to so-called passports. The industry is most worried about losing its ability to operate across the bloc from British headquarters. Another issue topping the agenda is the possibility that London will lose euro-clearing activities, a nearly \u20ac1 trillion-a-day business that supports 83,000 jobs in the City of London.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? London\u2019s role as a world-class financial center. Some firms will move some of their operations, but the bulk is likely to stay, allowing the City of London and Canary Wharf to remain major international financial hubs.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British clearing houses; the European Banking Authority; young EU talent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Frankfurt, lawyers and banks (because they always win).\u000a\u000aKey decision: The shape and form of mutual market access, assuming the U.K. loses full single market access and passporting rights.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: Mark Bowman, director general, international finance at the Treasury and Philip Rycroft.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aAGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Market access will dominate discussions, with British farmers currently hooked into sophisticated supply chains that deliver produce across Europe. Many EU farmers depend on the U.K. market, but Britain has more to lose. Restricted trade either way will deal EU farmers a heavier blow than Russia\u2019s food import ban, which devastated the industry.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Farms run razor-thin profit margins \u2014 everything is at stake.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: British farmers; Dutch and Spanish food exporters; Ireland\u2019s economy.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: There are few, but French farmers might benefit if their government \u2014 which the U.K. has traditionally hindered in agricultural affairs \u2014 pushes for a better-funded Common Agricultural Policy.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether negotiators will agree to tariff-free mutual market access.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one on the negotiating team has been specifically assigned this brief but Catherine Webb will deal with market access issues.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: Bence Tóth.\u000a\u000aSPACE\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s at stake? Whether the U.K. continues to contribute to the EU\u2019s space program will dictate whether it keeps access to contracts for satellite systems like Galileo, Europe\u2019s version of America\u2019s GPS network. The EU could also freeze British astronauts out of future space missions. As talks get underway on the broader Brexit deal, the government has set out a proposed new law allowing spaceports and satellite launches to take place in the U.K.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s not? Galileo will be completed whether the U.K. keeps on paying or not \u2014 some 20 of the satellites are already in orbit.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential losers: The U.K.\u2019s aerospace research institutions and NewSpace startups that have already been advised to start looking at options on the Continent.\u000a\u000aBiggest potential winners: Engineering companies and startups across the bloc, who will be quick to fill the gap left behind if the U.K. falls out of the EU\u2019s orbit.\u000a\u000aKey decision: Whether the U.K. keeps funding European space programs and contributing to broader EU research pools.\u000a\u000aKey person on U.K. side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKey person on Brussels side: No one specific on the negotiating team.\u000a\u000aKait Bolongaro, Jacopo Barigazzi, Carmen Paun, Emmet Livingstone, Hans Joachim Von Der Burchard, Joshua Posaner, Cathy Buyck, Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli, Laurens Cerulus, Giulia Paravicini, Quentin Ariès, Sara Stefanini, Kalina Oroschakoff, Marion Solletty and Cynthia Kroet contributed reporting.

aVPhoto: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images\u000a\u000aNew Jersey governor Chris Christie broke ranks with Donald Trump\u2019s other top allies this morning and refused to defend the candidate for bragging about groping women. He didn\u2019t, however, back down from supporting Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat kind of talk and conversation even in private is just unacceptable,\u201d he said on Boomer & Carton, a sports talk-radio show on WFAN. \u201cI was really disturbed and disappointed by it and embarrassed for him and his family.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen asked if Trump\u2019s remarks have caused him to waver in his support, Christie said, \u201cThis election is about bigger issues,\u201d and that Trump\u2019s admission to grabbing women may be gross, but \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only way you should make a judgment.\u201d

aVWhere might Trump triumph in Europe?\u000a\u000aNow, this American president supposedly isn\u2019t the Continent\u2019s favorite cup of tea (or whatever the beverage of European choice is). A Pew Research Center survey found Trump to be \u201cbroadly unpopular\u201d worldwide, with 22 percent of those polled trusting him to do the right thing. Barely a fifth of Europeans are confident Trump will do the right thing, and that includes the Trumpophiles in Russia.\u000a\u000aBut those numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. If you look at his most recognizable personal characteristics (forceful and charismatic to his backers; arrogant and intolerant to the other side) and at his signature policies (opposed to free trade and open borders for migrants, skeptical on regulation and the nanny state, my-nation-first everything), then Trumpism holds more appeal in the Old World than the European chattering classes think.\u000a\u000aTo determine just how much appeal Trump might have in 47 European countries, POLITICO introduces the Trumpability Index.\u000a\u000aThere is a method to this not wholly unscientific ranking of where a European Donald Trump would have the best chance of being elected. We came up with 13 categories associated with his brand of politics. Yearning for change is one, yearning for a strongman another. An adversarial approach to free media and an aggressive approach to slashing regulations are there too. Then we assessed how favorably each country would respond to each characteristic, assigned scores based on a ratings system between 1 and 10, and did the math.\u000a\u000aEnvelopes, please. Here are your top 10 Trump Country countries in Europe:\u000a\u000a1. The Czech Republic\u000a\u000aThe Czech Republic tops the Trump chart: Like in the States, dissatisfaction with traditional political parties (the original right-left parties, the ODS and CSSD, barely clear 10 percent in recent polls) has created an opportunity. If someone like Donald Trump were to run for office, they\u2019d have a strong chance of being elected \u2014 and in fact, someone does. Andrej Babi\u0161, who\u2019s likely to be elected prime minister in October, has drawn repeated comparisons to Trump in the past, including in a 2015 POLITICO article. Some similarities are obvious: Babi\u0161 is a billionaire businessman with no prior political experience who sells himself as an outsider; he\u2019s renowned for making politically incorrect comments, many about migrants coming into the country; and he\u2019s advocated for a hard-line immigration policy that involves not a wall but a \u201cfortress\u201d that keeps migrants out.\u000a\u000aBut even in subtler policy-based ways, the Czech Republic\u2019s likely next leader has Trumpesque qualities: Babi\u0161 supports an increase in defense spending, but was hesitant to increase health care funding when he was finance minister in 2016, making him one of the few European leaders we came across who had anything in common with Trump\u2019s health care policy. And Babi\u0161\u2019 response to being compared to Trump did nothing to tone down the impression of him as arrogant. The difference between him and Trump, he has said, is that \u201cTrump has gone bankrupt several times \u2026 I [have] not.\u201d\u000a\u000a2. Italy\u000a\u000aBefore there was Donald Trump, there was Silvio Berlusconi: A flashy, self-obsessed media tycoon who crossed one line after another with his rhetoric, and each time blamed the \u201chostile media\u201d or \u201ccommunist prosecutors\u201d for any negative coverage. In the same way the Teflon Donald continually eludes the consequences others anticipate from his \u201cwar against political correctness,\u201d Berlusconi exudes irreverence without losing support. Before there was the leaked tape of Trump bragging that \u201cwhen you\u2019re a star \u2026 you can do anything\u201d to women, there was a wiretap of Berlusconi boasting that he \u201conly did eight\u201d women the night before, despite having a queue of 11.\u000a\u000aWhile not currently in power \u2014 he was convicted for tax fraud and expelled from the senate in 2013 \u2014 Berlusconi is making a comeback. When the election takes place in 2018, it\u2019s looking like the three-time former prime minster will be integral to forming a new government. And Trump would be popular in Italy for the same reason Berlusconi might be able to return to politics: A public that\u2019s tired of traditional politicians and ready to reject elitist political parties in favor of self-proclaimed populists.\u000a\u000aIn terms of policy, Trump\u2019s stances line up with Matteo Salvini\u2019s Northern League, the far-right party that rivals Berlusconi\u2019s party in the polls. Salvini is an unabashed Trump fan, and he too advocates for a hard-line immigration policy, a simpler tax code and a defense of his country\u2019s national identity against outsiders.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. Russia\u000a\u000aRussia is the only country in Pew\u2019s survey besides Israel where confidence in the U.S. leader to do the right thing increased after Trump\u2019s election, which indicates the Russian public sees something they like in the Donald. A political victory for Trump might be possible in Russia if he strengthened his status of strongman \u2014 perhaps substituting rounds of golf for bare-chested swims \u2014 as Russia tends to prefer alpha-male behavior in the public sphere. Like Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s popularity is extremely strong in his country\u2019s heartland and weakest in big urban centers (although the scale is different \u2014 Putin consistently enjoys approval ratings of about 80 percent, while Trump has seen historically low approval ratings of under 40 percent since May).\u000a\u000aPutin\u2019s policies out-Trump Trump in many ways, perhaps showing what the U.S. president could accomplish if he had 18 years in power and a two-thirds majority in the legislative system. Trump seeks to project military strength; Putin has undertaken major spending to upgrade the military. Trump wants to simplify the tax system; Russia has a flat income tax rate of 13 percent for tax residents. Trump denounces anyone who disagrees with him; Putin\u2019s treatment is more deadly, with many critics of his regime dying in suspicious ways. Trump often denies facts and tells the media untruths; lying is an acceptable way of interacting with the press and constituents for Putin.\u000a\u000aThere are policy differences between the two: Putin professes to be in favor of international trade while Trump voices anti-trade rhetoric, and immigration is not a key talking point for Putin. But on balance, Trump\u2019s combination of machismo, media-denying and military aspirations would go over well in the Kremlin.\u000a\u000a4. Turkey\u000a\u000aRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been in power as prime minister and subsequently president since 2003. Although Erdo\u011fan, unlike Trump, is a seasoned politician, his pitch has echoes of \u201cMaking Turkey Great Again\u201d: Erdo\u011fan promised to raise living standards in his country (a venture at which he has succeeded) and more recently to restore Turkey\u2019s Ottoman-era place as the most influential nation in the Middle East. The two leaders also share strongman tendencies and a propensity to take criticism very personally (Erdo\u011fan has sued more than 2,000 people for insulting him), and both have sons-in-law whom they have rewarded with influential political positions (Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son-in-law Berat Albayrak is energy minister).\u000a\u000aTrump and Erdo\u011fan have overlapping core support \u2014 both appeal to religious conservatives and pander to nationalists to win elections. However, there are certain characteristics of Trump that would immediately make it difficult for him to be elected in a Muslim-majority country like Turkey: His crude comments about women would not be well-received, and his two divorces wouldn\u2019t help him either. Trump\u2019s isolationist immigration and trade policies would also be out of place in a country like Turkey that has used those two areas successfully as leverage with the West.\u000a\u000a5. Hungary\u000a\u000aHungary has proven Donald Trump\u2019s wall is not entirely in his imagination. The country\u2019s growing hostility toward immigration resulted in the construction of a razor wire fence along its southern border in an attempt to stop the 2015 influx of refugees.\u000a\u000aHungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is a love-him-or-hate-him leader, much like Trump, and their political priorities sync in more sectors than immigration: Trump\u2019s hostility toward the \u201cfake media\u201d pales in comparison to the treatment of the press by Orbán, who went as far as shutting down the largest opposition newspaper. Despite this, after seven years in office, Orbán\u2019s party remains the most popular in the country.\u000a\u000aIn terms of treatment of women, Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d comments wouldn\u2019t be the first sexist rhetoric to surface in Hungarian politics, meaning it might not be an automatic disqualifier: Orbán has no female ministers in his cabinet and, among other incidents, when asked why he fired his female ambassador to Washington, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t deal with women\u2019s issues.\u201d\u000a\u000a6. Azerbaijan\u000a\u000aAzerbaijan settles midway on the Trump-scale. President Iham Aliyev and Donald Trump concord on three points: media, military and Russia. The latter\u2019s influence on Azerbaijan stems from both its geographical proximity, and close ties between Aliyev and Putin. Russia is asserting itself more aggressively across the neighborhood, and Azerbaijan looks increasingly susceptible to Russian entreaties for collaboration. Azerbaijan\u2019s aspiration to regional eminence has also resulted in the adoption of a Trumpesque policy of continued traditional hostilities, with Trump continuing the war in Afghanistan while Azerbaijan rattles sabers against its local enemy Armenia. Moreover, both Aliyev and Trump maintain a strained relationship with the media, the former even stepping beyond the \u201cfake news\u201d shield by waging an unforgiving war against any critics of the authoritarian regime, while rewarding regime-friendly reporters with free apartments. Trump\u2019s reality-bending rhetoric would serve him well in Azerbaijan; Aliyev has railed against human rights and democracy as European and American \u201cdouble standards\u201d designed to subvert the state.\u000a\u000aAzerbaijan also earns an honorable mention for the presence of Aliyev\u2019s wife Mehriban Aliyeva, who bears a striking resemblance to Melania Trump and also happens to be vice president. However, Trump\u2019s appeal as an outsider coming in to shake up the system wouldn\u2019t be terribly effective for Azerbaijanis. Aliyev is second in a political dynasty; he and his father have led the country since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and with his party holding a political monopoly with almost all of the seats in parliament, there\u2019s no end in sight.\u000a\u000a7. Poland\u000a\u000aThe ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) that dominates the Polish political scene, led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, came to power through a Trumpian tactic: promising a voice and a sympathetic ear to rural Poles who felt that the previous centrist government had left them behind.\u000a\u000aTrump and Kaczy\u0144ski might not appear similar at first: one jets between gold hotels embossed with his name while the other conducts business in an \u201cairless and Spartan bureau;\u201d one tweets his every excessively punctuated thought while the other doesn\u2019t own a computer; one has had a string of beautiful wives while the other has never married and lives with two cats. But the two men have their similarities where it counts: as politicians. Both keep to themselves, befriending few foreign leaders; both expect intense personal loyalty from their inferiors; and like Trump, Kaczy\u0144ski \u201cinfuriates about half the country and captivates the rest.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Poland, Trump\u2019s biggest difficulty getting elected would be his brazen flashiness, which would be off-putting to a conservative public, and his insistence on slashing public health care, which would be wildly unpopular \u2014 PiS came to power with the promise of one of the most generous social programs in Polish history at the core of their campaign.\u000a\u000a8. Bulgaria\u000a\u000aBulgaria already has a wall that Trump can only dream of.\u000a\u000aBeing tough on immigration plays well in Bulgaria, and the country built a barbed wire fence along its border with Turkey in 2014 to stem the flow of migrants from the Middle East. President Rumen Radev, a former fighter pilot, won last year\u2019s election by vowing that he would not allow the country to turn into a \u201cmigrant ghetto.\u201d Prime Minister Boyko Borisov also initially seemed to give his blessing to the activities of nationalist vigilantes who rounded up and intimidated refugees, but later had to tone down his support.\u000a\u000aA burly former karate champion, Borisov can deliver macho quips straight from the Trump playbook. When asked in 2014 whether it was time for him to return to the premiership at a period of political disarray, he replied: \u201cWhen there\u2019s a winter storm, it\u2019s the man who drives the car, because he\u2019s more experienced.\u201d\u000a\u000aMuch like the current White House, Bulgarian politics are also deeply and murkily interwoven with the interests of the Kremlin and Russian oligarchs.\u000a\u000aOne major difference with Trump\u2019s America is that Bulgaria is far from protectionist in the face of foreign investment. Unlike the anti-Chinese Trump, Bulgaria has signaled its openness to Chinese investments in sectors such as transport and infrastructure.\u000a\u000a9. Malta\u000a\u000aThe newest alumnus of the presidency of the Council of the European Union, Malta has been under scrutiny in the past six months as it saw the reelection of Joseph Muscat. His is a personality-cult character similar to Trump: he\u2019s cultivated a \u201cfather of the people\u201d persona, is intent on rising above partisan politics to unify the country, and his book, \u201cJoseph: The best time for the country is yet to come\u201d echoes Trump\u2019s rallying cry to Make America Great Again. Despite being under criminal investigation for alleged corruption, Muscat won the snap election he called in June in a landslide, having demolished the opposition by claiming they were spreading malicious lies.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s actual policies would be less successful in Malta than his personality. A former British colony, it enjoys a more liberal health care system and is friendly to foreigners: Muscat, although he led the anti-EU campaign during the 2003 referendum, has changed his tune. He\u2019s also overseen an economic boom based in part on encouraging Russian oligarchs and Chinese magnates to buy Maltese passports, as well as making the island one of the top destinations for online gambling companies.\u000a\u000aIn 10th place, a tie: France and the United Kingdom\u000a\u000aAt first glance, the election of President Emmanuel Macron seems like the most anti-Trump move a country could make: A poised young centrist who advocates for stability and international cooperation was elected instead of a divisive far-right leader \u2014 Marine Le Pen \u2014 who supports immigration bans and isolationism.\u000a\u000aBut Macron and Trump have more in common than meets the eye. Both have experience in the private sector, Trump as a businessman and Macron as a banker. And both presented themselves as radical alternatives to traditional politics in their country. Both also have a fixation with public imagery that has led to strained relationships with the press. And while Macron presents himself as a liberal, some elements of his policies have been branded protectionist. He nationalized a shipyard to block an Italian takeover and he wants to impose more restrictions on cheap Eastern European labor.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s not to say the two have identical approaches: Macron strives to make the presidency more dignified, declining interviews and creating distance between himself and the public, while Trump has taken the opposite tack, closing the distance between himself and his constituency by spreading his message through social media. No doubt to the relief of the French public, you\u2019d never find Macron tweeting \u201cJOBS!\u201d or \u201ccovfefe.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s shamelessness would probably not go over well with the French public, but his strong-handed leadership and country-first rhetoric might. The considerable traction Le Pen\u2019s far-right party gained during the presidential election campaign shows that there\u2019s a segment of the French public that would like what Trump has to say.\u000a\u000aUnited Kingdom\u000a\u000aThe contemporary British political figure most like Donald Trump is probably former United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage. Both are brash and unconventional, both cast themselves as political outsiders who play on their commercial background and both used the politics of immigration as an anchor point for their political credo.\u000a\u000aBut whatever Farage\u2019s successes (he has been an MEP since 1999 and UKIP was a significant factor in making the Brexit referendum happen) he ultimately found little political success in the U.K. He stood for parliament seven times and lost on every occasion \u2014 although the British electoral system didn\u2019t do him any favors. That puts a big question mark over whether a British version of the American president would be successful.\u000a\u000aBrexit itself was driven in part by the same economic disaffection and isolationist instincts that led to Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. \u2014 but there are differences. Most Brexiteers are advocates of more free trade, not less. Also, on health care, the British love of the NHS would mean a Trumpian health system would be a non-starter with the public. Trump\u2019s personal characteristics, too, would be major a turn-off. While his appeals for radical change might get a hearing, the British public is generally wary of strongmen.\u000a\u000aSiegfried Mortkowitz, Jacopo Barigazzi, Zia Weise, Jan Cienski, Lili Bayer, Christian Oliver, Harry Cooper, James Randerson and Andrew Gray contributed to this story.

aVJeff Sessions is U.S. attorney general.\u000a\u000aDrug trafficking is an inherently violent business. If you want to collect a drug debt, you can\u2019t, and don\u2019t, file a lawsuit in court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. For the approximately 52,000 Americans who died of a drug overdose in 2015, drug trafficking was a deadly business.\u000a\u000aYet in 2013, subject to limited exceptions, the Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors not to include in charging documents the amount of drugs being dealt when the actual amount was large enough to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence. Prosecutors were required to leave out objective facts in order to achieve sentences lighter than required by law. This was billed as an effort to curb mass incarceration of low-level offenders, but in reality it covered offenders apprehended with large quantities of dangerous drugs. The result was that federal drug prosecutions went down dramatically \u2014 from 2011 to 2016, federal prosecutions fell by 23 percent. Meanwhile, the average sentence length for a convicted federal drug offender decreased 18 percent from 2009 to 2016.\u000a\u000aBefore that policy change, the violent crime rate in the United States had fallen steadily for two decades, reaching half of what it was in 1991. Within one year after the Justice Department softened its approach to drug offenders, the trend of decreasing violent crime reversed. In 2015, the United States suffered the largest single-year increase in the overall violent crime rate since 1991.\u000a\u000aAnd while defenders of the 2013 policy change point out that crime rates remain low compared with where they were 30 years ago, they neglect to recognize a disturbing trend that could reverse decades of progress: Violent crime is rising across the country. According to data from the FBI, there were more than 15,000 murders in the United States in 2015, representing a single-year increase of nearly 11 percent across the country. That was the largest increase since 1971 .\u000a\u000aThe increase in murders continued in 2016. Preliminary data from the first half of 2016 shows that large cities in the United States suffered an average increase in murders of nearly 22 percent compared with the same period from a year earlier.\u000a\u000aAs U.S. attorney general, I have a duty to protect all Americans and fulfill the president\u2019s promise to make America safe again. Last month, after weeks of study and discussion with a host of criminal-justice participants, I issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors regarding charging and sentencing policy that once again authorizes prosecutors to charge offenses as Congress intended. This two-page guidance instructs prosecutors to apply the laws on the books to the facts of the case in most cases, and allows them to exercise discretion where a strict application of the law would result in an injustice. Instead of barring prosecutors from faithfully enforcing the law, this policy empowers trusted professionals to apply the law fairly and exercise discretion when appropriate. That is the way good law enforcement has always worked.\u000a\u000aDefenders of the status quo perpetuate the false story that federal prisons are filled with low-level, nonviolent drug offenders. The truth is less than 3 percent of federal offenders sentenced to imprisonment in 2016 were convicted of simple possession, and in most of those cases the defendants were drug dealers who accepted plea bargains in return for reduced sentences.\u000a\u000aFederal drug offenders include major drug traffickers, gang members, importers, manufacturers and international drug cartel members. To be subject to a five-year mandatory sentence, a criminal would have to be arrested with 100 grams or more of heroin with the intent to distribute it \u2014 that is 1,000 doses of heroin.\u000a\u000aThe truth is that while the federal government softened its approach to drug enforcement, drug abuse and violent crime surged. The availability of dangerous drugs is up, the price has dropped and the purity is at dangerously high levels. Overdose deaths from opioids have nearly tripled since 2002. Overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids rose an astonishing 73 percent in 2015.\u000a\u000aMy fear is that this surge in violent crime is not a \u201cblip,\u201d but the start of a dangerous new trend \u2014 one that puts at risk the hard-won gains that have made our country a safer place.\u000a\u000aSome skeptics prefer to sit on the sidelines and criticize federal efforts to combat crime. But it\u2019s not our privileged communities that suffer the most from crime and violence. Minority communities are disproportionately impacted by violent drug trafficking. Poor neighborhoods are too often ignored in these conversations. Regardless of wealth or race, every American has the right to demand a safe neighborhood. Those of us who are responsible for promoting public safety cannot sit back while any American communities are ravaged by crime and violence.\u000a\u000aThere are those who are concerned about the fate of drug traffickers, but the law demands I protect the lives of victims that are ruined by drug trafficking and violent crime infecting their communities. Our new, time-tested policy empowers police and prosecutors to save lives.

aVChicago Still Isn\u2019t the Murder Capital of America Last year was the city's bloodiest in decades. But others continue to record higher homicide rates \u2014 and the hardest hit neighborhoods are what really merit attention.\u000a\u000aMurders increased significantly last year in the majority of American cities with a population over 250,000, according to preliminary data from police departments and news reports. The bump comes one year after killings rose across the country at their fastest pace in 25 years, and is likely large enough again to drive up the national homicide rate when final tallies are released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u000a\u000aIn no place did the uptick feel more dramatic than in Chicago. The city recorded 762 murders last year \u2014 a 59.4 percent increase over 2015, and its highest tally since the mid-1990s. A December report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning think tank, found that Chicago single-handedly accounted for nearly half of the 14 percent increase in homicides observed in the nation\u2019s 30 largest cities. Ninety-one percent of the city\u2019s killings were committed with a firearm.\u000a\u000aStay Informed Subscribe to receive The Trace\u2019s daily roundup of important gun news and analysis.

Share on Facebook\u000a\u000aShare on Twitter\u000a\u000aShare via Email Close\u000a\u000aChicago has become synonymous with gun violence, attracting attention from the press, politicians, and advocates on both sides of the firearms debate. In one of the final installments of a New York Times series on shootings in the city, Reverend Michael Pfleger, a prominent anti-violence activist and pastor on the city\u2019s South Side, described Chicago as \u201cthe poster boy of violence in America.\u201d President-Elect Donald Trump has used Chicago as an argument against tighter gun laws, taking to Twitter to vow federal action if local leaders can\u2019t stanch the tide, a talking point echoed by the National Rifle Association\u2019s top lobbyist.\u000a\u000aBut despite the soundbites, Chicago remains in the middle of the pack when homicide is measured on a per-capita basis. In 2016, the city had a rate of 27.9 killings per 100,000 residents \u2014 half that of St. Louis, whose 188 murders amounted to 59.3 homicides per 100,000 people and preserved that city\u2019s status as America\u2019s murder capital. Baltimore placed second, with a homicide rate of 51.2, followed by Detroit, New Orleans, and Cleveland. \u201cBecause Chicago has so many people, it can get a murder every day, and that gets people\u2019s attention,\u201d John Pfaff, a professor of law at Fordham Law School, told The Trace recently. \u201cWhen you focus on numbers, not rates, Chicago ends up looking worse because you forget just how big a city it is.\u201d\u000a\u000aNor was Chicago unique in notching a steep year-over-year increase in its murder rate in 2016. Louisville tallied 112 homicides by the end of November, for a 40 percent increase in its murder rate over last year. Memphis matched Chicago with a 59 percent rise in its homicide rate as it totaled 214 killings by mid-December. Killings in San Antonio spiked to a 20-year per capita high, reaching a total of 10.3 per 100,00 residents \u2014 a 61 percent increase over last year.\u000a\u000aJust as criminologists warn against focusing on raw homicide totals, they also caution against fixating on a single year\u2019s statistics. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at one moment in time,\u201d Jaclyn Schildkraut, professor in the public justice department at the State University of New York told the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cBeing able to look at [crime] over time is very important because it\u2019ll give you a picture of what\u2019s going on in a community.\u201d When The Trace crunched Chicago\u2019s five year average last October, covering the years 2010 to 2015, the city came in eighteenth among the 82 American cities with populations greater than 250,000. Updating the same calculations to cover homicide rates for the years 2011 to 2016, Chicago\u2019s falls to twelfth.\u000a\u000aIf some scholars of crime had their way, discussions of homicide rates would focus not on cities, but on the few urban neighborhoods where the phenomenon of murder inequality is especially stark. In St. Louis, which has had the country\u2019s highest homicide rate since 2014, violence is concentrated within neighborhoods like the Greater Ville, where the homicide rate per capita is close to 300. According to police data, almost half of the city\u2019s killings occur in only eight of its 79 neighborhoods. The unequal distribution of violence applies to Chicago, too. Five police districts, which contain only 8 percent of city\u2019s population, recorded an estimated 32 percent of its murders in 2016.\u000a\u000aAs in part years, a disproportionate share of Chicago\u2019s homicide victims were young African-American men, killed in alleys and on street corners when an altercation was made deadly by the use of a firearm. A report released this week by the University of Chicago Crime Lab sought to identify what\u2019s driving the spike in violence. It found that conditions commonly believed to influence gun crime \u2014 unemployment and poverty rates, availability of social services, mistrust in institutions, and public policy \u2014 did not change abruptly from 2015 to last year, and cannot directly explain the increase in murders. \u201cOne key implication of these data is the importance of a policy response that is focused on the core problem,\u201d the report reads. \u201cViolence concentrated largely in a moderate number of our most disadvantaged neighborhoods, carried out by teens and young adults in public places with illegally owned, and perhaps increasingly lethal, firearms.\u201d\u000a\u000a*The city of Orlando has excluded the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting from its 2016 homicide count. Its adjusted rate was not high enough to place the city among the 20 with the highest murder rates for last year.\u000a\u000aCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the San Antonio homicide rate in 2016 as 151 per 100,000 residents. It was in fact 10.3 per 100,000 residents, and the total number of homicides that year was 151.

aVAt a conference in mid-July, Barack Obama\u2019s CIA director, John Brennan, remarked that executive branch officials have an \u201cobligation \u2026 to refuse to carry out\u201d outrageous or anti-democratic orders from President Donald Trump. The comment quickly caught the attention of Rush Limbaugh, who saw nothing short of a threat to the republic. \u201cHe practically called for a coup!\u201d the radio host bellowed on the air a few days later, warning of a plot orchestrated by \u201cembeds in the deep state at the Pentagon, State Department, various intelligence agencies.\u201d\u000a\u000aEmbeds in the what? A year ago, the term \u201cdeep state\u201d was the province of Edward Snowden acolytes and fans of paperback espionage thrillers. Today, Limbaugh takes it for granted that his millions of listeners know what it meant.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe deep state entered America\u2019s national discourse in 2017 with the feeling of an already familiar character, ready to assume a starring role as hero or villain\u2014depending on how you feel about Trump. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the idea as the breathless complaint of a frustrated president who hasn\u2019t learned to work the system. But it\u2019s not that simple: There really is a kind of cabal that operates independently of elected officials in Washington\u2014even if it\u2019s not quite what Trump or his conservative allies think it is.\u000a\u000aPolitical scientists and foreign policy experts have used the term deep state for years to describe individuals and institutions who exercise power independent of\u2014and sometimes over\u2014civilian political leaders. They applied it mainly to developing countries like Algeria, Pakistan, Egypt and Turkey, where generals and spies called the real shots in nominally democratic societies and replaced elected leaders when they saw fit. (Turkey and Egypt have recently moved to more overt security-state dictatorships, in which the deep state is the only state.)\u000a\u000aFor a generation, the people who saw something like an American deep state\u2014even if they rarely called it that\u2014resided on the left, not the right. The 9/11 attacks triggered the rapid growth of an opaque security and intelligence machine often unaccountable to the civilian legal system. In the 2000s, the critique focused on a \u201cwar machine\u201d of military and intelligence officials, defense contractors and neoconservative ideologues who, in some versions, took orders directly from Vice President Dick Cheney. In the Obama era, the focus shifted to the eerie precision of \u201ctargeted killings\u201d by drones, and then the furor over Snowden, the ex-National Security Agency contractor whose 2013 leaks exposed the astonishing reach of the government\u2019s surveillance. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a deep state,\u201d Snowden told the Nation in 2014. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d\u000a\u000aEven measured academics began to describe a dual-state system in the United States, the focus of Tufts University international law professor Michael J. Glennon\u2019s 2014 book, National Security and Double Government. Glennon observed that Obama had campaigned against Bush-era surveillance and security policies in 2008 but acquiesced to many of them as president\u2014suggesting a national-security apparatus that holds sway even over the elected leaders notionally in charge of it.\u000a\u000aEnter Donald Trump. After January 2017, the unaccountable string-pulling bureaucracy suddenly came to seem, especially to liberals, less a sinister cabal than a crucial check on a president determined to blow up the system we had come to take for granted. Trump was openly hostile to much of the government he now ran, and its institutions began fighting back, sometimes in public ways. They did so with a combination of the severe (leaks of Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders) and the absurd (critical tweets from federal accounts like that of the National Park Service). To Trump and his allies, the new president is now the victim of conspiratorial bureaucrats threatened by a president trying to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d In August, after Environmental Protection Agency employees alerted the New York Times to an EPA report on climate change they feared would be quashed, a headline at the conservative Breitbart News website shouted: \u201cDeep State Teams with Fake News.\u201d Even more anxiety swirls around classified information: In July, the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report that found the Trump administration was being hit by national security leaks \u201con a nearly daily basis\u201d and at a far higher rate than its predecessors encountered. (After the report was picked up in the conservative media, Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. tweeted a link to it. \u201cIf there ever was confirmation that the Deep State is real, illegal & endangers national security, it\u2019s this,\u201d he wrote.)\u000a\u000aThus have the old battle lines flipped. Conservatives who once dismissed concerns about political abuse of NSA surveillance now complain about intelligence leaks linking Trump associates to the Kremlin; liberals who not long ago were denouncing the CIA for its unaccountable power have discovered new affection for the heroes at Langley who might uncover impeachment-worthy dirt.\u000a\u000aBeneath the politics of convenience is the reality that a large segment of the U.S. government really does operate without much transparency or public scrutiny, and has abused its awesome powers in myriad ways. And sometimes the government bureaucracy really does exercise power over the commander in chief: Obama felt that the military pressured him into sending more troops to Afghanistan than he had wanted, while an inexperienced George W. Bush was arguably led to war by a bipartisan cadre of national security insiders who had long wanted to take out Saddam Hussein.\u000a\u000aEven the Trump critique about the deep state in revolt, however exaggerated, is worth consideration. Hillary Clinton voters might delight in the classified material gushing forth about the president\u2019s men\u2014but its release can be criminal. (In May, Brennan called the intelligence leaks \u201cappalling.\u201d) Yes, the president could be covering up misdeeds of his own, raising thorny ends-and-means questions. But Trump haters should consider the precedent\u2014and how they would feel if, say, a President Kamala Harris were to enter the White House in 2021 and be hobbled by a similar blizzard of leaks from intelligence officials who consider her soft on terrorism.\u000a\u000aWhether any of this means there is a deep state in America depends on your definition. Powerful bureaucrats with access to government secrets and trusted media friends certainly do try to influence presidents from the shadows. But in Washington, at least, their views and goals are not monolithic. And unlike their counterparts in the developing world, they do tend to execute the orders they\u2019re given by the president, however grudgingly\u2014and are committed to upholding the rule of law.\u000a\u000aSome of the subversion and leaks Trump has faced are merely federal employees defending their turf from budget cuts and bone-headed ideas. That\u2019s far from the way the right-wing blogger Mike Cernovich described matters in August, when he told fellow conspiracy theorist and talk-radio host Alex Jones that the deep state would turn, literally, murderous: \u201cTrump will be killed. \u2026 They\u2019re going to kill us, they\u2019re going to kill him, they\u2019re going to kill everybody.\u201d\u000a\u000aFor Trump, a man who has always defined himself against caricatured enemies, the deep state is a useful boogeyman that allows him to merge several disparate political targets\u2014real, exaggerated and imagined\u2014into a single villain he can use to rally his supporters. The media\u2019s role is particularly crucial: When Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted on June 16 that he would open his show that night with an examination of \u201cthe deep state\u2019s allies in the media,\u201d the president of the United States retweeted him. It\u2019s not easy to make conservatives distrust law enforcement and intelligence officials, but showing them to be in league with snotty liberal reporters makes that possible.\u000a\u000aAnd so, after Trump\u2019s fired FBI director, James Comey, admitted in June that he had relayed accounts of his bizarre interactions with the president to a friend, who in turn shared them with a New York Times reporter, former Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski appeared on NBC and attacked Comey as \u201cpart of the deep state.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s everything that\u2019s wrong in Washington.\u201d It was as clever as it was insidious. Americans might be foggy about what, exactly, the deep state really is. But Washington they know\u2014and know they hate.\u000a\u000aMichael Crowley is senior foreign affairs correspondent for Politico.

aVForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto of Hungary | ATTILA KISBENEDEK/AFP via Getty Images Hungary says refugee ruling \u2018raped\u2019 EU law \u2018The real battle is only just beginning,\u2019 foreign minister declares.\u000a\u000aBUDAPEST \u2014 The Hungarian government rejected the European Court of Justice\u2019s verdict supporting the legality of the European Union\u2019s refugee relocation scheme, calling the decision political.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe ruling issued by the European Court of Justice in the migrant quota case is outrageous and irresponsible,\u201d said Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó at a press conference Wednesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real battle is only just beginning,\u201d he added. \u201cPolitics has raped European law.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed on Wednesday Slovakia and Hungary\u2019s case against a 2015 plan to relocate more than 100,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece over a period of two years.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate,\u201d the ECJ said in a statement announcing its ruling.\u000a\u000aHungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the 2015 relocation scheme. The plan ultimately provided for the redistribution of up to 160,000 people across member countries, including 1,294 refugees to Hungary. But less than 28,000 refugees have been transferred as of September 1 \u2014 a fact that Central European leaders like to point out as evidence of the plan\u2019s shortcomings.\u000a\u000aWhile the Hungarian government has vowed to continue fighting quotas following the Court\u2019s decision, Minister of Justice László Trócsányi did not specify new legal measures, saying that Hungary\u2019s next steps depend on the European Commission\u2019s actions.\u000a\u000aThe government will defend \u201cHungary\u2019s sovereignty, constitution, and identity,\u201d said Trócsányi, adding that the Commission is violating countries\u2019 rights.\u000a\u000aThe Hungarian leadership has repeatedly emphasized that its Central European neighbors continue to share Budapest\u2019s tough stance on refugees, but the bloc\u2019s unity on the issue appears to be eroding.\u000a\u000a\u201cSlovakia fully respects the verdict of the European Court of Justice,\u201d Peter Susko, spokesman for Slovakia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said. \u201cWe retain the opinion, however, that the so-called relocation compulsory quotas failed to work in real life.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will actively work to express solidarity with countries most affected by the problem of migration using solutions better suited to fit the purpose other than accepting migrants who have no desire or intention to remain in our country.\u201d\u000a\u000aPoland, however, remains committed to supporting Hungary in not accepting relocated refugees.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe were taking into account the possibility of such a ruling. The ruling does not change the policy of our government,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Beata Szyd\u0142o told reporters on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aPoland initially supported the plan, but ultimately refused to take in refugees after the conservative Law and Justice party came to office in 2015.\u000a\u000aEuropean Commissioner for Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos praised the court decision Wednesday, urging Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to immediately begin showing \u201csolidarity\u201d with Greece and Italy, and drop their refusal to accept relocated migrants.\u000a\u000aAvramopoulos also said that if they continue to defy the migration policy, the EU will go back to court and seek punitive action.\u000a\u000a\u201cMember states are obliged legally and politically \u2014 I would add even morally \u2014 to do their part and share in a responsible way the principle of solidarity in practice,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aIn June, the EU launched infringement proceedings against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic over their refusal to comply with the refugee relocation program. Thus far, Poland and Hungary have not accepted any relocated refugees, while the Czech Republic has taken in 12.\u000a\u000aSlovakia, on the other hand, has managed to avoid infringement proceedings by pledging to accept more refugees.\u000a\u000aHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has based his upcoming reelection campaign on preventing migrants from coming into Hungary.\u000a\u000aOn August 31, the Hungarian government asked the European Union to finance half of the cost of its southern border fence, which was constructed to prevent migrants from entering the country.\u000a\u000aThe request, however, was promptly rejected.\u000a\u000a\u201cSolidarity is a two-way street. There are times in which member states may expect to receive support, and times in which they, in turn, should stand ready to contribute,\u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker wrote in a letter to Orbán, obtained by POLITICO.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnd solidarity is not an à-la-carte dish; one that can be chosen for border management, and rejected when it comes to complying with relocation decisions that have been jointly agreed.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis article has been updated with reaction from Dimitris Avramopoulos.

aVEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani speaks at a press conference in Brussels | Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images Antonio Tajani: EU must keep the door open for Turkey European Parliament president says \u2018we need to keep on talking and push Turkey to change its line.\u2019\u000a\u000aThe European Union should end Turkey\u2019s membership talks on only one condition: if Ankara brings back the death penalty, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said Wednesday.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult today for Turkey to get into the European Union, but we cannot close the chapter,\u201d Tajani told POLITICO during an interview in his office. \u201cBut we need to send clear messages: the death penalty is not acceptable for us\u201d and if Ankara decided to reintroduce it, then there\u2019s \u201cevery chance\u201d dialogue would be closed.\u000a\u000aThe former European commissioner said there were a number of problems with Turkey, including its stance on \u201cpersonal freedom and freedom of opinion. It\u2019s unacceptable that there are journalists in jail,\u201d Tajani said, adding that he has raised these issues with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\u000a\u000aIn March 2015, the EU signed a deal with Turkey to take back refugees crossing into Europe in exchange for breathing fresh life into long-stalled EU membership talks. But tensions with Ankara have increased since an attempted coup last summer and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s subsequent crackdown on opponents. The sweeping new powers that Erdo\u011fan gained after a close-run referendum in April have made matter worse for some EU countries.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said \u201cTurkey should not become an EU member,\u201d a line shared by her rival for the German chancellorship Martin Schulz and by the Austrian government.\u000a\u000aMerkel said during an election TV debate that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee a mandate to expand the customs union [deal with Turkey] under the current circumstances.\u201d An upgrade of the customs union agreement was one of the main points in the 2015 deal.\u000a\u000aTajani, who when elected president of the European Parliament said he wanted to be \u201ca good spokesperson\u201d for the assembly, took a different line from fellow MEPs. In June, the Parliament called for Turkey\u2019s accession talks to be suspended if Ankara implemented plans to expand Erdo\u011fan\u2019s powers.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to Turkey, Tajani said, \u201cthe dialogue must be open because we have the problem of migration, of the fight against terrorism, we need to keep on talking and push Turkey to change its line.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs for an upgrade of the customs union deal, \u201cit depends on how the situation evolves \u2026 if there\u2019s a negative or a positive evolution.\u201d

aV\u201cThis is about young people who grew up in America \u2014 kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag,\u201d he said. \u201cThese DREAMers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.\u201d\u000a\u000aObama noted that politicians on both sides of the aisle have pushed for legislation that would allow these young people to stay in the country and earn citizenship if they were willing to attend college or enlist in the military. He said congressional inaction forced his administration to take action to protect them from deportation.\u000a\u000aRelated slideshow: Immigrants and advocates rally in support of DACA >>>\u000a\u000a\u201cTo target these young people is wrong \u2013 because they have done nothing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is self-defeating \u2014 because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel.\u201d\u000a\u000aAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced earlier Tuesday that the Trump administration would start phasing out Obama\u2019s program, which he characterized \u201cunilateral executive amnesty,\u201d on March 5, 2018. He called upon Congress to present the president with replacement legislation by that time that would offer the estimated 800,000 young undocumented immigrants a road to legal status.\u000a\u000aFormer Vice President Joe Biden also released a statement opposing the Trump administration\u2019s decision. He recounted a story of a young girl who grew up in the U.S. but now must live in fear that she would be sent back to a country she has never known.\u000a\u000a\u201cThese people are all Americans. So let\u2019s be clear: Throwing them out is cruel. It is inhumane. And it is not America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cCongress and the American people now have an obligation to step up and show our neighbors that they\u2019re welcome here, in the only place they\u2019ve ever called home.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough Obama has publicly opposed many of Trump\u2019s proposals and actions \u2014 both as a candidate and a president \u2014 this recent statement is his most forceful since leaving office. Last January, in his first public statement since leaving office, Obama said that \u201cAmerican values are at stake\u201d as Trump moved forward with his travel ban.\u000a\u000aHere is the complete Obama statement as posted on his Facebook page:\u000a\u000a\u201cImmigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules.\u000a\u000aBut that\u2019s not what the action that the White House took today is about. This is about young people who grew up in America \u2013 kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they\u2019re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver\u2019s license.\u000a\u000aOver the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people \u2013 our young people \u2013 that if your parents brought you here as a child, if you\u2019ve been here a certain number of years, and if you\u2019re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then you\u2019ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship. And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill.\u000a\u000aThat bill never came. And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country. We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm. Deportations of criminals went up. Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks. And America grew stronger as a result.\u000a\u000aBut today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong \u2013 because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating \u2013 because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. What if our kid\u2019s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn\u2019t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s be clear: the action taken today isn\u2019t required legally. It\u2019s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn\u2019t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kid\u2019s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out won\u2019t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone\u2019s taxes, or raise anybody\u2019s wages.\u000a\u000aIt is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today. And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it\u2019s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future. I\u2019m heartened by those who\u2019ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.\u000a\u000aUltimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we\u2019d want our own kids to be treated. It\u2019s about who we are as a people \u2013 and who we want to be.\u000a\u000aWhat makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals \u2013 that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. That\u2019s how America has traveled this far. That\u2019s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union.\u201d

aVJean-Claude Juncker risks going down in history as the man who lost Britain. He now has two years to become the man who charted the path forward for Europe instead.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in an extended interview last month at his office in the Berlaymont, the president of the European Commission laid out his thoughts for the year ahead, including his intention to use his State of the European Union speech next week to push for greater EU integration \u2014 without losing less enthusiastic Eastern European countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I am not an integration fanatic, I am very much in favor of deepening the European Union and at the same time respecting to the fullest extent justified, national interests,\u201d he said. He excluded treaty changes in the short term, \u201ceven though they would be necessary\u201d down the line.\u000a\u000aOnce disparaged as the tippling captain of a sinking ship, Juncker said that he, like the EU, is on an upswing, with populism on the wane (for now), Brexit negotiations under control and the bloc\u2019s economy on a slow but steady incline. The sentiment is captured by the theme he has chosen for his yearly agenda-setting speech: \u201cSailing with the wind!\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is a dramatic turnaround of fortunes for the bloc and its president. A year ago, both were written off by many.\u000a\u000aYet as Juncker now pushes an ambitious vision that touches on many areas of the EU, from the economy to security, his track record in three years in office offers reasons for skepticism about his chances of success. His tenure has been marked by at least as many lows as highs, from Brexit and the migration crisis to barely contained complaints about his personal health and remote management style.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe 2017 speech is indeed more important than the 2018 one. So, I think about delivering my own view on things\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000aHaving declared his tenure a \u201clast chance\u201d for Europe and himself as the head of a \u201cpolitical Commission,\u201d the former prime minister of Luxembourg hasn\u2019t restored the office to the heights of influence last seen in Jacques Delors\u2019 tenure in Brussels more than 20 years ago. Whereas then the institution\u2019s power of initiative was unquestioned, any current occupant must grapple with the reality of empowered national capitals, none more so than Berlin, and skepticism about Europe\u2019s ability to provide the answers to peoples\u2019 problems.\u000a\u000aBut Juncker is the ultimate survivor, a politician who has worked the frontlines of power on the Continent over three decades. He\u2019s in the home stretch of what he says is his first and last term in Brussels, and presumably his final job in politics. Even detractors within the Berlaymont \u2014 who sometimes bristle at being left out of a small circle of decision-makers composed of Juncker and his closest aide, Martin Selmayr \u2014 have noted a reenergized swing in the president\u2019s step.\u000a\u000a\u2018Personal manifesto\u2019\u000a\u000aJuncker\u2019s proposals, to be pursued in his final, full work-year before the 2019 European election, will include expanded military cooperation, concerted action on trade and trade defense, and the transformation of the European Stability Mechanism into a permanent safety net to protect not just national budgets but the pocketbooks and quality of life of the bloc\u2019s citizens.\u000a\u000aMost important, for Juncker\u2019s legacy at least, the speech is his last chance to lay the ground for being remembered as the Commission president who healed the bleeding wound caused by the first ever exit of an EU country.\u000a\u000aChatter has begun about who will replace him in 2019, and little to no policymaking is expected to take place between the European parliamentary election in May or June 2019 and the end of Juncker\u2019s term that fall.\u000a\u000aJuncker called next week\u2019s State of the Union substantively more important than next year\u2019s address, which will serve as a valedictory one and as a call to arms for his successor, but less as a policy blueprint.\u000a\u000aThe initiatives Juncker unveils will offer a window into his preferences for the EU\u2019s future \u2014 a debate he and his College of Commissioners kick-started in a \u201cwhite paper\u201d earlier this year. While the white paper laid out five potential pathways for Europe, Juncker\u2019s speech will in many ways serve as a roadmap for the so-called sixth scenario that he has hinted at in recent days.\u000a\u000aJuncker told POLITICO that he has spent the past months consulting governments, national parliaments, unions and trade associations, and his commissioners, but that said, he is inclined to use the address in Strasbourg as a personal manifesto. So the advice he received from his commissioners at an annual retreat last week will not necessarily be adopted, which critics would note would be far from the first time that has happened.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m asking myself if I shouldn\u2019t take the opportunity to say what I myself am thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 2017 speech is indeed more important than the 2018 one. So, I think about delivering my own view on things.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat he envisions is an EU where decision-making is streamlined, allowing the bloc to act more nimbly in areas where greater cooperation is needed and desired, while also drawing bright lines around areas of national sovereignty where he believes the capitals are right to demand their due deference.\u000a\u000aThe chalice Juncker is reaching for is balance. An underwhelming speech might consign him as the Brexit-only president; overly bold proposals risk being blocked by the more cautious EU countries (and ambition stops easily where money is involved).\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a window of opportunity,\u201d said Selmayr, Juncker\u2019s chief of staff. And when there is, \u201cyou can make two mistakes: overshoot or undershoot.\u201d\u000a\u000aEast-West divide\u000a\u000aJuncker, who served 19 years as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister before taking the helm in Brussels, is seeking to take full advantage of this moment to push his ideas \u2014 but he\u2019s also aware of the need to navigate the shoals of national interest.\u000a\u000aOn Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda warned sharply against pushing for deeper integration while others hold back, a concept known as a \u201cmultispeed Europe.\u201d Such a move, Duda warned, could break up the bloc.\u000a\u000aCriticized for ignoring and almost never visiting the Eastern EU states, Juncker insisted he was aware of the need to balance their desires with those of older, Western members of the club. \u201cThis weighs on my thinking and doing, because I always have to ask myself: If I propose this or that, then I immediately have a difference between East and West,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a topic for the future that we need to tackle right now. I put a lot of effort into [talking to Slovakian Prime Minister Robert] Fico and [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe said he made less of an effort with the Polish government, with whom the Commission has been feuding over controversial reforms to the country\u2019s governance structure. Warsaw, he said, will be \u201cmore lonely after Brexit.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne country Juncker doesn\u2019t have to worry too much about is the United Kingdom. Longstanding British aversion to \u201can ever closer union\u201d was reflected in the U.K.\u2019s resistance to EU military integration and in its refusal to join the euro common currency zone.\u000a\u000aEurozone rising\u000a\u000aBrexit\u2019s silver lining, Juncker noted, is that without the U.K. it will be both far easier and far more necessary to better coordinate the bloc\u2019s fiscal policies and priorities.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a period of a happiness about the future in front of us, from now to March next year\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen the British leave, 85 percent of GDP comes from within the euro area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all the more urgent to ask how this monetary union can be accompanied by a stronger coordination of economic policy. This is actually the topic of a future European finance minister, who probably should rather be an economics minister rather than a finance minister.\u201d By pushing for someone from a traditionally less powerful ministry, Juncker signals that the role would be somewhat diminished, and focused on coordinating economic policies rather than telling national governments how much to spend or not.\u000a\u000aThe creation of an EU finance minister, which already has the crucial support of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, would further cement Juncker\u2019s legacy as a champion of the EU, and allow him to boast of fulfilling a major promise from his campaign for Commission president in 2014.\u000a\u000a\u201cBoth [Merkel and Macron] and everyone else must then agree on what the sphere of influence of a European finance minister can be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be so that this European finance minister won\u2019t be able nor [be] allowed to interfere in the sovereign right of national parliaments as regards the budget. You just have to figure it out.\u201d\u000a\u000aJuncker and his team also see an opportunity to press for the transformation of the European Stability Mechanism into a sort of European International Monetary Fund \u2014 ready to step in when an EU economy hits the rocks. That would allow the EU to declare victory in managing the financial hurricane that followed the 2008 financial crisis, and better prepare for similar events in the future.\u000a\u000aJuncker expressed particular gratification for the weaker-than-expected poll ratings of the far-right Alternative for Germany ahead of the German election on September 24, where Merkel is expected to win comfortably.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a \u201cstroke of luck,\u201d he said, that Germany\u2019s major parties \u2014 Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and former European Parliament President Martin Schulz\u2019s Social Democrats \u2014 \u201carticulate themselves clearly in pro-European way.\u201d\u000a\u000aA new Franco-German alliance \u2014 driven by Macron in France and Merkel in Germany \u2014 \u201cis undoubtedly a power plant for Europe,\u201d Juncker said, and an opportunity that should not be wasted. \u201cThere\u2019s a period of a happiness about the future in front of us, from now to March next year.\u201d

aVWhen President Donald Trump boarded Air Force One Tuesday morning to survey the flood wreckage across southeastern Texas, two of the most crucial figures onboard\u2014and people with the most at stake\u2014were barely noted by press reports: Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon and a career agency employee named James Rivera.\u000a\u000aMcMahon, the former pro wrestling executive, runs an agency that has become the front line of American disaster lending. Through its Office of Disaster Assistance, run by Rivera, the 28-year veteran, the SBA made over $11 billion in loans after Hurricane Katrina, and more than $2 billion after Superstorm Sandy\u2014most of those to distressed homeowners with no business claims at all. Since its inception in 1953, it has issued more than 2 million loans for more than $54 billion.\u000a\u000aIt has not gone smoothly. After both Katrina and Sandy, the natural disaster was followed by a bureaucratic one, as an agency whose main job is small-business boosterism suddenly transforms into America\u2019s last-ditch emergency lender. After Katrina, the SBA needed an average of more than 65 days to process disaster loan applications\u2014a delay that led to a congressional backlash and major reforms. When Sandy struck, the agency was again unprepared; it took SBA an average of around 40 days to process loan applications.\u000a\u000aAppalled by the Katrina delays, Congress created three new emergency loan programs to get loans to people much faster\u2014but the agency never implemented any of them, a casualty of bureaucratic inertia, miscommunication and poor program design.\u000a\u000aNow, after Hurricane Harvey deposited more than 50 inches of rain in some parts of Texas, Rivera and the Office of Disaster Assistance are gearing up to prove they\u2019ve learned their lessons. Earlier this year, under grilling from lawmakers, Rivera assured the House Small Business Committee hearing that his office was \u201cas prepared as we\u2019ve ever been\u201d for a major disaster. But he also offered a warning. \u201cThe trend is in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, I hate to say this, until we are able to process a disaster like Sandy or Katrina, we are going to continue to have these same discussions.\u201d\u000a\u000aBy all accounts, Harvey will be a multi-billion dollar cleanup on the scale of Sandy and Katrina. The question now is whether SBA is actually prepared for such a disaster\u2014or whether past problems will resurface once again. \u201cThis is a real test for all the improvements they\u2019ve worked on,\u201d said Jane Campbell, director of advocacy at the National Development Council and formerly the staff director on the Senate Small Business Committee.\u000a\u000aIn the days after a disaster, as homeowners and businesses return to their property and assess the damage, rebuilding can appear daunting. Businesses need money to remove debris, replace broken equipment and pay their employees\u2014but their customers may be stranded elsewhere, cutting off their cash flow. Homeowners need money to rebuild their homes and replace their property, but they may have trouble even finding the basic papers they need to apply for loans. This creates big challenges for normal lenders. \u201cYou don\u2019t say to someone who is flooded out, Can you give me a deed to your property and mortgage?\u201d said Campbell, who is also the former mayor of Cleveland\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s where the SBA\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance is supposed to help. It\u2019s not exactly clear why a business agency had ended up responsible for such a broad loan portfolio, but the SBA is broadly tasked with helping communities develop economically after a disaster, and lending is a linchpin. It has a careful playbook for responding for disasters, involving setting up field offices, calling up reserve loan officers and adjusting work schedules to quickly get information to disaster victims. SBA can access information in the public domain, like a mortgage, reducing the burden on homeowners, and open service centers so people without access to a computer or the Internet can fill out online forms. It can also provide loans not just for physical property damage but also for economic injuries, covering business expenses that the business could have otherwise paid. Borrowers must still prove to the SBA that they are likely to repay their loan\u2014these aren\u2019t grants\u2014so a high percentage of applications are rejected. But after a disaster, victims\u2014especially businesses\u2014don\u2019t have many options. Said Jeff Sjostrom, president of the Galveston Economic Development Partnership, \u201cUnfortunately, the reality is there are very few sources of gap financing after a natural disaster.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis process makes sense, experts agree, but the agency has struggled mightily in the past. After Katrina, the agency faced major technological difficulties and didn\u2019t have the staffing needed to quickly process loan applications, leading to long delays. The money eventually flowed\u2014more than $11 billion in loans in total\u2014but the application process took months and many businesses went bust in the meantime. The agency had similar problems after Sandy when it underestimated the number of loan applications and delayed increasing staffing.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe real dilemma we had in the previous disasters is getting the decisions in a timely manner,\u201d said Campbell, who also said she had confidence in Rivera.\u000a\u000aCongress passed legislation in 2008 with 26 different reforms, including the creation of the three new emergency loan programs designed to get money to disaster victims in as little as 36 hours. Under these programs, SBA wouldn\u2019t lend money directly, but would instead encourage private sector lenders to make the loans, with the government guaranteeing 85 percent of the loan if a borrower defaulted. But, as POLITICO reported, the three programs never made a single loan. In fact, they were never even launched. Lawmakers grew increasingly frustrated with the agency over the slow implementation process, but even after Rivera testified multiple times that private lenders simply wouldn\u2019t participate in the programs on the loan terms, which are set by statute, Congress hasn\u2019t made any changes to the underlying law.\u000a\u000aAlmost a decade later, the fate of the programs is unclear. Rep. Steve Chabot, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, blamed the Obama administration for failing to implement the legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day at the SBA and we hope that this administration takes our recommendations seriously to better help small businesses when disaster strikes,\u201d he said in a statement. But SBA now says the programs aren\u2019t needed at all because the agency now has the capacity to get more money to people far more quickly. Carol Chastang, a spokeswoman at SBA, said in an email that the agency\u2019s recent improvements in disaster response, including the ability to provide unsecured disaster loans up to $25,000, \u201cprovide immediate disaster funds on a permanent basis, eliminating the need for the short-term assistance provided by [the three emergency loan programs]. That makes things easier for survivors, who have better things to do with their time than fill out multiple loan applications.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs of Wednesday, the agency had already received 1,210 applications and was calling up temporary staffers to assist with the expected heavy load of applications. Two loan applications have been approved so far, for $141,600 in total, and SBA has 68 field staffers working on Harvey. As Harvey continues to sweep across the Gulf Coast, migrating from the Houston region to New Orleans, it\u2019s too early to tell how many more will follow. If previous disasters are any indication, it will be in the tens of thousands. \u201cThe SBA is prepared\u2014for the long haul\u2014to respond to the recovery needs of residents and business owners rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey,\u201d said Chastang\u000a\u000aAt the April congressional hearing, Rivera expressed confidence to lawmakers that the Office of Disaster Assistance could likely handle a Katrina-style event. After flooding in Baton Rouge last August, he pointed out, average processing time for business disaster loans was just 12 days and home disaster loans was just eight days. But the agency received just 66,000 applications after that flooding, compared to 385,000 after Katrina, and experts believe that Harvey is closer to a Katrina-magnitude disaster. Which means, as Rivera said at the hearing, it\u2019s impossible to know if the SBA is truly prepared for a major disaster. Said Campbell, \u201cThis is the road test.\u201d

aVScores of gang takedowns this year, resulting in about 900 arrests, took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in gang-related crimes, police officials said.\u000a\u000a\u201cPrecision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence, which in a significant amount of cases are gangs,\u201d said Stephen P. Davis, the department\u2019s chief spokesman. \u201cBy going after the gang members, arresting them, we recognize the resultant reduction in violence.\u201d\u000a\u000aViolent crime has been more persistent in some communities, especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department, in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy low-level enforcement and aggressive tactics like stop-and-frisk, has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime, said David M. Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\u000a\u000a\u201cNew York City, in many ways, convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that, you should not do it, and there are much, much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities, most notably Chicago, which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides.\u000a\u000aThe New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the department\u2019s Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime, as well as the ever-changing tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Murders in which drugs were the primary motive, for example, dropped to 29 in 2016, from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly, to 57 last year from 49 in 2015.\u000a\u000aCriminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders, but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent, because it can escalate inside homes, without the police being notified.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aMr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results, but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York.\u000a\u000aFewer people were murdered with guns in 2016, but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73, from 50 the year before.\u000a\u000aMurders and shootings on the street, in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12, from three the year before, and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly, murders indoors ticked up by 19, while outdoor murders fell by 49.\u000a\u000aAbout a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., and more than half happened between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m.\u000a\u000aThe biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a \u201cdispute.\u201d Of those, the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged, followed by disputes over a man or woman, over money, and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act, two by gambling and two by road rage.\u000a\u000aJust under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest, and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads.\u000a\u000aForty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest, and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance, a category that would include cases in which the person suspected of being the killer was murdered before an arrest was made.

aVSugar made from beets in France | Philippe Huguen/AFP via Getty Images Europe\u2019s sugar firms fear an October surprise As a system of strict sugar quotas ends, some will get more cash; others pain.\u000a\u000aMany of Europe\u2019s sugar businesses are looking to October with a sense of fear and uncertainty as the sector faces its biggest overhaul in decades.\u000a\u000aAt the beginning of the month, Brussels will lift a purdah that has shielded beet growers from the ravages of the open market since the 1960s.\u000a\u000aThe European Commission now runs the sugar market, specifying how much sugar beet countries can grow while simultaneously paying farmers a fixed price. This system \u2014 in parallel with high tariffs on sugar cane imports from the rest of the world \u2014 largely cossets beet farmers from the boom and bust of other commodity markets.\u000a\u000aBut this sugar regime ends on October 1 \u2014 an event many fear will spur previously hamstrung businesses to churn out more sugar and send prices tumbling.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s a precedent for such a scenario. In 2015, the Commission ended milk quotas, which \u2014 alongside a disastrous combination of lower oil prices and Russia\u2019s food import ban \u2014 led to vast milk overproduction, sending prices into a death spiral and forcing thousands of farms to shut. Brussels mobilized \u20ac1 billion to stave off total collapse.\u000a\u000aBrussels and most farmers have drawn lessons from that crisis and are confident a sugar shock won\u2019t compare to the milk one. While some are certain to go out of business, most worry about the uncertainty of modifying a system whose fundamentals have puttered along unchanged since its introduction in 1968.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a new era,\u201d said Rafa\u0142 Strachota, the director of the Polish beet growers\u2019 lobby KZPBC. \u201cWe do not really know what will happen.\u201d\u000a\u000aMarie-Christine Ribera, director general of sugar manufacturers\u2019 lobby CEFS, said that the overriding feeling was one of uncertainty.\u000a\u000aBrooding in beet country\u000a\u000aEurope\u2019s sugar sector is dominated by sugar beet, a turnip-shaped root that thrives in the damp and loamy soils of Northern Europe. Some 1.5 million hectares of the European Union \u2014 an area slightly larger than Montenegro \u2014 are devoted to the crop.\u000a\u000aThe Continent\u2019s relationship with beets is a global exception, however. The world receives about 80 percent of its sugar through cane, a tropical crop, while beet processing in Europe makes up the remainder.\u000a\u000aThis quirk harks back to the Napoleonic wars, when British gunboats blockaded the trade routes to France\u2019s Caribbean possessions, effectively cutting off mainland Europe\u2019s access to sugar. French Emperor Napoléon Bonaparte invested heavily in embryonic beet-refining technology to overcome the shortage.\u000a\u000aIn 1968, Brussels was designing a farm policy to keep consumer prices fair while seeking to avoid extreme market volatility. The Commission introduced its production quotas and a floor price, which is set at \u20ac26 per metric ton.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s been a very stable system,\u201d Ribera said.\u000a\u000aThe great fear is discarding this system will mean competitive farms use their newfound freedom to plant more beets, which would flood the market and depress prices.\u000a\u000aCEFS, the sugar lobby, and agricultural workers\u2019 union EFFAT, warned in March of a \u201charsher market environment\u201d after quotas. \u201cThis could have consequences for the 28,000 direct workers and 137,000 farmers that depend on the sector, as well as for the vulnerable rural communities, of which sugar factories are often the economic backbone,\u201d the two groups said.\u000a\u000aOverproduction fears are justified. Europe\u2019s largest sugar companies are all set to exploit the new situation to ramp up exports.\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s AB Sugar, for example, says it expects to produce 50 percent more after October.\u000a\u000aWolfgang Heer, the CEO of Europe\u2019s largest refiner, Germany\u2019s Südzucker, said: \u201cWe know that volatility in our sugar sector will increase,\u201d Reuters reported in July. He expects the deregulation to allow his company to expand.\u000a\u000aNo milk crisis 2.0\u000a\u000aBrussels anticipated a milk-style market catastrophe and began releasing sugar-pricing data in July to help businesses and farmers better track the market. It will also allow governments to top up agricultural subsidies for sugar farmers in order to cushion any shocks.\u000a\u000aRuud Schers, a sugar analyst at Rabobank, said the milk and sugar sectors are incomparable. Beet farmers tend to grow other crops such as cereals or potatoes, which shields them from too much market turbulence.\u000a\u000aGrowers can also switch strategy from one year to the next because the beet harvest is annual, he added. Dairy farmers, in contrast, tend to be specialized and cannot as easily rid themselves of cows they bought during flush years.\u000a\u000aEurope already ran the gauntlet of a harrowing sugar reform in 2006. The Commission pushed to pivot the sector closer to world markets by opening up imports from developing countries while lowering the guaranteed sugar price by 36 percent.\u000a\u000aGrower numbers dropped from some 300,000 in 2005 to about 140,000 in 2016, while the number employed in sugar processing fell from about 50,000 to about 30,000 over the same period.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have prepared ourselves,\u201d Ribera said, adding that one factory out of two closed during the 2006 reform.\u000a\u000aCalamity cane\u000a\u000aMany think that Europe\u2019s small but historic cane refiners will receive the strongest post-quota thumping.\u000a\u000aNewer EU countries such as Romania, or those with deep ties to former colonies in the tropics such as Britain and Portugal, still have refineries that use cane sugar \u2014 which they buy under import tariffs they argue are prohibitively high. These refiners fret that even-cheaper beets will undercut them.\u000a\u000aMiguel Geraldes, the CEO of Portuguese cane refiner RAR, said imports account for 70 percent of his costs and he has already slashed personnel. \u201cIf we continue to pay high premium to our suppliers we will be out of business,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe added that to compete fairly with beet growers, the Commission needs to reduce import tariffs. \u201cThe problem is that the Commission doesn\u2019t care,\u201d he said, adding that he would support leaving the EU.\u000a\u000aTate & Lyle Sugars \u2014 Britain\u2019s cane refiner \u2014 backed Brexit for the same reason.\u000a\u000aBrussels points to the fact that cane refiners can import duty-free from developing countries. However, the refiners argue they need access to large producers such as Brazil.\u000a\u000aFor both cane and beet, the end of sugar quotas heralds a great unknown. Yet few really imagine a Europe without its sugar industry.\u000a\u000aRibera said of October 1: \u201cIt really is a revolution \u2014 but it\u2019s just a date.\u201d\u000a\u000aAuthors:

aVEmails from a reporter for the New York Times to government employees obtained exclusively by Breitbart News demonstrate that the newspaper\u2019s employees are not just on the receiving end of leaks, but are actually soliciting government employees to become leakers. What\u2019s more, the emails demonstrate the Times colluded with the president of government union to encourage and solicit these leaks\u2014something that may become highly problematic for both institutions.\u000a\u000a\u201cThanks again for taking the time to speak today,\u201d Coral Davenport, an \u201cEnergy and Environment Correspondent\u201d for the New York Times, writes in an email to John J. O\u2019Grady of the EPA workers\u2019 union. O\u2019Grady is the president of the AFGE Council 238 in Chicago\u2014which represents EPA workers.\u000a\u000aadvertisement\u000a\u000a\u201cAs I mentioned, I\u2019m working on a story looking specifically at concrete examples of unusual secretary at E.P.A.,\u201d Davenport states, continuing:\u000a\u000aI\u2019ve heard a lot of second-hand rumors, but in order to report these incidents, I\u2019d need to have first-hand or eyewitness accounts. I\u2019m looking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so, eyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u000a\u000aThe revelation of these emails comes as President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions crack down on leakers. It also comes as EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, has emerged as one of the most successful cabinet-level officials in the Trump administration, and Trump\u2019s political enemies throughout the left and media aim at targeting Pruitt.\u000a\u000aThe Times has come under significant scrutiny for a piece in late July by Lisa Friedman, one of Davenport\u2019s colleagues, for bashing Pruitt for traveling home regularly to Oklahoma.\u000a\u000a\u201cScott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to his home state, Oklahoma, 10 times over three months this year, largely at taxpayer expense, according to a report released Monday,\u201d Friedman wrote, adding:\u000a\u000aThe findings from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group founded by former E.P.A. officials, are drawn from Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar and the travel expenses he has submitted for reimbursement. Obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the documents show Mr. Pruitt spent 43 out of 92 days from March through May in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state.\u000a\u000aBut, as she buries in the story several paragraphs in, the report she cites \u201cdoes not assert\u201d that anything about Pruitt\u2019s travels back to Oklahoma as EPA administrator is at all \u201cimproper.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn an editorial after the questionable Times piece on Pruitt, the Tulsa World newspaper in Oklahoma mocked the Gray Lady for making a mountain of a mole hill.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we were supposed to be shocked to learn that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends, we\u2019re not,\u201d the Tulsa World\u2019s editorial board wrote under a headline: \u201cHeaven Forfend! Scott Pruitt is going home on weekends!\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s more, Trump himself has ripped the New York Times in recent days via his Twitter account\u2014calling the newspaper \u201ctotally inept\u201d:\u000a\u000aThe failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017\u000a\u000aA Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, told Breitbart News there is nothing abnormal about these emails.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe email demonstrates the process of reporting and gathering facts,\u201d Rhoades-Ha said in an email early Tuesday when seeking comment.\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady, the union official with whom Davenport was colluding per these emails to solicit government leakers, has not responded to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aDavenport continues in her written plea to O\u2019Grady in the email by noting that if he successfully delivers her the government leakers she is soliciting, she will protect their identities.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhile I\u2019d like to speak to staff about these examples, I DON\u2019T need to quote them by name or with any sort of identifying details that could in any way reveal the source of the information,\u201d Davenport writes. She continues:\u000a\u000aWe\u2019re VERY sensitive to the need to protect career folks who speak to us, and we DO NOT want to endanger anyone\u2019s employment. But, in order to ensure that our reporting is based on facts rather than rumors, we do need to feel sure that the examples we give are based on first-hand or eyewitness experiences rather than second and third-hand rumors.\u000a\u000aDavenport then provides her contact information and encourages people to text, call, email, or contact her on the encrypted phone apps Signal or WhatsApp. She provides both her personal email address and her Times email address. Breitbart News has redacted that information from the emails published herein, as well as all personal contact information in the emails.\u000a\u000aShe then continues her plea for leaks and explains the nuts and bolts of how she would go about consolidating leaks into becoming key revelations in a New York Times article down the road.\u000a\u000a\u201cAnother way to do this might be through a combination of your interviews and my reporting,\u201d Davenport writes, adding:\u000a\u000aIf you gave put together multiple eyewitness accounts of a specific example of behavior that demonstrates an unprecedented lack of transparency, we could cite that. Or, if I speak to multiple people who describe, firsthand, such an example, I could cite that without needing any quotations. In general, the more folks I speak to who can offer specific, first-hand accounts of similar phenomena, the more I can write with authority in a broad way with no quotations or identifying details.\u000a\u000aFrom there, she moves on to describe how she has already done this.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve already done this in a number of other stories this year,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cBelow are four stories that I reported with the help of multiple interviews with current EPA employees. Since the employees gave multiple firsthand accounts but could not be quoted, I was able to describe what was going on without naming, quoting, or identifying any of them. The only employees quoted in these stories are those who specifically gave permission to do so \u2014 generally the union leaders. However, the accounts of employees who were not quoted helped to deeply inform the story and allowed me to write with more authority. So looking to do the same this time.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavenport ends her note by telling O\u2019Grady to \u201cfeel free to send this note around to folks who might be willing to chat,\u201d and then includes the links to the four aforementioned Times pieces built on leaks she solicited from inside the EPA.\u000a\u000aThe four pieces that Davenport links in the email are all critical of Pruitt and the Trump administration\u2019s using leakers she admittedly solicited from inside the federal bureaucracy to do so. The headlines of the four pieces she links to are:\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady then forwarded the email from Davenport to a large list of EPA employees. With Davenport\u2019s full message, O\u2019Grady added a note of his own for EPA officials he was encouraging to leak to the New York Times.\u000a\u000a\u201cBelow is an e-mail I received from Coral Davenport of the New York Times,\u201d O\u2019Grady wrote to his colleagues. \u201cShe needs our assistance in verifying some information she has heard.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt includes two bullet points that use wording to describe what Davenport is looking for that is identical to her original email O\u2019Grady. First, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport is \u201clooking for examples of things like, information being communicated only verbally when it would historically have been put in writing, people being told not to bring phones, laptops or even take notes in meetings where they would in the past typically have done so.\u201d Second, O\u2019Grady wrote that Davenport was looking for \u201ceyewitness accounts of things like the administrator or top political appointees refusing to use official email, phones or computers, or any other specific, first-hand examples of practices that appear to demonstrate unprecedented secrecy or transparency.\u201d\u000a\u000aO\u2019Grady wrapped up his email to EPA employees by encouraging them to reach out to Davenport.\u000a\u000a\u201cPlease feel free to contact Coral directly,\u201d he wrote.\u000a\u000aIronically, the list of email addresses to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s message included a number of personal email addresses of EPA employees\u2014particularly rich since Davenport was seeking evidence of Trump administration EPA politically appointed officials mishandling government email protocol. Again, Breitbart News has redacted, in the images of the emails obtained, personal contact information, including the email addresses in the list of names to which O\u2019Grady forwarded Davenport\u2019s email.\u000a\u000aThe email chain obtained by Breitbart News chops off the original date and time that Davenport sent her email to O\u2019Grady. But it does include the time and date that O\u2019Grady forwarded the email to EPA career officials. The email O\u2019Grady sent to a number of EPA officials was forwarded on Thursday, August 3, at 2:33 p.m.\u000a\u000aThe government employees to whom O\u2019Grady forwarded this email\u2014whose email addresses Breitbart News has redacted from this email chain published via PDFs here\u2014include: Antony Tseng, Bethany Dreyfus, Britta Copt, Clovis Steib, Dennis Miller, Priscilla Oliver, Gary Morton, Lucretia Myers, Mark Coryell, Michael Mikulka, Natasha Greaves, Nate James, Shane Nelson, Silvia Saracco, Steve Calder, Thelma Estrada, Denise Morrison, Jeanne Schulze, Keith Fusinski, Russell Wiener, Sarah Perham, Steve Hopkins, Amer Al-Mudallal, Brent Maier, Destinee Cooper, Diane Lynne, Stephanie Doolan, Leah Oliver, Lesley Mills, Mark Sims, William McBride, Michael Ottlinger, Patrick Chan, and Ann Pitchford.\u000a\u000aApproximately half of those\u2014including O\u2019Grady himself\u2014were on personal email addresses, and many of them were fellow union officials. Some of them were on official EPA email addresses.\u000a\u000apage1 by Breitbart News on Scribd\u000a\u000apage2 by Breitbart News on Scribd

aVAndrej Babi\u0161. | Martin Divisek/EPA Czech lawmakers vote to strip PM candidate of immunity Andrej Babi\u0161 denies having illegally obtained an EU subsidy.\u000a\u000aPRAGUE \u2014 The Czech parliament voted Wednesday to strip the likely next prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, of his parliamentary immunity so that he can be prosecuted on subsidy fraud charges.\u000a\u000aCzech police will now be able to investigate the former finance minister on suspicion of having manipulated ownership of a subsidiary of Agrofert, a conglomerate that founded in 1993, to illegally obtain 50 million Czech koruna (\u20ac1.91 million) from the EU. He denies the charges.\u000a\u000aThe EU\u2019s anti-fraud office (OLAF) has also launched an investigation into the case.\u000a\u000aDuring the debate that preceded the vote, Babi\u0161 said he would gladly waive his immunity \u201cto make the truth come out.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou will not silence, you will not hurt, you will not stop, and you will not get rid of me either,\u201d the billionaire businessman told fellow MPs.\u000a\u000aAccording to recent polls, Babi\u0161\u2019 ANO party is poised to easily win the parliamentary election scheduled for October 20-21. If that happens, Babi\u0161 will likely be named prime minister.\u000a\u000aThe case dates back to 2008, when Babi\u0161 allegedly changed the ownership of the Stork\u2019s Nest resort and conference center to make it eligible for an EU subsidy, which was earmarked for small- and medium-sized firms. Agrofert consists of some 225 companies and, with revenues of nearly 120 million koruna, would have been ineligible.\u000a\u000aPolice claim that Stork\u2019s Nest was returned to Agrofert ownership after the subsidy was received. Babi\u0161 has claimed that the resort was owned by family members when it received the money.\u000a\u000aIt is highly unlikely that the investigation will be completed before the election. If Babi\u0161 does become prime minister, he would again be immune from prosecution. As he put it Wednesday, \u201cMy political fate will be decided by voters in the election.\u201d\u000a\u000aBabi\u0161 founded ANO in 2012 as an anti-corruption party. In the 2013 election, it received 18.7 percent of the vote and became the country\u2019s second most powerful party, with 47 seats in the lower house of parliament. It is currently a junior partner in the three-party ruling coalition headed by the Social Democratic Party of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka.

aVU.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, is confronting some resistance from the right as he seeks to become Donald Trump's secretary of Homeland Security, a closely watched appointment for a president-elect who pledged to vigorously fight illegal immigration.\u000a\u000aMcCaul, the current chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been open about his interest in the job, which could entail helping follow through on Trump's promises throughout the campaign to build a border wall and deport millions of people in the country illegally. But some hard-line illegal immigration opponents are increasingly arguing McCaul is not up to the task, citing a congressional record they say has not been tough enough on the issue.\u000a\u000a"If Rep. McCaul is chosen to head DHS, he will need to take a much more expansive view of border and immigration enforcement than he has in the past," read a statement Friday from Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\u000a\u000aMcCaul, who met with Trump on Tuesday in New York, has not been shy about pushing back on the criticism, which has been unleashed in recent days on Trump-friendly websites such as Breitbart News and LifeZette. In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, McCaul denounced the claims against him, which first surfaced in a Washington Times story a day earlier, as "incredulous and inflammatory and ... slanderous."\u000a\u000aThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\u000a\u000a"To say somehow I am not strong on immigration is laughable because whether it\u2019s sanctuary cities to every vote on the floor of the House, I have strongly voted against illegal immigration," McCaul said earlier Wednesday during a forum at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.\u000a\u000aWith the criticism mounting, McCaul published an op-ed Friday on Fox News' website making clear there is no daylight between him and Trump on border issues. "We are going to build the wall. Period," McCaul wrote, proposing a "payment plan" for Mexico that include assessing new immigration fees on the country and a "security toll" at border crossings.\u000a\u000aThe crossfire is coming at a critical time. With McCaul's team expecting Trump to soon make a decision on the job, an aide emailed some potential backers Sunday afternoon to encourage them to make their support known on social media.\u000a\u000aIf Trump does not make the appointment by Wednesday, McCaul could have another chance to make his case during his annual State of Homeland Security address scheduled that day at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.\u000a\u000aMcCaul\u2019s critics most frequently point to his Secure Our Borders First Act of 2015, which they say sought to secure the border without dealing with the millions of people already in the United States against the law. His opponents also note he was one of 19 House Republicans who backed former House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s immigration agenda, which included a path to legal status for those here illegally.\u000a\u000aAt the Bipartisan Policy Center event last week, McCaul defended the 2015 bill as \u201cvery strong,\u201d noting current Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson opposed it and President Barack Obama threatened to veto it. Critics of the legislation, McCaul said, don\u2019t understand his authority as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.\u000a\u000aThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fact is that I only have jurisdiction over the border,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cI don\u2019t have jurisdiction over [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement], which is a component of DHS, so therefore I cannot legislate interior enforcement. The argument was my bill didn\u2019t have interior in it. The reason why it didn\u2019t is because I don\u2019t have jurisdiction over that. If I had it, that would\u2019ve been in my bill.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt has not helped that McCaul received a vote of confidence from Johnson, a Democrat, who interjected at the forum when the moderator asked McCaul about the Washington Times story. "On his behalf, I don't know anybody who is stronger on border security in Congress that I have dealt with," Johnson said. (Later in the discussion, Johnson declined to comment when an audience member asked whom he would like to see as his successor.)\u000a\u000aMcCaul's rivals for Homeland Security secretary reportedly include Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a favorite of immigration hardliners. Also in the mix is Frances Townsend, former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush.\u000a\u000aPositive reviews have nonetheless been rolling in for McCaul as Trump considers him for the Cabinet job. In an op-ed published Saturday by Breitbart, U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, called McCaul the \u201cbest pick\u201d for the post.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis work is too important to trust to a novice,\u201d Duncan wrote. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have someone run the Department of Homeland Security who is learning on the job.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Texas, McCaul has enjoyed widespread support from fellow Republicans in high places. He counts among his backers U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, plus a number of his GOP colleagues in the U.S. House from Texas.\u000a\u000a"McCaul would be great at Homeland Security," Abbott wrote Saturday on Twitter, sharing McCaul's Fox News op-ed. "He knows border challenges, the threat of cartels & terrorists, & strategies to secure U.S."\u000a\u000a"Michael is a professional prosecutor first and foremost," Cornyn tweeted Saturday in response to an article in the Washington Examiner titled, "Immigration hawks balk at McCaul for DHS."\u000a\u000aThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\u000a\u000aPatrick, who chaired Trump's campaign in Texas, is also a fan of McCaul. In an interview the morning after Trump's victory, Patrick said he had already been in touch with the transition team about Texans who could serve in the administration, and he could see McCaul as DHS secretary or attorney general.\u000a\u000aCruz, whom McCaul has been encouraged to challenge in 2018, has been more measured in his support. Speaking with reporters Friday in McAllen, the Texas senator praised McCaul's law enforcement experience but stopped short of endorsing him for the Cabinet post. "That\u2019s ultimately the decision for the president-elect to make," Cruz said.\u000a\u000aRead more:

aVThe EU\u2019s top competition enforcer could find her power to pursue antitrust cases severely curtailed come Wednesday if the European Commission loses a court battle with Intel.\u000a\u000aThe European Court of Justice is scheduled to publish its verdict in an appeal by Intel against a once-record \u20ac1.06 billion sanction. Though the court hasn\u2019t overturned a Commission judgment in almost 40 years, the U.S. chipmaker has some reason to hope for victory in this case: A senior member of the court last October lambasted the Commission and recommended its appeal be upheld.\u000a\u000aA judgment in Intel\u2019s favor will have a direct and immediate impact on Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s landmark antitrust probes into other American firms Qualcomm and Google, and it carries wider implications for Commission inquiries into dominant firms and cartels across the board.\u000a\u000aThe judgment could order the Commission to delve deeper into the economic logic behind each case, said Damien Geradin, a partner at Euclid Law. \u201cIt could be much more difficult to apply [competition rules] and there would be many more shades of gray.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe last time a Commission antitrust case against a dominant firm collapsed before the EU\u2019s top court was 1979.\u000a\u000aEnding the Commission\u2019s winning streak in court could also change the \u201cbalance of power\u201d between the Commission and defendants, resulting in fewer settlements and more court fights, he added.\u000a\u000aThe Commission declined to comment. Intel declined to comment.\u000a\u000aEagerly, very long awaited\u000a\u000aThe last time a Commission antitrust case against a dominant firm collapsed before the EU\u2019s top court was 1979.\u000a\u000aIn a sign of the Intel case\u2019s significance, senior Commission antitrust officials and competition lawyers are said to have cleared their agendas for Wednesday morning to read the ruling and map out its legal implications. The date of its delivery and the outcome has been the subject of unusually intense speculation in legal circles for months.\u000a\u000aThe verdict, in a case launched by one of Vestager\u2019s predecessors more than 10 years ago, comes as she enters the last two years of her mandate as Europe\u2019s commissioner for competition. Closing two open cases each against Google and Qualcomm will be critical for her legacy.\u000a\u000aVestager has been frustrated at the way competition probes drag out across years, but she is well aware of the importance of winning before the courts. \u201cFast is always better than slow, but best of all is to be just,\u201d she often says.\u000a\u000aCommission regulators in 2009 concluded that Intel, then the dominant manufacturer of certain computer chips, offered discounts or paid customers on the condition they shun rival Advanced Micro Devices. The Commission ruled such terms were illegal coming from a company that supplied 70 percent of the market for x86 CPUs, the main chip running PCs and laptops.\u000a\u000aThe case cemented the Commission\u2019s reputation as the world\u2019s foremost antitrust enforcer \u2014 U.S. enforcers hesitated to press a case and eventually settled after the company promised to change its contracts and paid $6.5 million \u2014 and emboldened it to pursue high-profile cases on its own.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe company was scathing of the Commission\u2019s case. At the time, Intel said the regulator \u201cignored or minimized \u2026 important evidence that contradicted its view of the world.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Intel precedent on the terms that a dominant firm can offer its customers is cited heavily in looming cases against Google\u2019s Android operating system for mobile and its AdSense for Search (AFS) advertising business, according to people familiar with the cases.\u000a\u000aIn the Android case, regulators take issue with a series of Google supply contracts that impose exclusivity on partners, from handset-makers to telecoms operators.\u000a\u000aIn the AFS case the Commission takes aim at terms in Google\u2019s advertising contracts that required websites to shun Google\u2019s rivals.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity for the European Court of Justice to strike down the Commission decision and go against the old-fashioned approach of the Commission, in particular the legal service\u201d \u2014 Damien Geradin\u000a\u000aThe Intel precedent is also squarely at the center of one of the antitrust probes against Qualcomm, which alleges the U.S. chipmaker and technology firm made payments to Apple on condition it sourced chips exclusively from Qualcomm. After charging Qualcomm in December 2015, the case appears to be nearing an end.\u000a\u000aIntel\u2019s pushback\u000a\u000aIn its appeal, Intel accused the Commission of breaching its procedural rights by failing to properly report a meeting with Dell, where the latter is thought to have expressed reservations about the probe.\u000a\u000aCommission officials warned that requiring them to log each meeting would burden investigators with additional red tape and hamper their ability to gather intelligence. The court\u2019s verdict will be relevant for all ongoing probes and any ongoing appeals, including a likely action by Google against a \u20ac2.4 billion fine imposed in June against its Google Shopping service.\u000a\u000aA second line of attack in the Intel case focuses on how the contracts at issue were struck outside the EU. Investigators say they can pursue the deals because they affected competition with Europe.\u000a\u000aSuch disagreements come up \u201cquite often in cartel cases,\u201d said Oliver Geiss, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs.\u000a\u000aA third ground of appeal says the Commission cannot forbid dominant firms from handing out any discounts that involve exclusivity, but should draw on economics to show that a rebate hurt competition.\u000a\u000aInvestigators did model the economic effects of Intel\u2019s behavior, but the Commission\u2019s legal service has maintained in court that they did not need to: They point to case law dating back to the 1970s finding exclusivity rebates to be illegal when offered by a dominant firm.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity for the European Court of Justice to strike down the Commission decision and go against the old-fashioned approach of the Commission, in particular the legal service,\u201d said Geradin, the lawyer.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: This article was updated to reflect that Intel declined to comment.

Cohen (professor emeritus of Russian studies at New York University and Princeton) sat down in Moscow for a wide-ranging discussion with Edward Snowden. Throughout their nearly four-hour conversation, which lasted considerably longer than planned (see below for audio excerpts), the youthful-appearing Snowden was affable, forthcoming, thoughtful and occasionally humorous. Among other issues, he discussed the price he has paid for speaking truth to power, his definition of patriotism and accountability, and his frustration with America\u2019s media and political system. The interview has been edited and abridged for publication, compressing lengthy conversations about technological issues that Snowden has discussed elsewhere. Ad Policy\u000a\u000aThe Nation: It\u2019s very good to be here with you. We visit Moscow often for our work and to see old friends, but you didn\u2019t choose to be in Russia. Are you able to use your time here to work and have some kind of social life? Or do you feel confined and bored?\u000a\u000aSnowden: I describe myself as an indoor cat, because I\u2019m a computer guy and I always have been. I don\u2019t go out and play football and stuff\u2014that\u2019s not me. I want to think, I want to build, I want to talk, I want to create. So, ever since I\u2019ve been here, my life has been consumed with work that\u2019s actually fulfilling and satisfying.\u000a\u000aThe Nation: You have everything you need to continue your work?\u000a\u000aSnowden: Yes. You know, I don\u2019t spend all day running hand-on-hat from shadowy figures\u2014I\u2019m in exile. My government revoked my passport intentionally to leave me exiled. If they really wanted to capture me, they would\u2019ve allowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can operate with impunity down there. They did not want that; they chose to keep me in Russia.\u000a\u000aThe Nation: We understand you\u2019re not a person who gives a high priority to social life, but do you have some here in Moscow?\u000a\u000aSnowden: Yeah, I\u2019ve got more than enough for my needs, let\u2019s put it that way.\u000a\u000aThe Nation: If you feel like just getting together and chatting with people, you can?\u000a\u000aSnowden: Yeah, I can. And I do go out. I\u2019ve been recognized every now and then. It\u2019s always in computer stores. It\u2019s something like brain associations, because I\u2019ll be in the grocery store and nobody will recognize me. Even in my glasses, looking exactly like my picture, nobody will recognize me. But I could be totally clean-shaven, hat on, looking nothing like myself in a computer store, and they\u2019re like, \u201cSnowden?!\u201d

aVCentral and Eastern European countries have lobbied hard to keep political and social issues from being a factor in the race for the EMA | Bethany Clarke/Getty Images Bidders for Brexit-exiled EU agency split along social fault lines Race for European Medicines Agency has morphed into culture war between Eastern and Western Europe.\u000a\u000aThe behind-the-scenes knife fight over who hosts Europe\u2019s drugs regulator after Brexit is turning into a culture war.\u000a\u000aFor all the talk about EU27 unity against British negotiators, the competition for the European Medicines Agency, one of Brexit\u2019s biggest spoils, is exposing some of the Continent\u2019s deepest East-West fault lines, especially on social attitudes and values.\u000a\u000aThis week, EMA chief Guido Rasi called on the 19 countries applying to host the agency to be upfront about their policies on gay rights. Rasi said he understands the concerns of the agency\u2019s LGBT staff who wrote to him and other EU leaders about their fear of moving to a place that won\u2019t protect their rights or recognize their marriages when the agency leaves London after Brexit.\u000a\u000aNeither Rasi nor the letter mentioned any particular country, but the targets are clear. Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia and Romania don\u2019t recognize any sort of formal same-sex relationship. Romania is about to introduce a referendum to define \u201cfamily\u201d as a marriage between a man and a woman in the country\u2019s constitution. The other three already have constitutional bans on same-sex marriage.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe embrace people to work for us, no matter their gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation,\u201d Rasi said. \u201cWe have to do everything we can to ensure the new location can be reconciled with the life choices our staff have made, so that we can retain as many of them as possible to guarantee the continuity of EMA\u2019s operations.\u201d\u000a\u000aRomania, Slovakia and Bulgaria do not have an EU agency. All three joined the bloc more than a decade ago (Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and Slovakia in 2004), and as the U.K. walks out, they argue there is no justification for denying them the full trappings of membership, including playing host to the \u20ac322 million agency.\u000a\u000a\u201cEU countries talk about solidarity, but they only support it when it goes one way [East to West],\u201d said one Brussels-based diplomat from Eastern Europe, hinting at the clash pitting the European Commission and countries like Germany against Central and Eastern European countries over migrant quotas.\u000a\u000aFrom West to East\u000a\u000aRasi\u2019s note about staff retention speaks to his more immediate challenge: convincing nearly 900 highly skilled people living in one of the world\u2019s most cosmopolitan, liberal cities to move just about anywhere else. Rank-and-file hostility to moving too far east is clear from internal surveys, anonymous interviews with staff and the response to the LGBT letter. Even though there are at most 70 LGBT staff at the agency, about 250 employees signed the letter of concern, the writers said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is one of those blows below the belt that we expected\u201d \u2014 Brussels-based Eastern European diplomat\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the case that EMA is relocated to a member state with discriminatory legislation for LGBT persons, then LGBT staff members will be forced to choose between relocating with the agency or maintaining equal rights and protections under the law,\u201d the group wrote, noting particular concern that partners from non-EU countries might not be allowed to move with them.\u000a\u000aWhen approached about Rasi\u2019s call, a spokesperson for Slovakia\u2019s permanent representation in Brussels did not directly address the question of partnership rights but pointed to a national strategy on human rights and an LGBTI committee that advises a government council on human rights for minorities and gender equality.\u000a\u000aA spokesperson for Bulgaria\u2019s permanent representation in Brussels declined to comment on Rasi\u2019s request, noting he hadn\u2019t communicated his concerns directly to Bulgaria, but contended that Bulgaria is in compliance with EU laws and thus \u201cdoes not allow in its legislation any form of discrimination, including on the basis of \u2018sexual orientation.\u2019\u201d Pressed on whether this meant EMA staff with same-sex partners could enjoy spousal benefits, the spokesperson declined to elaborate.\u000a\u000aPoland\u2019s permanent representation in Brussels declined to comment, and Romania\u2019s did not respond.\u000a\u000aA Commission spokesperson said EU law, not the selection process, would protect LGBT staff and spouses.\u000a\u000a\u2018Below-the-belt\u2019 blow\u000a\u000aRasi\u2019s involvement in the issue surprised the Brussels-based Eastern European diplomat, who was not authorized to speak on the record. \u201cThis is one of those blows below the belt that we expected,\u201d the diplomat said, adding they were convinced that there were more to come.\u000a\u000aWith no illusions about the West\u2019s cultural disdain, Central and Eastern European countries have lobbied hard to keep political and social issues from being a factor in the race for the EMA, as well as the European Banking Authority, which is also based in London. Criteria set out by the Commission focus on things like IT networks, airports, job markets and housing (not to mention the geographic spread of agencies). Issues like political stability and adherence to rule of law \u2014 other areas where those countries might fall short \u2014 aren\u2019t explicitly considered.\u000a\u000aNo wonder, then, newer members of the EU club bristle at the idea they have to change their values to accommodate the rest of Europe.\u000a\u000aThe newer EU members believe they are being unfairly singled out. Italy, for example, also has its critics for not upholding liberal values. Gay marriage is also banned there (though the deeply Catholic nation does allow civil unions), it is hard to get an abortion and it has had plenty of its own recent struggles with corruption and government turmoil.\u000a\u000aNo wonder, then, newer members of the EU club bristle at the idea they have to change their values to accommodate the rest of Europe.\u000a\u000aAsked by local media this week whether the referendum to ban gay marriage might send a negative signal to the EU, the president of the Romanian parliament\u2019s lower house, Liviu Dragnea, responded: \u201cI am interested in this decision being taken by Romanians, not by somebody else.\u201d\u000a\u000aCarmen Paun contributed reporting.

Chuck Grassley (right) and Lindsey Graham wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images GOP senators: Comey drafted statement clearing Clinton before her interview Grassley, Graham say evidence suggests decision not to file charges was 'prejudged'.\u000a\u000aFormer FBI Director James Comey began drafting a statement rejecting the idea of criminal charges against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her private email account about two months or more before Clinton was interviewed in the FBI probe, according to partial transcripts of interviews released Thursday by two Republican senators.\u000a\u000aSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham said they obtained the transcripts from the Office of Special Counsel, a government watchdog agency that launched an investigation into whether Comey's actions violated a federal law against government employees engaging in political activity while on duty.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn a letter sent Wednesday to Comey's successor, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Grassley and Graham said Comey's move to start preparing the statement sometime in April or early May reflected a premature conclusion that Clinton shouldn't be charged.\u000a\u000a"Conclusion first, fact-gathering second\u2014that\u2019s no way to run an investigation. The FBI should be held to a higher standard than that, especially in a matter of such great public interest and controversy," Grassley and Graham wrote as they demanded all FBI records of the drafts Comey prepared as well as other materials related to the OSC probe.\u000a\u000aPlaybook Power Briefing Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aGrassley and Graham said the OSC\u2014a permanent, independent executive branch agency unrelated to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia probe\u2014shut down its investigation after Comey was fired in May by President Donald Trump. That's because the key law prohibiting use of an official position for political purposes, the Hatch Act, is not a criminal statute. As a result, there's no action that can be taken against people who are no longer government employees.\u000a\u000aA spokeswoman for the Office of Special Counsel declined to comment on the senators\u2019 claims or to discuss the agency\u2019s inquiry into Comey\u2019s conduct.\u000a\u000aAn FBI spokeswoman confirmed receipt of the senators' letter and said the agency will provide any response to the lawmakers' directly.\u000a\u000aOn Friday morning, Trump jumped on the disclosure as evidence that the fix was in on the Clinton email probe from the beginning.\u000a\u000a\u201cWow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more," he tweeted. "A rigged system!\u201d\u000a\u000aWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that if the senators' claims are true, they support Trump's decision to dismiss Comey.\u000a\u000a"If it is as accurate as they say it is, that would certainly give cause and reason that Jim Comey was not the right person to lead the FBI," Sanders said, before urging reporters to dig into the story.\u000a\u000aCongressional Republicans have long suspected that Comey had already decided Clinton would not be charged when a team of FBI agents and prosecutors met with her for three-and-a-half hours at FBI headquarters on Saturday, July 2, 2016. Comey's unusual and controversial public statement concluding the investigation came just three days later, on the Tuesday following the Independence Day holiday.\u000a\u000aHowever, the senators say the OSC interviews indicate Comey began drafting the statement at least six weeks earlier, well before FBI agents finished interviewing key witnesses in the investigation, including Clinton lawyers Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, State Department tech aide Bryan Pagliano and State information technology manager John Bentel.\u000a\u000aAt a House hearing last September, Comey vehemently denied any decision had been made not to charge Clinton before the July 2 interview. He was not asked when he began preparing his public statement.\u000a\u000a"If colleagues of ours believe I am lying about when I made this decision, please urge them to contact me privately so we can have a conversation about this," Comey said. "All I can do is tell you again, the decision was made after that because I didn't know what was going to happen in that interview."\u000a\u000aThe then-FBI chief said it was possible Clinton might lie in the interview, although he also said there was no indication she did.\u000a\u000aThe GOP senators referred to Comey's statement as "exonerating" Clinton, but it was so critical of her and her aides that it subsequently led Democrats to write to the Office of Special Counsel to seek a probe of whether his comments were intended to damage her prospects in the presidential race.

aVPrime Minister Theresa May and President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani at Downing Street | Pool photo by Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA EU\u2019s Tajani: Brexit phase 1 might not be over till Christmas The European Parliament president sees little in the way of \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 but plenty of \u2018foggy proposals.\u2019\u000a\u000aIf it were up to European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, Britain would have to wait until nearly Christmas to start discussing its future relationship with the EU.\u000a\u000aIn an interview with POLITICO, Tajani said he would formally propose to senior MEPs on Thursday the postponing until December of the European Council\u2019s assessment of whether there has been \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the first phase of Brexit negotiations. The decision is currently expected in October.\u000a\u000aThe EU27 insists there must be sufficient progress on the main divorce terms, including citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement, before moving to a second phase of negotiations focused on the future relationship with the U.K. In May, leaders said they would issue a verdict at a summit on October 19-20.\u000a\u000aBut, speaking over lunch of tartines and fruit in his office on the ninth floor of the Parliament building, the Italian conservative politician said it was clear to him the U.K. is not yet ready for the next phase.\u000a\u000aThe next regular summit after the October meeting is scheduled for December 14-15. That means that even if the Council judges \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been achieved, the second phase of talks would likely not start until after the Christmas and New Year holiday.\u000a\u000a\u201cSo far we have noted that no concrete proposals have arrived, only very foggy proposals\u201d \u2014 Antonio Tajani\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have three irrevocable priorities which are: rights for three-and-a-half million EU citizens living in the U.K.; the payment of what the EU deserves \u2014 not a euro more nor a euro less; third point, the Good Friday Agreement, that has to give us a positive solution for the border between Ulster and the Republic of Ireland,\u201d Tajani said in the interview, which was in Italian.\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce we have reached an agreement on these three points, we can talk about the future. Without an agreement on this, we cannot talk about the future. So far we have noted that no concrete proposals have arrived, only very foggy proposals,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI will ask the Council tomorrow [to extend the deadline] but it\u2019s not our fault, but due to delays,\u201d Tajani said. \u201cAnd the Brits are the ones who will be mostly affected by it. It is not a tragedy, but we cannot postpone further than December.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018Buying time\u2019\u000a\u000aTajani, a former journalist who was a spokesman for Silvio Berlusconi when he was prime minister, accused U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s negotiators of stalling for domestic political reasons.\u000a\u000a\u201cI do realize we are at the gates of the Conservative Party congress and therefore they are trying to buy time,\u201d Tajani said. \u201cBut we cannot afford to delay too much.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile some EU officials want discussions of the bloc\u2019s next multi-year financial plan to be delayed because of uncertainty over Brexit and the potential revenue shortfall caused by the U.K.\u2019s departure, Tajani said he wanted the long-term financial plan settled on schedule.\u000a\u000aUltimately, the Parliament must approve any final withdrawal agreement with the U.K., and its Brexit steering committee this week issued a report on citizens\u2019 rights that showed negotiators had a long way to go. MEPs on the steering committee said the U.K. was not offering sufficient protection and certainties to EU citizens living in Britain, while creating a tangle of unnecessary red tape.\u000a\u000aTajani made it clear that he was keenly aware of the powers that the European Parliament wields over the Brexit process, and he believed the British were similarly aware.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Parliament is fundamental, because if we vote no, it\u2019s no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can block everything and they know it.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Parliament plans to issue a resolution in early October expressing its own view on whether sufficient progress has been reached. That resolution is still being drafted but Tajani said citizens\u2019 rights would be one area of focus.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, Tajani said he is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, whom he knows well from their time as European commissioners. (Tajani held the transport and industry portfolios.)\u000a\u000aIn the interview, Tajani confirmed he had invited May to address the European Parliament but there was no firm answer yet from No. 10 Downing Street.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor sure she will not come before the Conservative congress, but I invited her before the elections, and she did not exclude the possibility of actually coming, \u201d said Tajani, who sees security as an area where maintaining close cooperation with Britain is vital.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen we received the first letter from May, I said immediately we could not mix up Brexit with the fight against terrorism, because the latter is linked with the lives of human beings and has nothing to do with the U.K. leaving,\u201d he said, adding that the EU should keep sharing information with Britain as it does with other allies in the fight against terror.

Special Envoy Ghassan Salamé said the organization will send at least 200 \u201cblue helmet\u201d military personnel to protect its base in Libya as soon as next month, significantly expanding the U.N.\u2019s mission to the country.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think they can be deployed already in the coming weeks,\u201d Salamé said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Stampa published Friday. Adding somewhere in the region of 200 to 250 peacekeepers to guard its base in the capital \u201cwill allow us, by the beginning of October, to lead a significant part of our activities in Libya,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aTalks on the possible deployment of soldiers to the U.N. base in Libya have been ongoing for several years. In 2014, the then Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi initiated a push in favor of adding troops, arguing it could help further stabilize the North African country \u2014 from where a significant number of migrants depart for Sicily.\u000a\u000aSalamé told La Stampa he took issue with Europe\u2019s divisions on foreign policy in the region. European nations must \u201cspeak with one voice\u201d in Libya, he said, because excessive activism of individual states driven by national interests creates further confusion for the local authorities and population.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are six or seven different operations in front of their eyes. Too many cooks spoil the broth,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThere are about 140 militias in Libya, a challenge for the Tripoli-based government of F\u0101yez al-Sarr\u0101j, which has been recognized by the U.N. In July, al-Sarr\u0101j and Khalifa Haftar \u2014 the military strongman who controls the east of the country \u2014 met in Paris to broker a deal to hold elections in spring 2018.\u000a\u000aHowever, Salamé cautioned \u201cin Libya, the last elections didn\u2019t bring about a change, but only an accumulation of institutions. Instead of replacing certain figures, they have added other.\u201d\u000a\u000aNoting that \u201cpresidential elections would be the first ones ever,\u201d Salamé said: \u201cOne needs to be sure that everybody will accept the final result.\u201d

aVMichel Barnier is widely believed to harbor a burning ambition for the EU\u2019s top post | Olivier Hoslet/EPA Why Barnier is Britain\u2019s best friend in Brussels The Frenchman\u2019s bigger ambition is the Commission presidency in 2 years \u2014 and he can\u2019t get it without a success in the Brexit talks.\u000a\u000aBritain\u2019s favorite Brussels punching bag may be its best shot at a Brexit deal.\u000a\u000aAs withdrawal talks took a tense turn in recent days, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s dapper French negotiator, has been called silly, arrogant and inflexible in the U.K., even a \u201csmackhead begging for his next hit of our money\u201d by one pro-Leave group.\u000a\u000aAmong EU insiders, however, the vilification of Barnier by British officials and media is just the latest example of what they view as a clueless approach by the U.K, and a failure to accurately read the political landscape across the Channel.\u000a\u000aA two-time European commissioner who served in multiple ministerial posts in the French government and made an unsuccessful bid for Commission president in 2014, Barnier is widely believed to harbor a burning ambition for the EU\u2019s top post.\u000a\u000aTo have virtually any chance of replacing Jean-Claude Juncker when his term ends in 2019, supporters of Barnier said, he must successfully deliver a withdrawal agreement. That gives Barnier personal incentive to seal a deal with London, they said, while many of his potential rivals stand to gain more from tough talk and a willingness to push the U.K. off the cliff.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis dream has always been to be president of the Commission, and that dream was broken in 2014,\u201d said Alain Lamassoure, a veteran French MEP and longtime colleague and acquaintance of Barnier\u2019s.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have prime ministerial experience to be Council president, but if he succeeds in the Brexit negotiations, he can make his dream come true,\u201d added Lamassoure, who is part of the same conservative European People\u2019s Party (EPP) political family as Barnier. \u201cThe calendar coincides perfectly. He will have finished in two years. And if he has done these negotiations brilliantly, he will be a candidate.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo be sure, Brussels is a political fish bowl, full of fast swimmers and loose lips, and the speculation about Barnier\u2019s motivations \u2014 beyond the customary desire to succeed in his current mission \u2014 may be of even less significance to the Brexit talks than the constant speculation about U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s grip on the Conservative Party.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, with Juncker insisting he will step down when his term ends in two years, Europe\u2019s capital is abuzz with various scenarios that would catapult Barnier into the presidential suite of the Berlaymont \u2014 perhaps with his deputy negotiator, Sabine Weyand, as cabinet chief, in an embodiment of the renewed Franco-German power nexus.\u000a\u000aProvided the negotiations don\u2019t implode, Barnier would be well-positioned to reach for his dream.\u000a\u000aOthers speculate that a more likely cabinet chief would be Olivier Guersent, currently the Commission\u2019s director general for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, who was Barnier\u2019s chief of staff when he was a commissioner from 2010 to 2014. Barnier\u2019s interest in the presidency, however, is generally regarded by colleagues and friends as an open secret.\u000a\u000aThat puts the Brexit negotiator\u2019s ambitions on a par with his U.K. counterpart David Davis: The Brexit secretary is the favorite among Conservatives to succeed May as Tory leader if she were forced out, according to opinion polls.\u000a\u000aBrand recognition\u000a\u000aIn 2014, Juncker and Barnier were rivals for the EPP nomination, with Juncker, a former 19-year prime minister of Luxembourg, winning that contest by a vote among party delegates of 382 to 245.\u000a\u000aBut 62-year-old Juncker and 66-year-old Barnier are political soulmates \u2014 committed euro-integrationists, long-time colleagues and mutual admirers. Early in his term, Juncker appointed Barnier as a special adviser on defense and security policy, and it was Juncker who personally tapped Barnier as the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, just a month after the U.K. voted to leave the bloc in June 2016.\u000a\u000aProvided the negotiations don\u2019t implode, Barnier would be well-positioned to reach for his dream.\u000a\u000aThe Brexit job has raised Barnier\u2019s profile higher than perhaps any EU official who has not served in a presidential capacity, and his name-recognition among the general public is undoubtedly stronger than many current EU heads of state and government.\u000a\u000aIn preparation for the negotiations, and in seeking to sustain unity among the EU27, Barnier has visited all of the EU capitals. And, apparently unprecedented for an EU negotiator, he has a standing invitation to attend European Council summits to update leaders directly on his progress.\u000a\u000aHe is also in nearly constant consultation with the European Parliament, which technically still formally elects the Commission president based on a nomination from the Council. (In practice, EU leaders have agreed since 2014 to select the nominee, or Spitzenkandidat, of the political party group that wins a plurality in the European parliamentary elections.)\u000a\u000a\u2018Premature\u2019\u000a\u000aFrom London\u2019s perspective, Barnier\u2019s ambition may not help much.\u000a\u000aWhile it gives him incentive to achieve a Brexit deal, it also creates an imperative for him to deliver an agreement viewed as favorable to the EU27, not Britain. So while he may be less inclined than others in Brussels to see the U.K. expelled from the bloc without a safety net, he is still constrained by the Council\u2019s negotiating directives \u2014 a fact that has drawn complaints from Davis and others demanding more flexibility from the EU side.\u000a\u000aA U.K. government official said Barnier was \u201can often reasonable guy who had found himself in an unreasonable situation.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked about Barnier\u2019s future, an EU source close to him said: \u201cMr. Barnier is fully engaged in the Brexit negotiations as the European Commission\u2019s chief negotiator and, as he has said himself before, he is conducting these negotiations in a calm and constructive spirit. His aim is to reach a deal with the United Kingdom.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe source stressed that the parameters of the talks were set by the negotiating directives put forward by the Commission and formally adopted by the 27 leaders in the European Council, with input from the Parliament, which must approve any final withdrawal agreement with the U.K.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs the European Commission\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier strictly follows the mandate that the heads of state or government have defined unanimously, and he fully takes into account the European Parliament\u2019s resolution,\u201d the source said.\u000a\u000aPremature or not, party groups are already looking ahead to 2019 and how they will organize the process of choosing their Spitzenkandidat.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Margaritis Schinas, the Commission\u2019s chief spokesperson, dismissed any talk about Barnier\u2019s future as \u201cgossip.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cPresident Juncker appointed M. Barnier to this important assignment for well-known reasons (see here),\u201d Schinas said. \u201cFor the rest, we have lots of work ahead and no time for gossip.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother senior Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was too soon to speculate. \u201cWe are not there yet,\u201d this official said. \u201cThe question of the next European Commission president is far, very far. Any casting would be very premature.\u201d\u000a\u000aPremature or not, party groups are already looking ahead to 2019 and how they will organize the process of choosing their Spitzenkandidat. And there are numerous potential obstacles for Barnier, beyond a disastrous outcome in the Brexit talks.\u000a\u000aPerhaps first and foremost is the likelihood that he will face a challenge within the EPP, currently Europe\u2019s most influential political family, including potentially from some popular officials who have experience as prime minister or president, like Jyrki Katainen, the former prime minister of Finland and current European commissioner for jobs, growth and competitiveness.\u000a\u000aOne factor that could work in Barnier\u2019s favor is that French President Emmanuel Macron is said to covet one of the top EU presidencies for France, though it is tough to predict the broader machinations that could drive the outcome in 2019. Macron, a former Socialist turned independent, has not said if his new party, La République En Marche, will run in the European elections, and, if so, if he will ally with one of the existing political families.\u000a\u000aAnd while Macron shares Barnier\u2019s pro-EU philosophy and outlook, his leverage in negotiations over EU leadership positions will depend on numerous other factors, including the objectives of other leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who ultimately must agree on how to fill top jobs at the Commission, Council, Parliament and European Central Bank.\u000a\u000aStill, in and around Brussels\u2019 European Quarter, the view is that if Barnier manages to pull off a Brexit deal that reflects EU priorities and maintains the unity of the 27, he will have a solid platform for a campaign.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think his ambition is recent,\u201d one former EU official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a childhood dream. It wasn\u2019t a plan. His conviction in European values is absolutely authentic.\u201d\u000a\u000aQuentin Ariès contributed to this article.

Mueller has sought to interview White House officials about the fallout, and the lobbyist has testified in front of a grand jury.\u000a\u000aThe notes from the meeting do not contain any damaging information about Clinton or references to promises of damaging information about her, nor do they indicate that officials on the campaign were promising favors or seeking them in return for money, the people who\u2019ve seen them said.\u000a\u000aAccording to these people, the notes have been with Senate officials for weeks and have been reviewed by a number of people on Capitol Hill. Also in attendance at the June 2016 meeting in New York were a Russian lawyer, a Russian businessman and other Trump campaign officials, including Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law.\u000a\u000aOfficials who have reviewed the notes say they are not likely to be independently vital to any case, if at all, because they are difficult to follow, particularly one year later. To be sure, the notes are not an exhaustive account of the meeting, and other things could have been discussed that are not included in the notes.\u000a\u000aJason Maloni, a Manafort spokesman, declined to comment.\u000a\u000aTrump Jr. testified to Senate investigators Thursday that he never received any damaging information but only wanted to assess Clinton\u2019s \u201cfitness\u201d for office. President Donald Trump and others were involved in crafting a statement on Air Force One that was viewed as misleading about the notes.\u000a\u000aThe notes from Manafort, these people said, are about financier Bill Browder, a key player in the Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned Russian officials for human rights abuses. In retaliation for those sanctions, Russia banned U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children.\u000a\u000aThe notes include a spirited case on why Trump officials should overturn the act and why Republicans could support it. It indicates that the Russian officials made critical comments about Browder, but that Trump officials seemed to know little about the legislation or how it came about.\u000a\u000aThe notes do not contain the word \u201cdonor,\u201d as NBC News previously reported, but they appear to explain the background of a key player involved in the act, these people said, and this person\u2019s previous donations to the Republican National Committee.

aVSeven years ago, after Hurricane Katrina wiped out entire neighborhoods in the Mississippi Delta, Congress had an idea to help local businesses recover from the next big one. Small companies had found they just didn\u2019t have the money to rebuild and keep the lights on until their customers returned. So in 2008, Congress created three new programs to get loans to small businesses quickly.\u000a\u000aSince the new emergency lending programs were born, American small businesses have been hit by Hurricane Irene, Hurricane Sandy, and other disasters.\u000a\u000aAnd here\u2019s how many loans the new programs have secured for small businesses in that time: Zero.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrankly, they didn\u2019t do squat. They really didn\u2019t do squat,\u201d said William B. Shear, the director of Financial Markets and Community Investment for the GAO, who has written multiple reports on SBA\u2019s preparation for disasters. \u201cThey really dropped the ball.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis week the Small Business Administration came under Congressional fire for what appears to be a total failure to execute the mission of issuing emergency loans. A long trail of GAO reports details this record of failure, and the SBA\u2019s perplexing inability to explain why businesses haven\u2019t received a dollar yet, a need that is expected to become only more acute as a changing climate brings more drastic storms.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done within the agency to get the kinks worked out,\u201d said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.). \u201cWith climate change, we\u2019re going to be facing disasters like this in highly populated areas, and they have to be able to be far more efficient and far more transparent.\u201d\u000a\u000aBehind the seven-year saga appears to be a mixture of bureaucratic inertia, miscommunication and inattention. But it also speaks to the difficulty of launching public-private financial partnerships, especially if they require banks to make risky loans on the government\u2019s terms.\u000a\u000aUnder the 2008 law, the SBA was directed to create three loan guarantee programs, using private-sector lenders to supply quick money to help businesses recover after a disaster, in at most 36 hours. The government would act as a backstop for the small but risky loans, guaranteeing that banks would receive 85 percent of the loan value if it goes bad.\u000a\u000aIt appeared, at first, that the agency was making a legitimate effort to start making loans. It asked for\u2014and received\u2014$3 million for a pilot program of one of the loan programs to determine the interest of lenders and borrowers, and actually published a set of rules in 2010.\u000a\u000aJames Rivera, the associate administrator of the SBA\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance, appeared before the House Small Business Committee Wednesday to explain why the SBA had decided to pilot just one of the three programs, against the 2008 law which required the agency to publish rules on all three programs.\u000a\u000a\u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t know why the other two regulatory programs were not implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can do is I can check back with the Office of Capital Access and we can get back to you for the record.\u201d\u000a\u000aAccording to GAO reports on the loan programs, the agency repeatedly promised the pilot version would commence soon. In May 2010, the SBA said it would happen by September 2010. In June 2012, the deadline had shifted to the end of that year.\u000a\u000aAs of this Wednesday, it still hasn\u2019t happened. Why not? A withering GAO report from last October documents two reasons: the electronic systems used to process the loans didn\u2019t work well together, and \u2013 more crucially \u2013 lenders weren\u2019t willing to take part.\u000a\u000aIn an interview, Rivera told POLITICO that the SBA\u2019s computer systems are now compatible and capable of dealing with the loans. The problem, he said, is getting banks on board: \u201cLenders just feel it\u2019s too much risk based on what we get.\u201d\u000a\u000aMaking loans after a disaster is an inherently risky proposition, and Congress set strict standards on the loans: the interest rate is set by the agency, and borrowers must have at least 10 years to pay them back. According to the October GAO report, the SBA found that lenders were understandably hesitant to provide the loans, even with the government guaranteeing 85 percent repayment, unless Congress relaxed some of those conditions.\u000a\u000aJust one problem, which surfaced in Wednesday\u2019s hearing: the SBA never actually told the House Small Business Committee it was having trouble with lenders.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe haven\u2019t received anything,\u201d Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, said in an interview. \u201cThat is basically an excuse.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked why it hadn\u2019t mentioned this obstacle to Congress, the SBA provided POLITICO a copy of a letter it sent to two other committees in which it did explain that lenders objected to the rules. A spokesperson said "the SBA has worked with Congress both formally and informally" over time. But the agency just sent the letter in December 2014, despite knowing about these problems for years. (\u201cThis has been an ongoing conversation we\u2019ve had with the lenders since the statute was passed,\u201d Rivera told the committee Wednesday.)\u000a\u000aEven in the letter, the SBA didn\u2019t offer any solutions. And when I asked Rivera what Congress might need to change to make the loans more appealing to lenders, he didn\u2019t have much of an answer. \u201cWe\u2019ll provide the response that they\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said of the Small Business Committee, \u201cand how they respond to it, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat happens next with the program? Lawmakers say they\u2019ve run out of patience. \u201cI think it\u2019s taken them too little and too long for them to continue to improve,\u201d Rep. Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.) told POLITICO. No lawmaker called for a change of leadership at the agency, but Velazquez and Steve Chabot, the chair of the House Small Business Committee, asked for a letter from SBA about when the loan programs will be up and running.\u000a\u000aAnd what happened to the $3 million that Congress appropriated in 2010? It was spent back then to deal with IT problems, said the SBA\u2019s press secretary\u2014fixing the computer systems for a program that still doesn\u2019t exist.\u000a\u000a

aVMario Draghi (left), president of the European Central Bank, and Jens Weidmann (right), who heads Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, may finally be seeing eye-to-eye | Daniel Roland/AFP via Getty Images Mario and Jens don\u2019t kiss but make up Why Draghi and Weidmann, the two most powerful central bankers in Frankfurt, these days find common ground on monetary policy.\u000a\u000aFRANKFURT \u2014 For years, Mario Draghi and Jens Weidmann were the odd couple of European central banking.\u000a\u000aTimes are changing.\u000a\u000aThanks to the eurozone\u2019s robust growth, Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, and Weidmann, his biggest internal critic who also heads Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, may finally be seeing eye to eye.\u000a\u000aBoth men broadly seem to agree that the ECB should soon start to phase out its ultra-easy money policy, deployed to combat the euro crisis over the past seven years.\u000a\u000aDraghi hasn\u2019t shied away from revealing his contempt for the Bundesbank\u2019s perennial opposition to his policies without offering concrete alternatives.\u000a\u000aWhen the ECB\u2019s governing council meets on Thursday to discuss the future of the bank\u2019s massive bond-buying program that\u2019s been pumping cheap money into eurozone economies, Draghi is almost certainly assured to win Weidmann\u2019s strong backing \u2014 at least on the overall direction, if not on all the details.\u000a\u000aFrosty past\u000a\u000aEver since the two men took their respective positions in 2011, a clash of minds between Draghi, the now 70-year-old MIT-trained economist at the pinnacle of his career, and Weidmann, a German technocrat more than two decades his junior who\u2019s eyeing the Italian\u2019s job, has taken place ahead of the ECB\u2019s key policy decisions.\u000a\u000aCasting himself as the chief opponent of Draghi\u2019s policy response to the crisis, the soft-spoken but dogged Weidmann accused his nominal boss of stretching the ECB\u2019s mandate. He also shared his fellow hawks\u2019 concerns about Draghi\u2019s habit of pressing ahead with dovish policy signals without securing a consensus \u2014 or even informing \u2014 the governing council members.\u000a\u000aFor his part, Draghi, who has a reputation as a lonesome genius who prefers to work with a small circle of trusted lieutenants, has criticized the Germans\u2019 nein zu Allem (\u201cno to everything\u201d) attitude, which he thinks would have led to the demise of Europe\u2019s currency union. Draghi and other ECB top brass let it be known recently that they were disappointed that Weidmann chose to publicly criticize the rest of the team instead of defending and explaining their policies to a skeptical German public.\u000a\u000aCentral bank officials said there were times when the two men hardly spoke to each other. And Draghi hasn\u2019t shied away from revealing his contempt for the Bundesbank\u2019s perennial opposition to his policies without offering concrete alternatives. Once, when asked whether he had the full backing of the governing council, Draghi answered: \u201cThere was one dissenting view \u2026 It is up to you to guess [who].\u201d\u000a\u000aInside his own institution, Weidmann is considered a strong team player. People familiar with Weidmann from his time in Berlin as an economic adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel also said he\u2019s far more pragmatic and flexible than some of his rhetoric as the head of the Bundesbank suggests, indicating that he may be on occasion just playing the part he was assigned.\u000a\u000aIn spite of their tense history, the relationship between Draghi and Weidmann could become much more cooperative now that the economic \u2014 and policy \u2014 cycle is taking an opportune turn.\u000a\u000aECB policymakers face a tough decision ahead on how and when to proceed to the exit from their ultra-loose monetary policies. With inflation still significantly below the ECB\u2019s near-2 percent target and the strength of the euro putting further downward pressures on prices, plenty of room for disagreement exists.\u000a\u000aDraghi and Weidmann seem to agree on the need to bring an end to the unconventional policies, dubbed \u201cquantitative easing\u201d or QE. Even though Draghi continues to urge patience, he has noted that as the economy continues to recover, the same degree of monetary accommodation can be achieved with less-aggressive easing measures. This suggests the ECB president is ready to draw down current policies.\u000a\u000aWeidmann and his fellow hawks favor a swifter approach than Draghi. But this should not hinder them from supporting moves to scale back monetary support \u2014 the first such occurrence in Draghi\u2019s six-year presidency \u2014 that fall short of their demands. The Bundesbank chief has already signaled that he\u2019s ready for compromise and understands that QE can\u2019t end abruptly.\u000a\u000aEye on prize\u000a\u000aAnother obvious reason why ECB watchers believe Weidmann has become less combative in recent weeks is because Germany is positioning him as a possible successor to Draghi to lead the powerful institution when the Italian\u2019s second term ends in October 2019. While Weidmann enjoys the trust of Merkel, he needs to shore up his popularity in the capitals of the other eurozone countries to improve his chances of moving into the penthouse office of the ECB skyscraper in Frankfurt.\u000a\u000aIn particular, Weidmann\u2019s lectures on sticking to rules and reinforcing market discipline have not endeared him to Southern Europeans. For instance, last year in Rome he sparked outrage in the Italian media when he doubled down on his call for new bank regulations that would limit the amount of sovereign debt of their own government that banks can hold. Corriere della Sera sniped that if Weidmann\u2019s aim for the Rome trip was to show why he was isolated on European debates, it was a success.\u000a\u000aOn Thursday, the ECB\u2019s governing council is unlikely to present any concrete policy proposals following their meeting, two central bank officials told POLITICO. Defying widespread speculation, Draghi didn\u2019t use a speech last month at the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s annual symposium to spell out his visions for an exit. Instead, he is expected to task an expert committee to draw up strategies for the governing council to discuss at its October meeting.\u000a\u000aDraghi\u2019s priority is to avoid a premature exit that could undermine the recovery and unravel his success in steering policy through a turbulent period. Weidmann, for his part, has voiced a preference for mapping out a full exit plan \u201csupported by appropriate communication\u201d in a newspaper interview days before the Fed event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\u000a\u000aWeidmann remains a demanding companion for the Italian. But Draghi knows that sharing the same road map with the German will make negotiating the rocky path ahead easier \u2014 and help secure his own legacy as the ECB leader who saved Europe.

aVPresident Donald Trump is increasingly fixated on slashing the top corporate tax rate to 15 percent \u2014 a level that pretty much no one else working on the issue in the White House or Congress thinks is workable.\u000a\u000aIn a White House meeting on Tuesday, Trump again expressed his strong desire to hit the 15 percent target, from today\u2019s 35 percent.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cYou can\u2019t get to 15 percent, and anyone who has a back of an envelope can make that calculation,\u201d said a senior official working on tax reform. \u201cAnd he may not like that truth, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s just math.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis debate over how low to bring the corporate rate as part of a larger overhaul foreshadows the difficulties the administration faces as it attempts to tackle tax reform, while also trying to raise the debt ceiling, pass a budget to keep the government funded, address immigration reform and dole out money for Hurricane Harvey relief.\u000a\u000aCongressional leaders, tax writers and key administration officials known as the \u201cBig Six\u201d met Tuesday in the Oval Office to talk about their progress \u2014 largely as a way to publicly show momentum on an issue significant to Republicans, the business community and conservative activists.\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, Trump plans to travel to North Dakota to makehis second tax sales pitch in a week. He will deliver a speech focused on the way tax reform will boost the financial lives of the middle class and help businesses.\u000a\u000aMorning Tax Sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aAccompanying him on Air Force One will be North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, one of 10 Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 in states that Trump won. A key part of the administration\u2019s strategy to push a tax package through Congress is to earn these members\u2019 support.\u000a\u000aIn his speech, Trump is expected to bring up the fact that the 1986 tax overhaul under President Ronald Reagan was also a bipartisan effort, according to excerpts released by the White House.\u000a\u000a\u201cBoth of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic speaker and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,\u201d the president intends to say. "If Democrats continue their obstruction, if they don\u2019t want to bring back your jobs, raise your pay and help America win, voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America or find a new job.\u201d\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn will also join the president on the trip.\u000a\u000aAs in his speech in Missouri last week, Trump is not expected to go into specific details about proposed changes to the tax code beyond wanting to lower corporate and individual rates and allow companies to bring back money from overseas.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s expected to continue trying to make a populist-style push for tax cuts, arguing that they will encourage businesses to invest and hire more workers while making it less attractive to open manufacturing facilities abroad and ship products back into the United States.\u000a\u000aLost in much of this rhetoric is the way a major tax cut would help businesses and their bottom line.\u000a\u000aPart of the challenge for the White House is crafting a major legislative package that can appeal to the fractured Republican Party in Congress, where hard-core conservatives and more moderate members often find themselves at odds.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe key hurdle is very simple. It\u2019s how to craft a package that can get 50 votes in the Senate and avoid the problems they had with Obamacare,\u201d said Stephen Moore, an informal economic adviser to Trump and distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI still maintain they will end up with something really scaled back that can give the president a bill-signing ceremony.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe politics of the issue keep changing as to what is attainable here, but it\u2019s time to get realistic about what we can pass,\u201d Moore added.\u000a\u000aTuesday\u2019s 45-minute Big Six meeting at the White House offered some hints of the difficulty of developing a major piece of tax legislation. The meeting was largely devoid of policy details \u2014 more of a show for the media than anything else, said one congressional source.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis was mostly about procedure: How we get from point A to point B and make sure tax reform doesn\u2019t get lost,\u201d said one source familiar with the meeting. \u201cThat means the House has to start moving in September, because it takes the Senate awhile.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnother issue that has cropped up in recent weeks is the state of play on the corporate tax rate.\u000a\u000aTrump surprised some people closely following the tax reform process by publicly sticking with the 15 percent figure in his speech in Missouri last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cIdeally \u2014 and I say this for our secretary of the Treasury \u2014 we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15 percent, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries, but still, by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world," he said. "But it would make us highly competitive.\u201d\u000a\u000aMost of the Big Six negotiators have come to the conclusion that the corporate rate will end up somewhere between 20 percent and 25 percent, despite the president\u2019s insistence on lowering it to 15 percent, a key promise from the campaign trail.\u000a\u000aThe thinking is that lowering the rate to 15 percent is unattainable without introducing a major new tax, such as the border adjustment tax long favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Chairman of the Ways & Means Committee Kevin Brady (R-Texas).\u000a\u000aNegotiators now must decide how hard to push on limiting expensing for capital investments and cutting into other current deductions to get that rate close to 20 percent. More immediate expensing and continuing to allow deductions for corporate interest, for instance, would mean pushing the top corporate rate closer to 25 percent.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhere the rubber meets the road is how much you are willing to cut into all this stuff to get the number closer to 20,\u201d said the administration official.\u000a\u000aWhile Trump continues to push to get as low on the top rate as possible, he is mainly sticking to the 15 percent figure so as not to be \u201cnegotiating with himself,\u201d said White House officials working on tax reform, and they expect the president eventually to endorse a plan that has a higher rate, probably closer to 20 percent or slightly higher.\u000a\u000aAdministration officials also cautioned against expecting any new detailed plan on taxes from the White House in the near term. Some on Wall Street began expecting those details after Mnuchin, in an interview on CNBC last week, appeared to suggest that a new blueprint would be coming soon.\u000a\u000aInstead, the officials said that the Big Six have already agreed on the basic framework and that it would now be up to the \u201cregular order\u201d process in Congress, in which the tax writing committees take the framework and create legislation with specific details on rates and deduction changes.

aVPresident Donald Trump also touted his actions on Air Force One en route to North Dakota for an event on tax reform. | John Minchillo/AP Trump sides with Democrats in debt limit, funding, Harvey deal The agreement sets up a brutal year-end fiscal cliff.\u000a\u000aDonald Trump, who casts himself as a master negotiator, took the first offer Democrats put on the table.\u000a\u000aRepublicans left the Oval Office Wednesday stunned. Trump had quickly sided with Democrats on a short-term debt ceiling increase, even overruling his own Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to concur with "Chuck and Nancy," as he later called them on Air Force One.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut Trump defied more than his top aides. He turned on Republican leaders in Congress when he caved to Democrats\u2019 demands to raise the debt limit and fund the government for three months, setting up a brutal year-end fiscal cliff. The move shocked everyone, as top White House officials and GOP leaders had been gearing up to raise the debt ceiling through the 2018 midterm election, looking to pass legislation as soon as Friday.\u000a\u000aBut even after Mnuchin, Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back on the Democratic demands in the meeting, Trump agreed to the three-month deal that will also head off the possibility of a government shutdown until mid-December.\u000a\u000aDuring the meeting, Ryan sharply criticized the Democratic proposal, a source familiar with the exchange said. But Schumer reminded him that Ryan had supported short-term increases in the past intended to help create bipartisan deals in 2013.\u000a\u000aSo after Democrats rejected GOP proposals to raise the debt ceiling for 18 months, and then six months \u2014 Trump endorsed Schumer\u2019s three-month pitch.\u000a\u000aThe Treasury Department will likely be able to buy more time for Congress on the debt limit into 2018. But the Wednesday deal still means Congress will have to raise the debt ceiling, negotiate a massive trillion-dollar spending bill, and potentially hash out a deal on immigration all at once or in quick succession.\u000a\u000aDemocrats were gleeful.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"Both sides have every intention of avoiding default in December and look forward to working together on the many issues before us," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\u000a\u000aTrump also touted his actions on Air Force One en route to North Dakota for an event on tax reform.\u000a\u000a"We essentially came to a deal and I think the deal will be very good," Trump said.\u000a\u000aCapitol Hill Republicans, loath to vote twice to raise the debt ceiling, were less than pleased. They said privately that Trump caved too quickly, relinquishing the GOP\u2019s leverage. And they worried that Trump would do the same in future deals.\u000a\u000a"I think our members would probably want to see something that goes significantly longer than that," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, when asked about the short-term debt limit proposal.\u000a\u000aOne senior Republican aide spoke more bluntly on background: \u201cThe president of the United States just handed a loaded gun to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe meeting came after congressional Democrats turned the screws on the president and GOP leaders, who need Democratic votes to raise the debt limit and avert a default.\u000a\u000aDemocratic leaders said Wednesday morning that they'd offer Trump their votes for a package delivering aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey and raising the debt ceiling only until mid-December. GOP leaders, eager to avoid multiple contentious votes on the debt ceiling, want to raise the debt ceiling through late 2018.\u000a\u000a\u201cGiven Republican difficulty in finding the votes for their plan, we believe this proposal offers a bipartisan path forward to ensure prompt delivery of Harvey aid as well as avoiding a default, while both sides work together to address government funding, DREAMers, and health care,\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.\u000a\u000aThe move by congressional Democrats was intended to preserve their leverage later this year on other issues, even though in the past, Democrats, including both Schumer and Pelosi, have said the debt ceiling should not be a topic of negotiation. But Democratic leaders were emboldened because Republicans needed significant Democratic support on the spending and debt legislation, which is expected to split congressional Republicans.\u000a\u000aIndeed, significant numbers of Republican defections were expected on the legislation, and debt ceiling votes typically draw opposition from conservatives who demand spending cuts in return.\u000a\u000aDuring a Wednesday morning press conference Speaker Paul Ryan blasted Democrats\u2019 opening salvo as \u201cridiculous and disgraceful,\u201d accusing them of playing politics \u201cat a moment when we have fellow citizens in need.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cLet's think about this: We\u2019ve got all this devastation in Texas. We\u2019ve got another unprecedented hurricane about to hit Florida. And they want to play politics with the debt ceiling?\u201d Ryan (R-Wis.) said. \u201cThat will strand the aid that we need to bring to the victims of these storms.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat's the exact message the White House had been sending to Capitol Hill. FEMA officials told lawmakers Tuesday that they'll run out of emergency funding as soon as Friday. Compounding that, Treasury officials began arguing they couldn't pay FEMA claims to victims unless the debt ceiling is increased immediately.\u000a\u000aThat's why GOP leaders told House Republicans during a closed-door conference meeting Wednesday that Republicans would remain in town \u2014 even through the weekend \u2014 until a Harvey-debt ceiling package is signed by the president.\u000a\u000aBut Trump upended GOP leadership's plans during the White House meeting. Sources familiar with the discussions said Ryan and McConnell made it clear that they didn\u2019t agree with Schumer or Pelosi. When Democrats wouldn't agree, they pushed for a six-month debt ceiling increase instead of the full 18 months.\u000a\u000aTrump appeared to tire of the back and forth when Democrats wouldn\u2019t cave to the six-month increase. He struck a deal \u2014 or at least, what he saw as one \u2014 cutting Mnuchin off mid-sentence as he argued against the merits of a short-term debt increase. The room went silent. Everyone was stunned.\u000a\u000aRepublicans returned to the Capitol disheartened. They thought they could call Democrats' bluff on the matter and were ready to exit the meeting as a standstill. One senior GOP aide said the whole experience was "mystifying.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cMaybe it's about the wall, I don't know,\u201d this person said. \u201cNone of it makes any sense.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike now, Republicans in December won\u2019t have a disaster relief bill to help win support for a debt ceiling increase \u2014 always a tough vote for Republicans \u2014 said another GOP source.\u000a\u000aDemocratic leadership staff began discussing a short-term debt ceiling strategy before the August recess, according to several Democratic sources following the talks. Some staff floated the idea of only agreeing to temporary increases in the debt ceiling until Republicans promised that tax reform will not add to the deficit.\u000a\u000aThe ongoing conversation suggests Democrats were ready to play hardball on the debt ceiling even before the hurricanes that have threatened Texas, Louisiana and Florida.\u000a\u000aThe short-term debt-limit strategy allows Democrats to say they're not flirting with default but also buys them the time they want to negotiate and use their leverage for other big-ticket items from immigration to government funding. The items mentioned in their Wednesday release \u2014 a debt limit hike, government spending, hurricane aid and protection for Dreamers \u2014 could in theory be rolled into one giant package later this year, though Democrats are more focused on ensuring that all those measures are bipartisan, according to Democratic aides.\u000a\u000aBut two debt limit votes would be painful for Republican leaders, who are already pulling teeth to get one increase in the nation's borrowing limit over the finish-line. Trump himself, GOP leadership sources say, will have to get involved to muster enough Republican votes for a single Harvey-debt limit package \u2014 and that's assuming every Democrat backs the bill.\u000a\u000a\u201cNo one wants to revisit this,\u201d said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) coming out of the GOP conference meeting.\u000a\u000aNot all Republicans hated the idea when Democrats floated it, however. One GOP leadership ally, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), suggested he wasn't opposed to the Democrats' proposal.\u000a\u000a\u201cLook, a short term increase in the debt limit so that they can handle this is a sensible thing, in my view," the Oklahoma Republican said, arguing that it might even be preferable to leadership's long-term debt increase strategy. "That\u2019s not like an 18-month deal.... I think it would have a lot more difficulty than something short term. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see."\u000a\u000aAfter the deal was struck, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) defended the president\u2019s actions: "I don't know that he sided with the Democrats. He made an agreement.\u201d\u000a\u000aJohn Bresnahan and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.

aVIn his first extensive interview since leaving the Trump administration, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon tells "60 Minutes" about the fallout after the leaked "Access Hollywood" tape.\u000a\u000aA few weeks before the election, a video obtained by the Washington Post showed Donald Trump talking with Billy Bush about groping women. It sent his campaign in crisis mode. The weekend after the tape release, Mr. Trump met with his team of senior advisors.\u000a\u000aBannon, then-RNC chairman Reince Priebus and Gov. Chris Christie discussed what steps to take next. In his conversation with Charlie Rose, the executive chairman of conservative publication Breitbart News explains how the meeting ended up costing Christie a potential job in the administration.\u000a\u000aCBS News\u000a\u000aSteve Bannon: And \u2013 and Trump went around the room and asked people the percentages he thought of \u2013 of still winning and what the recommendation. And Reince started off and Reince said, "You have \u2013 you have two choices. You either drop out right now, or you lose by the biggest landslide in American political history." And Trump, with his humor goes, "That's a great way \u2013 that's a great way to start our \u2013 start our conversation." We went around the room. And you could tell \u2013 I could tell from the incoming of politicians and I could tell from some of the politicians that were there, is that the natural inclination of politicians are \u2013 are \u2013 are to be so overwhelmingly stunned and shocked by how the media comes on you. But Trump wasn't that. And I told him as he went around, I was the last guy to speak, and I said, "It's 100 percent. You have 100 percent probability of winning." And that's the first time \u2013\u000a\u000aRose: But you seem to have done that at every point in the campaign. When he was in trouble, asking him to double down on his rhetoric, double down in terms of appealing to his base.\u000a\u000aBannon: Appealing to the American people and to the working class people in this country, absolutely. You know why? 'Cause \u2013 it was a winner. That's why I told him "double down" every time. And on that day, that's the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, "Come on, it's not 100 percent." I go, "It's absolutely 100 percent." And I told him why. "They don't care."\u000a\u000aRose: But they\u2026 they do care about respect for women. They do \u2013\u000a\u000aBannon: They do, they do, but they \u2013\u000a\u000aRose: I do know that.\u000a\u000aBannon: But they \u2013 but \u2013\u000a\u000aRose: And it's not just locker room talk. I mean \u2013\u000a\u000aBannon: That's locker room talk. The Billy Bush thing is locker room talk.\u000a\u000aRose: Did you lose confidence in anybody because they came to you at that point and said, "Look, he ought to get outta this race," other than Reince Priebus? I mean, did your attitude towards those people who said that, they were just wrong?\u000a\u000aBannon: Absolutely. The Billy Bush Saturday to me is a litmus test. It's a litmus test. And I said it the other day to [White House Chief of Staff] General [John] Kelly during the Charlottesville thing, afterwards. It's a line I remember from the movie. "The Wild Bunch." William Holden uses it right before that huge gunfight at the end. "When you side with a man, you side with him," okay? The good and the bad. You can criticize him behind, but when you side with him, you have to side with him. And that's what Billy Bush weekend showed me. Billy Bush Saturday showed me who really had Donald Trump's back to play to his better angels. All you had to do, and what he did, was go out and continue to talk to the American people. \u2026 People didn't care. They knew Donald Trump was just doing locker room talk with a guy. And they dismissed it. It had no lasting impact on the campaign. Yet, if you see the mainstream media that day, it was, literally, he was falling into Dante's Inferno.\u000a\u000aRose: Boy, you took names on Billy Bush Sunday, didn't you?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBannon: I did.

aVBrexit became a whole lot trickier for Theresa May when she lost her majority in June's snap election | Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA Brexit Files Insight Tory shuffle to help push through Brexit law Theresa May accused of trying to \u2018rig parliament\u2019 by seeking a majority on important committees.\u000a\u000aLosing her majority in June\u2019s snap election made Brexit a whole lot trickier for Theresa May \u2014 but the government has a plan to help smooth its parliamentary progress.\u000a\u000aWithout a phalanx of Tory MPs cheerleading the plethora of legislation needed to ease Britain\u2019s EU exit through all stages of the process, the government risks tricky blockages.\u000a\u000aThe solution: To slip in a motion to be voted on late on Tuesday night, which will give the government a majority in standing committees \u2014 where clause-by-clause legislative heavy lifting takes place and parliamentary mischief can be made.\u000a\u000aLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn was quick out of the blocks, accusing ministers of an \u201cunprecedented attempt to rig parliament.\u201d\u000a\u000aMay, he claimed, has \u201cno majority and no mandate\u201d yet will stack committees with Tory MPs.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe government has to have a legitimate chance of getting its business through\u201d \u2014 Charles Walker\u000a\u000aBut Charles Walker, a Tory MP and chair of the influential procedure committee, which scrutinizes the way the House of Commons conducts its business, is less outraged by the move.\u000a\u000aWhile he expects \u201clively debate\u201d he thinks it is a \u201creasonable proposition.\u201d The logic is that, through its deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, the government has a working majority in the Commons, so it should also have a majority in the parliamentary committees that scrutinize legislation. Under the current rules, the DUP group is too small to qualify for committee seats, meaning that the government falls short.\u000a\u000aWalker told POLITICO that without the motion, \u201cyou could potentially see the legislative process grind to a halt.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe government has to have a legitimate chance of getting its business through,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aBut he pointed out that there is a difference between commanding that majority and having that majority. \u201cIf you can\u2019t win the argument then you lose the vote. But the presumption should be that it starts from the position of having the ability to get its legislation through because it has a majority,\u201d he said, believing the majority of Tory MPs will be persuaded of that logic.\u000a\u000aThere are few signs of rebellion on the Tory and DUP side thus far, so the new rules are likely to be passed (probably).\u000a\u000aNonetheless, the government is holding its breath.\u000a\u000aOne senior Labour MP branded it \u201cthe biggest vote of this parliament.\u201d And Tory MPs have been told it is an unmissable vote.\u000a\u000aLook out for a Tuesday night parliamentary nail-biter.\u000a\u000aThis insight is from POLITICO\u2018s Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU.

aVFrench President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech in Athens, Greece | Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images Macron urges \u2018maximum ambition\u2019 on eurozone budget, finance minister French president praises Greece for reforming to stay in the single currency area.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday urged eurozone members to move with \u201cmaximum ambition\u201d toward adopting a common budget and finance minister, in defiance of Germany\u2019s position.\u000a\u000aSpeaking in Greece alongside President Prokopios Pavlopoulos, Macron heaped praise on his hosts for their efforts to carry out reforms and stay in the eurozone despite a crippling debt load and stringent savings goals.\u000a\u000aTo prevent future existential crises in the EU, the French president called for deeper integration between eurozone states, including a \u201creal eurozone budget [and a] a permanent finance minister who leads this executive.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a democratic responsibility on the eurozone level, and as such it requires maximum ambition,\u201d he added.\u000a\u000aMacron, who pushed for an overhaul of Europe\u2019s posted workers directive during a tour of Central and Eastern Europe last month, is casting himself as a European leader who can bring eurozone states closer together at a time when Britain is negotiating its way out of the bloc.\u000a\u000aSo far his proposals to create a eurozone parliament, common budget and finance minister have met with only muted approval in Germany. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble endorsed the notion of a parliament and increasing the powers of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to bail out struggling countries.\u000a\u000aBut while Macron agreed with the need for a stronger ESM, and said the International Monetary Fund should not intervene in European affairs, he said the ESM was no replacement for a eurozone budget.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe European Stability Mechanism has a crisis management function, and we must activate it, and indeed we must move toward a European Monetary Fund, but this is in no way a budget,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism for crisis management to allow different parties to recover from a crisis like the one that you had to go through.\u201d

aVDamien Green , first secretary of state leaves 10 Downing Street on June 11, 2017 in London, England | Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images May\u2019s deputy: European Parliament doesn\u2019t set Brexit talks deadline British first secretary of state says \u2018UK need to continue to make the progress.\u2019\u000a\u000aBritish First Secretary of State Damian Green rejected remarks by European Parliament President Antonio Tajani that the U.K. would have to wait until nearly Christmas to start discussing its future relationship with the EU.\u000a\u000aTajani told POLITICO in an interview published Thursday that he would formally propose to senior MEPs on Thursday the postponing until December of the European Council\u2019s assessment of whether there has been \u201csufficient progress\u201d in the first phase of Brexit negotiations. The decision is currently expected in October.\u000a\u000aGreen told BBC Radio 4 Thursday morning that this deadline \u201cis not set by the European Parliament.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need our own legislative house in order. We need to continue to make the progress that we need to make,\u201d Green said as MPs begin considering the general principles of the EU Withdrawal Bill on Thursday.\u000a\u000aGreen also commented on remarks by former European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who said Thursday there is a \u201czero percent\u201d chance that enough progress will be made on exit issues by October to move on with Brexit talks.\u000a\u000aGreen said that was \u201ctoo pessimistic.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThese are complex negotiations, and there are several rounds to go,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe want to increase the pace, but there have been some significant agreements made already. Talks will be tough \u2014 let\u2019s see what happens between now and October.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen further dismissed a Daily Telegraph report published Thursday that claimed he had distanced himself from leaked immigration policies to curb migration, for low-skilled workers in particular.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat report is nonsense, I have never seen what is leaked,\u201d he said, adding that he will only comment on government policies when they come out in \u201ca few weeks\u2019 time.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen did say the government will need to propose changes to the current immigration system, because that will disappear when the U.K. leaves the EU.\u000a\u000aHe said the U.K. needs to make sure it attracts \u201cpeople that bring benefits to the country,\u201d and immigration numbers needed to be \u201ccontrolled and lowered.\u201d

aVSpeaking from Bedminster, New Jersey, in early August, President Donald Trump vowed to formally dub the U.S. opioid crisis a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut nearly a month later, the president has yet to officially declare a state of emergency \u2014 a move that would enable the federal government to pump funds into addressing the drug epidemic.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn the latest episode of the Women Rule podcast, two women on the front lines of the opioid fight \u2014 June Sivilli, the chief of the public health division in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Dr. Cece McNamara Spitznas, ONDCP\u2019s senior science policy adviser \u2013 try to explain why Trump still hasn\u2019t made that formal declaration.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat the powers are related to a national emergency and trying to determine how would that apply in this situation \u2014 it requires a lot of specialist eyes to take a look,\u201d Spitznas told POLITICO editor Carrie Budoff Brown. \u201cAnd a lot of people to sit around and sort of go through exactly what we can do legally, and across all the different parts.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think we\u2019re in that phase of looking at [it] and leaving no stone unturned on what is it that we can possibly do,\u201d Spitznas added.\u000a\u000aNot everyone in Trump\u2019s administration sees the need for an emergency declaration to combat the crisis.\u000a\u000aWhile the White House\u2019s bipartisan Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis had recommended an official declaration, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price downplayed the idea in early August, before Trump weighed in.\u000a\u000aThe Global Politico Susan B. Glasser\u2019s new weekly podcast takes you backstage in a world disrupted. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"We believe that at this point, the resources that we need or the focus that we need to bring to bear to the opioid crises can be addressed without the declaration of an emergency," Price said.\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to the broader national strategy to halt the opioid problem, ONCDP also defended Trump\u2019s recent law-and-order push, in combination with other public health-oriented approaches.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe view is that we need to get people who need care the care that they need,\u201d Sivilli said. \u201cAnd if people are breaking the law, then they need to be prosecuted.\u201d\u000a\u000aDrawing a line between opioid users and drug traffickers, Sivilli added: \u201cWe can forget that there are a lot of bad people out there trafficking a lot of drugs to our communities. And so serious traffickers are not users who are trying to just address their habit. So we want people who have an addiction to get treatment, but if they\u2019re criminals they should not be treated as if they\u2019re not.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the wide-ranging podcast roundtable, the two ONDCP officials weighed in on all aspects of drug control policies \u2014 from personal family struggles with addiction and alcoholism to the unique effect the opioid crisis has had on women.\u000a\u000aRead below for highlights:\u000a\u000a8:02 It was in 2008 when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first started tracking the increase of drug poisoning deaths from prescription drugs \u2014 and for Sivilli, it was the \u201cfirst data that came to our attention that made us realize there\u2019s a problem\u201d with opioids in the U.S.\u000a\u000aSpitznas noted that America is unique in its higher consumption of opioids because that class of drugs are \u201creally easily prescribed.\u201d\u000a\u000a11:22 Spitznas details how her work in addiction medicine had been heavily influenced by her own family\u2019s struggles with alcoholism and her father\u2019s experience in a treatment program.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I was 7 years old, my father wrecked my mother\u2019s Volkswagen Bug,\u201d Spitznas said. \u201cHe was drinking. He had a DUI.\u201d\u000a\u000a16:39 The duo discusses how the opioid crisis has specifically impacted women.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you look at women, the drug that is still involved in most female deaths \u2026 are still the prescription opioids,\u201d Spitznas says.\u000a\u000aSivilli recommends that \u201ca woman\u2019s treatment program should probably be a segregated program\u201d because of a \u201cvariety of additional supports that women need,\u201d including child care.\u000a\u000aLater, the two also weigh in on the Catch-22 for pregnant women who may suffer from an opioid addiction.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they go to, say, a provider for pre-natal care, if they have children at home, and the provider learns that they have been misusing substances\u2026 then in some states, they are mandated to report that to child welfare,\u201d Spitznas points out. \u201cThat is, for some women, an impediment to seeking pre-natal care.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a \u201ctough\u201d call in the policy space, Spitznas says, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t want there to be a child safety issue.\u201d\u000a\u000a22:45 What does the current national strategy for combatting the opioid crisis look like?\u000a\u000aSince the start of the Trump administration, Sivilli says \u201cwe just continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d She goes on to explain the administration\u2019s combination of approaches, including a law-and-order approach, decreasing access to opioids and other drugs (including preventing such drugs from coming into the country), increasing access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, and further funding addiction treatment programs.\u000a\u000aWhile President Trump has yet to officially declare a national emergency on the issue, Spitznas is hopeful that the attention paid will mean that the administration is \u201cleaving no stone unturned on what it is that we can possibly do.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think when he says, \u2018It\u2019s an emergency,\u2019 we need to look at all the tools in our tool kit,\u201d Sivilli says.\u000a\u000a28:24 The two discuss the intersection of law enforcement and public health as it relates to the opioid crisis.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe view is that we need to get people who need care \u2014 the care that they need,\u201d Sivilli says. \u201cAnd if people are breaking the law, then they need to be prosecuted.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe emphasizes that sometimes prison is the only way those addicted to opioids have received help for their substance abuse disorders.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou hear over and over from people in these treatment programs, \u2018Jail was the first time I had an opportunity to get treatment,\u2019\u201d Sivilli notes.\u000a\u000a40:18 Sivilli discusses how reducing prescriptions for opioids would help alleviate the opioid crisis, and Spitznas voices her wish that every person who is able to subscribe an opioid also be trained in addiction treatment.\u000a\u000a44:09 Though the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been around for nearly three decades, it\u2019s never been led by a woman. Sivilli and Spitznas discuss women\u2019s roles in the department and ponder on the potential for female leadership.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of women who are stakeholders, who are leaders in our field, who are leaders in addiction medicine,\u201d Sivilli says. But to lead the office, she notes, is a \u201cvery demanding job.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t have any life except the job,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have is the job.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen Spitznas was asked whether she would consider a job helming the agency, she demurred.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat is something that might be something I could think about in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cBut currently, I\u2019ve been with the federal government for 17 years, and I am uniquely placed, I think, right now to be able to make a really great impact.\u201d\u000a\u000a

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday shrugged off criticism made by his former presidential primary challenger Hillary Clinton in her new book about the 2016 election, saying that he's instead focused on new issues.\u000a\u000a"My response is that right now it's appropriate to look forward and not backward," he said in a statement.

aVAgain and again on Wednesday \u2014 11 times in total, before 1 p.m. \u2014 President Donald Trump deployed some form of his favorite dodge: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019ll know in a very short period of time. But it looks like it could be something that will be not good.

It later emerged that Trump broke with Republicans and sided with Democrats to support just that.\u000a\u000aWhether he\u2019s facing an uncomfortable question, trying to keep some mystery around his future plans, or simply filling up verbal space, Trump has frequently thrown out the phrase \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d when facing a barrage of questions from reporters.\u000a\u000aHe\u2019s used the verbal tic on topics big and not-as-big \u2013 from whether the U.S. will go to war with a nuclear North Korea, to whether Steve Bannon would be ousted from the West Wing.\u000a\u000aWednesday was no different.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

aVRoss noted that even though the renegotiation is in its early stages, the Trump administration still views the end of the year as the deadline for talks to wrap up. | AP Photo Ross calls NAFTA withdrawal 'right thing' to do if 2.0 talks fail\u000a\u000aCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday backed President Donald Trump's ever-present threat of terminating NAFTA, saying that withdrawal would be \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do if trilateral talks between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. are not successful.\u000a\u000aRoss noted that even though the renegotiation is in its early stages, the Trump administration still views the end of the year as the deadline for talks to wrap up. He argued that the process can't \u201cdrag on too long\u201d beyond that, because if it did, negotiators would run into delays amid elections in all three countries and the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority in the U.S.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a\u201cAs you get closer to all of those political dates, the ability to get anything done will go down,\u201d he said at an event hosted by The Washington Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s no fine line, magic tape, but more or less by the end of the year is probably where we\u2019re going to need to know where we are."\u000a\u000aRoss, in rare public comments on the renegotiation since the talks formally began in mid-August, praised the \u201cextremely rapid\u201d pace of efforts to revamp the free trade deal, but emphasized the need for changes to be widespread.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has made clear that if they don\u2019t work, he\u2019s going to pull out \u2026 and really, that\u2019s the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need fixes to this deal. It has not worked the way that it was intended to."\u000a\u000aHe pointed to the growing trade deficit between the United States and Mexico in particular as an example of why the arrangement is not working, though most economists say that trade deficits are not an accurate way of judging the benefits of a trade agreement.\u000a\u000aSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Did it fairly distribute the benefits? And we don\u2019t think that it did."\u000a\u000aThe strategy during the first two rounds of talks has been to try to notch early wins on less controversial issues before turning to thornier discussions on more difficult policy areas, Ross said. Negotiators have been focused on getting textual issues out of the way in order to \u201ctry to build some momentum, so you really had \u2026 a feeling of togetherness as you move into the harder issues,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aRoss\u2019 comments line up with what industry officials and others said as the second round, held in Mexico City, concluded earlier this week, when they lamented what they felt was a lack of significant progress as negotiators side-stepped contentious issues.\u000a\u000aMexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said on Thursday that the three countries have yet to address rules of origin, the trade deficit and the dispute settlement chapter \u2014 three of the topics that will likely prove hardest to negotiate \u2014 according to a report in Mexican media.

It was mercifully brief \u2026 I was numb.

But he isn\u2019t a Democrat \u2014 that\u2019s not a smear, that\u2019s what he says,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic Party.\u201d

aVDanielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for The New York Times, said "Fox & Friends" did not attempt to "confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment." New York Times requests apology from Fox on ISIS story\u000a\u000aThe New York Times on Sunday took the unusual step of requesting an apology from a competitor, asking "Fox & Friends" to retract a report that the Times was to blame for the 2015 escape of an ISIS leader. Fox subsequently updated the story on its website with the NYT letter.\u000a\u000a"I am writing on behalf of The New York Times to request an on-air apology and tweet from Fox & Friends in regards to a malicious and inaccurate segment 'NY Times leak allowed ISIS leader to slip away,'\u201d wrote Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of communications for the Times.\u000a\u000aThe "Fox & Friends" report, which aired Saturday, apparently spurred a tweet by President Donald Trump: \u201cThe Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist, al-Baghdadi,\u201d the president wrote later Saturday. \u201cTheir sick agenda over National Security.\u201d The "Fox & Friends" hosts had said the Times was "failing in its credibility. It\u2019s failing our country."\u000a\u000aIn her request, Rhoades Ha added: "Neither the staff at Fox & Friends, nor the writers of a related story on Foxnews.com, appeared to make any attempt to confirm relevant facts, nor did they reach out to The New York Times for comment."\u000a\u000aLater Sunday, Fox attached the New York Times letter to its original story and issued this statement: "The FoxNews.com story was already updated online and Fox & Friends will also provide an updated story to viewers tomorrow morning based on the FoxNews.com report. For all of their concern about accuracy, the New York Times didn't reach out to anyone at Fox News until Sunday afternoon for a story that ran Friday night."\u000a\u000aMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Tony Thomas, who told Fox that the published report caused a lead to the ISIS leader's whereabouts to go dry. "That was a very good lead. Unfortunately, it was leaked in a prominent national newspaper about a week later and that lead went dead,\u201d said Thomas, who leads the U.S. Special Operations Command.\u000a\u000aA Fox News spokesperson said "There is absolutely no comparison between Herridge's brief report on Fox News Sunday" and the Times "reported much more compromising details than Herridge did, in revealing revealing specific details about how Baghdadi communicated and who played a role delivering those communications. Also, [the Times] reported the terrorist's wife was cooperating and how an informant led to the target."\u000a\u000aThe Times claims the pertinent material was actually disclosed by Carter in his public statement and stated that the Pentagon did not object to its more detailed June article.\u000a\u000aSpeaking on background, a Fox News executive slammed Rhoades Ha for seeking the apology only on Sunday afternoon and for alerting reporters at the same time.\u000a\u000a"NYT PR VP Danielle Rhoades Ha did not contact Fox News until Sunday afternoon \u2014 a day and a half AFTER the FoxNews.com story was published. She sent a letter to the reporter on the story \u2014 Catherine Herridge \u2014 at 3:30 pm on Sunday while being too cute by half and sending it to the press simultaneously \u2014 likely bcc\u2019ing reporters," the executive said. (The Times directly emailed POLITICO a copy of the letter that was sent to the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer on Sunday at 3:33 p.m.) "Herridge interviewed General Thomas at the Aspen Security Forum on Friday and did a wrap-up story on the panel for FoxNews.com, which was published on Friday night. Seems like an awfully long time to wait to correct something if they were so concerned about accuracy. And Ha did not reach out to Fox & Friends until 2 p.m. on Sunday for a story that aired Saturday morning. ... Why did it take them so long to reach out?"\u000a\u000aThe executive added: "If we notified the press every time the N.Y. Times had to update an online story or correct something, your inbox would crash."\u000a\u000aIn response, Rhoades Ha said she initially emailed the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer at 12:53 on Sunday, asking for a response by 3 p.m. Rhoades Ha also said she "sent a separate request to Catherine Herridge and her co-author to update their story, which I would have done with or without the Fox & Friends segment. I did not ask Catherine for an apology. She responded and updated her story."\u000a\u000aRhoades Ha said she has yet to receive a response from the "Fox & Friends" weekend executive producer.\u000a\u000a"We asked them for an apology because the entire premise of their segment is false," Rhoades Ha said. "I find it curious they are focusing on the timing of my emails instead of whether or not their reporting if false."\u000a\u000aOn Saturday, the Times sought clarification from the White House after Trump's tweet:\u000a\u000a"We have asked the White House to clarify the tweet. If the President is referring to this 2015 story, the Pentagon raised no objections with the Times before publishing the story in 2015 and no senior American official ever complained publicly about it until now, as noted in Peter Baker's story this morning."\u000a\u000aUPDATE July 24, 2017:\u000a\u000a\u201cFox & Friends\u201d addressed the Times\u2019 concerns in a segment Monday morning but did not apologize, saying, \u201cThe Times described its 2015 reporting to the Pentagon before publication and they had no objections, and no senior American officials have ever complained publicly \u2013 until now.\u201d The show then directed viewers to read the full statement online.\u000a\u000aIn response, The Times said the updated segment "wasn't an apology, nor did it begin to address the larger issues with the Fox & Friends Weekend segment, one of which was sheer hypocrisy. The host railed against The New York Times for covering a raid stating that the U.S. government 'would have had al-Baghdadi based on the intelligence that we had except someone leaked' to The New York Times when Fox News had covered the same raid three weeks earlier in a segment in which their correspondent said, 'The newly recovered intelligence may bring U.S. closer to Baghdadi's kill or capture,'" a Times spokesperson said. "According to the curious logic of the Fox & Friends host, Fox News itself was unpatriotic."\u000a\u000aIn an updated statement on Monday afternoon, Fox said that "Neither Fox News\u2019 report nor the subsequent on-air coverage was inaccurate." The network then links to a recent piece the Times wrote, explaining why it decided to name a CIA operative in one of its recent stories as something the Times is trying to distract people from by seeking an apology from Fox. "We find it beyond disappointing that the New York Times, in an attempt to distract from their recent debacle, decided to blame Fox News for comments made publicly by General Thomas during a widely viewed panel at the Aspen Security Forum. It might behoove the Times to actually check in with their reporter Eric Schmitt to see whether Gen. Thomas\u2019 comments have merit and whether Schmitt\u2019s reporting in 2015 revealed intelligence that allowed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to slip away.\u201d

aVAverage Americans have never much liked eggheads. That\u2019s not a bad thing in itself: Americans are a skeptical but level-headed people\u2014or were until recently\u2014whose common sense and ingenuity allowed their nation to achieve great heights in science, diplomacy and the arts, while never displacing the ordinary voter as the deciding voice in affairs of state.\u000a\u000aBut recently skepticism has curdled into something more toxic, even dangerous. Donald Trump explicitly campaigned against experts, calling them \u201cterrible\u201d and saying he didn\u2019t need them. As president, he seems determined to prove that experts are unnecessary to the running of a superpower\u2014winging important conversations with foreign leaders, issuing an executive order without advice from his own Cabinet and picking a radio talk-show host with no background in science or agriculture for the top science position in the Department of Agriculture.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn the far less grand homes of ordinary American families, knowledge of every kind is also under attack. Parents argue with their child\u2019s doctor over the safety of vaccines. Famous athletes speculate that the world might actually be flat. College administrators ponder dropping algebra from the curriculum because students keep failing it. This is all immensely dangerous, not only to the well-being of individual citizens, but to the survival of the United States as a republic.\u000a\u000aHow all this happened, and why it threatens our democracy, is a complicated story. Even Alexis de Tocqueville took note of the American distrust of intellectuals in the 19th century, and it only deepened with the social and political traumas of the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, globalization and technological advances have created a gulf between people with enough knowledge and education to cope with these changes, and people who feel threatened and left behind in the new world of the 21st century.\u000a\u000aAs a result, the implicit social contract between educated elites and laypeople\u2014in which professionals were rewarded for their expertise and, in turn, were expected to spread the benefits of their knowledge\u2014is fraying. Americans live increasingly separate lives based on education and wealth, part of a decades-long \u201cbig sort.\u201d What is qualitatively different today is that ordinary citizens seem increasingly confident in their views, but no more competent than they were 30 or 40 years ago. A significant number of laypeople now believe, for no reason but self-affirmation, that they know better than experts in almost every field. They have come to this conclusion after being coddled in classrooms from kindergarten through college, continually assured by infotainment personalities in increasingly segmented media that popular views, no matter how nutty, are virtuous and right, and mesmerized by an internet that tells them exactly what they want to hear, no matter how ridiculous the question.\u000a\u000aIt is easy to dismiss hostility toward experts as a function of a poor education, but that\u2019s inaccurate. The affluent, educated parents of Marin County in California, after all, led the way on the anti-vaccine madness. \u201cDilbert\u201d cartoonist Scott Adams, who holds an MBA, has a large audience for his attacks on experts, including his astonishing claim that there\u2019s nothing a president can\u2019t master in a conversation with a specialist in an hour. Narcissism and know-nothingism are not afflictions found only among a few disgruntled high-school dropouts in the heartland. They are endemic across the country, exacerbated over the past half-century by affluence, technology, a permanent youth culture\u2014and, above all, politics: academic postmodernism and fashionable relativism on the left, and the anti-intellectualism of certain evangelical strains and a long history of populist skullduggery on the right.\u000a\u000aVoters say they reject expertise because experts\u2014whom they think of as indistinguishable from governing elites\u2014have failed them. \u201cAmericans might look back on the last 50 years and say, \u2018What have experts done for us lately?\u2019\u201d one USA Today columnist recently wrote, without irony. Somehow, such critics missed the successful conclusion of the Cold War, the abundance of food to the point that we subsidize farmers, the creation of medicines that have extended human life, automobiles that are safer and more efficient than ever, and even the expert-driven victories of the previously hopeless Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. Experts, in this distorted telling, have managed only to impoverish and exploit ordinary Americans; anything that has benefited others apparently happened only by mere chance.\u000a\u000aThis mythology was central to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. The experts, voters were told, waged wars they didn\u2019t know how to win, signed trade deals that depopulated America\u2019s towns and unleashed a plague of terrorism. Trump adviser Steve Bannon even required new White House staff to read The Best and the Brightest, the landmark study of the origins of the Vietnam War, as a cautionary tale about intellectual pinheads who rammed the United States into a ditch in Southeast Asia. But Bannon, like so many others, misunderstood the book\u2019s message, which was not about the domination of experts, but rather about what happens when experts are ignored. Before and during the debacle in Vietnam, actual experts on Asia and other subjects were pushed aside, often by people who thought their own intelligence and professional success in other endeavors (running a car company, for example) made them more capable. Bannon is right that the book is a cautionary tale\u2014but one mostly about people like Steve Bannon.\u000a\u000aSure, there\u2019s truth even in the stereotypes about the educated classes. They do, in fact, run the day-to-day affairs of the nation, and often in ways that voters would not approve if they understood them. Nor are the experts blameless; their track records are full of mistakes, some of great consequence. Worse, because experts tend to speak mostly to one another, they often display a lack of empathy with those who do not understand them or their specialized jargon. They barely veil their pleasure at the distance, both physical and intellectual, they enjoy from laypeople. And they too easily fall prey to the arrogance of believing that their expertise in one subject can be applied to almost any issue\u2014especially if there\u2019s a healthy paycheck involved.\u000a\u000aThe cure for these transgressions, however, is not to replace expertise with ignorance: It is to replace it with better expertise. If complaints about experts were meant to restore a balance between experts and laypeople, experts would be the first to support it. But this requires voters to be at least modestly informed, not simply convinced they are automatically right. And as it stands now, attacks on expertise often amount to a demand from ordinary citizens\u2014sometimes encouraged by politicians and hucksters\u2014that their views, no matter how contradictory or hazardous, be considered equal to those of the most experienced expert.\u000a\u000aThe Ideas Issue The POLITICO 50 The ideas blowing up American politics\u2014and the people behind them. Our annual list.\u000a\u000aNo country, and especially not a republic based on delegated powers, can maintain the values and practices that sustain democracy when voters remain ignorant about their own system of government. When most Americans think a quarter of the U.S. federal budget is devoted to foreign aid, when more than 70 percent of them cannot name all three branches of government\u2014and nearly a third can\u2019t name even one\u2014the basic structures of American democracy cannot survive.\u000a\u000aThe Founding Fathers believed that civic virtue was built on education and knowledge. In a republic, citizens need not be experts, but they must learn enough to cast an informed vote. Or, in the words of James Madison: \u201cA people who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\u201d If Americans do not rediscover this foundational truth about their own system of government, they not only court disasters from pandemics to wars; they risk ceding their government either to the corruption of a mindless mob\u2014or, in the wake of a disaster, to a new class of technocrats who will never again risk asking for their vote.\u000a\u000aTom Nichols is professor at the U.S. Naval War College and author of The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.

aVThis autumn, two words will matter more than any other when it comes to Brexit: \u201csufficient progress.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt is the great test Brexit negotiators will face \u2014 barring something unexpected \u2014 ahead of the European Council\u2019s summit in October. As set out in the EU27\u2019s negotiating guidelines, the European Council (minus Britain, of course) will decide whether talks over the summer on so-called exit issues \u2014 notably citizens\u2019 rights, the Northern Irish border and the Brexit bill \u2014 have progressed far enough. Only then will they permit negotiators to move on to the next stage, and the bit the U.K. really wants to talk about \u2014 the future relationship with the EU and trade.\u000a\u000aEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier intends to update the Council either at or around the time of its next summit on October 19 and 20.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat\u2019s sufficient? How long is a piece of string?\u201d asked the U.K.\u2019s former Brexit Minister David Jones. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be more of a political decision than anything else.\u201d\u000a\u000aEuropean Council officials acknowledge that the meaning of the phrase is \u201cnot specified.\u201d That allows for a great deal of flexibility when the EU27 leaders meet. Ultimately, it will be a subjective judgment rather than a decision made against a checklist of negotiation goals. The thinking of each leader is likely to be steered by the most powerful Council members \u2014 Angela Merkel (assuming the German chancellor wins the upcoming September 24 election as expected) and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron.\u000a\u000aAccording to U.K. officials, \u201csufficient progress\u201d won\u2019t necessitate putting an actual figure on Britain\u2019s financial liabilities. On Ireland, it\u2019s likely nothing will be settled until the end of the Brexit process. Meanwhile on citizens\u2019 rights, the role of the European Parliament could become significant, introducing a second political dimension that the U.K. will need to be aware of.\u000a\u000aBrexit bill bust-up\u000a\u000aSuccess or otherwise in the \u201csufficient progress\u201d test is likely to hinge on the key issue of the U.K.\u2019s financial obligations \u2014 the requirement, as the EU sees it, to meet commitments already made toward the EU\u2019s budget up to 2020.\u000a\u000aThe EU will at least expect the U.K. to set out its proposal for calculating what its obligations are, if not a final figure. Thus far, the U.K. has refused to do so, preferring to critique the proposals put forward by the EU negotiating team. During the third round of Brexit negotiations, it presented a legal analysis of the EU proposals which rejected the entire basis for the bloc\u2019s calculations. It favors of a more à la carte approach to the budget, with the U.K. paying for those parts (so far unspecified) that it wants to be part of.\u000a\u000aAt the press conference rounding off the talks, David Davis, the U.K.\u2019s Brexit secretary said he had a duty to \u201cinterrogate\u201d the EU\u2019s position on the budget. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say, across the piece we have a very different legal stance,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe key issue for \u2018sufficient progress\u2019 will be money,\u201d said Charles Grant, director of the London-based Centre for European Reform think tank. \u201cThe EU and the U.K. will have to agree on a methodology for calculating the amount that the U.K. must pay.\u201d Such a methodology would have to be \u201cdetailed enough to reassure the EU \u2026 but vague enough so that journalists cannot easily work out a direct figure,\u201d Grant added. EU estimates of this figure range from \u20ac65 billion net to \u20ac100 billion.\u000a\u000aOne reason for the vagueness is it would be politically difficult for Prime Minister Theresa May to present a bill to the British public in October before she has any perks, such as trade concessions, to show for it.\u000a\u000aHaving to settle on a figure to reach the next stage of talks would, in the words of one individual familiar with the British position, be seen by Brexit-supporting British newspapers as \u201cpaying £50 billion for a conversation.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut U.K. officials are clear the Brits will pay something. Downing Street says it does not recognize reports in the British press that the opening offer would be £36 billion, staggered over three years of a transition period. Some Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs said even this was too much, creating a potential political headache for May. But even the Brexiteers are coming around to the idea that some money will have to change hands.\u000a\u000aBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was closely associated with a discredited Vote Leave campaign pledge to repatriate £350 million a week from the EU budget, has subsequently conceded that the U.K. will have to pay something on exit.\u000a\u000aBut he may be unwilling to defend a big payout, Grant said. \u201cIt would make him look silly, after what he said in the referendum campaign \u2026 he might choose to resign rather than defend the deal. But the U.K. will have to pay \u2026 or the EU will simply refuse to discuss the future relationship.\u201d\u000a\u000aCitizens and their Parliament\u000a\u000aOn the question of the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. and U.K. citizens in the EU, the European Council will be under pressure from the European Parliament, which intends to formally indicate, prior to the Council\u2019s decision, whether its Brexit steering group, led by former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, believes \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been reached.\u000a\u000aIn a statement issued July 25 following a meeting with Barnier, the group set out a series of red lines, including safeguarding family reunion rights that the U.K. wants to water down and protecting rights to vote in local elections, which the EU wants to water down. It also sets out its opposition to a U.K. plan to carry out systematic criminal records checks on every current EU resident who applies to stay in the U.K. after Brexit and advocates a \u201cfull role\u201d for the European Court of Justice in safeguarding the rights of citizens on both sides after Brexit.\u000a\u000aWhile the European Parliament position will only be advisory for the Council, one EU official speaking on condition of anonymity said the Council would be wise to heed it. \u201cParliament has a vote on the Brexit deal at the end of the process, so its wishes have to be taken into account when deciding on \u2018sufficient progress,\u2019\u201d the individual said.\u000a\u000aIreland\u000a\u000aThe Council is likely to be lenient in its assessment of \u201csufficient progress\u201d with regards to talks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. While officially classed as an \u201cexit\u201d issue rather than a \u201cfuture relationship\u201d one, there was early agreement in the Brexit talks that the political sensitivity and the importance of preserving the peace process made this set of issues a special case. It has been allocated privileged status within the talks; a \u201cdialogue\u201d led by two of the most senior officials from either side \u2014 May\u2019s Brexit sherpa Oliver Robbins for the U.K. and Barnier\u2019s deputy Sabine Weyand for the EU.\u000a\u000aOne official familiar with the progress of talks said there was an understanding on both sides that the matter would not be resolved until it was clearer what the terms of the U.K.\u2019s trading relationship with the EU would be \u2014 so not until the end of the Brexit talks process.

aVThe stabilization effort, led in part by Republican Lamar Alexander, could yield the first bipartisan Obamacare bill since the law was passed seven years ago. | Zach Gibson/Getty Images Bid to shore up Obamacare faces time crunch, conservative countereffort\u000a\u000aA bipartisan group of senators has palpable momentum but little time to make good on a bid to shore up Obamacare insurance markets, even as conservative Republicans press a parallel attempt to make good on their promise to repeal the health care law.\u000a\u000aThe stabilization effort, led by Republican Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Democrat Patty Murray (Wash.), could yield the first bipartisan Obamacare bill since the law was passed seven years ago. It could also provide some measure of certainty for insurance companies that have until Sept. 27 to make final decisions about whether to participate in Obamacare markets next year.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aConservative Republicans, backed by the Trump administration, are trying to revive the repeal effort \u2014 and are caught in a similar time crunch. The process to fast-track a repeal bill in the Senate expires on Sept. 30, which is driving conservatives to make one last attempt at fulfilling a portion of their seven-year-old campaign pledge to undo Obamacare.\u000a\u000aThe repeal forces are backing a bill under development by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) that would give states block grants to implement their health care programs. Vice President Mike Pence met with Cassidy and Graham to discuss the effort on Wednesday, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who killed the GOP's "skinny" repeal effort in July \u2014 said he's open to the plan.\u000a\u000aBut the bill is not yet fully written, and both Graham and Cassidy refused to share details about what it would do.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019ll know something by the end of the week, one way or another,\u201d Graham said.\u000a\u000aPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aAlexander is focusing on a bill that would fund for at least one year Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing payments, which reduce out-of-pocket costs and which President Donald Trump has threatened to pull. The Senate HELP Committee chairman signaled Wednesday that he\u2019s open to a longer funding stream \u2014 and he also wants to provide new flexibility to a state waiver program in the health care law.\u000a\u000aAlexander wants to shorten the six-month period CMS now has to review waivers and give states fast-track approval if they want to use a waiver concept that's already been approved for another state. A politically diverse group of insurance commissioners told senators at a HELP Committee hearing Wednesday that the process is now too cumbersome and slow.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe more we could streamline that process, the better off we\u2019d be,\u201d Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller said.\u000a\u000aMurray has said she would not support any waiver changes that undermine Obamacare consumer protections. But Republicans will need some structural changes in exchange for support from their side of the aisle.\u000a\u000aThere appears to be growing support for providing federal backing for state reinsurance programs \u2014 financial backstops that help pay for insurers\u2019 costliest patients \u2014 although it is unclear whether that could be accomplished by the end of the month. Democrats have called for a national plan, and Alexander conceded it could conceivably win GOP support; although some Republicans liken reinsurance to a "bailout."\u000a\u000a\u201cIt would add market competition,\u201d Tennessee Insurance Commissioner Julie Mix McPeak said at the hearing. \u201cIt would entice insurers back into the market because it would provide economic certainty.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlexander is loath to broaden the committee\u2019s ambitions, suggesting it\u2019d be difficult to speed a bill through Congress that pours more funding into Obamacare.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf we can do two things, that\u2019ll be two more things we\u2019ve agreed on in a bipartisan way in the last seven years, in health insurance,\u201d Alexander said, adding that a reinsurance program would likely be costly. \u201cThat would take new money. That\u2019d be hard to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aThere is widespread interest in what Alexander and Murray are trying to do. Thirty-one senators attended a closed-door meeting with insurance commissioners before Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\u000a\u000aThere is a small core of support for their effort in the House. Forty members of the bipartisan Problem-Solvers Caucus, led by Trump ally Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and moderate Democrat Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), are backing a proposal similar to Alexander\u2019s. But their version would also significantly curtail the employer mandate to have it apply only to companies with more than 500 employees, the vast majority of which already provide health coverage. The group met Tuesday with several senators, including Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).\u000a\u000a\u201cThere was a sense of optimism that what Lamar Alexander and what Patty Murray are working on does have some legs and could be the initial foundation of success on which bigger success could be built,\u201d Reed said in an interview.\u000a\u000aReed, who is bullish about action before the end of the month, said Trump\u2019s effort to strike a debt limit and government funding deal with Democrats would clear the decks so lawmakers could spend more time focusing on health care this September. He added that the next two weeks will be a make-or-break time for any progress: \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, its going to happen in the next two weeks in the Senate."\u000a\u000aBut not everyone is excited.\u000a\u000aSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the chamber's No. 2 Republican, referred to Alexander\u2019s effort as a \u201cbailout for insurance companies.\u201d And some House members back what Graham and Cassidy are trying to do.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been working with Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) to try to move Graham\u2019s bill. The duo struck a deal last spring that ultimately saved the House\u2019s stalled health care repeal effort; now they\u2019re hoping to be instrumental again.\u000a\u000aMeadows in an interview Wednesday said he\u2019s hopeful that Graham can rally enough support for his bill and that he needs to move \u201csooner rather than later\u201d to beat the Sept. 30 deadline.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re working very diligently on the legislative text,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cSenator Graham has done an outstanding job of trying to get all the stakeholders involved, both moderate and conservative members. It has real merits.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeadow predicted the parallel push by Alexander and Murray could pass the House \u2014 but only with the support of Democrats.\u000a\u000aKyle Cheney contributed to this report.

It said she had lodged a complaint with the prosecutor\u2019s office in Hamburg.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe press witch hunt is becoming more and more absurd. It is not even shying away from covering allegedly intimate health problems. But if false allegations about illness are spread during the research process, that crosses a red line for me,\u201d Weidel said.\u000a\u000aSpiegel rejected Weidel\u2019s claims. \u201cAlice Weidel\u2019s accusations are absolutely baseless,\u201d spokeswoman Anja zum Hingst said via email. \u201cSpiegel is not planning any story about her health.\u201d\u000a\u000aZum Hingst said prosecutors had not notified Spiegel of the criminal complaint announced by the AfD.\u000a\u000aWeidel has recently come under fire for walking out of interviews only a few minutes after they started. Last Friday, she left an interview with the Oberhessische Presse newspaper after only two questions had been asked. She objected to the party being described as anti-foreigner and anti-Islam.\u000a\u000aThis week, she walked out of a live debate on Germany\u2019s ZDF television involving seven politicians from all the parties expected to win seats in parliament.\u000a\u000aIn the debate, Andreas Scheuer of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, called one of Weidel\u2019s party colleagues a \u201cright-wing extremist,\u201d prompting her to leave immediately. Later, on Facebook, Weidel accused the TV show\u2019s host Marietta Slomka of being \u201cbiased and unprofessional.\u201d\u000a\u000aPopular German satirist and comedian Jan Böhmermann suggested Weidel\u2019s walkout was a publicity stunt, saying on Twitter that it \u201cappeared to have been staged.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout stating any reasons, Weidel canceled another interview with the same station scheduled for two days later.

aVEmmanuel Macron at the Elysée palace | Alain Jocard/AFP via Getty Images Macron heads to Greece with big ideas but few specifics French president will give speech at site of early Athenian democracy.\u000a\u000aPARIS \u2014 Emmanuel Macron flies to Athens Thursday for a state visit with messages he hopes will reach a wider audience than the Greek politicians he wants to encourage on their bumpy road to economic reforms.\u000a\u000aThe French president will, in line with the policy of his predecessor François Hollande, reiterate his support for the Greek government\u2019s effort to clinch a deal with its eurozone partners to restructure the country\u2019s massive public debt. But he will also use an open-air speech on the Pnyx \u2014 the hill where citizens of ancient Athens used to hold their meetings \u2014 to restate his vision for the future of the EU, and the need for a more integrated monetary union.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s aides were keen this week to underline the symbolic nature of the French president\u2019s visit and speech in one of the cradles of democracy. But the same aides also implicitly acknowledged that Macron would be long on ideas and short on specifics \u2014 because most of the plans he has for Europe haven\u2019t yet been seriously discussed with his other European partners, most notably Germany, where a general election is just weeks away.\u000a\u000aBriefing reporters ahead of the trip, one presidential adviser seemed to take some pride in noting that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will be the 12th EU leader Macron has met in the space of two weeks. The two-day formal visit will also be one of the French president\u2019s longest trips since he took office, following a series of quick hops in Europe since he came back from holiday on August 28.\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s visit and speeches, however, will not only be aimed at other European leaders and citizens. On the domestic front, he is implementing the first phase of his reform agenda with an overhaul of labor laws, and is currently the most unpopular French president of modern times at this stage of the presidency. He wants to hammer home that his focus on a new French push for European integration is not an exercise in gratuitous self-aggrandizement, but a way to bring more prosperity at home down the road.\u000a\u000aMacron is traveling to Greece with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and some 40 CEOs of French companies, large and small, in a show of force designed to promote French exports and investment. \u201cWhen you look at [Greece\u2019s] growth numbers, investment picking up, unemployment still sky-high but shrinking, you clearly see the need to support Greece in this more positive moment,\u201d a presidential aide said.\u000a\u000aMacron will reiterate his view that Athens will deserve some form of debt restructuring once it has completed its current bailout program in a year\u2019s time. But he will not do anything that would break the so far united front of Greece\u2019s public creditors on the matter, the aide added.\u000a\u000aThe same will be true of eurozone reforms, where Macron isn\u2019t expected to go much further than his often-stated ideas on the creation of a eurozone budget supervised by a eurozone finance minister, and the need for \u201cmore democracy\u201d in decision-making around the monetary union.\u000a\u000aHe will stick to broad strokes because none of what he has in mind \u2014 much of it remaining fuzzy \u2014 has seriously been discussed with the German government. Only once a new government takes office in Berlin after the September 24 election will Macron push the issue.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe can\u2019t say that we need a more collective, democratic process and at the same time announce that a full and complete plan will be announced in Athens,\u201d the Macron aide said.

A date will now be arranged between No. 10 Downing Street and Tajani\u2019s team, a government official said.\u000a\u000aThe Conference of Presidents is chaired by Tajani and attended by the leaders of all the political groupings.\u000a\u000aThe prime minister said in June that she had been in \u201cdiscussions\u201d with Tajani about the possibility of becoming the first U.K. prime minister to address the European Parliament since Gordon Brown in 2009.\u000a\u000aHowever, a Downing Street official told POLITICO earlier this week there were \u201cno plans\u201d to address the Parliament.\u000a\u000aResponding, the Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, said May had \u201cso far refused our invitations\u201d and urged her not to underestimate the importance of the Parliament.\u000a\u000a\u201cI fear the U.K. government and others are taking it for granted that MEPs will fall into line and agree any withdrawal agreement, but this would be a mistake,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aAn EU official said: \u201cTajani told political leaders a couple of hours ago that May has accepted an invite \u2014 but it will be a closed session just with a few of them.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Conference of Presidents, which meets twice a month, met Thursday and was given a presentation by Verhofstadt.\u000a\u000aA \u201cclear majority\u201d of leaders agreed the assessment on whether \u201csufficient progress\u201d on the first phase of Brexit negotiations was unlikely to be met by October, according to a press statement.\u000a\u000aThe Conference of Presidents decided the Parliament would adopt a resolution in October focusing on the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. and U.K. citizens in the EU post Brexit, and setting out its priorities on the Irish and Northern Irish border and assessing the financial situation.

aVHolding skeptical views on oil and gas would seem to be electoral suicide in Norway, a country that became rich thanks to fossil fuel exports.\u000a\u000aBut two such parties look set to take seats in the September 11 vote, and potentially play a key role in the coalition building that usually follows Norwegian elections.\u000a\u000aLow oil prices, growing concerns over climate change and the rise of environmental parties have for the first time sparked a debate about whether Norway \u2014 one of the EU\u2019s leading gas suppliers \u2014 should be so reliant on one industry.\u000a\u000aThe Green Party wants a halt to oil and gas exploration and to phase out existing fields within 15 years. It took one seat in the 169-member Storting in 2013 with 2.8 percent of the vote, but a new poll conducted for state broadcaster NRK has the party with 4.2 percent support \u2014 enough to give it seven seats.\u000a\u000aThe Socialist Left, which currently holds seven seats, wants a ban on new permits for oil and gas drilling. The poll gives it 6.1 percent of the vote share, enough for 11 seats.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the first time in Norwegian history, the future of the industry is under focus when people go to vote,\u201d said 22-year-old Anna Kvam, a first-time candidate from the Greens.\u000a\u000aLabor, the leading center-left party, is running at 24.4 percent in opinion polls. That would give it 46 seats, far short of the 85 needed for a majority. Labor says it won\u2019t work with the Greens, but most calculations of post-election coalition-building include at least one of the two oil and gas-skeptical parties.\u000a\u000aIn the 2013 election, Labor came first with 55 seats, but was unable to form a ruling coalition. That allowed the Conservative Party under the leadership of Prime Minister Erna Solberg to form a government together with the right-wing Progress Party and support from the smaller Christian Democrats and Liberals. The Conservatives have 25.7 percent in polls \u2014 and any coalition built by them is unlikely to include left-leaning environmentalists.\u000a\u000aIn the 2013 round of horse-trading, drilling in environmentally sensitive areas was an issue, but the future of oil and gas wasn\u2019t \u2014 especially because both the Conservatives and Labor support the sector and aren\u2019t keen to upend an industry that has made Norway one of the wealthiest countries on the planet.\u000a\u000aA lot has changed since then.\u000a\u000aNorway goes green\u000a\u000aThe Paris climate summit helped solidify views as to the seriousness of climate change \u2014 where Norway joined with the EU in pushing for an agreement to keep temperature rises to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. The country is a world leader in the adoption of electric cars, thanks in part to generous subsidies that are possible because of the money generated by selling oil and gas.\u000a\u000aRecent oil price turbulence also underlined the risk of being too tied to a single revenue stream.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil the last few years it was almost impossible to talk about the implications of the oil industry and climate change in the same sentence,\u201d said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. \u201cSomething is really happening.\u201d\u000a\u000aGulowsen said the fall in oil prices made the shift happen: The government reported a more than 40 percent drop in revenues from the sector in 2016 compared to 2015.\u000a\u000aAbout 50,000 people in the industry lost their jobs when crude prices collapsed in 2014 \u2014 a fifth of the sector\u2019s workforce at the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe tone in the debate has changed,\u201d said Labor MP Per Rune Henriksen, who was also state secretary for energy between 2010 and 2013. \u201cNow we are talking more about the economic risks in the oil and gas industry.\u201d\u000a\u000aKarl Eirik Schjøtt-Pedersen, director general at the Norwegian oil and gas association as well as a former minister and Labor MP, agreed the topic is higher on the agenda, and said that\u2019s because of the \u201cvery loud voices from the Greens.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a small minority advocating for changes,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aA recent survey from the Norwegian oil and gas association showed that 70 percent of Norwegians believe it is important to maintain the country\u2019s oil and gas industry \u2014 with young people more skeptical of the industry than older Norwegians. Another survey by the Dagbladet newspaper showed that 44 percent of Norwegians are willing to let some oil reserves remain in the ground to save the climate, while 42 percent disagree.\u000a\u000aThe fight over oil and gas is most acute in Norway\u2019s Arctic Lofoten and Vesterålen islands. The region is home to the world\u2019s largest cold-water coral reef and the source of most of Norway\u2019s fish supply \u2014 but it is also estimated to hold billions of barrels of crude.\u000a\u000aIndustry has been keen to drill there for years, but the current government was forced to keep the region off limits as part of a coalition deal after the last election. The government tried to reverse that ban last year, but was forced to retreat after a backlash from environmentalists and the fishing industry.\u000a\u000aA recent poll showed that 58 percent of respondents want to leave the Lofoten and Vesterålen free from oil drilling, while 27 percent want to recover the resources.\u000a\u000aDrill baby, drill\u000a\u000a\u201cThe potential is big for employment and for bringing additional income to the national treasury,\u201d said Elnar Remi Holmen, Norway\u2019s secretary of state for petroleum and energy from the Progress Party.\u000a\u000aProgress has been the most avid supporter of drilling in Lofoten and Vesterålen, while the Greens, the Socialist Left and the agrarian Center Party want to leave it oil-free.\u000a\u000aThe main parties are pro-exploration, but even they have had to soften their approach \u2014 a sign of the shifting debate.\u000a\u000aThe Conservatives pledged a thorough assessment to understand how drilling may affect tourism and the fisheries sector. Labor wants to partly open up the region to drilling, also following an initial assessment, but promised to avoid the most sensitive areas close to Lofoten\u2019s shores.\u000a\u000aKvam said she hopes opposition from \u201cthe big green block in the parliament\u201d will leave the area untouched.\u000a\u000aBut the industry is hopeful that the rise of environmental parties won\u2019t derail the country\u2019s traditional reliance on oil and gas.\u000a\u000aRegardless of which of the two big parties form the government in September, Schjøtt-Pedersen said that \u201cneither the Conservative Party nor the Labor Party will accept any essential changes to the country\u2019s oil and gas policy even if other parties put pressure.\u201d\u000a\u000aHenriksen, the Labor MP, said: \u201cAs long as there is a demand for oil and gas on the market, somebody has to produce it \u2026 Why should we keep our hands clean and let Saudi Arabia, Nigeria or the U.S. take this market?\u201d\u000a\u000aThis article has been updated with newer polling data.

aVWashington (CNN) Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Democrat to announce she'll co-sponsor Sen. Bernie Sanders' single-payer health care bill when it's introduced in September.\u000a\u000aThe California freshman -- seen as a rising star in the party and a 2020 presidential prospect -- revealed her plans to back Sanders' legislation at a town hall Wednesday night in Oakland.\u000a\u000a"Here, I'll break some news: I intend to co-sponsor the Medicare-for-all bill, because it's just the right thing to do," Harris said.

aVPresident of the Catalan Government Carles Puigdemont (fourth from the left) and other members of the Catalan parliament applaud the results of the vote on a bill for a referendum on independence in Barcelona, on September 6, 2017 | Lluis Gene/AFP via Getty Images 7 takeaways from Catalonia\u2019s insurrection day Catalan parliament approves October 1 independence vote.\u000a\u000aMADRID \u2014 Catalan separatists moved from words to deeds Wednesday when the regional Cabinet of Carles Puigdemont signed a decree calling a self-determination referendum for October 1, and the secessionist majority of the Catalan legislative chamber approved a bill paving the way for the vote.\u000a\u000aThe move culminates a years-long build-up of the Catalan secessionist movement, which a decade ago barely gathered the support of 15 percent of Catalans, and places the regional government and the legislature in open defiance of Spain\u2019s constitution and the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\u000a\u000aThe stage is set for one of the gravest political crises Spain has faced in its 40-year-long recent democratic history.\u000a\u000a\u201cCatalonia will decide its own future on October 1,\u201d Puigdemont said in a speech after signing the decree. \u201cNo one has the authority nor the power to seize our right to decide.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter approving the bill, secessionist legislators sang Els Segadors, the Catalan anthem. Pro-unity lawmakers had abandoned the hall in protest before the vote.\u000a\u000aRajoy\u2019s Cabinet took the first legal steps to tackle the independence push before the vote took place by challenging in the Constitutional Court the decision by the bureau of the Catalan assembly to go ahead with the processing of the bill and by asking the tribunal to act against Carme Forcadell, the president of the Catalan chamber. The public prosecutor also announced a criminal action against the five lawmakers who made the decision, including Forcadell. Further legal action challenging the referendum law and Puigdemont\u2019s decree calling the vote is expected Thursday.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re going to defend the constitution, democracy and liberties,\u201d Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, the deputy prime minister, told reporters in the afternoon, adding the Catalan chamber\u2019s session debating the bill was \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201ca kick to democracy.\u201d\u000a\u000aHere are seven takeaways from Catalonia\u2019s insurrection day.\u000a\u000a1. There may not be a vote\u000a\u000aMadrid and the Spanish judiciary have enough tools to prevent a vote, which will most likely be declared unconstitutional by the courts. Rajoy gave a hint Wednesday on how he intends to proceed: challenging all legal steps in the courts and targeting the top officials involved. The Constitutional Court has powers to urge officials to comply with its judicial decisions and suspend them from office if they refuse to do so. Other measures could include the seizure of some competencies of the regional executive.\u000a\u000aRajoy is under increasing pressure from some conservatives to teach Catalan separatists a lesson, but a harsh response could lead to increased support for independence in Catalonia. Madrid may opt for a softer approach, avoiding the most drastic measures and tolerating a de facto vote \u2014 similar to the informal ballot on independence that took place in 2014 \u2014 while refusing to accept its legitimacy and ignoring its results.\u000a\u000a2. Puigdemont in the firing line\u000a\u000aWhatever the outcome, Madrid and the Spanish courts are determined to make Catalan officials pay for challenging the country\u2019s unity.\u000a\u000aWhile Puigdemont has vowed to go to prison for the sake of independence if necessary, Catalan officials are more likely to face being banned from public office and fines. That was the case for former Catalan President Artur Mas and those responsible for organizing the 2014 informal vote on secession, who were found guilty of disobeying court orders.\u000a\u000aSpain\u2019s Court of Auditors on Tuesday hinted what\u2019s to come for Puigdemont and his allies when it demanded Mas and other organizers of the 2014 vote post a \u20ac5.1 million bail for the public funds used in organizing the 2014 ballot.\u000a\u000a3. A common unionist front emerges\u000a\u000aThe leader of the main opposition Socialists, Pedro Sánchez, and the head of the liberal Ciudadanos party, Albert Rivera, have publicly offered their support to Rajoy in order to maintain the rule of law in the face of the Catalan challenge. Together with the PM\u2019s Popular Party, the common unionist front adds up to around 73 percent of lawmakers in the Spanish parliament and 39 percent of the seats in the Catalan regional chamber. Rajoy, Sánchez and Rivera exchanged calls this week and plan to meet Thursday.\u000a\u000aWhereas Rajoy\u2019s minority government can count on the support of a majority of the opposition, slight differences have surfaced in how each party wants to tackle the issue. Rivera, for instance, asked Rajoy not to tolerate another informal vote on independence like the one in 2014. Sánchez, on the other hand, said Wednesday in a radio interview the issue shouldn\u2019t be over dramatized.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey call it a referendum but it\u2019s not a referendum,\u201d Sánchez said.\u000a\u000a4. Propaganda is key\u000a\u000aBoth sides are waging a merciless propaganda war in which facts are systematically spun, no topic is off-limits \u2014 not even the terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils last month \u2014 and those who attempt to stay on the fence are publicly shamed.\u000a\u000aAt stake is how to portray the whole conflict at the Catalan, Spanish and international level. Pro-independence forces say Spain is an authoritarian country that refuses to allow Catalans to express their democratic will at the ballot box. The Spanish government labels separatists fanatics who despise democracy and the rule of law.\u000a\u000aWhile the Catalan government has sought and failed to obtain meaningful backing from foreign governments, it has proven skilful at making its voice heard in the foreign media. The public relations war is only likely to increase in the run up to October 1, with both sides attempting to pin the blame on the other.\u000a\u000a5. A Catalan Maidan could backfire\u000a\u000aOne of the most delicate matters is whether the current conflict could escalate to a civil disobedience campaign in the streets of Catalonia, mirroring the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf there was a government offensive to remove the ballot boxes, then obviously we will mobilize the citizens to prevent that from happening,\u201d Marta Rovira, the No. 2 of the Catalan Republican Left \u2014 Puigdemont\u2019s coalition partner \u2014 told reporters Sunday.\u000a\u000aSuch a move would obviously attract international attention, fulfilling one of the aims of Puigdemont and his allies, but it may be a double-edged sword that could backfire against the separatists.\u000a\u000aSome independence supporters have long advocated for civil disobedience \u2014 namely the radical-left Popular Unity Candidacy, the junior partner of the secessionist alliance. A significant portion of independence supporters, however, are middle-class moderates, who may be reluctant to join such actions or even drop support for the cause if things get out of control.\u000a\u000aMuch attention will be paid on Monday to the Diada, or Catalan national day, a celebration when millions have rallied in support of independence in previous years, for hints of how the conflict may play out in the streets.\u000a\u000a6. It\u2019s a numbers game\u000a\u000aIf the referendum does go ahead, much will depend on how many people actually vote. Catalan unionists are largely expected to abstain. Pro-independence forces have vowed the referendum will be binding regardless of turnout, but it\u2019s clear low participation would weaken their leverage.\u000a\u000aSupport for Catalan independence has fallen in recent polls from a peak in 2013. Madrid was optimistic the country\u2019s current economic revival could reduce the movement to a more manageable level \u2014 the economic crisis was one of the key drivers of the Catalan independence push. Any misstep in the current crisis could blow up the equation.\u000a\u000aThe latest research from the Catalan government-funded Centre d\u2019Estudis d\u2019Opinió found 48 percent of citizens wanted a referendum regardless of the opposition of the Spanish government, while 23.4 percent wanted a vote only with a green light from Madrid. In the same poll, 41.1 percent supported secession, while 49.4 percent opposed.\u000a\u000a7. The headache won\u2019t end October 1\u000a\u000aWhether the vote takes place on October 1 or not, the day after will prove problematic for Spain. The Catalan government and the secessionist majority of the regional chamber have rebelled against the principle of Spanish national sovereignty, upheld by the country\u2019s constitution and supported by a majority of Spanish political forces. A significant compromise would be needed for both sides to find a negotiated solution.\u000a\u000aPuigdemont told POLITICO in July a proposal without independence, which secures Catalan competencies and addresses complaints about language, finances, infrastructure and education, would obtain widespread support in Catalonia.\u000a\u000aThe Socialists\u2019 Sánchez proposed a commission in Congress to explore potential solutions and has obtained Rajoy\u2019s backing for the initiative \u2014 but significantly not the support of Catalan independence forces. Even if it gets going, such a commission will have to overcome massive political difference both between pro- and anti-independence supporters and among the forces defending the unity of the country.

aVA hard Brexit could turn into a stinking problem for the British government.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is one of the European Union\u2019s top waste exporters. It sends more than 3 million tons a year to other EU countries, accounting for over 10 percent of the U.K.\u2019s waste that isn\u2019t reused or recycled. The mixed waste is sent abroad as refuse-derived fuel, trash that has been treated so that it can be burned for energy.\u000a\u000aA hard break from the European Union risks creating a \u201cpotential disaster scenario,\u201d leaving the country stuck with large amounts of garbage that it does not have the capacity to process, waste management company Suez warned last month. A related issue is dealing with a mountain of materials that can be recycled, but that the U.K. can\u2019t process itself and also exports.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cHard borders, import tariffs and a weakening sterling will make waste exports to Europe, which the U.K. continues to rely upon, financially unviable,\u201d said David Palmer-Jones, CEO of Suez recycling and recovery U.K.\u000a\u000aIf Brexit blocks the U.K.\u2019s waste exports to the EU, or just makes them more expensive because of tariffs, that could hike environmental costs borne by businesses and increase the amount of trash put into landfills \u2014 the worst way to deal with waste from an environmental perspective.\u000a\u000aExperts agree on one thing: The U.K. will have to rethink its waste policy, now shaped by the EU.\u000a\u000aSuez, which also operates waste-to-energy plants in Britain, is urging the government to build more facilities in the country to close the \u201ccapacity gap\u201d in residual waste treatment, especially incineration plants.\u000a\u000aThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declined to answer questions on the impact of Brexit on the U.K.\u2019s waste exports but said the needs related to waste infrastructure are being assessed. \u201cWe recognize the need for a mix of infrastructure and this will form part of a renewed strategy on waste and resources that looks ahead to opportunities outside the EU,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said.\u000a\u000aOn top of mixed waste exports, the U.K. exports roughly 15 million tons of recovered material for recycling (metals, paper, plastics and glass) because it lacks the capacity to reprocess the materials at home and treatment costs are lower abroad. Although most of those recyclables go to Asia, largely China, some are reprocessed in EU countries, mainly glass.\u000a\u000aChina recently announced it plans to put in restrictions on recyclable imports, something that is likely to affect the U.K. as well as other EU countries.\u000a\u000aHowever, not everyone agrees with Suez\u2019s grim Brexit scenario.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the U.K. was to completely dissociate from the EU, we could still be exporting [refuse-derived fuel] to EU countries\u201d using the legal framework provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, if at a higher cost, said Dominic Hogg, chairman of Eunomia Research and Consulting. The consultancy estimated that export volumes would remain the same and the U.K. will actually end up with an excess of residual waste treatment capacity in the next decade, thanks to improved recycling rates.\u000a\u000aTrashing EU recycling goals\u000a\u000aExperts agree on one thing: The U.K. will have to rethink its waste policy, now shaped by the EU, once it leaves the bloc.\u000a\u000aThe question is whether a post-Brexit U.K. will stick with EU-set recycling targets. EU countries have to recycle or reuse at least 50 percent of their municipal waste by 2020, and are now negotiating a 65 percent recycling target for 2030.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. hasn\u2019t disclosed its position on the new targets, but Therese Coffey, minister in charge of waste management at the environment department, said in 2016 that the 2030 recycling targets were \u201ctoo high.\u201d More recently, she signaled that the U.K. could move away from targets based on the weight of recycled waste, as the EU uses, and instead focus on resource efficiency.\u000a\u000aThis uncertainty comes amid concerns that Britain will fall short of the 2020 goal. Although recycling in the country has improved over the years, the rate in England dropped in 2015 for the first time in over a decade to 43.9 percent.\u000a\u000aThe Labour Party and circular economy experts want to increase recycling rather than bet on waste-to-energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think we will get there, and that is the consequence of seven years of a virtual vacuum of waste policy in the U.K.,\u201d Hogg said.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. has reduced the amount of waste sent to landfill in recent years. However, it diverted more to incineration for energy, which is not considered the most resource efficient way to deal with waste.\u000a\u000aOperators including Suez argue that boosting waste-to-energy at home would solve two problems at once \u2014 getting rid of waste while increasing domestic energy production.\u000a\u000aSuez thinks the message has been well-received.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I met with [then-Climate Change Minister] Nick Hurd, the British will was very clear,\u201d Jean-Marc Boursier, deputy director general for recycling at Suez said in an interview. He said the government wants to bring some of the waste processing back to the U.K. from abroad and \u201cslightly diverge\u201d from EU targets in favor of incineration rather than recycling.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHowever, the opposition Labour Party and circular economy experts want to increase recycling rather than bet on waste-to-energy.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have got to reduce, reuse and recycle. We do not need more incineration capacity,\u201d said David Drew, Labour\u2019s shadow junior environment minister. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice notion that you\u2019re going to get energy from waste, but I think it\u2019s more important that we find other ways in which we produce our energy. This is really a sideshow.\u201d

aVFifteen miles outside of Baton Rouge, on a road washed out by the flooding that submerged a nearby highway, Robert Formeller is rebuilding his property, or trying to. An insurance agent and sole proprietor of the real estate company Formeller Investments LLC, he owns three small office buildings in Denham Springs, Louisiana. Having lived through the disastrous Louisiana floods in 1983, Formeller invested almost $100,000 raising the office buildings above historic flood levels.\u000a\u000aBut the torrential rains that struck the Baton Rouge region in August flooded the buildings anyway. He\u2019s been spending days and nights since working to recover his business before mold sets in and his tenants move out. \u201cHe's tapping into every loose dollar he can find to get things moving and get on top of the recovery,\u201d said his daughter, Nicole Gould.\u000a\u000aAs millions in disaster-relief money pours into Louisiana, you might think a good federal disaster policy would get money to people like Formeller almost immediately, giving them enough short-term cash to keep their businesses afloat. And you\u2019d be right: experts on disaster recovery think getting money quickly to small-business owners is crucial not just for the owners, but letting the community around them recover. One oft-cited study by the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that 40 percent of small businesses that close for even a day after a disaster never reopen.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Small businesses] are so much the part of a fabric of a community,\u201d said Robin Keegan, the former executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which was created following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to oversee the recovery. \u201cIn most cases, the recovery of a community is almost a mission rather than a profit-making endeavor. They need the resources to be part of that recovery.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter Katrina, Congress passed a new law designed to do just that. The Immediate Disaster Assistance Program, 1 of 3 emergency loan programs created under a 2008 law, was supposed to funnel money to small businesses within 36 hours of a disaster, with a government guarantee for the lender. But as POLITICO reported last year, that program \u2014 which was supposed to be piloted in 2010 \u2014 had never actually managed to secure a loan for any small business.\u000a\u000aCongress held a hearing on the problem last summer, but today, as Louisiana faces its worst disaster since Katrina, the emergency loan program still hasn\u2019t secured a single loan. What has happened, instead, is a bit of buck-passing. Last year, Congress was pointing the finger at the Small Business Administration, which was supposed to administer the loans but had never actually helped issue one. This year, Congress has the agency\u2019s feedback on what went wrong \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear what, if anything, lawmakers plan to do about it.\u000a\u000aSo far the SBA has spent $3 million on the program. Its eight-year history has become a story of slipshod reporting and missed deadlines. And it still hasn\u2019t funneled a dollar to people like Formeller.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat would be critically important, especially getting it up in 36 hours,\u201d said Charles D\u2019Agostino, executive director of the LSU Innovation Park, a research complex in Baton Rouge. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a week. We don\u2019t have two weeks.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe emergency loan program was invented to fill a gap. Businesses actually can get disaster relief from Washington, but it takes a while \u2014 after Superstorm Sandy, the Government Accountability Office found it took nearly 40 days for SBA to review disaster loan applications from small businesses. In that time, they can lose inventory, miss payroll, lose all their customers, and usually need short-term cash to keep the doors open. The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act was supposed to do that, offering loan guarantees to local banks, with a goal of approving the money for businesses within 36 hours.\u000a\u000aCongress appropriated $3 million in the 2010 fiscal year for the SBA to pilot the program, and the agency actually released rules for it the same year. But the pilot never happened, with the agency repeatedly pushing back its projected launch date. The GAO investigated the delays and delivered a scathing report against the agency in 2014. The watchdog pinpointed two main problems: faulty computers and an unwillingness among lenders to participate.\u000a\u000aLast summer, despite the GAO report, the program still hadn\u2019t made a loan, and POLITICO reported that lawmakers were increasingly concerned with SBA\u2019s ability to get it up and running. The agency said it had solved its computer problems but had been unable to persuade banks to take part in the program under the strict financial terms required by law. It reiterated that complaint this summer, sending a letter in July to Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, outlining comments it had received from lenders who refused to participate in the program.\u000a\u000aIs the program doomed because banks simply won\u2019t help? The National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, a trade association for banks and other institutions, sent detailed objections to the loan rules in a comment to the SBA, and went so far as to argue that disaster funding shouldn\u2019t be their job, writing: \u201cproviding loans to assist such individuals and entities is an inherently governmental function and is a role unsuited to private commercial lenders.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut on the ground, it\u2019s not clear how big an obstacle that really is. In Baton Rouge, Nicole Gould said that a local bank quickly said it could lend her father the emergency money he needed \u2014 even without the government guarantee. She\u2019d originally tried to help her father apply for disaster loans from the SBA, but gave up on trying to fill out the forms after spending hours on them and getting only halfway through. \u201cThere's not enough time to spend on a 10-hour application,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just talked to the banker and he promised us the lending is on and their rate is going to be very close to 4 percent anyway. They already have the first mortgage on the property. They have a vested interest in the property succeeding.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe state of Louisiana has had good luck working with local banks as well. After Katrina, the state set up a temporary bridge loan program to help small businesses recover. Like the Immediate Disaster Assistance Program, the Louisiana program worked through private-sector lenders. Its terms were slightly better than the federal program: The SBA law offers banks an 85 percent repayment guarantee; Louisiana offered 100 percent. The program delivered $10 million in loans to 407 small businesses within three weeks.\u000a\u000aThe idea does require some community spirit on the part of banks: Even with a 100 percent loan guarantee, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make the banks any money,\u201d said Adam Knapp, who was the policy director for the Louisiana Economic Development agency at the time and now is the CEO of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber,. \u201cThey are doing it out of their goodwill.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe NAGGL did not respond to a message asking for further comment on its objections to the loan program.\u000a\u000aBy all accounts, the SBA has improved its processes for responding to natural disasters in recent years. It has been quick to set up field offices in the region and put out information for how affected businesses can apply for loans. But the flooding in Louisiana is putting the agency to its first major test since Sandy. Through Thursday, the agency had received 801 applications for its traditional business disaster loans. So far it has approved only 92 for a total of $7.9 million; it declined 243, with 415 still pending. (51 were withdrawn.) Carol Chastang, a spokesperson for the agency, said the applications are being processed within five days \u2014 not quite 36 hours, but far better than the SBA\u2019s processing times after Sandy. However, keeping up that pace will be critical as more small-business owners file their applications. The agency received nearly 15,000 applications after Sandy. While the numbers aren\u2019t expected to reach that high in the Baton Rouge region, Knapp estimates that 12,000 small businesses were affected, so the number of applications could rise considerably in the coming weeks.\u000a\u000a\u201cGetting cash out within about a week is really the time frame you want,\u201d said Michael Hecht, the president of Greater New Orleans, a regional economic development group.\u000a\u000aSo the complaints do seem to have improved at least one part of the disaster lending program. As for the quicker emergency loan program launched in 2008? The short answer is that it\u2019s been punted: The SBA has told Congress what the problems are, so in theory the impetus for fixing them falls on Congress. Potential solutions to make it more appealing to banks include increasing the loan guarantee and loosening restrictions on the loan term and associated fees, which would require changes to the law. In November, Congress passed legislation, sponsored by Velázquez, that made small changes to the traditional disaster loan program and gave businesses affected by Sandy another chance to apply for aid, but did not address the loan programs created under the 2008 legislation.\u000a\u000aIn response to questions about whether Congress was considering changes to the program, Velázquez said in a statement, \u201cWe should look carefully at potential changes to improve these other disaster loan initiatives, encourage private sector involvement and create more options for businesses impacted by disasters. It is inexcusable that the agency has taken 8 years and still hasn't been able to get this program off the ground. If legislative changes are necessary, we can look into them and I would hope my Republican colleagues would be open to such an effort, but regardless the agency needs to make this initiative a priority." Any changes will ultimately be up to the committee chairman, Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), and Republican leaders in Congress. Chabot's staff said they were awaiting another GAO report in October.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in Baton Rouge, the community is coming together to help each other in any way it can. D\u2019Agostino, who has worked with small businesses in the region for almost 30 years, said he and his staff drove around handing out Visa gift cards and household goods like toothbrush and toothpaste\u2014the small items that are critical for people to get their lives back on track but are easily overlooked. He offered small businesses a computer with Internet and a phone to call suppliers, cancel deliveries and inform customers their orders would not arrive on time.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental thing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis is not going to be a short process.\u201d\u000a\u000aAfter publication, Rep. Velázquez's office provided an additional statement on the need for the Small Business Administration to prioritize the emergency loan program. The story has been updated to include it.

aVMerkel and Erdo\u011fan pose for a picture after meeting in Istanbul | Tolga Bozoglu/EPA Erdo\u011fan calls Merkel\u2019s stance on EU membership \u2018Nazism\u2019 The Turkish president blasted the German chancellor for discussing an end to EU accession talks.\u000a\u000aTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Wednesday criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her election rival Martin Schulz for discussing an end to EU accession talks for his country, German media reported.\u000a\u000aIn a TV debate on Sunday, Schulz made clear that if he were elected, he would break off negotiations immediately, while Merkel said Tuesday she would push the European Union to reconsider its relationship with Turkey.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhat happened is Nazism,\u201d said Erdo\u011fan in response. \u201cWhat happened is fascism.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI am not saying \u2018you are a Nazi, you are a fascist.\u2019 I am only defining what happened.\u201d\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Erdo\u011fan compared German officials to Nazis after local authorities blocked Turkish politicians from speaking at rallies ahead of a Turkish referendum on expanding the president\u2019s powers.\u000a\u000aThe Turkish president maintained that his government still has the goal of becoming a full EU member. He argued that while Turkey has fulfilled the necessary requirements, the EU has not kept its promises, calling accusations against Turkey something \u201cnot to be tolerated.\u201d\u000a\u000aBoth Schulz and Merkel have condemned Erdo\u011fan\u2019s crackdown against opponents in the wake of a failed coup last year. Twelve Germans are currently being held as political prisoners in Turkey, according to the German government.\u000a\u000aMerkel on Tuesday called political developments in Turkey \u201cmore than alarming,\u201d and warned that the country was \u201cincreasingly leaving the path of the rule of law.\u201d\u000a\u000aErdo\u011fan also compared the current atmosphere in Europe to the rise of fascism before World War II.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know where this approach of Europe leads?

aVBERLIN \u2014 Lurking just beneath the surface in any debate about advances in digitalization and automation is a deep-seated fear that sooner or later robots will replace humans.\u000a\u000aFor Germany, what some call the \u201cRobot Apocalypse\u201d might actually be a good thing \u2014 if it helps alleviate the looming skilled-worker shortage that\u2019s threatening to undermine Europe\u2019s largest economy.\u000a\u000aIf anything, Berlin might even be wishing for more \u2014 smarter \u2014 robots.\u000a\u000aBy 2030, Germany could face a shortage of 3 million skilled workers, according to recent research by consulting firm Prognos AG. While digitalization could compensate for as much as half of the lost labor pool by some estimates, it won\u2019t resolve the problem.\u000a\u000aIndeed, for all the promise of digital manufacturing, there\u2019s little evidence automation will lead to fewer industrial jobs overall.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re not going to run out of work, but it\u2019s going to become more complex,\u201d said Christian Böllhoff, the head of Swiss-based Prognos, which has studied the effects of digitalization on Germany\u2019s workforce.\u000a\u000aEven if advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to substitute even mid-level staff, as some technologists predict, companies will continue to need skilled workers to manage and service the new machinery.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fastest and most effective way to deal with the skilled-worker shortage is to improve the situation for working families\u201d \u2014 Christian Böllhoff, head of Swiss-based Prognos\u000a\u000aWhile job descriptions are expected to change, most jobs are expected to remain. Researchers at the Mannheim-based ZEW economic institute project that just 12 percent of German jobs are exposed to automation.\u000a\u000aCompanies are already worried. For the first time, a majority of German firms cited Fachkräftemangel (skilled-worker shortage) as the top risk to their businesses in a regular business sentiment survey by the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK). Four out of five companies say the difficulty they have in finding skilled workers is preventing them from investing in innovation, while half see their economic future at risk, according to another report.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe challenge is huge,\u201d German Labor Minister Andrea Nahles acknowledged last week.\u000a\u000aBiology is the root of Germany\u2019s skilled-worker problem. Germany, which has one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates, is aging fast. Beginning around 2020, the country\u2019s baby boomers will begin going into retirement, robbing the economy of a crucial source of expert labor. By 2060, Germany\u2019s work-age population, now at 50 million, could fall by a quarter, according to government projections.\u000a\u000aDemographics isn\u2019t the only issue: Not enough German students are preparing for the digital future.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s vocational apprentice system, in which companies offer high-school students on-the-job training, is admired around the world. But not enough students are going into IT-related professions. Last year, for example, IT only ranked fifth among young men pursuing an apprenticeship. Twice as many students took up training as car mechanics. Among young women, office management topped the list, followed by retail sales.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe need to rethink how we secure skilled labor in Germany,\u201d Nahles said.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s easier said than done.\u000a\u000aObvious options, such as raising the retirement age are politically tricky. Germany recently raised its retirement age to 67 and though economists argue it should be raised to 70, that\u2019s unlikely to happen any time soon. In Sunday\u2019s campaign debate between Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz, her Social Democrat challenger, the chancellor pledged not to hike the retirement age.\u000a\u000aAnother possible solution is immigration. Germany has benefited from an influx of EU labor in recent years, but has had more difficulty attracting qualified workers from other parts of the world.\u000a\u000aSince 2012, Germany has attracted more than 60,000 highly-skilled workers under the EU\u2019s Blue Card program.\u000a\u000aThe country would need a much larger influx to compensate for the skilled workers leaving the workforce. But political costs of opening Germany\u2019s doors to foreigners \u2014 as illustrated by the recent refugee crisis \u2014 can be considerable.\u000a\u000aAn easier option could be to get more women into the workforce by improving Germany\u2019s childcare infrastructure. While nearly 70 percent of working-age German women are in the labor force, about half are in part-time work.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe fastest and most effective way to deal with the skilled-worker shortage is to improve the situation for working families,\u201d Prognos\u2019 Böllhoff said. \u201cThat means creating conditions that allow women, in particular, to pursue employment.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhatever solution German policymakers pursue, there\u2019s a broad consensus that they need to act soon.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday we are a country enjoying the highest level of employment in our history, for which we receive considerable praise in Europe\u201d \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u000a\u000aAs the country\u2019s pool of skilled technicians and engineers withers, German companies are likely to invest more in regions with the skills they need, such as North America and Asia.\u000a\u000aIn some areas, this is already happening.\u000a\u000aConsider Germany\u2019s vaunted car industry, which employs about 1.8 million people directly and indirectly in the country.\u000a\u000aThough brands such as Mercedes and BMW still benefit from their \u201cMade in Germany\u201d cachet, many of their cars are already made in other parts of the world. BMW, for example, produces more cars at its plant in South Carolina in the U.S. than it does at its main Munich factory.\u000a\u000aGermany\u2019s solid economic performance in recent years and its low unemployment rate have largely masked its unpreparedness for the digital revolution.\u000a\u000aThat said, Germany\u2019s political leadership isn\u2019t blind to the threat. Even the German chancellor has begun subtly warning of the challenges that lie ahead.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday we are a country enjoying the highest level of employment in our history, for which we receive considerable praise in Europe,\u201d Merkel said a speech to the German parliament on Tuesday. \u201cBut I also have the feeling that we\u2019re on the threshold of a new stage, one focused on the main driver of the modern age \u2013 digital innovation.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe POLITICO Global Policy Lab is a collaborative journalism project seeking solutions to challenges faced by modern economies in an age of political disruption and technological transformation.

aVNearly eight years since the beginning of the Great Recession, the American economy finally gained back all of the jobs lost during the economic downturn.\u000a\u000aWhile this is positive news, underlying structural concerns remain, resulting in historically low labor force participation, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, and a \u201cmissing generation\u201d of firms. Together, these factors are a drag on the economy, sapping dynamism.\u000a\u000aPolicymakers often think of small business as the employment engine of the economy. But when it comes to job-creating power, it is not the size of the business that matters as much as it is the age. New and young companies are the primary source of job creation in the American economy. Not only that, but these firms also contribute to economic dynamism by injecting competition into markets and spurring innovation.\u000a\u000aRepresenting 95 percent of all U.S. companies, businesses with fewer than fifty employees are undoubtedly important to overall economic strength. So too are the relatively few large companies that employ millions of Americans.\u000a\u000aYet, the startup news is not all good. The rate at which new businesses are opening has been steadily declining until 2014. Because of their out-sized contributions, this decline has troubling implications for economic dynamism and growth if it is not reversed.\u000a\u000aYoung Firms Drive Job Growth and Economic Dynamism\u000a\u000aNew businesses account for nearly all net new job creation and almost 20 percent of gross job creation, whereas small businesses do not have a significant impact on job growth when age is accounted for.\u000a\u000aCompanies less than one year old have created an average of 1.5 million jobs per year over the past three decades.\u000a\u000aMany young firms exhibit an \u201cup or out\u201d dynamic, in which innovative and successful firms grow rapidly and become a wellspring of job and economic growth, or quickly fail and exit the market, allowing capital to be put to more productive uses.\u000a\u000aYoung firms were hit hard during the Great Recession. Even still, from 2006 to 2009, young and small firms (fewer than five years old and twenty employees) remained a positive source of net employment growth (8.6 percent), whereas older and larger firms shed more jobs than they created.\u000a\u000aDeclining Startup Rates Threaten Growth\u000a\u000aNew businesses represent a declining share of the business community. According to Census data, new firms represented as much as 16 percent of all firms in the late 1970s. By 2011, that share had declined to 8 percent.\u000a\u000aNot only are there fewer new firms, but those startups that do exist are creating fewer jobs. The gross number of jobs created by new firms fell by more than two million between 2005 and 2010.\u000a\u000aStartup activity has been subdued across the country. Firm entry rates were lower between 2009 and 2011 than they were between 1978 and 1980 in every state and Metropolitan Statistical Area except one.\u000a\u000aPave the Way for an Entrepreneurial Renaissance\u000a\u000aPolicies at the federal, state, and local levels influence an individual\u2019s ability to start a business and impact firm growth and survival. Policymakers at all levels can help create an environment more conducive to business formation.\u000a\u000aFEDERAL\u000a\u000aWelcome Immigrants\u000a\u000aImmigrants were nearly twice as likely as native-born Americans to start businesses in 2014. The creation of a visa for immigrant entrepreneurs would allow these job creators to start companies in the United States.\u000a\u000aRemove Regulatory Barriers to Growth\u000a\u000aAs regulations build up over time, they represent an increasing and disproportionate cost to entrepreneurial firms. Ideas to counter regulatory accumulation include the establishment of a commission to review and recommend regulatory changes to Congress and implementing sunset dates on major regulations.\u000a\u000aSTATE\u000a\u000aSimplify Tax Codes and Payment Systems\u000a\u000aTaxes matter, but what entrepreneurs are most concerned about is tax complexity. Simplifying tax codes and payment systems so they are easier to understand will relieve what many entrepreneurs feel is a burden on them and their businesses.\u000a\u000aEncourage Competition and Labor Mobility\u000a\u000aOccupational licensing and non-compete agreements can depress entrepreneurship by artificially inflating the cost to enter a new market and restricting the free movement of individuals. Reconsider licensing requirements and adjust non-competes to spur entrepreneurial growth.\u000a\u000aLOCAL\u000a\u000aCultivate Human Capital\u000a\u000aHigher levels of education are associated with increased entrepreneurial activity. An analysis of 356 U.S. metropolitan areas found that high school and college completion is important to startup rates.\u000a\u000aFOR MORE INFORMATION\u000a\u000aClick on the links for access to the following resources, or contact Jason Wiens at jwiens@kauffman.org:

aVNorth Korea's latest nuclear weapons test was by far its most powerful, potentially producing an explosive yield nearly 10 times stronger than that of the country's most advanced warhead.\u000a\u000aDefying U.N. sanctions and fiery threats from President Donald Trump, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his country's sixth nuclear weapons test Sunday after a nearly year-long hiatus spent focused on making strides in the country's ballistic missile capabilities. North Korea announced shortly afterward it had developed and tested its first hydrogen bomb, a vastly more destructive weapon than the warheads experts have previously observed in Kim's arsenal. While different sources have reported different results, some believe it may have been more powerful than all previous tests combined.\u000a\u000aRelated: What war with North Korea looked like in the 1950s and why it matters now\u000a\u000aKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\u000a\u000aU.S. intelligence observed the detonation of an "advanced nuclear device" equivalent to 140 kilotons of TNT, according to The Diplomat. On the other hand, Norwegian Seismic Array reportedly projected an explosion of about 120 kilotons, Japan reported 70 kilotons and South Korea said it was 50 kilotons. Others have put the number as high as 500 kilotons.\u000a\u000aLee Sang-Hak/Yonhap/via REUTERS\u000a\u000aNorth Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006, likely producing less than one kiloton\u2014but also sparking an outcry from leading U.N. powers. A second test in 2000 produced about 9 kilotons, according to Reuters. Since Kim Jong Un became North Korea's third-generation leader after his father's death in 2011, he rapidly developed both his country's nuclear and ballistic weapons stockpiles. The next two tests, in February 2013 and January 2016, produced roughly about a dozen kilotons.\u000a\u000aBy the fifth test, in September 2016, the explosive yield increased to about 20 kilotons, and North Korea was producing nuclear warheads with the destructive equivalence of the "Little Boy" bomb used by the U.S. on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The roughly 15-kiloton nuclear warhead, along with the country's first intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), would be enough to take out many major U.S. cities, as well as other population centers around the world. North Korea's latest bomb would be even deadlier.\u000a\u000aFollowing North Korea's first two ICBM tests in July, Newsweek used nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein's NukeMap last month to calculate the casualties of a potential North Korean nuclear strike on major cities in the U.S. The tool found that a 15-kiloton nuclear warhead would kill an estimated 174,640 people and injure 291,630 more if it struck Newsweek's office in lower Manhattan. Now, these numbres are raised to 477,470 deaths nearly a million and a half injuries if the latest warhead produces a yield of 150 kilotons, as Wellerstein estimates.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea monitoring group 38 North, a project of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, published Tuesday an analysis of the test by leading intelligence analysts Joseph S. Bermudez, Jr. and Jack Liu. The pair estimates the yield of Sunday's nuclear weapons test to be about 120 kilotons, making it about eight times stronger than the "Little Bomb" that killed at least 75,000 people in Hiroshima, and about six times stronger than North Korea's previous nuclear test.\u000a\u000aPlanet Labs, Inc/38 North\u000a\u000aPlanet Labs, Inc/38 North\u000a\u000aLike his father, Kim has argued that North Korea has the right to possess nuclear weapons in order to defend the country from U.S. invasion. He points to previous Washington-led efforts to overthrow Iraqi leader President Saddam Hussein, who was found not to possess weapons of mass destruction, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who had voluntarily surrendered his own nuclear program in a bid to imrpove relations with the West.\u000a\u000aMany countries, including China, have expressed concern regarding North Korea's nuclear arsenal, as well the U.S.'s growing military presence in the region.

aVMy parents brought me to the United States when I was 3 years old. I\u2019ve gone to school here, worked here, paid taxes. I\u2019m as American as you are.\u000a\u000aOn Sunday, I learned that the president wants to send me back to Mexico. Or, at least, he isn\u2019t willing to defend my right to stay here. Either way, my life is about to be radically upended.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMy parents didn\u2019t teach me Spanish. I grew up in a small town in Alabama, speak with a Southern accent, and didn\u2019t even know I was undocumented until I was 16 years old. I grew up reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and have always considered this country my home.\u000a\u000aNow President Donald Trump plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and I could be deported to Mexico, a country that is completely foreign to me. I\u2019d have nowhere to live, no family to stay with and no way to find work. I would live in a different country than my American wife, who without financial support would have to sell our new house.\u000a\u000aMy story isn\u2019t an unusual one. Like countless others, when I was an infant my family fled from poverty and cartel violence. After they crossed the border, they settled in a small town in northwestern Alabama. My parents made sure I learned English, and as a child when people asked me where I was from, I told them Alabama without hesitation. To me, that was the truth.\u000a\u000aI first heard the word \u201cundocumented\u201d when I was 16. I enrolled in driving classes at my school, but I was told I couldn\u2019t get a driver's license because I didn\u2019t have the right documents. Until that point, I had no idea I was considered an \u201cundocumented\u201d person in America. It crushed me to find out. For years, I was angry at my father for not coming into the country the \u201cright way.\u201d Looking back, I suppose my parents were afraid to tell me the truth, or didn\u2019t want me to be afraid.\u000a\u000aOnce I realized what being undocumented meant for my life, things got hard. My family couldn\u2019t afford to send me to college, and since I wasn\u2019t an American citizen I couldn\u2019t qualify for college scholarships or financial aid. I was tempted to quit school because there didn\u2019t seem like much of a point. After graduation, my classmates talked about their future, and when they asked me what my plans were I would say nothing because I was too embarrassed to tell them I was undocumented.\u000a\u000aBecause it is difficult to find work without papers, friends and family encouraged me to get a fake ID and take a job in an immigrant-heavy industry like construction. They told me it was the only option. But I felt that relying on a fake ID was wrong, and I was determined to obtain an education and job legally.\u000a\u000aLuckily, a white couple from a few doors down began helping me. They introduced me to their church, which I started attending. I worked odd jobs during the day, and at night researched colleges that accept undocumented immigrants. When I expressed my interest in attending a Bible college, members of the church helped me pay the tuition. I started attending the college that fall.\u000a\u000aCesar as a child in Alabama. | Courtesy of Cesar Virto\u000a\u000aWhen President Barack Obama implemented the DACA policy a few years later, everything became easier. I immediately applied for a driver\u2019s license, Social Security number and work permit. I remember taking my first road trip with my valid driver\u2019s license. I went to the beach to visit a friend, and for six hours I cried like a baby because for the first time in my life I wasn\u2019t scared of getting pulled over by the police. Each mile I drove felt like a pound no longer weighing me down.\u000a\u000aA few months later, I graduated from an accredited institution, the first in my family to do so. I found a job with a Christian book company in Nashville, Tennessee, with full benefits. Like many others, I was the first DACA employee my company had hired. A year later, I got married and bought my first home. Because of DACA, I finally felt like I was achieving the American dream.\u000a\u000aMy wife and I consulted with lawyers on how I could achieve legal residency, but they all said I would have to first leave the country, and that it isn\u2019t guaranteed the government would let me back in. That\u2019s a risk I can\u2019t take. If I can\u2019t return to my job in Tennessee, we will probably lose our house. My wife would have to drop out of college because I pay the tuition.\u000a\u000aCesar on graduation day. | Courtesy of Cesar Virto\u000a\u000aWhen Trump announced the end of DACA, my old fears returned. I thought I would never feel that kind of anxiety and dread again, but I was wrong.\u000a\u000aOnce DACA ends, I will no longer have the work permit I need for my job. I am also an Uber and Lyft driver, but without a valid driver's license, that source of income will disappear, too. If we lost our house, we have no family in Nashville to stay with. I\u2019ve been working toward my master's degree, but that would have to be put on hold, too.\u000a\u000aEven scarier is the prospect of deportation.\u000a\u000aI haven\u2019t been to Mexico since I left as a 3-year-old, more than 25 years ago. I have no memory of the place, and I\u2019m culturally American\u2014I would feel more like an outsider there than I do here. I have no clue how I would make a living, or where I would go. I had the opportunity to take some Spanish classes in college, but I speak it with an Alabama accent and can\u2019t read or write the language well. I feel trapped\u2014Hispanics make fun of my pronunciation and tell me I act like an American, and Americans say I do not look like them and need to go back to where I came from. I do not know how to act any other way. I am me. It hurts to be told I do not belong wherever I go.\u000a\u000aBut what hurts me the most\u2014more than the alienation, more than the fear\u2014is the sense of betrayal. It pains me that many of the same Christians who supported me as a youth, who helped pay my college tuition, can turn around and chant, \u201cBuild the wall.\u201d People I love post things on Facebook that break my heart. If I were any less grounded in my faith, I honestly would have left the religion.\u000a\u000aBut I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t leave, and as a Christian, I am trying to understand the points of view of those Christians who would like to see me deported. Many of them, I know, are struggling in their own lives. I pray that our shared faith will give them compassion for immigrants like me, and I wish that we can love one another as much as I love this country.\u000a\u000aI'm also praying for a solution. I hope that Congress will put in place a path for me to keep the life I\u2019ve worked hard for, but my wife and I are preparing for the worst. My priority is providing for her, but there are no guarantees.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, I take refuge in my faith. \u201cBut our citizenship is in heaven,\u201d says Philippians 3:20. \u201cAnd we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\u000a\u000aCesar Virto is a customer services international representative at LifeWay Christian Resources in Nashville, Tennessee.

aVPARIS \u2014 Forget Emmanuel Macron, the \u201cJupiter-like\u201d president who spoke only in grand symbolic gestures.\u000a\u000aFrance\u2019s new leader is morphing into the explainer-in-chief.\u000a\u000aWith approval scores crashing, his predecessor, François Hollande, feeling bold enough to criticize him in public, and hard-left opponents scrapping for a fight, the 39-year-old president is being forced to reorient his communications strategy by 180 degrees.\u000a\u000aExit the quasi-North Korean grip on presidential messaging; the James Bond-like PR stunts; the hunt for leakers in ministerial offices; the ironclad rule against \u201coff-the-record\u201d talks; the ultra-rare presidential address.\u000a\u000aThe new Macron is ready to talk and to explain what he\u2019s trying to do \u2014 at least twice a month and preferably on the radio, according to accounts of the president\u2019s first off-the-record chat with journalists.\u000a\u000aHe is also pushing his ministers, MPs in his centrist La République en Marche movement and several newly hired comms staffers to back him up as often, and as loudly, as possible, on TV and radio.\u000a\u000aSince he took office, relations between the press and the new president have been strained, if not overtly hostile.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president is not adapting to polls,\u201d said a presidential adviser. \u201cHe\u2019s adapting to a reform agenda that he\u2019s set for France, and that requires explanation before the French people to clarify its benefits and counteract the anxiety-inducing rhetoric of some critics.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhat for? To correct the course of a presidency that is veering off the rails amid missteps, overconfidence and rising opposition to his reform agenda.\u000a\u000aHollande\u2019s revenge\u000a\u000aIn practice, the shift means granting the public much more access to the president, via direct social media exchanges or more unscripted talks with journalists.\u000a\u000aLast week, for the first time since he took office, Macron had a long off-the-record \u2014 but comprehensively reported \u2014 chat with journalists from three publications (Le Monde, L\u2019Obs and regional Ouest-France) handpicked to join him on his Falcon aircraft from Salzburg to Bucharest.\u000a\u000aThe move raised eyebrows because Macron had frequently blasted his ex-boss and mentor, François Hollande, for similar chumminess with the fourth estate.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the problem of recent presidencies has been too much closeness with journalists,\u201d the then candidate Macron said in April. \u201cAnd I think that, especially when you\u2019re the president, you don\u2019t pal around with reporters.\u201d\u000a\u000aHollande, an obsessive off-the-record talker, waited until Macron\u2019s popularity score was in Donald Trump territory to get his revenge. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to ask the French for more sacrifices than is necessary,\u201d he told journalists in southwestern France.\u000a\u000aMore remarkable still was what Macron had to say to the journalists on his plane \u2014 he would now address the public twice each month, probably on the radio.\u000a\u000aThat struck a balance between familiarity and remoteness, and had pleasing historical echoes with Charles de Gaulle\u2019s wartime addresses from London to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s fireside chats, Macron reportedly said.\u000a\u000aAnd the president will be giving more print interviews too. Stepping out from his relationship with the weekly JDD paper, he has given one to right-leaning magazine Le Point that is due out on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the president test-drove his new freewheeling communications plan during his tour of Central Europe, veering off-message during a joint press conference with his Austrian counterpart in Salzburg to defend domestic reforms.\u000a\u000aOne thing that\u2019s unlikely to change though is Macron\u2019s attitude toward set-piece press conferences at the Elysée presidential palace \u2014 a longstanding ritual he has shunned. He still finds them too unmanageable to be of any benefit, he is cited as having said.\u000a\u000aWar on leakers\u000a\u000aSince he took office, relations between the press and the new president have been strained, if not overtly hostile.\u000a\u000aWeeks after he entered office, his team cherry-picked journalists for his first trip abroad, prompting multiple media groups to denounce the practice in an open letter.\u000a\u000aWhen Richard Ferrand, a close ally to the president, was investigated on charges of nepotism, the government spokesman, Christophe Castaner, castigated journalists for trying to \u201cbehave like judges\u201d when they pressed him about ethics in public office \u2014 a key theme of Macron\u2019s campaign.\u000a\u000aThe question now is whether Macron\u2019s new presidential style will be more open, or just have the appearance of being so.\u000a\u000a(Ferrand is now head of the République En Marche group, but missed out on a more important ministerial role.)\u000a\u000aAnd staff in ministerial cabinets heard in no uncertain terms that the response to leaks would be legal action.\u000a\u000aTo dissuade potential leakers, the labor ministry in June filed a legal complaint \u2014 later withdrawn \u2014 against the person who leaked a working paper on its labor reform to center-left daily newspaper Libération.\u000a\u000aBeyond specific conflicts, journalists griped about a communications strategy that was overtly top-down, relentlessly agenda-driven and closed off to back-and-forth exchanges.\u000a\u000aThe president\u2019s office held frequent, exhaustive briefings but flatly refused to address questions on topics that were not on the agenda \u2014 there was no such thing as off-message.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, PR gatekeepers choked off access to advisers, or made the penalty for leaking information to the press so clear to them that the effect was essentially the same.\u000a\u000aThe question now is whether Macron\u2019s new presidential style will be more open, or just have the appearance of being so.

aVUnder President Barack Obama, the federal government has made fighting discrimination a top priority, from signing the Lilly Ledbetter Act just a few days after he entered office to recent efforts to reduce the pay gap through unilateral actions. These moves, while well-intentioned, can also have unintended consequences and even set back the quest to eliminate pay discrimination.\u000a\u000aThe clearest example of this came in September, when the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission finalized changes to a form \u2014 called the EEO-1 Form \u2014 that collects demographic data on workers. For the first time, the EEOC required U.S. employers to report data on wages and hours worked by gender, race and ethnicity, an attempt to address a very real issue \u2014 that some people are paid less because of their sex, race or ethnicity.\u000a\u000aCollecting this data may seem like a logical step in order to eliminate pay discrimination. But the change to the EEO-1 form imposes a very broad requirement on employers \u2014 so broad that even after employers spend countless additional hours filling it out, the resulting data will be inaccurate and lead to misguided policy decisions. To prevent this from happening and as a much-needed step toward reducing the regulatory burden on U.S. businesses, President-elect Donald Trump and the GOP Congress should make undoing the rule a priority next year.\u000a\u000aTo start, let\u2019s assume that pay discrimination based on sex, race or ethnicity is a major problem. (Even that is questionable: The government\u2019s own statistics estimate that only about 35 percent of the gender gap may be caused by some form of discrimination.) Is the EEOC\u2019s new rule unreasonable?\u000a\u000aOn the surface, the government asking for one more set of data seems tolerable. But the details of the requirement demonstrate how challenging this is for employers. Under the new rule, the EEOC requires employers to report the exact hours worked by all their employees, broken down by gender, race, ethnicity, income level (in one of 12 pay bands) and job category (in one of 10 defined categories). Altogether, each employer must fill in more than 1,800 new boxes on a form so that the government can analyze whether certain workers are paid less than other workers, despite working in similar jobs with similar hours.\u000a\u000aThis is a huge new burden on businesses. Already, according to EEOC estimates, about 67,000 businesses with 100 or more workers spend 1.1 million hours a year to fill out an EEOC form reporting data about employees\u2019 ethnicity, race and sex by job category. The new requirement, by adding in employees\u2019 hours worked and corresponding pay data, nearly doubles the estimated annual labor cost associated with reporting data to the EEOC \u2014 on top of one-time implementation costs totaling $27.2 million.\u000a\u000aWorse than the increased costs on business, the new EEOC data will not identify employers who discriminate against their employees. Why? Because the EEOC job categories are so broad that they make direct comparisons meaningless. Oral surgeons will be counted in the same job category as credit counselors, and firefighters in the same job category as blackjack dealers, even though each person\u2019s pay is dramatically affected by the various educational requirements, required experience levels and hazardous conditions of each job. The pay for a marketing professional straight out of college will be directly compared with that of a nonsupervisory marketing professional with 25 years of experience.\u000a\u000aThe EEOC says it will use the data \u201cto compute within-job-category variation, across-job-category variation, and overall variation, thus supporting the agencies\u2019 ability to discern potential discrimination.\u201d But without controlling for pay variations tied to these other important differences in worker qualities and market needs, the data\u2019s validity for assessing discrimination is questionable at best. At worst, it will create a false impression of the true state of pay discrimination in the U.S.\u000a\u000aThe requirement that employers record the number of hours their employees work is also likely to result in inaccurate data because many companies simply don\u2019t have that information. A 2016 survey from the American Payroll Association found that 36 percent of respondents work for a company that doesn\u2019t require them to record the number of hours they work. After businesses complained that they don\u2019t track hours for employees exempt from overtime laws, thus making pay comparisons difficult, the EEOC gave firms two options: Either use a 40-hour workweek as a proxy for the time estimate or provide data to support a different number. These employers are now stuck either implementing major new time-tracking systems in order to accurately provide the data on each individual worker\u2019s hours or knowingly reporting a number (40) that may be inaccurate. Some employers may choose to implement tracking and others may not, which means the entire database could be contaminated by faulty data.\u000a\u000aEmployers are also required to report pay as defined by W-2 earnings, even though W-2 earnings are affected by choices workers make on voluntary overtime, for example, or on contributing to a 401(k) account. In other words, one worker voluntarily contributing the maximum amount to a 401(k) may appear to make less than a worker contributing nothing, even if their salaries are exactly the same.\u000a\u000aIn trying to prevent an employer from paying workers less based on their sex, race or ethnicity \u2014 characteristics fairly easy to objectively categorize \u2014 these new requirements are reducing the employer\u2019s ability to pay based on more subjective metrics about worker qualities that are critical to job performance, such as experience, skills, talent and effort.\u000a\u000aTrump and Republican lawmakers may be able to prevent this new rule from taking effect by using the Congressional Review Act, which allows majorities in both houses of Congress to use an expedited procedure to undo recent regulations. It\u2019s a process Republicans are already promising to use to repeal a number of Obama-era rules.\u000a\u000aAs it stands today, the economic threat from the EEOC rule is real. The whole reporting system continues to push us closer to a Soviet-style system where workers are assigned to rigid job categories with pay that is equal to all others in each category. Federal government workers and military personnel are already classified like this, so of course such a system makes sense to EEOC personnel. What they don\u2019t realize is that especially in smaller companies, people play fluid roles, and one person often has multiple job functions that don\u2019t fit neatly into a government box based on 10 very broad categories. Someone managing the sales operation might also be helping out with IT; or someone answering the phones might also be heading up recruiting and hiring efforts. This makes comparing the duties and pay of these unique workers to others impossible.\u000a\u000aI have to wonder what comes next after the EEOC collects these data sets. The inaccurate conclusions that will be drawn from this data could result in a slow push to pay everyone within a job category the same, effectively chipping away at the meritocratic foundations that make U.S. businesses \u2014 and the American economy \u2014 the best in the world.\u000a\u000aBrian Hamilton, a highly regarded entrepreneur, is chairman and co-founder of Sageworks, a financial information company.

aVRepresentatives from Facebook say that privacy concerns prevent them from sharing raw data with outsiders | Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images Facebook undermines its own effort to fight fake news A once-touted plan to fact-check stories is being hindered by the company\u2019s refusal to share information.\u000a\u000aThe fact-checkers enlisted by Facebook to help clear the site of \u201cfake news\u201d say the social media giant\u2019s refusal to share information is hurting their efforts.\u000a\u000aIn December, Facebook promised to address the spread of misinformation on its platform, in part by working with outside fact-checking groups. But because the company has declined to share any internal data from the project, the fact-checkers say they have no way of determining whether the \u201cdisputed\u201d tags they\u2019re affixing to \u201cfake news\u201d articles slow \u2014 or perhaps even accelerate \u2014 the stories\u2019 spread. They also say they\u2019re lacking information that would allow them to prioritize the most important stories out of the hundreds possible to fact-check at any given moment.\u000a\u000aSome fact-checkers are growing frustrated, saying the lack of information is undermining Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news reports.\u000a\u000a\u201cI would say that the general lack of information \u2014 not only data \u2014 given by Facebook is a concern for a majority of publishers,\u201d Adrien Sénécat, a journalist at Le Monde, one of the news organizations that has partnered with Facebook to fact-check stories, said in an emailed response.\u000a\u000aRepresentatives from Facebook say that privacy concerns prevent them from sharing raw data with outsiders.\u000a\u000aIn the wake of November\u2019s election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed the amount of fake news on his platform and called it \u201ca pretty crazy idea\u201d that it could have influenced the election. But a month later, under pressure, the company announced a slew of efforts designed to combat the problem, including the arrangement with fact-checkers. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to doing our part,\u201d Facebook\u2019s vice president for Newsfeed, Adam Mosseri, wrote. \u201cWe believe in giving people a voice and that we cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves, so we\u2019re approaching this problem carefully.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is going to sound super corny, but fact-checkers don\u2019t really take anything at face value\u201d \u2014 Alexios Mantzarlis, director of Poynter\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network\u000a\u000aMosseri has publicly characterized those efforts as effective. In April, he said in an address, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen overall that false news has decreased on Facebook,\u201d but the company did not provide proof of the claim. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to measure,\u201d Mosseri had added, \u201cbecause we can\u2019t read everything that gets posted.\u201d\u000a\u000aSara Su, a product manager on Facebook\u2019s newsfeed team, told POLITICO that she believes the fact-check program is working: \u201cWe have seen data that, when a story is flagged by a third party fact-checker, it reduces the likelihood that somebody will share that story.\u201d She declined, though, to provide any specific numbers.\u000a\u000aFacebook does plan on eventually sharing more information with the fact-checking groups it works with, according to Su, though exactly how much and when is undetermined. \u201cI wish I could give you dates, but we are committed to working with our fact-checking partners to continue to refine the tools to be more efficient,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aFor now, many fact-checkers are taking Facebook\u2019s claims of success with the proverbial grain of salt.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is going to sound super corny, but fact-checkers don\u2019t really take anything at face value,\u201d said Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of Poynter\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network. \u201cYou need to support with evidence.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn the United States, Facebook signed up Politifact, FactCheck.org, Snopes.com, the AP and ABC News to patrol news on the platform. Since March, users have been able to report stories that seem untrue and send them to a queue for the checkers. Facebook\u2019s algorithms also search for stories that seem bogus, adding them to the queue. If two of the fact-checking groups label a story false, then Facebook slaps a \u201cdisputed\u201d tag on it.\u000a\u000aThe issue, Mantzarlis said, is that fact-checkers don\u2019t know how stories are affected by being flagged \u2014 whether reactions to them change, if sharing goes up or down, or, more broadly, if fact-checks are capable of changing the mind of someone inclined to believe a false story in the first place. There is also the question, Mantzarlis added, of whether a disputed tag from the fact-checking groups \u2014 all mainstream media \u2014 could be a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d for a certain strain of story.\u000a\u000aThough it occupies a central role in the public discourse, as a private company, Facebook is under no obligation to disclose internal data. Su said that doing so could get too close to revealing information about users. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to strike the balance. We all have the same objective, to prevent false news from reaching people on our platform,\u201d said Su. \u201cWe want to be as transparent as we can be while also respecting the privacy of people on our platform.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that Facebook acknowledged to congressional investigators that it had sold ads during the 2016 campaign to a Russian company trying to influence voters. The acknowledgment came as part of the probe into Russian efforts to influence the election, and underscored the role of Facebook as a political messaging tool.\u000a\u000aEugene Kiely, the director of FactCheck.org, and Aaron Sharockman, the executive director of Politifact (which is owned by Poynter), both report largely positive working relationships with Facebook. Both say, though, that having more access to data would be helpful.\u000a\u000aSome uneasiness appears to have crept into the larger relationship between Facebook and the fact-checking community. Sharockman described the mood as \u201ctense\u201d in July when representatives from Facebook and Google addressed a crowd of about 150 at the fourth Global Fact conference in Madrid.\u000a\u000aThe crowd wasn\u2019t hostile, Sharockman said, but a theme emerged in questions from both the audience and Mantzarlis, who organized the conference and hosted the panel: Would Facebook and Google agree to share data with them?\u000a\u000aMantzarlis asked Áine Kerr, Facebook\u2019s manager of journalism partnerships: \u201cWhen will Facebook share what happens to the reach and engagement of stories that got flagged by fact-checkers?\u201d And he asked Google\u2019s Philippe Colombet, one of the company\u2019s top news partnership officials: \u201cWhen will Google share data on how users react to finding fact-checks in their search?\u201d\u000a\u000aDuring the crowd Q&A, others, including Sénécat, the Le Monde journalist, followed up with similar questions. In both cases, Kerr and Colombet acknowledged the fact-checkers\u2019 concerns and said that they would relay them to their companies, but that they weren\u2019t in positions to make any changes.\u000a\u000aSénécat does not believe the meeting in Madrid was tense, per se, but he said in an email that it \u201csure was kind of frustrating\u201d because the Facebook and Google officials were \u201cavoiding tough questions.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI think more than \u2018tension,\u2019 there was some kind of disappointment,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMantzarlis described the discussion as \u201cfrank.\u201d\u000a\u000aOne important way data from Facebook could help his team, Sharockman said, is with prioritizing which stories to fact-check. Currently, Facebook tells the fact-checking groups which stories in their queue are most popular on the platform, but doesn\u2019t give any information beyond a ranking.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s 1,200, 1,500 stories that we could look at today, and we\u2019re going to look at two,\u201d Sharockman said. \u201cOur process is pretty time intensive.\u201d A single fact-check can take five hours to complete, he said. That means that choosing the right stories to examine is crucial.\u000a\u000aMantzarlis said he would want to see data on how the length of time it takes to flag a false story affects its spread. It\u2019s not hard to imagine other questions: Do certain types of stories require more immediate attention than others? Are there other types that may not be viral yet, but data has shown likely will be soon? When an article is flagged, how often do copy-cat versions with altered headlines pop up to replace it? Even knowing what types of headlines work best for fact-checking posts would be valuable, Mantzarlis said.\u000a\u000aSénécat added that it would be helpful to have access to a list of posts that have been reviewed by other third party fact-checkers\u2014something he said is currently not available.\u000a\u000a\u201cFacebook was a key vector of misinformation during the 2016 campaign so the effectiveness of their response is of great public concern\u201d \u2014 Brendan Nyhan, Dartmouth College political science professor\u000a\u000aSu noted that Facebook recently started listing fact-checks in the \u201crelated articles\u201d stack beside stories on similar subjects that may be false. She added that the fact-checkers are just one of many ways that Facebook is attempting to curb false news. For instance, every fact-check that is completed, she said, is entered into Facebook\u2019s machine learning model to help its software identify similar stories in the future.\u000a\u000aFacebook said it has also tried to reduce the financial incentives for producers of false news.\u000a\u000aBrendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth College political science professor who has studied fact-checking extensively, said he understands the private companies\u2019 desire to keep raw data in house, but that he would like to see shared more \u201cresults of the experiments they have presumably done evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches to countering misinformation.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is an important issue,\u201d Nyhan said, \u201cFacebook was a key vector of misinformation during the 2016 campaign so the effectiveness of their response is of great public concern.\u201d\u000a\u000aSharockman and Kiely both acknowledge that they are relatively early in their program with Facebook. And Mantzarlis is optimistic that, eventually, the company will open up.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll get there before the end of the year,\u201d Mantzarlis said. \u201cI think this is important to people within Facebook, so I think they will share information.\u201d

aVFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images As Spicer looks for work, his celebrity rating isn\u2019t helping A talent agency provided POLITICO with the data used by TV executives to assess audience appeal. The former Trump spokesman bombed.\u000a\u000aWASHINGTON \u2014 After a beleaguered six-month run as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer has been shopping his brand for television, book and speaking deals in recent weeks. The latest findings of a celebrity-popularity poll, however, may show why he is a tough sell.\u000a\u000aSixty-four percent of respondents in the survey from E-Score, a polling company used by major talent agencies and TV executives to assess celebrities, had a negative opinion about Spicer, compared with 36 percent who liked him. Spicer\u2019s overall score \u2014 based on awareness, appeal and attributes \u2014 was 13. In contrast, Oprah Winfrey clocked in at an overall 96 while Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News journalist who now hosts the NBC newsmagazine \u201cSunday Night With Megyn Kelly,\u201d rated a 52.\u000a\u000aThe gap in those numbers isn\u2019t totally surprising. During his time in the Trump administration, Spicer had a testy relationship with the news media that played out from the podium before the American public. Also, political figures typically score lower in celebrity market research, and the survey was conducted in April, two months before Spicer resigned his White House post.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a very high negative score,\u201d Randy Parker, E-Score\u2019s director of marketing, said of Spicer\u2019s appeal.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn fairness,\u201d Parker added, \u201cthe picture changes quite a bit when we limit responses to Republicans.\u201d\u000a\u000aA talent agency provided POLITICO with the numbers on Spicer, and E-Score gave comparison numbers for other politicians.\u000a\u000aHis numbers aren\u2019t the lowest in the poll\u2019s ranking of the political class. Jared Kushner, senior adviser and son-in-law of President Donald Trump, scored an overall 5, mainly due to respondents\u2019 lack of awareness of him. Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman awaiting sentencing for sending obscene material to a minor, scored a 2. And even prominent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has served South Carolina since 2003, came in at only 6.\u000a\u000aAfter signing with power agent Robert Barnett, Spicer has yet to land a television contract with a major news network despite his interest, according to two people familiar with the matter. He started having meetings with the networks in July, just days after he resigned following Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s appointment as White House communications director.\u000a\u000aFox News, which has expressed some interest, has yet to offer him a contract, according to two sources at the network. (Fox currently employs Dana Perino, President George W. Bush\u2019s former press secretary.) CNN has said that it will not add him as a contributor because of credibility issues related to statements he made from the White House Briefing Room.\u000a\u000aOne agent from a prominent Hollywood talent agency said it passed over representing Spicer because of E-Score\u2019s findings on his lack of appeal.\u000a\u000aWhile television may not be interested, Spicer has signed with Worldwide Speakers Group for a number of arrangements.\u000a\u000aA source close to Spicer said that he had two \u201ctraditional\u201d and three \u201cnontraditional\u201d TV deals in the works, as well as \u201cseveral exciting and lucrative consultancies \u2014 foreign and domestic\u201d \u2014 and \u201cmultiple interested publishers.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cSean is doing just fine,\u201d the source said.\u000a\u000aSpicer himself said in an email Wednesday night: \u201cI have been thrilled with all of the opportunities that have come my way in several areas since leaving the White House. I could not be happier.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe does have a relatively high 29 percent awareness rating, likely because of his must-watch briefings that aired on every cable news network, as well as Melissa McCarthy\u2019s caricature of him on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a rage-a-holic.\u000a\u000aParker compared Spicer\u2019s attributes with the other politicians in E-Score\u2019s database. He noted that Spicer\u2019s aggressiveness score of 28 percent was high compared with other political figures, who averaged 13 percent. His insincerity rating was high, 29 percent, compared with 19 percent for other politicians. Twenty-one percent of respondents called him mean. He scored 19 percent for \u201ccold,\u201d 9 points higher than other politicians.\u000a\u000a\u201cHis attribute scores are interesting: Thirty-three percent of the people surveyed say he\u2019s rude as compared to the average politicians, who are at 11 percent,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd keep in mind, there are a lot of rude politicians.\u201d\u000a\u000aSpicer also had a high \u201ccreepy\u201d score of 27 percent, compared with 15 percent for the average politician. Only 6 percent of respondents described Spicer as trustworthy, and 11 percent called him emotional.\u000a\u000aThe poll, which was conducted April 28, was sent to 1,100 respondents who represent the American television audience. His overall 13 rating from E-score is a percentile ranking in comparison with the other 10,000 celebrities in the database.

aVRight-wing radio personality Alex Jones said Friday that the so-called Deep State is planning to assassinate President Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aHe and others on the far right have been accusing career government employees in the Deep State, particularily those who work in national security, of conspiring against Trump and his agenda. Far-right internet personality Mike Cernovich joined Jones Friday in predicting a coup against Trump in the next couple of months.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re saying, 'A month or two we\u2019re going to kill the president, month or two we\u2019re going to remove him,'\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is so sinister.\u201d\u000a\u000aKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\u000a\u000aJones has a substantial following, with 4.8 million unique visits to his Infowars.com between June 5 and July 4, according to Quantcast. On Friday, he followed up with a call to arms, saying the Deep State is planning to kill Trump supporters as well as the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf they ban us from YouTube, that\u2019s when Trump will be killed, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Cernovich said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us, they\u2019re going to kill him, they\u2019re going to kill everybody.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn recent months, the Infowars host and other conspiratorial right-wingers have been predicting a second civil war between conservatives and liberals. Jones and Cernovich alleged they were being censored by YouTube and Google and talked about planning protests against tech giants, including one at Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg's house.\u000a\u000a\u201cFolks, they are going to blow the president\u2019s head off, they are going to bomb him,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey are getting ready.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump appeared on Jones\u2019s show during the campaign, and longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone is a frequent guest on the program. \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down,\u201d Trump told Jones.\u000a\u000aCernovich and Jones both promoted the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory, a false allegation that Hillary Clinton was involved in a child-sex-abuse ring. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. has praised Cernovich, saying a he should win a Pulitizer for accusing Susan Rice of "unmasking" Trump associates. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster reportedly determined that Rice did nothing improper in regard to the allegation.\u000a\u000aMore recently, the far right has focused on McMaster, alleging he is a leader of the Deep State that is trying to undermine Trump (though without any solid evidence).\u000a\u000a\u201cNo one voted for H.L McMaster- he is a neocon quisling, helping [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller line up @realDonaldTrump for the take-down,\u201d Stone tweeted Friday.\u000a\u000aJones is a noted conspiracy theorist, having questioned almost every major shooting and bombing over the past decade, including the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. He also is a proponent of 9/11 conspiracy theories.\u000a\u000aThe discussion of a new civil war started after the election, Nate Evans, a spokesman for the liberal media watch group Media Matters for America, told Newsweek in July. Evans said the right-wing media has increasingly been advocating violence since Trump was elected, and that Jones \u201chas been particularly crazy about it.\u201d

aVJewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\u000a\u000aHere are two things that have happened in recent days involving Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\u000a\u000a1. A Twitter personality and former Hillary Clinton adviser named Peter Daou launched a website called "Verrit," which bills itself as "Media for the 65.8 Million," which is the number of people who voted for Clinton in 2016. According to its founder, Veritt exists to verify cold, hard facts in our era of fake news and Breitbart-ian propaganda. Over the weekend, Clinton publicly endorsed the site:\u000a\u000aI'm excited to sign up for @Verrit, a media platform for the 65.8 million! Will you join me and sign up too? https://t.co/bOLSMyk6bG \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 3, 2017\u000a\u000aAdvertisement\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHere's the kind of "fact" Verrit verifies, though:\u000a\u000aBernie Sanders and the Mainstream Media Helped Put Trump in the White House https://t.co/Pixzgi3E1g \u2014 Verrit (@verrit) August 23, 2017\u000a\u000aHmm.\u000a\u000a2. A few excerpts of Clinton's upcoming book What Happened (which comes out next Tuesday) have leaked. In one of them, she says that Sanders "resort[ed] to innuendo and impugning my character" in the 2016 primary, doing "lasting damage" to her public image (by "paving the way" for the "Crooked Hillary" attack, for instance) that contributed to her loss in the general election.\u000a\u000aThis is the grudge that won't go away, not that Clinton's critics on the left are any more ready to be concilliatory. And while perpetually hostile trolls like Daou are difficult to ignore, there is a version of the Clinton-ite case against the Bernie wing that's not entirely unreasonable, which is: The Democratic Party, at a fundamental level, is composed of decent regular people who work hard for progressive political goals. Those people, pre-2016, generally supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy because of her career-long commitment to said goals and were of the mindset that her general-election chances would be best served by a smooth primary. It was thus both unfair and unhelpful, the argument goes, for Sanders to paint the entire party institution as the vehicle for corrupt "millionaires and billionaires" during his anti-establishment campaign\u2014and for observers like me to suggest, as I did last week, that there was something untoward about the way the party seemed to set up the primary to help Clinton.\u000a\u000aThe best version of the other side of that argument is that presidential nominations aren't lifetime achievement awards and that Sanders' popularity spoke to the real problems that many Democratic voters had with Clinton's candidacy, with the party's relatively moderate message, and with its uninspiring and/or crony-tastic leaders and power brokers. Whatever damage Sanders might have done to the Democratic brand, as it were, was justified by the need to shake up an institution that\u2014however well-intentioned\u2014has fared unacceptably poorly in recent elections at both local and national levels.

aVDemocrats are living their own version of Groundhog Day. Every day, they wake up and realize they are still in the 2016 presidential primary.\u000a\u000aThe leaked excerpts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign memoir, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d have stirred up another round of relitigation over, well, what happened. Clinton reserves some blame for Vladimir Putin, James Comey and herself. But it\u2019s her fingering of Bernie Sanders that has cheered her loyalists, enraged his, and made every other Democrat consider emulating Bill Murray by taking a bath with a plugged-in toaster.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aSanders\u2019 attacks on her character and progressive credentials \u201ccaused lasting damage,\u201d she charges in the book, \u201cmaking it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 campaign. I don\u2019t know if that bothered Bernie or not.\u201d\u000a\u000aOuch. \u201cThis is the grudge that won\u2019t go away,\u201d said Slate\u2019s Ben Mathis-Lilley of Clinton\u2019s feelings toward Sanders. But Clinton\u2019s jabs are more than personal pique. She is effectively warning her colleagues in the Democratic establishment: Don\u2019t give Bernie the keys to the party.\u000a\u000aThat message is not one often said out loud. Even if many Democrats harbor reservations about the Vermont independent\u2019s rising influence in their party, \u201cunity\u201d has been the buzzword since the Election Day debacle. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Sanders to join the party leadership, along with the Democrat from the reddest state in the union, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin. The new Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez, asked his rival, Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, to be vice chair, and then filled out a \u201cUnity Reform Commission\u201d\u2014part of the compromise 2016 party platform\u2014with members picked by Clinton, Sanders and Perez.\u000a\u000aDemocrats have been bending in Sanders\u2019 direction on policy in hopes of keeping Berniecrats in the fold. Schumer\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d policy package is aimed at breaking up corporate monopolies (though Sanders\u2019 political arm Our Revolution was unimpressed and staged a protest at the DNC the day after Schumer\u2019s unveiling). After Sanders supporters tagged potential presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris as soft on Wall Street, she fortified her left flank by endorsing his forthcoming single-payer health care bill. (In a Thursday statement responding to Clinton\u2019s criticisms, Sanders slipped in that his bill would be introduced next week, perfectly timed to step on her book rollout.)\u000a\u000aSanders holds the whip hand. He pushes the party. Then the party, terrified of losing his voters, gets pushed.\u000a\u000aThis lurch to the left has caused no immediate problems; congressional Democrats have been remarkably unified against Trump all year. And from the progressive populist perspective, Sanders is pushing Democrats only where they need to go, substantively and politically.\u000a\u000aBut Clinton\u2019s book waves a big red flag: \u201c\u2026 he isn\u2019t a Democrat\u2014that\u2019s not a smear, that\u2019s what he says. He didn\u2019t get into the race to make sure a Democrat won the White House, he got in to disrupt the Democratic Party.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders might say: Guilty as charged. In a June address to the \u201cPeople\u2019s Summit,\u201d an annual gathering of about 4,000 leftists with little fealty to the Democratic Party, he made plain his agenda of remaking the party in his image: \u201c[T]he current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure \u2026 The Democratic Party needs fundamental change \u2026 The Democratic Party must, finally, understand which side it is on. And that cannot be the side of Wall Street or the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile Sanders argues that the Democratic Party must choose sides between people and corporations, Clinton counters that Sanders must choose whether or not to be a Democrat. For Clintonites, his refusal to embrace the party label is not a mere matter of nomenclature. It suggests he does not have the Democratic Party\u2019s best interests at heart; he is unwilling to partner with Democrats who have different views about the scope of government and its relationship with business; and, in turn, he can\u2019t make the trade-offs essential to governing.\u000a\u000aIn another leaked passage, Clinton equates Sanders\u2019 grandiose plans with the get-rich-quick scheme shared by the drifter in There\u2019s Something About Mary who plans to outsell \u201cEight-Minute Abs\u201d with \u201cSeven-Minute Abs.\u201d \u201cOn issue after issue,\u201d she mockingly complains, \u201cit was like he kept promising four-minute abs, or even no-minutes abs. Magic abs!\u201d\u000a\u000aShe doesn\u2019t say this outright, but the implication is that she believes Sanders is a snake oil salesman (the leaked excerpt appears to say there was no way \u201cBernie could keep his promises or deliver real results\u201d) who shouldn\u2019t be allowed to become the face of the party and define its agenda.\u000a\u000aWill any Democrat care about what she has to say? Clinton is already being pilloried anew for \u201creopening this wound\u201d at \u201cthe worst possible time\u201d when Democrats could be seizing the offensive against divided and reeling Republicans. Her book comes out as a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll puts the percentage of those viewing her positively at an abysmal 30 percent, 6 points worse than President Trump\u2014hardly making her a perfect messenger.\u000a\u000aBut perhaps it\u2019s that unpopularity\u2014the combined loathing from Trump and Sanders supporters\u2014along with the extreme unlikelihood that she ever would run for another office, that liberates her to do what elected Democrats cannot: front-stab Bernie. After all, she has literally nothing to lose.\u000a\u000aSanders, however, has a lot to lose. Thanks to his audacious bet on disruption, he now wields the most influence he\u2019s ever had since he redeveloped the Lake Champlain waterfront. He finished the primary as a national figure with some of the strongest poll ratings of any active politician in America, often cracking 50 percent favorability when no others can. He is almost certain to be a major factor in 2020, be it as a candidate or the leader of the left and a powerhouse endorser.\u000a\u000aThe new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found Sanders with a 44 percent positive rating. That\u2019s pretty good in this age of polarization, especially considering his negative rating stood at only 30 percent. But dropping below the 50 percent threshold suggests he\u2019s paying some price for his intraparty scuffles, such as when he resisted an endorsement of moderate Democratic House candidate Jon Ossoff, and touted a mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, with a record of restricting abortion rights. If Clinton can narrow his appeal, she may not buoy her personal popularity, but she may complicate Sanders\u2019 attempt at a party makeover.\u000a\u000aThe prospect of Clinton seeking to outmaneuver Sanders makes the reception to her book and promotional tour worth watching. Strong sales and enthusiastic crowds could send a signal to other Democrats running in 2018 and 2020 that Bernie-style populism hasn\u2019t cornered the market on grass-roots passion. On the other hand, if Democrats are buzzing more about \u201cMedicare for All\u201d than \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d then Bernie\u2019s hold on the party will be solidified.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s four-month road trip won\u2019t end like Groundhog Day, with our rumpled male and buttoned-down female protagonists breaking the curse and settling down together in Western Pennsylvania. Democrats instead are doomed to relive the bitter Clinton-Sanders battle day after day for a simple reason: There is no consensus on \u201cwhat happened,\u201d and there never will be.\u000a\u000aBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d

aVSCHUMER: HUD WILL WAIVE \u2018DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS\u2019 REVIEW FOR NEARLY ALL SUPERSTORM SANDY VICTIMS, ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP FLOOD INSURANCE SETTLEMENT FUNDS WITHOUT FEAR OF CLAW-BACK; AT LAST MINUTE, FEMA WILL ALSO EXTEND SANDY CLAIMS REVIEW PROCESS SO MORE HOMEOWNERS CAN APPLY\u000a\u000aIn July, Schumer Called on HUD Secretary Castro to Waive HUD Policy Requiring Every Settlement Negotiated by FEMA Be Scrutinized For \u2018Duplication of Benefits\u2019 For Sandy Victims; Previous Burdensome & Bureaucratic Policy Endangered Homeowners\u2019 Settlement Funds\u2014The Majority Of Whom Received No More Than $20K & Are Still Spending Money To Rebuild\u000a\u000aDecision Means HUD Will Waive Duplication Of Benefits For Anyone Who Received FEMA Payment Of $20K Or Less & Anyone Whose Duplication Is Less Than $20K \u2014That\u2019s 3 Out Of 4 Homeowners; Payouts Greater Than $20K Will Go Through Fair & Flexible Analysis & Duplication of Benefits Recoupment Could Be Waived In Many Of Those Cases, Too\u000a\u000aU.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer announced today that, after his push, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will waive its policy mandating a \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d assessment for Superstorm Sandy victims who receive $20,000 or less from FEMA. For the minority of cases that remain, HUD will look at each on a case-by-case basis and determine if there is a potential duplication of benefits, an assessment they promised Schumer would be done by the CDBG grantees with significant flexibility \u2014and one that could still allow a complete waiver of the duplication of benefits analysis to occur if the duplication is determined to be $20,000 or less. Specifically, that equates to a waiver for nearly 75% of the cases, or 3 out of 4 homeowners, who were at risk of having these settlement funds clawed back under the current Duplication of Benefits policy. Under its current policy, HUD mandates that each and every recipient that receives National Flood Insurance Policy (NFIP) settlement funds from FEMA and also received Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) from NY Rising or Build it Back have their flood insurance settlement re-reviewed to identify any \u201cduplication of benefits.\u201d This assessment would be incredibly burdensome to homeowners who have waited years to receive the flood insurance protection they were entitled to, not to mention that the Duplication of Benefits assessment would likely cost more to conduct than the funds that would ultimately be recouped. Therefore, Schumer led the effort to have this policy waived for Sandy victims and was the first to formally call on HUD Secretary Castro to forego efforts to claw-back NFIP insurance money from Superstorm Sandy victims who have recently received additional flood insurance payouts.\u000a\u000aSchumer has also called on the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to extend the Sandy Claims Review Process that was set to stop accepting claims from homeowners on September 15, 2015. At the last minute, and after Schumer's urging, FEMA will now extend the Claims Review Process for an additional 30 days. This will allow hundreds of more homeowners who are eligible to have their claims reviewed sign up for the program without the fear that funds provided by FEMA will retroactively be clawed-back by New York Rising or Build It Back as a duplication of benefits.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe people this decision helps are the people who have scraped\u2014and are still scraping\u2014to get by and rebuild their homes, their lives. These are not the people the feds should be knocking on the door of to pay up. They did not profit from this disaster and many of them are still paying for home repairs and will be for a long, long time,\u201d said Senator Schumer. \u201cHUD\u2019s decision to waive the \u2018duplication of benefits\u2019 policy for so many Superstorm Sandy victims\u2014and the promise that even more could be free of a claw-back\u2014represents a sensible resolution, but more importantly, the right thing to do.\u000a\u000a\u201cMoreover, I am pleased to learn that given HUD\u2019s determination today, FEMA will extend the claims review process by an additional 30 days. That process is working and putting hard-earned dollars back into the pockets of Sandy victims and that is why I fought so hard to see it put in place. An extension makes sense and will allow more homeowners who feel like they have been shortchanged to be made whole,\u201d Schumer added.\u000a\u000aAccording to federal court records and news reports, evidence supports allegations that private insurance companies unjustly and arbitrarily denied the flood insurance claims of thousands of homeowners affected by Superstorm Sandy, many based on suspect engineering reports. More than 1,000 property owners filed lawsuits in U.S. Eastern District of New York against insurers over flood insurance claims that were denied or underpaid in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. After Schumer\u2019s push, FEMA agreed to reopen and review any flood insurance claim\u2014of the approximately 144,000\u2014filed by Superstorm Sandy victims, in addition to the thousands already in litigation.\u000a\u000aDespite the long battle of fighting for these desperately needed funds, HUD\u2019s initial policy required those homeowners who recently received additional flood insurance payments from FEMA to again have their settlement re-reviewed to determine if the funds were a \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d received from CDBG grants given years ago.\u000a\u000aEarlier this year, Schumer publicly wrote to Secretary Castro and impressed upon him that in these unique circumstances NFIP settlement funds should not be sought to be clawed-back from homeowners under the \u201cDuplication of Benefits\u201d policy. Specifically, Schumer cited a federal statute that says, \u201cThe agency which provided the duplicative assistance shall collect such duplicative assistance from the recipient\u2026when the head of such agency consider it to be in the best interest of the Federal Government.\u201d Schumer explained that this statute gives HUD the authority to waive the mandate that NFIP settlement funds be recouped as a \u201cduplication of benefits.\u201d Schumer said that HUD should grant a waiver of this requirement in this situation because these homeowners have had to wait years for this funding due to fraudulent activity, in part by the Federal Government\u2019s lack of oversight, and have to fight private insurance companies, leading to unnecessary aggravation - not to mention that initial payments to these homeowners likely failed to account for many of the additional losses that occurred as a result of the storm.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, in 2013, Schumer successfully pushed HUD to provide additional flexibility to Sandy victims who declined a government loan immediately after Superstorm Sandy. Initially, HUD\u2019s \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d policy negatively impacted these victims by requiring that CDBG assistance be reduced by the amount of any approved SBA loan - whether the homeowner accepted the loan of not.\u000a\u000a###

aVNorth Korea will be able to field a reliable, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile as early as next year, U.S. officials have concluded in a confidential assessment that dramatically shrinks the timeline for when Pyongyang could strike North American cities with atomic weapons.\u000a\u000aThe new assessment by the ­Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which shaves a full two years off the consensus forecast for North Korea\u2019s ICBM program, was prompted by recent missile tests showing surprising technical advances by the country\u2019s weapons scientists, at a pace beyond what many analysts believed was possible for the isolated communist regime.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. projection closely mirrors revised predictions by South Korean intelligence officials, who also have watched with growing alarm as North Korea has appeared to master key technologies needed to loft a warhead toward targets thousands of miles away.\u000a\u000aThe finding further increases the pressure on U.S. and Asian leaders to halt North Korea\u2019s progress before Pyongyang can threaten the world with nuclear-tipped missiles. President Trump, during his visit to Poland this month, vowed to confront North Korea \u201cvery strongly\u201d to stop its missile advances.\u000a\u000aThe DIA has concluded that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be able to produce a \u201creliable, nuclear-capable ICBM\u201d program sometime in 2018, meaning that by next year the program will have advanced from prototype to assembly line, according to officials familiar with the document. Already, the aggressive testing regime put in place in recent months has allowed North Korea to validate its basic designs, putting it within a few months of starting industrial production, the officials said.\u000a\u000aThe DIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to address any classified assessments.\u000a\u000aBut Scott Bray, ODNI\u2019s national intelligence manager for East Asia, said in a statement: \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s recent test of an intercontinental range ballistic missile \u2014 which was not a surprise to the intelligence community \u2014 is one of the milestones that we have expected would help refine our timeline and judgments on the threats that Kim Jong Un poses to the continental United States. This test, and its impact on our assessments, highlight the threat that North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose to the United States, to our allies in the region, and to the whole world. The intelligence community is closely monitoring the expanding threat from North Korea.\u201d\u000a\u000a[Kim Jong Un\u2019s rockets are getting an important boost \u2014 from China]\u000a\u000aOne of the few remaining technical hurdles is the challenge of atmospheric \u201creentry\u201d \u2014 the ability to design a missile that can pass through the upper atmosphere without damage to the warhead. Long regarded as a formidable technological barrier for impoverished North Korea, that milestone could be reached, beginning with new tests expected to take place within days, U.S. analysts said. U.S. officials have detected signs that North Korea is making final preparations for testing a new reentry vehicle, perhaps as early as Thursday, a North Korean national holiday marking the end of the Korean War.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re on track to do that, essentially this week,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence report who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive military assessments.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea has not yet demonstrated an ability to build a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be carried by one of its missiles. Officials there last year displayed a sphere-shaped device the regime described as a miniaturized warhead, but there has been no public confirmation that this milestone has been achieved. Preparations reportedly have been underway for several months for what would be the country\u2019s sixth underground atomic test. The last one, in September, had an estimated yield of 20 to 30 kilotons, more than double the explosive force of any previous test.\u000a\u000aNorth Korea startled the world with its successful July 4 test of a missile capable of striking parts of Alaska \u2014 the first such missile with proven intercontinental range. The launch of a two-stage \u201cHwasong-14\u201d missile was the latest in a series of tests in recent months that have revealed startlingly rapid advances across a number of technical fields, from mastery of solid-fuel technology to the launch of the first submarine-based missile, current and former intelligence officials and weapons experts said.\u000a\u000a(Anna Fifield,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\u000a\u000a\u201cThere has been alarming progress,\u201d said Joseph DeTrani, the former mission manager for North Korea for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a former special envoy for negotiations with Pyongyang. \u201cIn the last year they have gained capabilities that they didn\u2019t have, including ones that we thought they would not have been able to obtain for years.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe July 4 missile test also caught South Korea\u2019s intelligence service off guard, prompting a hasty revision of forecasts, according to South Korean lawmakers who have received closed-door briefings. \u201cThe speed of North Korea\u2019s ICBM missile development is faster than the South Korean Defense Ministry expected,\u201d said lawmaker Lee Cheol-hee of the left-wing Minjoo party, who attended an intelligence committee briefing after the July 4 test.\u000a\u000a[The message behind the murder: North Korea\u2019s assassination sheds light on chemical weapons arsenal]\u000a\u000aThe South Korean government, which is actively trying to engage the regime in Pyongyang, has declined to call the most recent test a success. North Korea still has not proved it has mastered some of the steps needed to build a reliable ICBM, most notably the reentry vehicle, Lee said.\u000a\u000aStill, officials across the political spectrum acknowledged that North Korea is rapidly gaining ground. \u201cNow they are approaching the final stage of being a nuclear power and the owner of an ICBM,\u201d said Cha Du-hyeogn, who served as an adviser to conservative former president Lee Myung-bak.\u000a\u000aU.S. spy agencies have detected multiple signals that North Korea is preparing to test a reentry vehicle. Analysts believe that the July 4 test was intended to demonstrate range \u2014 the ability of its new two-stage ICBM prototype to reach altitude and distance milestones \u2014 while the new launch will seek to validate engineering features designed to protect the warhead as it passes through the upper atmosphere and then is delivered to a distant target.\u000a\u000aThe latest designs appear to cobble together older systems \u2014 including portions of a missile frame used to launch satellites into orbit \u2014 with a more advanced engine that North Korea began testing earlier this year. Much of the technology is based on old Soviet-era designs that have been reworked by what U.S. experts describe as an increasingly capable cadre of homegrown engineers, goaded along by a leadership that has pursued nuclear weapons and delivery systems with single-minded zeal.\u000a\u000aKim vowed in January to successfully test a nuclear-capable ICBM in 2017, achieving a long-sought goal that North Koreans believe will serve as the ultimate deterrent against threats to the communist regime\u2019s survival. At the time, the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s formal assessment still held that a credible ICBM threat would not emerge until 2020 at the earliest.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s timeline moved faster than we expected,\u201d said the U.S. official familiar with the new DIA assessment. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting an ICBM test in July.\u201d\u000a\u000aFormer U.S. officials and weapons experts said a successful test of a nuclear-capable ICBM would dramatically raise the stakes in the North Korean crisis, putting new pressure on North Korea\u2019s neighbors and increasing the risk of miscalculation. \u201cThe danger is that decision time and warning is greatly reduced when North Korea has the weapons, and that escalation can happen quickly,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, senior director for arms control and nonproliferation with the Obama administration\u2019s National Security Council.\u000a\u000aThe specter of a nuclear-armed, ICBM-capable Kim \u201ctakes the risk to a new level but does not change the nature of the threat we have faced for some time,\u201d Wolfsthal said. \u201cWe have to deter North Korea from ever using any nuclear weapons and make clear that any move to use these weapons is suicide.\u201d\u000a\u000aRead more:\u000a\u000aNorth Koreans may be isolated, but the country\u2019s elite use Gmail, Facebook and iTunes\u000a\u000aTwenty-five million reasons the U.S. hasn\u2019t struck North Korea\u000a\u000aHow Trump is changing America\u2019s foreign policy

aVFreedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (right) and Vice Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (left) told White House officials Thursday that the group may put out its own tax plan. | Mark Wilson/Getty Freedom Caucus might go rogue on tax reform\u000a\u000aHouse Freedom Caucus leaders told White House officials this week that Republicans need to release a tax plan soon \u2014 or the conservative group may put out one of its own.\u000a\u000aFreedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Vice Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) delivered that message Thursday to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Director Gary Cohn, the top officials leading the tax effort for the White House. Mnuchin and Cohn, along with White House legislative liaison Marc Short, who was also at the meeting, do not want the group to release any text, fearful it will prevent Republicans from uniting behind one plan.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aMeadows, in a brief interview Friday afternoon, downplayed the possibility that the group would release its own legislation, adding that the White House has assured him action is imminent. But conservatives are eager to deliver on a major campaign promise after the Obamacare repeal bill died in the Senate. And if that means forging ahead on their own, they\u2019re not ruling it out.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not threatening my own tax bill if we don\u2019t get our way,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAt the same time, if we don\u2019t make decisions in the near term on what we\u2019re going to do, [we might] put forth something.\u201d\u000a\u000aMeadows added: \u201cEvery day that goes by, there is less and less of a chance of getting it done before the end of the year. And so for us, it\u2019s all about promoting real dialogue right away, and we\u2019ve been assured real dialogue right away is forthcoming.\u201d\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

But they're also concerned about keeping conservatives in the fold after Trump cut a budget deal this week with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), startling his own party.\u000a\u000aWhen Mnuchin met with Republicans Friday morning and asked them to vote for the deal, he was jeered and hissed by the room.\u000a\u000aTrump encouraged legislators to \u201churry\u201d on a tax plan in September. But debates are still ongoing between the House and the Senate on particulars, including over whether to allow immediate business expensing, and over how much the corporate tax rate can be lowered. And Trump has repeatedly pushed for a 15 percent rate behind the scenes, even as some of his top advisers, including Cohn, say it is not mathematically possible.\u000a\u000aThe possibility of the Freedom Caucus going rogue on tax reform petrifies administration and Capitol Hill Republicans working on the issue. GOP leaders believe that a single, unified tax bill backed by Trump, the House and the Senate is critical to success.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s the very reason why Cohn and Mnuchin have been meeting weekly with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), along with the GOP chairmen of the House and Senate tax panels \u2014 a group known as the \u201cBig Six.\u201d\u000a\u000aConservatives, however, also want a seat at the table and are eager to see a plan and influence the text. There\u2019s a palpable fear that the Big Six is going to release a plan and try to jam conservatives \u2014 just like they did with health care.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy conversations with the White House as well as the speaker [are], \u2018Let's make some decisions and start debating the merits of those rates and expensing models and everything that goes into a tax reform package,\u2019\u201d Meadows said. \u201cTo allow the Big Six or the Secret Six to negotiate something, then to give everyone a binary choic,e is not something that will necessarily represent a broad swath of the GOP conference.\u201d\u000a\u000aConservatives are desperate for a win to show constituents back home. An antsy Meadows ticked off six major tax reform questions that no one has answered, from the exact corporate tax to how business expensing will be handled. \u201cThose are six items that you and I can\u2019t answer, and if we can\u2019t answer them, then we don\u2019t have any idea what we\u2019re doing on tax reform,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMeadows said there are several Freedom Caucus members crafting tax legislation. And Axios reported earlier this week that one such plan would lower the corporate tax rate to 16 percent \u2014 a much more aggressive cut than the Big Six believes Congress can achieve.\u000a\u000aBut the meeting appears to have convinced conservatives to hold off\u2014at least for now.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe only way that a plan from the Freedom Caucus would be introduced is if there is inaction on behalf of the Big Six, and we\u2019re still talking about principles weeks from now,\u201d said Meadows, who argued that there was \u201cno need\u201d for his group to drop a plan at the moment.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ll never put out a bill,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut as long as they put out a bill and negotiate in good faith over the next few weeks, there will be no Freedom Caucus bill or a need for a Freedom Caucus bill.\u201d

Bounds is currently assistant U.S attorney in Oregon and also served in the George W. Bush administration; he has clerked for the federal judge he would replace, Diarmuid F.

The panel generally does not proceed with a confirmation hearing for judicial nominees without the seal of approval from the home-state senators, which is done by sending a blue slip back to the committee.\u000a\u000aWyden and Merkley stressed in the letter, addressed to White House counsel Don McGahn, that they had already told the administration they would not greenlight any candidate that had not been approved by a bipartisan judicial selection committee in the state.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The moves from Democrats will test the long-standing Senate blue-slip tradition, which has allowed senators virtual veto power over nominees from their home state.\u000a\u000aSeveral key Senate Republicans, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), have suggested that the blue-slip policy is more appropriate for district court nominees rather than appellate picks, whose courts span multiple states and wield considerably more influence.\u000a\u000aOther Democrats have returned blue slips for key circuit court nominees, including 6th Circuit nominee Joan Larsen of Michigan and 7th Circuit nominee Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, who had their confirmation hearings this week.

The Paris Las Vegas hotel finally managed to shut down the event, but another group of angry Sanders fans descended on the state Democratic headquarters the next morning.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTo the state party officials across the nation who saw videos from the convention on the Internet and on cable news Monday morning, the Nevada debacle served as a jarring reminder that the party is still a long way from united after its long slog of a primary.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think maybe Nevada is a little bit of a wake-up call\u201d to party leaders, warned West Virginia Democratic Vice Chairman Christopher Regan. "If every state chair is not talking about how we can make sure that doesn't happen in our state, [for] those that have yet to go, you're just not doing your job."\u000a\u000aIn interviews with state Democratic chairs and other party leaders in roughly a dozen states \u2014 some of whom back Sanders, and some who support Clinton \u2014 the consensus is that the Nevada meltdown was an anomaly. But many worry that it might also be a harbinger of trouble at upcoming state conventions, and perhaps even the July national convention in Philadelphia.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt is really important for [Sanders], if it\u2019s clear to him by the time the convention starts \u2014 and that\u2019s likely to happen \u2014 [that Clinton has won], that he send messages to his supporters through his lieutenants, through the heads of his delegations, that if Secretary Clinton has the necessary delegates, then we\u2019ll have a roll call,\u201d said former Pennsylvania governor and DNC chairman Ed Rendell, the convention chairman and a veteran Clinton ally, conceding that a fight over the party\u2019s platform would still be likely.\u000a\u000aDemocrats had hoped to portray the party as a picture of unity \u2013 to contrast to what\u2019s expected to be a messy, contentious Republican affair a week earlier in Cleveland \u2013 but those hopes are fading as some level of unrest is now expected in various state Democratic conventions in upcoming weeks.\u000a\u000aThose concerns began surfacing in formal and informal communications on Sunday and Monday, said state Democratic officials \u2014 and it is certain to be a glaring topic of conversation later this week in Philadelphia when state party leaders gather for their quarterly meeting.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019ll see similar things happen in other state conventions elsewhere in the next few weeks. I don\u2019t know if it will be to the same extent as Nevada,\u201d predicted Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, noting that he had already discussed the Nevada proceedings during a meeting with his own party on Monday morning, weeks before their own convention. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that tensions will be this high come late July [at the national convention]. But obviously if they are, that would be a problem."\u000a\u000aOthers express a higher degree of alarm, and hope to head off any further clashes by encouraging the Vermont senator to call for a cool-down.\u000a\u000a\u201cI hope Senator Sanders would understand that he is not only damaging his own reputation and standing, but also doing harm to the Democratic Party, unless he encourages his supporters to be more genteel in their protest,\u201d said Don Fowler, the Democratic National Committee chairman from 1995 to 1997.\u000a\u000aIn Nevada, Saturday\u2019s convention fell into disarray even after Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid \u2014 the state\u2019s leading Democrat \u2014 issued statements Friday urging a calm, respectful event following fraught county conventions last month.\u000a\u000aThe Vermont senator\u2019s backers at one point shouted down California Sen. Barbara Boxer, speaking on behalf of Clinton, while protesting party chairwoman Roberta Lange\u2019s stewardship of the event and accusing the local leadership of stacking the rules and credentials against them when some delegates \u2014 including those who were not registered Democrats \u2014 weren't accepted.\u000a\u000aThree hours after the event was scheduled to end, hotel security stepped in to close out the proceedings but the turmoil didn\u2019t end there. Protesting into the next day after Clinton came out on top, some angry participants posted Lange\u2019s phone number online, spurring thousands of death threats, according to the Nevada Democratic Party.\u000a\u000aWhile many of the state Democratic conventions have gone off without a hitch this year \u2014 both in states won by Clinton and by Sanders \u2014 the contentiousness surrounding Nevada had some precedent.\u000a\u000aIn Colorado\u2019s April convention, Clinton-backing Sen. Michael Bennet was drowned out by Sanders backers chanting \u201cchange your vote,\u201d referring to his role as a super delegate. More recently in Maine, where Sanders won the state\u2019s caucuses by a 2-1 margin but a majority of the state\u2019s 5 super delegates back Clinton, the Democratic convention approved a proposal forcing super delegates to proportionally align their support with the caucus results. Sanders supporters in the crowd booed and yelled \u201csellout\u201d and \u201cgo back to Massachusetts\u201d at former Congressman Barney Frank, when he called on them to unite behind Clinton.\u000a\u000aState leaders said they can envision future gatherings getting even testier as the race drags on and as Sanders keeps winning primaries, as he is expected to do on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a"I am a little concerned about some of the procedural stuff, but I think we're prepared to have those conversations," said Wyoming Democratic Chairwoman Ana Cuprill, explaining that she had raised security concerns while planning the convention in her state, where Sanders won the popular vote but tied in the pledged delegate count.\u000a\u000aTo the Sanders team, such worries simply mean party officials should work on finding a way to improve and clarify their procedures to be more inclusive toward supporters of a candidate who has won so many states and delegates.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re still putting together the facts on what happened there at the time, but in general I can say that it would be in the Democratic Party\u2019s best interest for its leaders to figure out a way to welcome the millions of people we have brought into Democratic Party politics this year, and make them part of the process,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 communications director Michael Briggs. \u201cSmart, self-interested Democrats should figure out how to welcome those people rather than stiff-arm them."\u000a\u000a"It\u2019s fair for [party leaders] to figure out what happened, and to try to figure out a way to be more open and welcoming than the Nevada Democrats were for their own sake,\u201d he added. \u201cWhoever is the nominee of this party is going to need the support of as many people as possible, obviously, and the way to do that is to take advantage of this boom in interest that has happened because of Senator Sanders\u2019 message resonating all across the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut most state leaders who spoke with POLITICO wouldn\u2019t commit to making changes, instead insisting, like Mississippi Democratic Chairman Rickey Cole, \u201cIf you want to participate in the process, you have to know the rules."\u000a\u000aAccordingly, those officials are now reviewing the plans for their own state conventions or gatherings \u2014 many spent Monday checking in with their staffs about their preparation. But they say they are more concerned about how Sanders\u2019 local fans read his campaign trail messaging, and fear that insinuations that the nominating process is rigged \u2014 not to mention Sanders\u2019 consistent criticism of the party establishment \u2014 could lead to more unrest. They\u2019d prefer that the senator focus more of his campaign trail ire on Donald Trump.\u000a\u000aSouth Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison floated the idea of a public event held in conjunction with Clinton, to send a message of party harmony even if both candidates remain in the race for the foreseeable future.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, in state after state, party leaders said they were aiming to ensure calm at their state conventions by explaining the rules and opening lines of communication between Clinton and Sanders supporters.\u000a\u000aThe alternative, said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, is a Trump presidency: \u201cIf people walk away just because they don\u2019t get their way, it will result in the worst president in the history of the United States."

aVThe Florida Republican is riding out the storm \u2014 which is expected to hit South Florida by Sunday morning \u2014 in his West Miami home, staying close to his 86-year-old mother, who lives in a nearby assisted living home. | AP Photo Rubio in Miami: Irma could 'overwhelm the system'\u000a\u000aMIAMI \u2014 From airports to banks to opioid addicts, Sen. Marco Rubio is warning that Hurricane Irma could "overwhelm the system" in Miami, as the nation's eighth-largest city \u2014 and leaders across the state \u2014 prepares for the storm amid a kind of creeping dread.\u000a\u000aThe Florida Republican is riding out the storm \u2014 which is expected to hit South Florida by Sunday morning \u2014 in his West Miami home, staying close to his 86-year-old mother, who lives in a nearby assisted living home.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"You've got a lot of elderly people living in old structures and trailer parks who don't want to leave. You've got cruise ships dropping people off at the Port of Miami," Rubio told POLITICO by phone from his home. "You've got major airports in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach. I don't care if the towers open and the airlines are flying, you can't get anyone on the plane without TSA agents. And if those TSA agents live in Miami and were evacuated or harmed by the storm, it's going to be a while until you get them back to work."\u000a\u000aWhile downgraded from a Category 5 storm to a Category 4 storm Thursday, the storm's projected track has also shifted westward, and most models are now in agreement that the storm is likely to crash into South Florida sometime Sunday. The storm\u2019s latest path has it running up the center of the state, impacting nearly every region except the further western portions of the Panhandle.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line: A major hurricane as wide as the state is threatening landfall on either coast; the entire state is in the dreaded cone of uncertainty; the whole southern peninsula is under a hurricane warning and a warning for storm surge that could reach 10 feet. Hundreds of thousands of residents on the I-95 and I-75 corridors evacuated. There are traffic jams on every major northbound highway out of the southern peninsula. Store shelves from Naples to Miami and points north all the way to Jacksonville are picked clean of water, food, batteries, flashlights, plywood and screws. Fuel is sucked dry.\u000a\u000aGov. Rick Scott has taken the exceedingly rare step of closing pre-K-12, colleges and universities in all Florida\u2019s 67 counties through Monday. He also ordered the closure of state offices across the state. Scott has done a media barrage, offering updates and stressing the importance of people leaving the South Florida region \u2014 and of other Floridians being prepared to leave if needed.\u000a\u000a"Because of the nature of the storm and the trajectory, it has the capacity to overwhelm the system," Rubio said. "What if you're 86 years old and your Social Security check comes in on the 10th or the 15th. You don't have a bank. ... How do you get funds?"\u000a\u000a"All these [opiate addiction] sober homes in Palm Beach, run by shady operators, what do they do with all these patients living there and theoretically being treated? Do they just pick up and leave and now these people are on their own?" Rubio asked. "We've also got a substantial homeless population. ... You've got a lot of elderly people living in old structures and trailer parks who don't want to leave. You've got cruise ships dropping people off at the Port of Miami."\u000a\u000aRubio said small farming towns near the Everglades such as Belle Glade could also face flooding from Irma if it pushes a 10-foot storm surge up the River of Grass.\u000a\u000aAnd there's more: Aside from the short term shock of so many thousands leaving South Florida for Central and North Florida, Rubio said the state might have to prepare for a fresh influx of people from Puerto Rico, who have come to Florida in droves in recent years.\u000a\u000aPuerto Rico was "expecting a catastrophic entire-island wipeout" from Irma but dodged that fate, Rubio said. However, he added, the public utilities are decaying and some places could be without power for so long \u2014 some initial estimates projected as many as six months of blackouts \u2014 that more people will pick up and move to Florida.\u000a\u000a"In Florida, our utilities go down and you can drive trucks down from North Carolina," Rubio said. "In Puerto Rico, how do you get there? By sea."\u000a\u000aMatt Dixon in Tallahassee contributed to this report.

aVStory highlights North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the U.S. and South Korea\u000a\u000aThe U.S. calculates that a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time\u000a\u000aMike Chinoy says it's not the first time such an "alarmist" conclusion has been reached\u000a\u000aHe suggests other U.S. agencies have disagreed\u000a\u000aThe latest controversy over whether North Korea has the technology to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile is not the first time American intelligence agencies have been at odds in assessing Pyongyang's capabilities. And it is not the first time the Pentagon's intelligence arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has been out front in reaching the most alarmist conclusions about North Korea -- one with which other U.S. agencies have disagreed.\u000a\u000aThe DIA assessment, disclosed by a Congressman at a hearing on April 11, was that the DIA has "moderate confidence" North Korea has developed a nuclear warhead that can be delivered by a ballistic missile. Within hours, however, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, released a statement saying the DIA report did not represent the consensus of the intelligence community, and that "North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile," -- a view echoed by a Pentagon spokesman and the South Korean Defense Ministry.\u000a\u000aSecretary of State John Kerry also noted that "it is inaccurate to suggest that the DPRK has fully tested, developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report."\u000a\u000aMike Chinoy\u000a\u000aThe sharply different judgments about Pyongyang's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998, when a fierce debate erupted within the American intelligence community after U. S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri, not far from North Korea's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon.\u000a\u000aThe DIA insisted that Kumchangri was a construction site for a secret, underground nuclear weapons facility and that its existence proved Pyongyang was cheating on the Agreed Framework, the Clinton administration's 1994 deal under which the North froze operations at Yongbyon in return for economic and diplomatic concessions from Washington.\u000a\u000a"The DIA was adamant," then-National Security Adviser Sandy Berger recalled in a 2007 interview for my book, "Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED Kerry visita Asia Replay More Videos ...

"I looked at the evidence," one senior Clinton administration official told me during research for my book, "and I could easily see innocent explanations for virtually everything they pointed to. And others in the intel community looked at exactly the same stuff and heard the DIA's arguments about it, and said essentially, this is really flimsy stuff."\u000a\u000aOn August 17, 1998, the New York Times published a story that revealed the intelligence findings, turning what had been an internal intelligence debate into a public firestorm of controversy -- just as the congressman's revelations did on Thursday.\u000a\u000aThe Times report, with headline "North Korea Site An A-Bomb Plant, US Agencies Say" created major problems. In Washington, the Clinton administration came under attack for Pyongyang's alleged violations of the Agreed Framework. And, unless the issue was handled with great skill, the tenuous link between the U.S. and North Korea that has existed since the 1994 deal would collapse.\u000a\u000aIn the spring of 1999, Chuck Kartman, Washington's Special Envoy for Peace Talks with North Korea -- nicknamed "Iron Butt" for his ability to sit patiently and listen to North Korean envoys spew out venom, bombast and threats across the negotiating table -- engaged in protracted talks with his North Korean counterparts.\u000a\u000aIn May, Kartman convinced the North to agree to permit U.S. inspectors to visit Kumchangri. In addition, after initially demanding a payment of $300 million dollars for a one-time visit, North Korea eventually accepted a shipment of 100,000 tons of potatoes as the "price" of permitting the inspection.\u000a\u000aJUST WATCHED South Korea concerned about threats?

To the Americans' surprise and embarrassment, they found a large, empty underground cave. There was no evidence of a secret nuclear site.\u000a\u000aThe crisis passed. According to Gary Samore, then the National Security Council's Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and subsequently President Obama's Coordinator for Weapons of Mass Destruction, Counter-Terrorism and Arms Control: "The conclusion was that Kumchangri was not configured in a way that could be used either for plutonium or for enrichment. So, whatever we thought Kunchangri was, it wasn't. It was not nuclear-related."\u000a\u000aNearly two decades later, the purpose of the construction site at Kumchangri remains unknown. But the episode underscores the complexities of assessing intelligence on North Korea. The rush to judgment in 1998, driven by the DIA's aggressive briefings and the deliberate leak of the story to the media, left many officials at the time cautious, if not downright skeptical, about subsequent intelligence findings.\u000a\u000a"DIA hyped their findings unbelievably," one former senior Clinton administration official said to me. "They mis-stated their level of certainty, and the further up the food chain they went, the more they dropped the caveats, and ended up putting us in a terrible position."\u000a\u000aGary Samore had accepted the DIA's analysis, and lobbied strongly for the Clinton administration to make Kumchangri a major issue. "Sandy Berger [President Clinton's National Security Adviser] depended pretty heavily on my judgment," he told me, "and I feel that my recommendation to him that it was a serious issue led the administration to deal with it more seriously than it ever turns out is justified. I would say that was the biggest mistake I made in my career as a civil servant."\u000a\u000aThe Kumchangri episode does not mean the DIA is necessarily wrong in its current assessment of North Korean nuclear capabilities. But the skepticism expressed by other agencies after Thursday's revelation carries a lesson. In a country which the former deputy head of the CIA, John McLaughlin, once described to me as an "intelligence black hole," serious analysts can reach sharply differing conclusions about the same evidence, and the public should be careful in taking every alarmist headline about North Korea at face value.

aVSeven years after the European Union got its own diplomatic service, it still punches below its economic weight in diplomatic terms \u2014 and foreign ministers will spend the next two days trying to fix that.\u000a\u000aMeeting in Estonia\u2019s capital Tallinn Thursday and Friday, they will brainstorm practical steps to enable the EU to talk with one voice on global issues where national diplomacy still trumps the collective.\u000a\u000aThe fundamental problem with the EU\u2019s foreign policy and the European External Action Service (EEAS) \u2014 the EU\u2019s foreign ministry and diplomatic corps \u2014 is that it lacks the capabilities that underpin traditional diplomacy. Sometimes, as with North Korea, it simply lacks any leverage. Elsewhere, such as Syria, the EU is the largest aid donor but has no collective military capability to impose its will \u2014 in the sometimes seemingly unlikely event it can agree on a policy.\u000a\u000aAfter an EU summit last December, German Chancellor Angela Merkel lamented that she and her EU colleagues \u201chave to stand there watching\u201d while Syria falls apart.\u000a\u000aThe veteran French diplomat Pierre Vimont, the first secretary-general of the EEAS, said ambiguous attitudes among the largest EU member countries are a major part of the problem. \u201cThey are interested in a European foreign policy but at the same time they want to retain national powers as much as possible,\u201d he said. This tends to hamper what the EU can do collectively.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the very start, the external service has never worked properly\u201d \u2014 EU diplomat\u000a\u000aOne recent example of a large European country pursuing its own agenda was the response to migration across the Mediterranean via Libya. Instead of agreeing an EU-wide approach, Italy struck a unilateral deal with local powers in Libya to stop people setting sail \u2014 then asked for European backing.\u000a\u000aThe EU can\u2019t even agree on an apparently simple question like what constitutes a country: For example, five countries in the EU (Greece, Romania, Spain, Slovakia and Cyprus) still don\u2019t recognize Kosovo as an independent state.\u000a\u000a\u201cFrom the very start, the external service has never worked properly,\u201d said an EU diplomat.\u000a\u000aThe general\u2019s dream\u000a\u000aA truly collective foreign policy has been an elusive goal for European federalists ever since French President General Charles De Gaulle suggested regular meetings of foreign ministers in 1959.\u000a\u000aFederica Mogherini, the current EU foreign policy chief, is well aware of the External Action Service\u2019s flaws. \u201cToday the service is still in its infancy and we\u2019re working hard to use all the tools provided by the treaties,\u201d she wrote two years ago, noting that the EEAS is more complex than a simple foreign service since \u201cit incorporates elements of a development and a defense ministry.\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was the Italian politician who put the self-reflection session on the agenda for this week\u2019s meeting in Tallinn. As it is an \u201cinformal\u201d gathering that doesn\u2019t need to take any grand decisions, she hopes EU ministers will feel free to float ideas or express grievances.\u000a\u000aThe EEAS, which became fully operational in January 2011, has its own staff and budget and Mogherini straddles both the European Commission, where she is a vice president, and the Council, where she chairs the Foreign Affairs Council, which gathers EU foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aThe primary function of the EEAS is to support the EU institutions and member countries, but since foreign policy remains a national prerogative, she is more of a coordinator than a minister.\u000a\u000aThat means Mogherini has little room for maneuver. \u201cIt\u2019s always very difficult because member states resent it when the High Representative [Mogherini\u2019s official title] and EEAS try to work on their own,\u201d said Vimont.\u000a\u000aIn any case, it is the capitals who are in the driving seat \u2014 and others understand that too.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s probably why, as an organization which tries to influence the way foreign policy is made, we focus our advocacy attention to the capitals because we know that, when it comes to foreign policy, it is still the capitals where key decisions are made,\u201d said Susi Dennison, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.\u000a\u000aIn this regard, not all voices are created equal \u2014 and EU member countries\u2019 historical and post-colonial ties around the world count for a lot. So the EU would be hesitant to pursue a bold line in Latin America, for example, without the blessing of Spain.\u000a\u000aAnother issue is that the EEAS remains \u201can understaffed, and under-resourced service,\u201d said Steven Blockmans, a professor of EU external relations law at the University of Amsterdam. But that is changing. Since the service\u2019s creation, \u201cit has shown that it can add value,\u201d said Blockmans. With 140 delegations around the globe, the EEAS has a network to rivals those of bigger European countries.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn many cases, individual member states\u2019 interests \u2026 are better served by working collectively through the EU at international level, rather than individually,\u201d said Blockmans.\u000a\u000aClosed-door debate\u000a\u000aBrussels tried to deflect expectations that the closed-door sessions in Tallinn would place the EEAS\u2019 performance under scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s not a discussion on the working methods of the EEAS but about the Foreign Affairs Council,\u201d said an EU official. Mogherini was eager to reflect on \u201cthe innovations\u201d she has introduced halfway through her term, said the official, who described the feedback from member countries as \u201cappreciation\u201d for the service\u2019s coordinating role.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe don\u2019t expect therefore discussions on the EEAS,\u201d said the official.\u000a\u000aHowever, one diplomat said the talks were certain to involve operational issues such as the lack of \u201ctimely distribution of documents from the external service to member states\u201d and, on the other hand, the need for member countries \u201cto indicate to the external service early enough when they have problems, instead of blocking the adoption of a common position at the last moment.\u201d\u000a\u000aUnlike many other policy areas, the Lisbon Treaty, which created the EEAS, requires unanimity on foreign policy.\u000a\u000aWith 28 member countries, last-minute changes of position by individual national delegations are hard to avoid, but they can be deeply frustrating for diplomats trying to hammer out a common EU position. One example of a last-minute intervention that nearly torpedoed an EU foreign policy move was a statement on Israel last year that had been agreed by EU officials and was due to be agreed by EU foreign ministers.\u000a\u000aJust ahead of the meeting, Greece wanted to reopen the text because it felt the wording would inflame relations with Israel. It then complained that it did not have enough time to examine the document to give it a final green light before approval by foreign ministers, a claim rejected by other diplomats.\u000a\u000aIn their private discussions, ministers are expected to look at fundamental questions about the role of the Foreign Affairs Council.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt European level, and also at national level, foreign policy is the prerogative of heads of state or heads of government,\u201d said Vimont, meaning that the real power lies with the European Council, made up of European heads of state and government. Foreign ministers, he argued, must \u201cadmit once and for all that the Foreign Affairs Council works under the tutorship and the instructions of the European Council.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhile EU diplomats and officials may be able to make incremental changes to EU foreign policy and how it functions, they won\u2019t be able to change some fundamental issues that go against streamlined decision-making. Unlike many other policy areas, the Lisbon Treaty, which created the EEAS, requires unanimity on foreign policy. Changing that would require a surrender of power by national governments and a treaty change, making that option a virtual non-starter.

aVGerman Chancellor and Christian Democrat (CDU) Angela Merkel and German Social Democrat (SPD) and chancellor candidate Martin Schulz shake hands prior to a televised debate at ARD television studios on September 3, 2017 in Berlin, Germany | Herby Sachs/WDR/ARD via Getty Images Record number of Germans don\u2019t want Turkey in EU: poll Majority of Germans want government to take tough economic stance against Turkey.\u000a\u000aA record number of Germans oppose Turkish EU membership and say accession talks with the country should end, according to a Deutschlandtrend survey conducted for broadcaster ARD.\u000a\u000aSome 84 percent of the respondents say Turkey does not belong in the European Union, the highest disapproval rate ever recorded in Deutschlandtrend poll, which was published Thursday night.\u000a\u000aIn addition, a large number of Germans (88 percent) want the federal government to take a tough stance against Turkey. This went up by 5 percentage points compared to February this year.\u000a\u000aSome 77 percent of the respondents believe the federal government should take economic action against Turkey, although 80 percent think that the German government should keep discussions with the Turkish administration open.\u000a\u000aThe two countries have been involved in a diplomatic row following a series of incidents. The issue became part of the German election campaign when both Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat opponent Martin Schulz were asked about it during last week\u2019s TV debate ahead of the September 24 vote.\u000a\u000aSchulz said he will end talks if he becomes chancellor, whereas Merkel said she will push the EU to reconsider its relationship with Turkey.\u000a\u000aSupport for the chancellor has risen slightly after the debate, according to the same poll. If Germans were able to directly elect their leader, 54 percent of them said they would vote for Merkel, up from 49 percent last week, whereas Schulz would receive 26 percent of the vote.\u000a\u000aSupport for each of the parties has changed little though.

aVLONDON \u2014 Theresa May will lead the Conservative Party into the next general election on the back of a bold series of domestic policy reforms that will begin to be rolled out before Christmas, according to her closest cabinet ally Damian Green.\u000a\u000aThe first secretary of state in the U.K. government \u2014 effectively the deputy prime minister \u2014 told POLITICO he expected May to remain in place \u201cfor many years\u201d to implement the agenda she first set out on the steps of Downing Street when she succeeded David Cameron last July.\u000a\u000aAfter a lack of progress on domestic policy reforms over the past five months, following the decision to call a snap election and the subsequent focus on Brexit, Green said the government would return to addressing the day-to-day concerns of ordinary voters, who need to see an improvement in their lives before the next election.\u000a\u000aGreen said the government would publish a potentially explosive report on racial disparity in the U.K. within weeks, as well as the long-awaited conclusion of the government\u2019s \u201cindustrial strategy\u201d \u2014 a policy of economic interventionism that marks May\u2019s premiership in stark contrast to Cameron\u2019s more free-market approach.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is not just a government about Brexit, it\u2019s a government with a big domestic agenda, and a lot of what you will see in coming months will stem from that domestic agenda\u201d \u2014 Damian Green\u000a\u000aThe government will also make a major push on housing so they can make \u201can offer\u201d to young voters at the next election, most of who swung behind the Labour Party in June\u2019s snap poll, Green said.\u000a\u000a\u201cHousing policy is hugely important and particularly important for certain demographics,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a decline in home ownership and that\u2019s worrying and particularly worrying for people in their 20s and 30s who would know that [for] previous generations that was the point when they became homeowners. That\u2019s one of the domestic issues we are determined to get to grips with.\u201d\u000a\u000aA senior official at Conservative Campaign Headquarters told POLITICO last month the party \u201curgently\u201d needed a radical new housing policy to try to win back younger voters. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has reportedly been pressing for a significant increase in house building but faces opposition from some within his own party who are concerned about the impact that would have on the countryside.\u000a\u000aBut Green said: \u201cWe need an offer for everyone. That\u2019s why the prime minister is very, very keen to ensure we continue to pursue the domestic agenda she set out on the steps of Downing Street when she first became prime minister. We must not neglect the domestic agenda, precisely so we\u2019ve got an offer, we can show we are making life better for many groups of people, among whom are young people.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u2018I\u2019m not a quitter\u2019\u000a\u000aThe prospect of May leading the Conservative Party into the next general election looked remote in the weeks following the calamitous ballot in June. But the prime minister has steadily rebuilt her authority since then, before finally declaring during a visit to Japan last week that she intends to remain in Downing Street for the long haul. \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter,\u201d she said. Asked if that meant she wanted to lead the Conservatives into another election she replied: \u201cYes, I\u2019m in this for the long term.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked if he shared the prime minister\u2019s desire to stay in place for another five years, in defiance of a significant chunk of Conservative MPs, Green said: \u201cYes, I think Theresa is doing what is a very difficult job extremely well and I would like to see her continue to do this for many years.\u201d Asked if he thought she would actually fight the next election, due in 2022, Green replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen, 61, who campaigned for Remain in the Brexit referendum, is one of May\u2019s oldest political allies, with a friendship that goes back to their time at Oxford University, where he served as president of the Oxford Union in 1977. His then girlfriend, Alicia Collinson, was the tutorial partner of the now prime minister, then Theresa Brasier.\u000a\u000aGreen admitted the result of the last election had \u201cchanged the political situation,\u201d but insisted it did not mean the prime minister\u2019s domestic policy agenda needed to be junked in its entirety.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe still have the same issues that were facing the government before the election, we\u2019ve still got basically two big tasks, [implement Brexit] successfully and pursue the prime minister\u2019s domestic agenda, because it\u2019s easy in weeks where Brexit has dominated for people to forget that.\u000a\u000a\u201c[What\u2019s] really important is to make sure we don\u2019t lose our domestic focus. This is not just a government about Brexit, it\u2019s a government with a big domestic agenda as well, and a lot of what you will see in the coming months will stem from that domestic agenda.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a good exercise for government to think what can we do other than pass laws\u201d \u2014 Damian Green\u000a\u000aGreen said there would be \u201cbig meaty domestic issues to get to grips with\u201d on top of Brexit. However, he said the reforms the prime minister wants would not all come through new legislation because there was no government majority.\u000a\u000aTwo senior Whitehall officials from other departments told POLITICO they have been asked to consider how best to enact reforms without legislation. \u201cWe were told to use our imagination,\u201d one said. \u201cNot all reform means changing the law.\u201d\u000a\u000aGreen said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do things which require legislation then you have to take a cool look at the [parliamentary] arithmetic, but there\u2019s lots you can do.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have a parliamentary majority in those areas where we have agreement with the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] parliamentary group. But also, there\u2019s a lot you can do elsewhere. For instance, some of the industrial strategy stuff \u2014 a lot of it doesn\u2019t require parliamentary legislation,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a good exercise for government to think what can we do other than pass laws.\u201d

aVChief of staff John Kelly\u2019s no-nonsense deputy, Kirstjen Nielsen, has been working in the White House for only five weeks.\u000a\u000aBut in her short tenure, the new sheriff\u2019s No. 2 has already helped set a new tone in the West Wing that was described by more than 10 senior administration officials and outside advisers to the president as one that can be dismissive and lacking in collegiality. These people worry that Nielsen \u2014 who now occupies former chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s old office \u2014 is at risk of squandering the morale boost that accompanied the arrival of the four-star general and the hope for a fresh start.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aNielsen, who served as Kelly\u2019s chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security before moving with him to the West Wing, routinely cancels meetings with senior officials if someone shows up late, multiple aides said. Phone calls often go unreturned.\u000a\u000aAnd she controls time with Kelly the same way Kelly is seeking to control time with President Donald Trump \u2014 staffers who linger too long in the chief of staff\u2019s office are interrupted and hurried along.\u000a\u000a\u201cGatekeepers are generally not beloved,\u201d said Jonathan Hoffman, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, who was hired by Nielsen. \u201cBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s an important job.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of Trump\u2019s top aides said they have been eager to fall in line with Kelly\u2019s new, more disciplined structure, and still express great admiration for the general, who replaced former chief of staff Reince Priebus in late July. But they said they have been disappointed by an \u201cus v. them\u201d attitude from his deputy, and a sense that she has been brought in to \u201cclean up all the messes.\u201d And while Kelly has managed to control the information flow to the Oval Office and won the confidence of the president, the growing frustration shows that work still needs to be done to put together a happy, supportive team.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

But Nielsen has been greeted by an especially vociferous backlash from a group of people who say they are not simply bridling at a new structure. Some Trump loyalists even refer to Nielsen behind her back as \u201cNurse Ratched,\u201d a reference to the malevolent head nurse in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d who coldly presides over a mental hospital.\u000a\u000aOthers compare the walls she has tried to erect around Kelly to the dynamic between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his top gatekeeper at the State Department, Margaret Peterlin, who controls all access to the secretary.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt Homeland, she actively ensured that no Trump supporters were appointed or hired,\u201d said political operative Roger Stone, one of Trump\u2019s earliest advisers. \u201cLike [national security adviser H.R.] McMaster and Kelly, she is a neocon who likely did not vote for Donald Trump and certainly does not support his non-interventionist worldview. If the president fails, it will be because of appointments like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s not only the hard-right Trump advisers who are frustrated. Senior administration officials who described themselves as cheering for the Kelly regime to succeed have been disappointed by what they see as a lack of communication with other senior aides, and a lack of respect for staffers who predated her.\u000a\u000aNielsen\u2019s defenders chalked up the criticism to a discomfort with change, and said they expect it to pass. \u201cKirstjen is a great addition to the White House and has been helpful in bringing fresh perspective and new structure to the team,\u201d said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\u000a\u000aNielsen\u2019s first impression in the West Wing stands in contrast to how she was viewed in her old life, as a trusted national security and cyber expert. An alum of the George W. Bush administration, where she served on the White House Homeland Security Council, Nielsen in recent years has advised government officials abroad and at home, as well as private sector CEOs, on infrastructure protection, including cyber security.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a political person by nature,\u201d said Frank Cilluffo, director of the Center for Cyber & Homeland Security at George Washington University, where Nielsen served until recently as a senior fellow. \u201cShe\u2019s very competent and thoughtful. I\u2019m not sure what the right training grounds are for anyone in these sorts of jobs, but she\u2019s solid. She\u2019s a wonk at heart, and she\u2019s there to serve.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of Nielsen\u2019s former colleagues describe her as one of the hardest-working people they ever met. That was part of what impressed Kelly about her during the transition, when Nielsen volunteered to help oversee the confirmation process for Kelly, the incoming secretary of homeland security. The back-to-back late nights caught up with her and she fell ill, coughing so hard that she cracked a rib.\u000a\u000aInstead of taking time off, however, Nielsen showed up to work with a bandage wrapped around her torso, to control the acute pain in her rib cage. \u201cShe got patched up and kept going,\u201d recalled Thad Bingel, a DHS veteran who volunteered alongside Nielsen on the Trump transition team. \u201cIf you\u2019re a guy who came up through the Marine Corps, like Kelly, you\u2019re impressed with that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe painful rib incident, colleagues said, was part of why Kelly put his faith in the hard-working \u201csherpa\u201d behind his smooth confirmation process \u2014 plus the fact she got results. Kelly, alongside retired Gen. James Mattis, were the only two Cabinet secretaries sworn in on Inauguration Day.\u000a\u000aBut while she has the backing of Kelly, so far she has established no personal relationship with the president \u2014 an oversight that longtime Trump world advisers describe as a major misunderstanding of how the structure around him functions, where all power ultimately emanates from him.\u000a\u000aWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway, a veteran of Trump world, said she disagreed with that categorization of the new enforcer\u2019s enforcer. \u201cShe\u2019s hardly parachuted into the White House uninitiated,\u201d Conway said. \u201cShe\u2019s been the chief\u2019s chief at DHS for the first six months of this administration, when many of the major issues, like the travel ban, wall construction, ICE, FEMA and DACA, were running through that Cabinet department.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe added that Nielsen \u201cneither expected nor sought her new position, but not unlike her immediate boss, Kelly, she is motivated by duty, honor and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, much of the early criticism directed at Nielsen is inherent in the difficult position she has been thrust into. A White House chief of staff functions essentially as a principal, making his deputy a de facto chief, a proxy in meetings, his eyes and ears on the ground.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s easier to train your ire on her than on a four-star general,\u201d one White House official said. \u201cHer boss is often with our boss. She\u2019s left managing the store, she\u2019s left telling people \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSome Trump veterans compared the dynamic to the one that ultimately drove Katie Walsh, Priebus\u2019 deputy who colleagues described as \u201caffably no-nonsense,\u201d out of the White House after 60 days on the job. The difference is that Kelly has empowered Nielsen, where Priebus would often undercut Walsh, in an attempt to hold on to his own job \u2014 an ultimately doomed effort.\u000a\u000aFor now, it\u2019s not only staffers who are pushing back against the tone and tenor of the new regime. Despite the new controls on his time and schedule, Trump has still spoken to his old advisers, like Priebus and Bannon. Longtime friends can still connect with him through the White House switchboard. The president even phoned his former aide Sebastian Gorka after his departure, according to someone familiar with the exchange, to express his thanks and hope for his support from the outside.\u000a\u000aBut people close to the administration said Trump is eager to make the new situation work and knows that change is necessary, even if it's not the free-flowing, open-door structure he transplanted from Trump Tower to the Oval Office. Trump has great faith in Kelly, aides said, who has great faith in his team. Plus, the president \u201cis aware of public perception,\u201d one ally said. \u201cAnd that perception is that if he fires them, something is wrong with him, not them.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVPARIS \u2014 If Emmanuel Macron was worried about his nosediving popularity, he ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u000a\u000aAs his government prepares to unveil a far-reaching overhaul of labor rules on Thursday, the far left and trade unions are preparing to fight back with nationwide street protests throughout September.\u000a\u000aThe looming showdown over workers\u2019 rights in a country where they are revered by much of the left is set to be the biggest test yet of Macron\u2019s authority and determination, at a time when his popularity is plummeting.\u000a\u000aThe big question is: Will Macron be able to resist the onslaught and fulfill his promise to make the French economy competitive again? Or will he follow generations of his predecessors who balked when the going got tough?\u000a\u000aWhile the exact contents of the overhaul are being kept a secret, a trade union boss who didn\u2019t wish to be named said they would deliver \u201cthe most profound overhaul\u201d of France\u2019s 3,492-page labor code \u201csince World War II.\u201d He added that most unions were waiting to see the published decrees before deciding how to react, and that the hardline CGT union risked being isolated in its complete opposition to the reforms.\u000a\u000aAsked Wednesday about the president\u2019s commitment to reform in the face of stiffening opposition, government spokesman Christopher Castaner said: \u201cAfter the final round of the presidential election, Emmanuel Macron told me \u2018We have won the right to take risks.'\u201d\u000a\u000aHe added: \u201cDo you think he is the type of person to change his approach based on polling? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u000a\u000aMacron will face stiffer headwinds than ever before. Failure could come in many forms, particularly if he bows to pressure and waters down his reforms.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got our backs against the wall,\u201d said Pierre Gattaz, head of France\u2019s main employers\u2019 lobby, MEDEF. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that the government\u2019s hand not tremble \u2026 and that there not be 1,000 counter-parties, 1,000 restrictions, 1,000 exceptions.\u201d\u000a\u000aStreets of rage\u000a\u000aMacron has one major advantage when taking on the doubters: He can rely on firm support from the lower house of parliament, where his centrist La République en Marche party commands an absolute majority.\u000a\u000aThe labor code changes, to be presented by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe and Labor Minister Muriel Pénicaud on Thursday, do not require approval by parliament, though they will need to be signed off on by France\u2019s Constitutional Court.\u000a\u000aFrom a legislative standpoint, almost nothing stands in Macron\u2019s way. And poll scores will not change the fact that his MPs control parliament, no matter how low they go.\u000a\u000aYet the normally bullish president showed a rare flash of self-doubt while in Bucharest last week when he declared that France was \u201cunreformable,\u201d in comments that critics said betrayed misgivings about his chances of success. Macron, who made the unusually strong remarks when speaking to Romania\u2019s French community, added that the French \u201chated reform\u201d and the only way to change the country was to do so while leading the European Union into a new phase of integration.\u000a\u000aFrom the start of the labor reform process, government negotiators took pains to keep the talks secret, striking a deal with unions not to leak working documents. Government met with unions some 100 times, although they often held separate meetings with them to discuss the same topics. The five unions involved mostly toed the line, although the CGT said early on that it opposed the spirit of the changes, with chief Philippe Martinez adding in August that the reform was a \u201clie\u201d by the state.\u000a\u000aWhen a leaked document ended up in left-leaning daily Libération, the labor ministry launched legal action, later withdrawn, against the author of the leak (known merely as \u201cX\u201d in the lawsuit).\u000a\u000aMacron\u2019s government was keen to avoid labor talks overshadowing its broader legislative agenda, namely a law on ethics for lawmakers. It also wanted to avoid fueling opposition from the far-left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, or even from far-right leader Marine Le Pen, both of whom now have seats in parliament. Mélenchon in particular has a chance to prove his political clout by attracting big crowds to protests, although he has opted not to join forces with unions.\u000a\u000aIf Macron and his team are circumspect, it\u2019s because they understand how explosive the topic of labor reform is. Few subjects are more contentious in France and street movements are a formidable force that crushes reforms and brings down governments.\u000a\u000aMacron may be France\u2019s youngest leader in more than a century, but he was an 18-year-old student when national strikes brought down the government of then-prime minister Alain Juppé, burying his attempt to reform the pension system. Macron was 29 when a national student uprising against a proposed \u201cfirst job\u201d contract cowed then-prime minister Dominique de Villepin. He was 37 and serving under François Hollande as economy minister when his boss burned through any remaining political capital he had in order to pass a labor reform, since derided as pointless, after weeks of protests.\u000a\u000a\u201cI view them with respect,\u201d said Castaner when asked about the upcoming protests. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to explain the benefits of this reform.\u201d\u000a\u000aIf they fail to do so, negative opinions of Macron and his agenda will keep piling up, and more people will turn out to protest. Macron will not lose his job, and Prime Minister Philippe is unlikely to do so either. But they could lose their zeal to reform.\u000a\u000aDeath by a thousand cuts\u000a\u000aIn the short term, a greater fear among those who invest in France is that Macron will compromise the substance of his reforms in ways that will ultimately render them toothless.\u000a\u000aAccording to the trade union boss, the labor code changes will allow unions and companies to negotiate most working conditions at the company or factory level, as opposed to that work being done on a sector-by-sector level, as is currently the case.\u000a\u000aThat would bring French labor laws closer to current standards in Germany or Sweden, for example, while depriving hard-line unions of much of their national negotiating power.\u000a\u000aAnother expected big change is the creation of a set scale for severance pay after dismissal. Currently, there is no way to predict how much a dismissal will cost once it goes to arbitration. A fixed scale would make the process more predictable.\u000a\u000aOn both fronts, Macron\u2019s government could quietly give ground in ways that would drain the reform of its value. By accepting that some topics, such as the maximum length of the working week, would remain the subject of sectoral negotiations, they would undermine their plans to bring in greater flexibility. By scrapping the severance pay scale, they would sacrifice the predictability desired by investors.\u000a\u000aStarting on Thursday, Macron\u2019s government has a month during which it can revise its executive decrees before they are sent to the Constitutional Court for final approval. The intensity of the protests will likely determine the government\u2019s willingness to cede ground.\u000a\u000aOne point in Macron\u2019s favor: The front against him is divided, with Mélenchon\u2019s troops protesting on September 23, 11 days after the CGT trade union, and other unions so far undecided on whether to join in.

aVPoliticians in Brussels are both the biggest cheerleaders and staunchest foes of constant connectivity.\u000a\u000aEU officials have repeatedly touted the benefits of high-speed mobile internet in a series of recent policy documents. But just a mile down the road from European Commission headquarters, the Brussels regional government has for years hampered the rollout of new mobile network technology amid health concerns about radiation exposure.\u000a\u000aWith the dawn of the Internet of Things, taking all kinds of gadgets and even cars online, telecoms players in Belgium\u2019s various levels of government are under pressure to sort out their differences.\u000a\u000a\u201cBrussels risks becoming a medieval island in a digital Europe,\u201d said Alexander De Croo, digital minister and vice prime minister in Belgium\u2019s federal government.\u000a\u000aA lack of connectivity already causes problems in both day-to-day life and for security services in responding to crises. What\u2019s more, EU officials have bet their political capital on the successful rollout of 5G, the next-generation mobile technology.\u000a\u000aBrussels\u2019 environmental norms for radiation are 50 times stricter than the standards set by an international commission under the World Health Organization.\u000a\u000aA decade ago, Brussels\u2019 local lawmakers instituted strict environmental limits on the mobile telecoms-related radiation levels across town. This angered telecoms executives, who lashed out at what they think is an outdated policy. Telecoms services delayed investing in stronger wireless mobile coverage and Brussels was late in adopting the current 4G technology.\u000a\u000aIn Europe\u2019s capital, seat of the EU institutions, there\u2019s little case for investing in more powerful technology, according to telecoms companies.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday, we estimate that [5G] won\u2019t be possible [in Brussels],\u201d said Coralie Miserque, a spokeswoman for Telenet, one of Belgium\u2019s two dominant telecoms operators. \u201cWe have to adapt our network \u2026 [but it\u2019s] already saturated.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Commission\u2019s 5G action plan calls for early adoptions as soon as next year and large-scale market roll-out by 2020. New high-speed mobile internet networks are being tested across the world, and Europe wants to catch up with pioneering countries such as South Korea, China, and the U.S.\u000a\u000aJust last month, national telecoms ministers from across Europe agreed to \u201cposition Europe as the global lead market for 5G.\u201d\u000a\u000aWithout more bandwidth, the new technology can\u2019t be rolled out in Brussels. \u201cIf we want to be a digital capital, this is impossible,\u201d Miserque said.\u000a\u000aGetting online\u000a\u000aBrussels\u2019 environmental norms for radiation are 50 times stricter than the standards set by an international commission under the World Health Organization. Telecoms companies\u2019 own estimates say they are among the strictest in the world.\u000a\u000aThis leads to bad connections across town because the networks aren\u2019t allowed to broadcast sufficiently powerful signals to ensure a steady connection. For example, mobile internet is often cut when walking alongside the Commission\u2019s Berlaymont headquarters.\u000a\u000aIn past reports, the country\u2019s telecoms regulator has flagged that the Brussels\u2019 telecoms radiation limits force Belgian consumers to have worse internet connections at higher prices.\u000a\u000aOn March 22, 2016, when terrorists struck Brussels\u2019 airport and metro, killing 32 people and injuring hundreds, cell towers couldn\u2019t handle the traffic, leaving many unable to call or text. National politicians blamed Brussels\u2019 radiation standards for the weak wireless coverage.\u000a\u000aDuring the attacks, one operator, Base, ignored the radiation limits when its network overheated. It later nudged policymakers to address the issue of capacity in times of crisis, but the Brussels government pushed back when requests were made to relax the limits more widely.\u000a\u000aA year-and-a-half later, telecoms operators and security services struck a political deal to breach radiation limits in times of crisis. They remain the same the rest of the time.\u000a\u000aPolitical decision\u000a\u000aSome suggest that Brussels\u2019 limits are more a result of politics than health concerns.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe right norm \u2014 that\u2019s not something that\u2019s clear-cut. It\u2019s a political decision,\u201d said Guy Vandenbosch, a professor in telecoms technologies at the Catholic University Leuven.\u000a\u000aSo far, the current ruling coalition of Socialist, Liberal and centrist parties hasn\u2019t tabled any legislation to amend the rules.\u000a\u000aThe limits date back to laws introduced in 2007 and 2009, the legacy of two consecutive coalition governments that included Green parties that pushed heavily for strict environmental controls.\u000a\u000aThey have been challenged before Belgium\u2019s Constitutional Court by none other than the country\u2019s federal government, among other legal institutions, as well as by telecoms operators. But this has failed to bring down the laws.\u000a\u000aSo far, the current ruling coalition of Socialist, Liberal and centrist parties hasn\u2019t tabled any legislation to amend the rules. Brussels Environment Minister Céline Fremault did not respond to POLITICO\u2019s questions in time for publication.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Vandenbosch noted that the experts\u2019 views on the health risks of mobile-network radiation levels are nuanced.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere have been plenty of studies on the effects of [telecoms] radiation, but no immediate effects and almost no mid-term effects have been found,\u201d he said. The long-term effects are still unknown.\u000a\u000aIn practice, this means the Brussels government opted for limits that scientists dub are \u201cas low as technically achievable,\u201d Vandenbosch said.\u000a\u000a\u201cLawmakers, without fully realizing it, followed this principle,\u201d said Vandenbosch, adding that, as far as health is concerned, \u201cthat\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u201d

aVPolitics took a back seat this week as Hurricane Harvey devastated southeastern Texas, dropping more than 50 inches of rain in some locations and killing more than three dozen people. Officials are just beginning to assess the damage inflicted by the storm, which is expected to total in the tens of billions of dollars and will further complicate a crowded legislative agenda this September.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s week was subdued, by his standard. He visited Texas on Tuesday, though avoided the afflicted regions where recovery efforts are ongoing, and then began his public push for tax reform with a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, tough on Congress but light on details.\u000a\u000aBeyond the West Wing, most government agencies were focused on Harvey, dedicating resources and manpower to assist in the recovery efforts. There just wasn\u2019t much time to finalize and roll out new policies. But it wasn\u2019t all quiet, as agencies from the Department of Justice to Department of Labor managed to issue some real policy changes that didn\u2019t get much attention behind the flood news. Here\u2019s how Trump changed policy this week:\u000a\u000a1. Police can buy military equipment again\u000a\u000aIn August, 2014, after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, looked something like a war zone as protesters set fires and police responded with camo-clad snipers and armored vehicles the result of a decades-long program allowing local law enforcement agencies to receive surplus military equipment.\u000a\u000aThe controversial image of police rolling in on their own citizens like an army roused Obama into action. Nine months later, his administration prohibited the transfer of certain equipment, such as grenade launchers and armored vehicles, to local police departments and limited the transfer of other items such as drones, riot gear and explosives. Such equipment, the administration determined, didn\u2019t serve a purpose for local law enforcement agencies. "Some equipment made for the battlefield is not appropriate for local police departments,\u201d Obama said.\u000a\u000aOn Monday, Trump rescinded the Obama-era executive order limiting the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Now police departments can again buy previously restricted guns, ammunition, and riot gear, as well as other military-style equipment like grenade launchers, according to a Department of Justice fact sheet. The changes are a victory for local law enforcement agencies that believe the equipment helps keep their officers\u2014and the public\u2014safe. But it was sharply criticized by civil liberties groups and even received some pushback from Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul. \u201cIt is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime,\u201d Paul said, \u201cbut it is another for them to subsidize militarization.\u201d\u000a\u000a2. Trump nixes an Obama policy to reduce pay discrimination\u000a\u000aLast year, the Obama administration made a final attempt to reduce the racial and gender pay gaps, finalizing changes to a form\u2014the EEO-1\u2014that requires employers to report workplace demographics. Under the revised form, employers with more than 100 workers would have to report pay data by race, ethnicity and gender. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency responsible for the form changes, could have then used the data to launch an investigation into discrimination. The changes were set to take effect March 2018.\u000a\u000aBut this week, the White House directed the EEOC to stop the changes and instead use the original EEO-1 form, saying the changes \u201clack practical utility, are unnecessarily burdensome, and do not adequately address privacy and confidentiality issues.\u201d Labor and civil rights groups criticized the roll-back, arguing that the new form was a crucial means to get employers to address continued unfair pay disparities. Business groups praised the move, saying the form changes created an unnecessary paperwork burden that would ultimately hurt growth and wages.\u000a\u000a3. The fiduciary standard gets delayed for more than a year\u000a\u000aOne of Obama\u2019s final financial reforms was the \u201cfiduciary standard,\u201d a dry-sounding policy that essentially means stockbrokers can\u2019t put their own interests ahead of their clients\u2019. In May, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta announced in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he would let the fiduciary standard take effect as planned on June 9. But that wasn\u2019t the full story: Only some parts of the rule, which requires financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, took effect on that date; the rest of the rule takes effect on January 1, and it quickly became clear that Acosta wasn\u2019t going to let that happen.\u000a\u000aFirst, at the end of June, he asked for information from the public about changing the law. Then, this week, the DOL published a proposed rule delaying the effective date 18 months, until July 1, 2019. This wasn\u2019t a surprise: in a court filing earlier this month, the agency said it had proposed an 18-month delay. This is just a proposed rule, so the agency must still accept comments and issue a final regulation. But it\u2019s clear that Acosta intends to delay, and likely substantively reform, the fiduciary rule. In the meantime, the agency said earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t actually enforce the portions of the rule that took effect in June\u2014meaning, in effect, the rule has now been mostly mothballed.\u000a\u000a4. Trump\u2019s trade fights with Canada continue\u000a\u000aDuring his presidential campaign, Trump railed against China\u2019s trade practices\u2014but he hasn\u2019t done much to improve them since taking office, breaking his promise to name Beijing a currency manipulator and delaying investigations into steel imports from China. Instead, he has targeted a friendly country much closer to home: Canada. He has, for example, reopened NAFTA negotiations with Canada and Mexico and imposed duties on certain Canadian products, including lumber.\u000a\u000aThis week, the trade fight with Canada took a bit of a surprising turn when the Commerce Department delayed preliminary antidumping duties on certain Canadian lumber companies to give the two countries additional time to negotiate a settlement. In effect, the delay temporarily lifts the 7 percent to 8 percent duties that Commerce had imposed earlier this summer. The agency must make a final determination on the duties by November 14. In less surprising news, on Thursday, Commerce opened an investigation into certain types of Canadian paper, the first step toward imposing penalties for unfair trade practices.\u000a\u000aNeither of these trade moves is especially important to the economy, but they are additional evidence that Trump\u2019s trade agenda, so far, is far softer than the bombastic threats he leveled on the campaign trail. Together with his limited actions against Chinese trade policy, his agenda appears almost \u2026 conventional.\u000a\u000a5. The diplomatic rift with Russia continues\u000a\u000aTrump entered office hoping to improve relations with Russia, saying it was \u201cabsolutely possible\u201d to ease tensions with Moscow. But the relationship has only spiraled downward as Trump has faced multiple investigations into potential collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. Things are only getting worse: After Trump reluctantly signed into law new sanctions against Russia, President Vladimir Putin reacted angrily, ordering the U.S. to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia by 755 people.\u000a\u000aThis week, the Trump administration responded by forcing Russia to close three diplomatic compounds, located in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. The State Department, in announcing the retaliation, issued a sharply worded statement, saying the initial Russian action was \u201cunwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries.\u201d The move is just the latest sign that Moscow and Washington aren't on better terms, even with Trump in the White House.

aV\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDolores Huerta, the famed labor leader who marched with Cesar Chavez and coined his rallying cry, is still mad as hell\u2014and she was spitting fire when I asked her about President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to stop protecting undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as kids.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis is a step up above slavery,\u201d Huerta said in the latest episode of POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast. \u201cThe Republican plan is to deport all of the people that you have here that are undocumented, and bring in folks here under foreign labor contracts.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aShe doesn\u2019t much care, either, whether the president is personally a racist\u2014it\u2019s enough that Trump engages in racist rhetoric, in her reckoning, and \u201cgives license to all the racism that already exists in the United States of America.\u201d She ticks off ideas he\u2019s considering or already enacting: Extending provisions for contract workers, who come in for labor without rights. The border wall. Accelerated deportations. And now Trump is going after the 800,000 people who signed up for two-year work permits under President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, Huerta said, Trump and other wealthy people like him benefit more than anybody from the sweat of immigrant labor without ever appreciating it.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it\u2019s mean. I think that he\u2019s got this obsession, a fixation, against people of color. You know, the way that he keeps attacking Mexicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a Mexican-American. And my great-grandparents were here before his were, I\u2019m sure. And his grandfather came from Germany.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn Trump, Huerta, 87, sees everything she\u2019s been fighting since the 1950s. The exploitation and discrimination is just clearer now, she said. In a lifetime in activism that stretches back to her time as Chavez\u2019s forgotten partner organizing farmworkers in the 1960s, Huerta\u2019s had a knack for saying things that stick, from when she first came up with \u201cSi Se Puede\u201d by chance as part of a heated conversation with organizers in Arizona in 1972, to when she set off a media explosion in 2006 by telling an Arizona high school, \u201cRepublicans hate Latinos.\u201d\u000a\u000aLooking at the president and the politics he\u2019s encouraging, Huerta quotes Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset on power going to the greedy and powerful, and says America is \u201capproaching\u201d mob rule, exposing the racism, sexism and classism that she said she\u2019s been battling since she got her start in activism by joining the Community Service Organization in Stockton, California, in 1955.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe see that it\u2019s really very visible that people who before maybe were racist but didn\u2019t declare themselves as such now feel that they have license to do so,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the racism is so visible, because then this means that we have to do something about it.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo she\u2019s glad to see the marches, like the one planned for Tuesday to start in front of the White House and go to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement main office, starting a five-day hunger strike, or the many other protests expected across the country in the days ahead, building on the Women\u2019s March and others that have taken off since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think the \u201960s are back,\u201d Huerta said, not at all unhappily.\u000a\u000aClick here to subscribe and hear Huerta tell the full story of why she still feels guilt about not telling Bobby Kennedy he needed more security on the night he was shot and about the night how she came up with \u201cSi Se Puede!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHuerta is a singular figure in the history of American politics. A prominent female labor leader at a time when women were barely factors in the labor movement, she came later to the women\u2019s rights movement (though she came to embrace it). A central enough political force that she was standing at Bobby Kennedy\u2019s side in Los Angeles when he declared victory in the 1968 California primary minutes before he was assassinated, she\u2019s become almost anonymous in the decades since. (Chavez even usually gets the credit for Si Se Puede.)\u000a\u000aA mother of 11 who barely saw many of her children for sometimes years because of how much she threw herself into the organizing work, she\u2019s clearly frustrated by how she\u2019s been overlooked, how Chavez is a household name and hers is generally known only to those steeped in the lore of labor activism\u2019s heyday.\u000a\u000aTrying to recalibrate the record, Huerta has eagerly participated in a new movie about her life, \u201cDolores\u201d\u2014but in promoting it, she can\u2019t escape grappling with the present. That includes not only the present of Trump and his relationship with Latinos, but also the present of a labor movement in crisis. Membership has been dropping for decades, and now panic is setting in about how the Supreme Court will rule on laws restricting organizing for public-sector workers. Labor strategists who, a year ago, were well into plans for how they were going to try to nudge a President Hillary Clinton to the left are still catching up with how to approach a White House in which they have no real point of entry. Leaders find themselves less in touch with their members than they had thought, unable to explain how endorsements for Clinton from the top squared with so many members pulling the lever for Trump on Election Day, and unsure how to re-establish that bond. Members who wanted Clinton are depressed. Many fear that, for a labor movement in crisis, the future will be even worse.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, technology is automating job after job, the well-paying manufacturing work of yesteryear isn\u2019t coming back and, other than the death of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, America\u2019s trade policy remains the same approach that labor leaders have been decrying for decades. Huerta spoke of how she refuses to use the self-checkout line at CVS, but she knows that kind of quiet action is barely a drop within a drop, and that the real revolution that she wants isn\u2019t even close to happening.\u000a\u000aOn the contrary\u2014the upheaval and radicalism of the 1960s ended with Richard Nixon\u2019s election and presidency, in some parallel to the politics that elected Trump: beyond the most passionate supporters at the rallies, a quieter majority in enough states, many of them snapping back against cultural and economic elites they felt had disrespected and ignored their concerns.\u000a\u000aNixon, of course, was elected to two terms, which is more than many people with Huerta\u2019s politics can conceive is possible for Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cI love to quote the poet Pablo Neruda, who said, \u201cThey can cut all the flowers, but you can\u2019t hold back the spring,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do believe that we are the spring. We are the ones that are going to go forward. We\u2019re going to sow those seeds of justice, and they\u2019re going to sprout. And we\u2019re going to be a lot stronger.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis story tagged under: Immigration\u000a\u000aOff Message

aVU.S. efforts to penetrate reclusive North Korea have been so confounding for so long that the military likely doesn't have enough accurate intelligence to take out its nuclear and missile facilities even if President Donald Trump ordered it.\u000a\u000aTrump on Thursday declared anew that "military action would certainly be an option," one that would be "a very sad day for North Korea."\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000a"Is it inevitable? Nothing's inevitable," he said at a White House news conference, adding that he "would prefer not going the route of the military, but it's something certainly that could happen. Our military has never been stronger.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut because the so called Hermit Kingdom has long been one of the most impenetrable intelligence targets \u2014 the top U.S. spy earlier this year called it \u201cone of the hardest, if not the hardest" \u2014 there is low confidence airstrikes or other means of attack would successfully thwart its nuclear and missile ambitions without leaving significant elements of its arsenal for Pyongyang to retaliate with.\u000a\u000a"You don't want to stir the hornet's nest and the hornets are still there when you're done," said Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former National Security Council staffer for former President George H.W. Bush. "If you're giving options to the president ... one of the very first things we have to say is we can strike what we can see, but we don't know what we can't see.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000a"Generally speaking, I don't think it's overstating to say we're still groping in the dark," he added.\u000a\u000aThe difficulty collecting and interpreting intelligence on North Korea is one reason why different spy agencies often reach different conclusions about North Korea's capabilities \u2014 and have been caught off guard repeatedly, including reportedly by the test earlier this week of a thermonuclear bomb.\u000a\u000aIn 2013, for example, the Defense Intelligence Agency said it had "moderate confidence" that North Korea had developed a nuclear warhead that could be launched atop a ballistic missile. Shortly after, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper walked that back and said that the finding was not the consensus of the whole intelligence community.\u000a\u000aBut this summer, a military intelligence analysis of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs had to be revised, concluding Pyongyang could place an atomic bomb atop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States by the end of 2018 \u2014 two years sooner than previous estimates.\u000a\u000aWeeks later, other U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that North Korea has begun building missile-ready warheads.\u000a\u000aAnd on Sunday, North Korea's underground detonation of a nuclear weapon in the remote northeast of the country literally shook the region with what experts now say was a 140 kiloton blast \u2014 more powerful than its previous five tests combined.\u000a\u000aThe U.S. collects intelligence on foreign nations and terrorist groups primarily using human spies, electronic eavesdropping, cyber espionage and spy satellites. And each is especially difficult in North Korea for various reasons, say those with direct experience.\u000a\u000aOne is the lack of diplomatic or commercial relationships, said Bruce Klingner, who spent 20 years at the CIA and DIA before joining the Heritage Foundation.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t blend well into North Korea, and even South Korea has difficulty running agents, because of differences in dialect and pronunciation,\u201d Klingner said. \u201cAny strangers stand out, so in a country where people will report on their families and neighbors, certainly any stranger will get reported.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat means any human intelligence comes from North Korean defectors. There have been some but not many, and more often than not they have been individuals lacking direct knowledge of the regime's most sensitive inner workings.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPaal said defectors also will typically embellish the information they share to get better treatment and are often not reliable.\u000a\u000aAnd even the limited opportunities there are for human intelligence collection \u2014 considered crucial to gauging intent \u2014 are often unsatisfying.\u000a\u000a\u201cNorth Korea is probably the most restrictive human environment in the world. It\u2019s far more restrictive certainly than pre-war Syria or Iran, more restrictive than China or Burma,\u201d said Andrew Peek, a former Army intelligence officer and fellow at the Clements Center for National Security, a nonpartisan research center at the University of Texas at Austin. "I think we have less granularity on North Korea than we do on Syria or Iran. There\u2019s very little osmosis in or out.\u201d\u000a\u000aGathering intelligence through electronic means \u2014 in military parlance, signals intelligence \u2014 is also restricted because of the limited technology, internet access and cellphone use inside North Korea. And those who do use computer networks in North Korea, including government officials, use strong encryption.\u000a\u000a"Their broadband is extremely limited," Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, told a Senate panel in May. "So using that as an access to collection is \u2014 we get very limited results."\u000a\u000aThe same goes for other intelligence gathering tools, he said. "We get very limited results. We do not have constant, consistent [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] capabilities and so there are gaps, and the North Koreans know about these," Coats told the Armed Services Committee. "So it is \u2014 it becomes a difficult challenge relative to a society as closed and as isolated as North Korea is ..."\u000a\u000aUsing satellites to take photos is the most successful intelligence collection tactic in North Korea, experts say. But even that has limits.\u000a\u000aWhile imagery can help track military movements or analyze activity or test preparations at nuclear or missile sites, it provides an incomplete picture, Klingner said.\u000a\u000aSurveillance images are also difficult to collect because many North Korean military and storage facilities are located underground, both for security reasons and because the mountainous country lacks large open spaces.\u000a\u000aSuch terrain can also make it difficult to get multiple images of a facility from different vantage points, he said.\u000a\u000aA reminder of the difficulty tracking North Korea's secret military activities was the recent underground test of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb, which caught many observers by surprise.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe hardest part is confirming what they have done on the nuclear test side,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, who served as the senior director for arms control and nonproliferation on the National Security Council until January. \u201cAre they bluffing or not? That is because we don\u2019t have great links inside their nuclear test program, and they have gotten good at ensuring nothing leaks from their test site.\u201d\u000a\u000aOthers agreed that the fact so many of North Korea's missile and nuclear assets are underground in caves or tunnels shuts off many options that might otherwise be available to military planners.\u000a\u000a"I think the X factor to me is how much they have developed these underground complexes, and I would suspect deeply. We just have no sense of that," said Peek.\u000a\u000aIt all adds up to a relative blind spot for American and allied intelligence agencies.\u000a\u000a"If you look at the satellite picture of the lights at night from the satellite," Coats said in May, "there's one dark area with no lights on, and that's North Korea."\u000a\u000aBryan Bender contributed to this report.

aVAs political regulation in the U.K. has tightened, PR consultants are driven to ever more desperate business wherever they can find it | Franck Robichon/EPA Opinion Bell Pottinger scandal, sadly inevitable The scandal raises serious questions about the way Britain does business.\u000a\u000aLONDON \u2014 Many years ago, Tim Bell harangued me at a party over someone else\u2019s champagne for being industrial editor of the Observer, a newspaper that was unduly influenced, in his view, by the interests of Lonrho, the conglomerate that owned the paper in those days.\u000a\u000aTo be lectured by Bell on media ethics was worrying \u2014 a bit like being told by Oliver Reed that you drank too much. Fast forward to today and Bell\u2019s PR conglomerate, Bell Pottinger, is collapsing amid revelations that it campaigned for the continued \u201cexistence of economic apartheid\u201d in South Africa, on the payroll of the billionaire Gupta family, to keep President Jacob Zuma and his family in power.\u000a\u000aBut schadenfreude isn\u2019t enough. The bigger question here is how, in 2017, a U.K. PR firm can be charging £100,000 a month for, among other things, inciting racial hatred in a foreign sovereignty.\u000a\u000aBell may not have been directly involved in the South African campaign that has finally sunk the firm that has his name over the door. But he created the corporate climate in which it prospered.\u000a\u000aAnd that raises serious questions about the way Britain does business, especially at a time when we apparently want to open our own trading channels to the world, independent of the regulation of the European Union.\u000a\u000aWe need to decide what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re doing it and for whom it\u2019s beneficial. If the answer to the last of those is self-enrichment, then it\u2019s not enough.\u000a\u000aFor the past two decades, Bell made a seven-figure income out of the political-influence game. Clients famously included Margaret Thatcher and despots from Chile\u2019s Augusto Pinochet to Belarus\u2019 Alexander Lukashenko. Not to mention the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Asma, and arms dealer BAE, embroiled in a scandal over its dealings with the loathsome Saudi Arabian regime.\u000a\u000aThe PR industry has long operated on the taxi-rank principle, similar to the legal profession, that you take the next available client \u2014 however odious they may be \u2014 because everyone deserves professional representation, right? Well, no, as it turns out.\u000a\u000aTo my shame, I\u2019ve operated on that principle in the past (and I kept the money).\u000a\u000aBut here\u2019s the thing: As political regulation in the U.K. has tightened and as the media have atomized in the digital era, with the internal economies of newspaper groups collapsing as social media suck out the advertising revenues, the offer of consultative influence on behalf of clients becomes ever thinner. It has driven PR consultants to ever more desperate business wherever they can find it.\u000a\u000aSo it\u2019s a bit rich, frankly, for regulators at the PR Consultants Association to expel Bell Pottinger.\u000a\u000aNow, many of these people are my friends. I drink their wine in their country homes. I\u2019m a chaplain, if not father confessor, to some of them. But I hope they won\u2019t mind me saying that they look like a bunch of pimps throwing up their hands in horror at the moral turpitude of their highest-earning whore.\u000a\u000aThe flogging of influence is the same whether you\u2019re burnishing the reputation of a U.K. corporate client or that of Jacob Zuma \u2014 making boring people marginally less tedious happens to be a working definition for most of PR. But the financial rewards can be greater on Bell\u2019s side of the business. To coin an old phrase, we\u2019ve established what you are, we\u2019re just negotiating the price.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s why, after all, Bell Pottinger survived and prospered for so long, precisely because that\u2019s the professional model. It\u2019s just a question of degree.\u000a\u000aCollapsing industries always reveal the worst in themselves. But it\u2019s a governance issue, not one of regulation. We need to decide what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re doing it and for whom it\u2019s beneficial. If the answer to the last of those is self-enrichment, then it\u2019s not enough.\u000a\u000aIf the PR industry can\u2019t ask those questions of itself and receive the right answers, then \u2014 as in journalism \u2014 the state will step in. In his memoirs, published in 2014, Bell wrote: \u201c\u2026with each day that passes the state seems to take more control of our lives \u2026 [for some people] this may be desirable, but for me it is nothing short of catastrophic.\u201d\u000a\u000aHow right he has turned out to be, but not in the way he anticipated.\u000a\u000aGeorge Pitcher is a writer, Anglican priest and former spin doctor. His novel \u201cA Dark Nativity\u201d is published this autumn.

aVLONDON \u2014 Westminster\u2019s warren of corridors, plethora of pubs and cast of ambitious characters makes it the perfect stage for political plotting.\u000a\u000aBut it is also the backdrop to many a romantic liaison, where you might be surprised to discover that your lunch partner is more than familiar with the subject of your conversation.\u000a\u000aHere is POLITICO\u2019s guide to the Westminster power couples you need to know.\u000a\u000aTrue blue veterans\u000a\u000aBernard and Anne Jenkin\u000a\u000aThis pair met at the 1984 Conservative Party conference in Brighton \u2014 the year an IRA bomb was planted in an attempt assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\u000a\u000aBernard Jenkin\u2019s father, who was then in the Cabinet and had been staying in the Grand Hotel where the bomb went off, met his future daughter-in-law for the first time when the young romantics eventually found him in a nearby hotel for the evacuated.\u000a\u000aBernard Jenkin, an MP since 1992, is chairperson of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and on the pro-Brexit European Research Group steering committee. Anne Jenkin, who was given a seat in the House of Lords in 2011, leads the party\u2019s Women2Win offshoot, which she set up with Prime Minister Theresa May to boost the number of female Tory MPs in 2005.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: Walks on an Essex beach, seclusion away from public life, concerts, jobs about the house and entertaining are the couple\u2019s shared interests.\u000a\u000aGood stock: The pair both come from strong political pedigree. As well as Bernard Jenkin\u2019s Cabinet minister father, three of Anne Jenkin\u2019s grandparents were in the House of Lords, one was the only Tory woman elected as an MP in 1945. The Jenkins have two grown-up boys.\u000a\u000aGreat to be with @bernardjenkin and @GilesWatling in #Harwich to support 'This is Tendring' Britannia Ball for #RNLI pic.twitter.com/8NMo2F1etU \u2014 Anne Jenkin (@Baronessjenkin) June 30, 2017\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aResearcher romance\u000a\u000aNatalie Evans and James Wild\u000a\u000aLeader of the House of Lords Natalie Evans \u2014 the youngest member of May\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 does not work far from her Ministry of Defense special adviser husband, James Wild.\u000a\u000aLove blossomed in the economics section of the Conservative Research Department, when William Hague was leader of the opposition. Wild covered the Department of Trade and Industry, as it was then, and Evans the Treasury. Former Prime Minister David Cameron elevated Evans to the House of Lords after she led the New Schools Network charity, a job subsequently held by Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff Nick Timothy. Wild now advises U.K. Defense Secretary Michael Fallon.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: Keen cricketers, Wild and Evans always get to England test matches and both played in the recent Lords and Commons team against the Lashings Cricket Club (made up of former test cricketers). They also hold Norwich City Football Club season tickets in Norfolk, where Wild has family and stood unsuccessfully for North Norfolk in the snap election.\u000a\u000aFeline friend: Hetty, their cat, usually wakes the couple up before their early morning alarm clock.\u000a\u000aBrexit baby\u000a\u000aAndrea Jenkyns and Jack Lopresti\u000a\u000aAndrea Jenkyns first caught public attention when she defeated former Labour Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in his Morley and Outwood seat by a margin of just 422 votes in the 2015 general election. Once in Westminster, she met Jack Lopresti, the MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke, and the couple began dating later that year. The Sun carried pictures of the couple in matching elf jumpers at a staff party and reported that Lopresti was still married.\u000a\u000aBrexit baby: Their baby Clifford George was born on the day Article 50 was triggered \u2014 and his arrival was announced in the House of Commons.\u000a\u000aThrilled to announce that at 42, I am having a baby with my partner Jack. https://t.co/UMSrJLrwvb pic.twitter.com/AJPH4AY7FH \u2014 Andrea Jenkyns MP (@andreajenkyns) November 16, 2016\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWedded watchdogs\u000a\u000aRobert Chote and Sharon White\u000a\u000aRobert Chote and Sharon White each have a powerful watchdog to oversee. Chote marks the U.K. Treasury\u2019s homework at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), while White keeps Britain\u2019s telecoms, postal services and broadcast media in check at regulator Ofcom.\u000a\u000aWhite arrived at Ofcom via the British Embassy in Washington (where the couple married) and then Tony Blair\u2019s Downing Street. Chote began his career as a journalist at the Independent and Financial Times newspapers and headed the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank before taking the helm at the OBR.\u000a\u000aBrainiacs: The pair both studied economics at Cambridge, but met through a mutual friend two years after they left university.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: Talk is usually domestic practicalities at their home in Tufnell Park in north London. Most non-work time is spent ferrying their two children around, though they manage to get to the theater and concerts when they can.\u000a\u000aMinisterial matrimony\u000a\u000aMark Lancaster and Caroline Dinenage\u000a\u000aNot many newlyweds get personal congratulations in the House of Commons, but former Prime Minister David Cameron did just that when this pair of Tory MPs married in February 2014.\u000a\u000aBoth are part of the current government, Lancaster as a minister at the Ministry of Defense and Dinenage at the Department for Work and Pensions.\u000a\u000aTime apart: Constituency time is long-distance. They represent places that are 120 miles apart \u2014 Dinenage representing the south coast town of Gosport, while Lancaster is the MP for Milton Keynes North.\u000a\u000aPets and kids: The pair have three children between them from previous relationships, and three fish.\u000a\u000aLobby love\u000a\u000aPatrick Wintour and Rachel Sylvester\u000a\u000aWintour \u2014 former Guardian political editor and now the paper\u2019s diplomatic editor \u2014 met Sylvester \u2014 the Times columnist whose interview with Andrea Leadsom stalled the Brexiteer\u2019s leadership bid in the summer of 2016 \u2014 when they were both working for Sunday papers in the lobby.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: Sylvester told POLITICO they do talk about politics a bit at home because they both find it interesting. \u201cIt\u2019s not really talking shop, it\u2019s just talking about the world,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aChildren: The pair have four children between them, aged 22, 20, 13 and 10 (the older two are Sylvester\u2019s step-children), and two cats. They are currently engaged in a guerrilla war with foxes that are destroying their garden.\u000a\u000aSunday rivals\u000a\u000aJane Merrick and Toby Helm\u000a\u000aUntil Merrick went freelance two years ago, this pair were Sunday political editor rivals \u2014 Merrick at the Independent on Sunday and Helm at the Observer. They met in the lobby when Merrick was working at the Daily Mail and Helm was at the Telegraph.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: \u201cWe still talk about politics all the time,\u201d Merrick told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aIn the blood: Their seven-year-old daughter delighted in breaking the news to her classmates that the prime minister had just resigned after watching David Cameron\u2019s final speech from Downing Street over breakfast the day after the Brexit vote.\u000a\u000aLabour love\u000a\u000aJack Dromey and Harriet Harman\u000a\u000aEquality champion Harriet Harman describes in her autobiography, \u201cA Woman\u2019s Work,\u201d how she and Shadow Business Minister Dromey worked together in the mid-1970s in a back room at the Brent Law Centre in a space so small their two desks had to be pushed together. Harman was first elected in 1982 and went on to serve as solicitor general, minister for women and leader of the House of Commons, as well as two stints as leader of the opposition. Dromey, a trade unionist, has been MP for Birmingham Erdington since 2010.\u000a\u000aAhead of the times: The pair cohabited without being married in the days when it was thoroughly disapproved of. Harman wrote of her relationship: \u201cMy job and my partner was very different from what my parents hoped for me. I was working at a law center rather than in a respectable solicitors\u2019 practice. And Jack could not have been further from the professional middle-class husband they had envisaged.\u201d\u000a\u000aDowning Street devotion\u000a\u000aLizzie Loudon and Will Tanner\u000a\u000aLizzie Loudon, the prime minister\u2019s former press secretary, and Will Tanner, her former deputy head of policy, met during Theresa May\u2019s short-lived leadership campaign. They really got to know each other after May became prime minister while working at No. 10. Both have left Downing Street since the general election. Loudon is now a partner at political advisory group Hanbury Strategy while Tanner is chief policy adviser at Portland Communications.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: Loudon says they don\u2019t really talk about work at home, but share a common interest \u2014 and lots of friends \u2014 in politics so would naturally discuss what\u2019s going on in Westminster. The have just returned from a holiday in Sicily.\u000a\u000aNorthern Irish nuptials\u000a\u000aNigel and Diane Dodds\u000a\u000aLeader of the DUP in the House of Commons Nigel Dodds and MEP Diane Dodds met when Nigel was studying at the Institute of Professional Legal Studies at Queen\u2019s University in Belfast where Diane was a history undergraduate, according to an interview in the Belfast Telegraph.\u000a\u000aNot just a big name in Northern Ireland, Nigel Dodds is now a significant figure in the rest of the U.K. after his party did a deal with the Conservatives to keep Theresa May in power after she failed to secure a majority in the June snap election.\u000a\u000aChildren: The pair had three children, but their middle son, Andrew, sadly died. \u201cOur middle boy, Andrew, passed away aged eight in 1998. We believe strongly in God\u2019s providence \u2014 doors open and close along life\u2019s journey, which guide us in the direction God would have us go,\u201d Nigel Dodds told the Belfast Telegraph.\u000a\u000aWorlds collide\u000a\u000aPeter Dominiczak and Lottie Dexter\u000a\u000aDominiczak and Dexter met for a working lunch at Inn the Park in Regent\u2019s Park when he was the Daily Telegraph\u2019s political editor and she was special adviser to the then Business and Energy Minister Matt Hancock. Times have changed for the pair.\u000a\u000aDominiczak has left journalism and now works for Lynton Crosby\u2019s CTF Partners \u2014 the architect of election wins for former Prime Minister David Cameron, Boris Johnson\u2019s victory in his first London mayoral race in 2008 and Theresa May\u2019s less successful snap election campaign.\u000a\u000aFirst born: Dexter, who has been on maternity leave after having the pair\u2019s first son, Hector, will return to work for First Secretary of State Damian Green, now de facto deputy prime minister, in the new year.\u000a\u000aPolitical editor and Cameron\u2019s media guru\u000a\u000aTim Shipman and Charlotte Todman\u000a\u000aSunday Times Political Editor and \u201cAll Out War\u201d author Tim Shipman is married to David Cameron\u2019s former head of media operations Charlotte Todman. Pre-Cameron, Todman was personal assistant to his predecessor, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and also worked in Ed Miliband\u2019s private office at the Cabinet Office. She was head of events for the official Remain campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe, and is now a communications and campaigns consultant.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen I wrote a story [Todman] didn\u2019t like during the referendum I was made to sleep in the spare room for two nights,\u201d Shipman told POLITICO.\u000a\u000aNew York, New York: The pair met in a limousine in New York during the U.N. General Assembly in 2011, and again in the Red Lion pub five months later. They married in July 2015.\u000a\u000aAfter hours: The pair claim not to talk shop at home too much, and relax by seeing friends, watching TV box sets, going to comedy shows and the theater.\u000a\u000aHonorable mentions\u000a\u000aMatt Goshko, director of press at the U.S. Embassy, and Susannah Goshko, deputy director at the Department for Exiting the European Union.\u000a\u000aSpectator Political Editor James Forsyth and Allegra Stratton, former Newsnight political editor poached by ITV, are married.\u000a\u000aAssistant Editor of the Spectator Isabel Hardman and Labour MP John Woodcock are a notable Westminster item.\u000a\u000aLabour MP Stephen Kinnock is married to the former Danish prime minister, now CEO of Save the Children International Helle Thorning-Schmidt.\u000a\u000aExeter MP and former culture secretary Ben Bradshaw is married to BBC producer Neal Dalgleish.\u000a\u000aFormer Ed Miliband spokesperson James Stewart and Sky News Political Correspondent Tamara Cohen.\u000a\u000aMinister and member of the Johnson clan Jo Johnson and Guardian Social Affairs Editor Amelia Gentlemen are married.\u000a\u000aShadow Justice Minister Gloria De Piero is married to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson\u2019s director of communications, James Robinson.\u000a\u000aHome affairs committee chairperson Yvette Cooper and former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were the first ever married Cabinet minister couple.\u000a\u000aShadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman is married to shadow whip Nick Smith.\u000a\u000aBBC Westminster Hour presenter Carolyn Quinn and i newspaper Political Editor Nigel Morris are another example of lobby love.\u000a\u000aShadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth is married to Labour Party Executive Director Emilie Oldknow.\u000a\u000aThe Liberal Democrats\u2019 deputy leader Jo Swinson is married to former Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames, who is believed to be the first MP to take a baby through a voting lobby.\u000a\u000aJim Waterson, Buzzfeed political editor, and Jess Brammar, deputy editor at BBC Newsnight, are an item.\u000a\u000aSamana Haq, who will shortly be head of news at the Ministry of Justice after eight years in the lobby as ITV News Westminster news editor, married Carl Dinnen, ITV political correspondent, earlier this year.\u000a\u000aFormer Press Secretary to the Prince of Wales Mark Bolland is married to Guy Black, who sits in the House of Lords as Baron Black of Brentwood and is also executive director of the Telegraph Media Group.\u000a\u000aAlan Beith, who sits in the House of Lords as Lord Beith, is married to former president of the Liberal Democrats and fellow peer Diana Maddock.\u000a\u000aBenedict Brogan, former deputy editor of the Telegraph, now director of group public affairs at Lloyds Banking Group, is married to the Department for Communities and Local Government Permanent Secretary Melanie Dawes.\u000a\u000aConservative MP John Penrose is married to Cheltenham Racecourse board member and non-executive director of the Bank of England, Diana \u201cDido\u201d Harding, who sits in the House of Lords as Lady Harding of Winscombe.\u000a\u000aLabour MP Jon Cruddas is married to long-serving Labour Party special adviser Anna Healy, who was made a life peer in 2010 and sits in the House of Lords as Baroness Healy of Primrose Hill.

aVLately, Russia appears to be coming at the United States from all kinds of contradictory angles. Russian bots amplified Donald Trump during the campaign, but in office, Kremlin-backed media portray him as weak. Vladimir Putin is expelling U.S. diplomats from Russia, limiting options for warmer relations with the administration he wanted in place. As Congress pushes a harder line against Russia, plenty of headlines declare that Putin\u2019s gamble on Trump has failed.\u000a\u000aConfused? Only if you don\u2019t understand the Gerasimov Doctrine.\u000a\u000aIn February 2013, General Valery Gerasimov \u2014 Russia\u2019s chief of the General Staff, comparable to the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2014published a 2,000-word article, \u201cThe Value of Science is in the Foresight,\u201d in the weekly Russian trade paper Military-Industrial Kurier. Gerasimov took tactics developed by the Soviets, blended them with strategic military thinking about total war, and laid out a new theory of modern warfare \u2014 one that looks more like hacking an enemy\u2019s society than attacking it head-on. He wrote: \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness \u2026 All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey are not aiming to become stronger than us, but to weaken us until we are equivalent.\u000a\u000aThe article is considered by many to be the most useful articulation of Russia\u2019s modern strategy, a vision of total warfare that places politics and war within the same spectrum of activities\u2014philosophically, but also logistically. The approach is guerrilla, and waged on all fronts with a range of actors and tools \u2014 for example, hackers, media, businessmen, leaks and, yes, fake news, as well as conventional and asymmetric military means. Thanks to the internet and social media, the kinds of operations Soviet psy-ops teams once could only fantasize about \u2014 upending the domestic affairs of nations with information alone \u2014 are now plausible. The Gerasimov Doctrine builds a framework for these new tools, and declares that non-military tactics are not auxiliary to the use of force but the preferred way to win. That they are, in fact, the actual war. Chaos is the strategy the Kremlin pursues: Gerasimov specifies that the objective is to achieve an environment of permanent unrest and conflict within an enemy state.\u000a\u000aDoes it work? Former captive nations Georgia, Estonia and Lithuania all sounded the alarm in recent years about Russian attempts to influence their domestic politics and security, as the Obama administration downplayed concerns over a new Cold War. But all three countries now have parties with Russian financial connections leading their governments, which softly advocate for a more open approach to Moscow.\u000a\u000aIn Ukraine, Russia has been deploying the Gerasimov Doctrine for the past several years. During the 2014 protests there, the Kremlin supported extremists on both sides of the fight \u2014 pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian ultra-nationalists \u2014 fueling conflict that the Kremlin used as a pretext to seize Crimea and launch the war in eastern Ukraine. Add a heavy dose of information warfare, and this confusing environment \u2014 in which no one is sure of anybody\u2019s motives, and pretty much no one is a hero \u2014 is one in which the Kremlin can readily exert control. This is the Gerasimov Doctrine in the field.\u000a\u000aThe United States is the latest target. The Russian security state defines America as the primary adversary. The Russians know they can\u2019t compete head-to-head with us \u2014 economically, militarily, technologically \u2014 so they create new battlefields. They are not aiming to become stronger than us, but to weaken us until we are equivalent.\u000a\u000aRussia might not have hacked American voting machines, but by selectively amplifying targeted disinformation and misinformation on social media \u2014 sometimes using materials acquired by hacking \u2014 and forging de facto information alliances with certain groups in the United States, it arguably won a significant battle without most Americans realizing it ever took place. The U.S. electoral system is the heart of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, and now \u2014 thanks to Russian actions \u2014 we\u2019re locked in a national argument over its legitimacy. We\u2019re at war with ourselves, and the enemy never fired a physical shot. \u201cThe information space opens wide asymmetrical possibilities for reducing the fighting potential of the enemy,\u201d Gerasimov writes. (He also writes of using \u201cinternal opposition to create a permanently operating front through the entire territory of the enemy state.\u201d)\u000a\u000aNot all Russia-watchers agree on the Gerasimov Doctrine\u2019s importance. Some say this is simply a new and well-articulated version of what Russians have always done, or that Putin is inflated as an all-powerful boogeyman, or that competition among the various oligarchic factions within the Kremlin means there is no central strategic purpose to their activities. But there\u2019s no question that Russian intervention is systematic and multi-layered. This structure challenges us, because we don\u2019t necessarily understand how it has been put into practice; like all guerrilla doctrine, it prioritizes conservation of resources and decentralization, which makes it harder to detect and follow. And strategically, its goals aren\u2019t the ones we\u2019re used to talking about. The Kremlin isn\u2019t picking a winner; it\u2019s weakening the enemy and building an environment in which anyone but the Kremlin loses.\u000a\u000aHerein lies the real power of the Gerasimov-style shadow war: It\u2019s hard to muster resistance to an enemy you can\u2019t see, or aren\u2019t even sure is there. But it\u2019s not an all-powerful approach; the shadowy puppeteering at the heart of the Gerasimov Doctrine also makes it inherently fragile. Its tactics begin to fail when light is thrown onto how they work and what they aim to achieve. This requires leadership and clarity about the threat \u2014 which we saw briefly in France, when the government rallied to warn voters about Russian info ops in advance of the presidential election. For now, though, America is still in the dark \u2014 not even on defense, let alone offense.\u000a\u000aMolly K. McKew, an expert on information warfare, advises governments and political parties on foreign policy and strategic communications. She advised Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s government from 2009-2013, and former Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat in 2014-2015.

aVSo far, Nielsen has been overseeing who is supposed to attend what meetings, ensuring the right agencies and departments are looped in, and reviewing how different offices are structured.It\u2019s a job that by nature breeds enemies, not allies. But Nielsen has been greeted by an especially vociferous backlash from a group of people who say they are not simply bridling at a new structure. Some Trump loyalists even refer to Nielsen behind her back as \u201cNurse Ratched,\u201d a reference to the malevolent head nurse in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d who coldly presides over an insane asylum.\u000a\u000aOthers compare the walls she has tried to erect around Kelly to the dynamic between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his top gatekeeper at the State Department, Margaret Peterlin, who controls all access to the secretary.\u000a\u000a\u201cAt Homeland, she actively ensured that no Trump supporters were appointed or hired,\u201d said political operative Roger Stone, one of Trump\u2019s earliest advisers. \u201cLike [National Security Adviser H.R.] McMaster and Kelly, she is a neocon who likely did not vote for Donald Trump and certainly does not support his non-interventionist world view. If the president fails, it will be because of appointments like this.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s not only the hard-right Trump advisers who are frustrated. Senior administration officials who described themselves as cheering for the Kelly regime to succeed have been disappointed by what they see as a lack of communication with other senior aides, and a lack of respect for staffers who predated her.\u000a\u000aNielsen\u2019s defenders chalked the criticism up to a discomfort with change, and said they expect it to pass. \u201cKirstjen is a great addition to the White House and has been helpful in bringing fresh perspective and new structure to the team,\u201d said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\u000a\u000aNielsen\u2019s first impression in the West Wing stands in contrast to how she was viewed in her old life, as a trusted national security and cyber expert. An alum of the George W. Bush administration, where she served on the White House Homeland Security Council, Nielsen in recent years has advised government officials abroad and at home, as well as private sector CEOs, on infrastructure protection, including cyber security.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a political person by nature,\u201d said Frank Ciluffo, director of the Center for Cyber & Homeland Security at George Washington University, where Nielsen served until recently as a senior fellow. \u201cShe\u2019s very competent and thoughtful. I\u2019m not sure what the right training grounds are for anyone in these sorts of jobs, but she\u2019s solid. She\u2019s a wonk at heart, and she\u2019s there to serve.\u201d\u000a\u000aMany of Nielsen\u2019s former colleagues describe her as one of the hardest working people they ever met. That was part of what impressed Kelly about her during the transition, when Nielsen volunteered to help oversee the confirmation process for Kelly, the incoming Secretary of Homeland Security. The back-to-back late nights caught up with her and she fell ill, coughing so hard that she cracked a rib.\u000a\u000aInstead of taking time off, however, Nielsen showed up to work with a bandage wrapped around her torso, to control the acute pain in her rib cage. \u201cShe got patched up and kept going,\u201d recalled Thad Bingel, a Department of Homeland Security veteran who volunteered alongside Nielsen on the Trump transition team. \u201cIf you\u2019re a guy who came up through the Marine Corps, like Kelly, you\u2019re impressed with that.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe painful rib incident, colleagues said, was part of why Kelly put his faith in the hard-working \u201csherpa\u201d behind his smooth confirmation process \u2013 plus the fact that she got results. Kelly, alongside Gen. James Mattis, were the only two cabinet secretaries sworn in on Inauguration Day.\u000a\u000aBut while she has the backing of Kelly, so far she has established no personal relationship with the president \u2013 an oversight that longtime Trump world advisers describe as a major misunderstanding of how the structure around him functions, where all power ultimately emanates out from him.\u000a\u000aWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway, a veteran of Trump world, said she disagreed with that categorization of the new enforcer\u2019s enforcer. \u201cShe\u2019s hardly parachuted into the White House uninitiated,\u201d Conway said. \u201cShe\u2019s been the chief\u2019s chief at DHS for the first six months of this administration, when many of the major issues, like the travel ban, wall construction, ICE, FEMA and DACA, were running through that Cabinet department.\u201d\u000a\u000aShe added that Nielsen \u201cneither expected nor sought her new position, but not unlike her immediate boss, Kelly, she is motivated by duty, honor, and country.\u201d\u000a\u000aIndeed, much of the early criticism directed at Nielsen is inherent in the difficult position she has been thrust into. A White House chief of staff functions essentially as a principal, making his deputy a de facto chief, a proxy in meetings, his eyes and ears on the ground.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s easier to train your ire on her than on a four-star general,\u201d one White House official said. \u201cHer boss is often with our boss. She\u2019s left managing the store, she\u2019s left telling people \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aSome Trump veterans compared the dynamic to the one that ultimately drove Katie Walsh, Priebus\u2019 deputy who colleagues described as \u201caffably no-nonsense,\u201d out of the White House after 60 days on the job. The difference is that Kelly has empowered Nielsen, where Priebus would often undercut Walsh, in an attempt to hold on to his own job\u2014an ultimately doomed effort.\u000a\u000aFor now, it\u2019s not only staffers who are pushing back against the tone and tenor of the new regime. Despite the new controls on his time and his schedule, Trump has still spoken to his old advisers, like Priebus and Bannon. Longtime friends can still connect with him through the White House switchboard. The president even phoned his former aide Sebastian Gorka after his departure, according to someone familiar with the exchange, to express his thanks and hope for his support from the outside.\u000a\u000aBut people close to the administration said Trump is eager to make the new situation work and knows that change is necessary, even if it\u2019s not the free-flowing, open-door structure he transplanted from Trump Tower to the Oval Office. Trump has great faith in Kelly, aides said, who has great faith in his team. Plus, the president \u201cis aware of public perception,\u201d one ally said. \u201cAnd that perception is that if he fires them, something is wrong with him, not them.\u201d

aVNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's possible career as a sports broadcaster may not have panned out, but he might still have a shot at a television gig. Christie has had conversations with both MSNBC and CNN about possible contributor deals after his term ends, according to three sources with knowledge of the talks.\u000a\u000a"Yes. They are talking about a possible deal," an NBC source said. An NBC spokesperson declined to comment.\u000a\u000aCNN declined to comment.\u000a\u000aChristie is not in talks with Fox News, a separate source with knowledge of the situation said.\u000a\u000a"He's not really too far down with anything," another source with knowledge of the talks said, adding that Christie has been on the receiving end of a lot of interest from both television networks and other places, such as law firms.\u000a\u000aPart of the reason the talks haven't gotten more serious are New Jersey ethics rules, which prohibit Christie from getting too far in negotiations with the networks while in office.\u000a\u000aThe governor's spokesperson, Brian Murray, said he was "not going to discuss [Christie's] future plans." "He has not discussed publicly what he plans or wants to do," Murray added.\u000a\u000aChristie already tried his hand at another media gig -- sports radio host. Christie auditioned as the replacement for afternoon WFAN host Mike Francesa. But last month the New York Daily News reported Christie was no longer under consideration by WFAN, though Christie later said that it was he who declined the job.\u000a\u000aRelated: WFAN co-host Craig Carton arrested for alleged fraud\u000a\u000a"After considering the other options that I have been presented with for post-gubernatorial employment, I declined their request to do additional shows," Christie said in a statement last month. "I made station executives aware that while I would be happy to continue to fill in for (WFAN morning show co-host) Boomer Esiason when asked and when available, that they should no longer consider me as a candidate interested in any job at WFAN when I leave the Governorship. I made that clear to them prior to leaving for my family vacation two weeks ago."

aVProminent Democrats are increasingly riled by attacks from Bernie Sanders' supporters, whose demands for ideological purity are hurting the party ahead of the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential election, they say.\u000a\u000aBut it\u2019s not just the outside agitators that Democratic lawmakers, operatives and activists are annoyed with: They\u2019re tired of what they see as the Vermont senator\u2019s hesitance to confront his own backers, either in public or through back channels.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aTensions boiled over recently when a handful of Sanders loyalists bashed freshman Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 a rising star in the party and potential 2020 hopeful \u2014 as an establishment tool. Democrats were also rankled that other prominent Sanders allies said support for single-payer health care should be a litmus test for candidates.\u000a\u000aIn response, Democratic senators and outside groups have begun telling Sanders and friendly intermediaries that if he wants to be a leading figure for Democrats ahead of 2020\u2019s presidential election, he needs to get his supporters in line \u2014 or at least publicly disavow their more incendiary statements.\u000a\u000aThe confrontations, they insist, threaten party unity ahead of a critical midterm election cycle, when Democrats have a shot at winning the House and several governor\u2019s offices.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Democratic Party has treated Sen. Sanders exceptionally well. We collectively let him run in our primaries when he declared he wasn\u2019t a Democrat \u2014 I count that as a great favor, and an opportunity almost no one else has ever received,\u201d said former Democratic National Committee Chairman Don Fowler, who has called for the independent Sanders to formally join the party.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know what his intentions are in terms of the future,\u201d Fowler added, referring to the senator's willingness to corral his supporters. \u201cSen. Sanders has to make his own decisions about what\u2019s responsible to do."\u000a\u000aMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe mutual mistrust goes beyond the establishment vs. insurgent divide that defined 2016\u2019s presidential primary. Some Democrats from the progressive wing of the party agree that he needs to do more to rein in his supporters.\u000a\u000aIf Sanders intends to lead the party, said one Democratic operative who\u2019s worked with him, requesting to speak anonymously like many others for fear of reprisal from Sanders backers, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to wash your hands of all of this.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe complaints have largely gone unheeded by Sanders\u2019 camp. Many of the senator\u2019s closest allies insist such frustration simply reflects the same misunderstanding of Sanders\u2019 \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d Democrats have had since he first started running for president.\u000a\u000a\u201cBernie Sanders really does lead a movement, he doesn\u2019t run an organization. And movements are different from organizations,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a veteran Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Sanders' campaign. \u201cA movement operates organically and moves on its own. It can have leaders, but no one directs a movement.\u201d\u000a\u000aDemocrats' frustration about Sanders' unwillingness to confront his backers has intensified since it first emerged during the 2016 campaign.\u000a\u000aIn one of the most contentious moments, the candidate himself refused to condemn supporters in Nevada who revolted against Hillary Clinton's delegate win during that state party\u2019s May convention.\u000a\u000aMany Democrats are concerned that Sanders no longer has any control over the vast political network surrounding him after his 2016 campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, left the helm of Our Revolution in June. That national political organization, Sanders' post-campaign creation, is now led by former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, who was a strident supporter of the Vermonter and a Clinton critic in 2016.\u000a\u000aLast month, Democrats across Capitol Hill were quick to circulate a BuzzFeed report in which Turner called the DNC \u201cdictatorial\u201d and \u201cinsulting.\u201d They were concerned that a group with the reach of Our Revolution\u2019s could be doing significant damage to the party\u2019s efforts to re-engage with Sanders voters.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s a huge frustration. Senators roll their eyes and acknowledge it\u2019s one of the biggest threats to the Democratic Party, the division that they sow,\u201d said one senior Democratic Senate aide who has worked with Sanders' office. \u201cIt would be so helpful for him to be more forceful or forthright that this isn\u2019t the point of what his efforts were.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders, now a member of Senate Democrats\u2019 leadership team, never publicly condemned or endorsed Turner\u2019s remarks. People close to him say he views Our Revolution as a separate entity from the political team he controls. (Our Revolution\u2019s executive director, Shannon Jackson, is a former longtime Sanders aide.)\u000a\u000aFellow Democrats have employed a variety of tactics to try and relay their concern to Sanders, who is still learning how to play the inside game customarily expected of a party leader.\u000a\u000aJust as Turner was complaining about the DNC, a range of Democratic senators and their top political staffers were closely following a string of stories that quoted Sanders supporters criticizing Harris.\u000a\u000aIn one interview, the co-founder of a group called People for Bernie said Harris was being anointed as the candidate "of extremely wealthy and out-of-touch Democratic Party donors."\u000a\u000aAfter a handful of such stories, Harris herself spoke with Sanders on the Senate floor about the criticism, said multiple Democrats briefed on the exchange.\u000a\u000aSoon after, Longabaugh praised the first-term lawmaker in her home-state Sacramento Bee, leading to a de-escalation of tensions.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody part of Bernie\u2019s inner circle had anything to do with that, or would have any part of the criticism of Sen. Harris,\u201d he told the newspaper last month.\u000a\u000aOther Democratic senators have nudged colleagues who they think might be useful bridges to Sanders, asking them to step in. That group includes Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a fellow progressive who was the only senator to back Sanders in 2016.\u000a\u000aAmong the concerns: how Turner \u2014 appointed to the DNC\u2019s \u201cunity commission\u201d by Sanders in April \u2014 has pilloried the party messaging effort put together by Schumer in conjunction with his leadership team that includes Sanders. But their primary complaint has been that Sanders hasn\u2019t sufficiently directed his backers to attack Republicans \u2014 not fellow Democrats \u2014 with the midterm elections looming.\u000a\u000aAt no point was this worry more apparent than after the leaders of the National Nurses Union refused last month to rule out supporting primary challenges for Senate Democrats who don\u2019t support his Medicare-for-all health care bill. The group, one of Sanders' closest allies, vowed to \u201c[hold] the Democrats accountable.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders\u2019 own campaign pollster called the measure a litmus test in the same POLITICO report. And Turner \u2014 whose group houses the huge email list Sanders\u2019 team built during his campaign and subsequently refused to hand over to the DNC \u2014 said \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong\u201d with Democrats who don\u2019t support Sanders\u2019 measure.\u000a\u000aYet it took three weeks for Sanders himself to weigh in. He told The Washington Post that his health care legislation wouldn\u2019t serve as a litmus test for whether or not to back fellow senators. It was hardly a disavowal of his allies\u2019 rhetoric, though, and the delay left other lawmakers sweating about primary challenges for nearly a month.\u000a\u000aEven after he spoke up, multiple Democratic operatives who supported him in 2016 worried his statement was too little, too late. After all, the Sanders Institute \u2014 the think tank led by Sanders\u2019 wife, whose website is plastered with pictures of the senator \u2014 published the health care proposal pushed by the same nurses union.\u000a\u000aTo Sanders and the collection of people closest to him, such discussion is further evidence that his critics will never be satisfied, multiple Sanders confidants said. They believe the divide between the senator and his backers couldn\u2019t be clearer, and that anyone who pays attention to his stated goals and looks at his actions as a member of Democrats\u2019 Senate leadership team should understand he finds the attacks on Harris and other sitting Democrats counterproductive.\u000a\u000aAnyway, goes the frequent refrain from Sanders allies who paraphrase the senator\u2019s common campaign season reminder, he can\u2019t just snap his fingers and make his supporters fall in line. If Sanders supporters\u2019 vehemence is anyone\u2019s problem, they say in private, it\u2019s the public\u2019s problem for not understanding the divide between his words and his fans\u2019.\u000a\u000aAnd they insist that Sanders\u2019 campaign-season elevation of figures like Turner \u2014 not to mention his creation of Our Revolution \u2014 is irrelevant now. They point out that Sanders demonstrated his support for fellow Democratic senators by organizing health care-focused rallies for several of them earlier this year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe left wing of the Democratic Party has a set of institutions and players that pre-dated Bernie\u2019s campaign for president of the United States, and they still exist now that the campaign is over. They are going to pursue their own objectives as they see fit,\u201d said Longabaugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem for him at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a

aVUS President Donald Trump speaks with Mitch McConnell at a meeting about tax reform | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images GOP livid after Trump cuts deal with Democrats Congressional Republicans say the move will only embolden Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi in future talks.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump\u2019s and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s tête-à-tête on Tuesday \u2014 after a summer of sniping between the two \u2014 lifted Republican hopes that the GOP was finally back in sync ahead of a brutal fall of fiscal deadlines.\u000a\u000aNot 24 hours later, the president cut a deal with Democrats on a short-term debt ceiling increase opposed by McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Just Wednesday morning, in fact, Ryan had scoffed at the Democratic offer that Trump accepted minutes later.\u000a\u000aIn the aftermath, Republicans seethed privately and distanced themselves publicly from the deal. They were left to hope that Trump\u2019s collaboration with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was a temporary dalliance, and not the new MO for the president.\u000a\u000a\u201cObviously, it would have been better not to make us vote repeatedly on the debt ceiling. But I wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d sighed Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). \u201cI think Mitch would rather have done it differently, but it\u2019s not worth having a big old fight over.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cA three-month debt ceiling? Why not do a daily debt ceiling?\u201d cracked Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cHe\u2019s the best deal-maker ever. Don\u2019t you know? I mean, he\u2019s got a book out!\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s just a betrayal of everything we\u2019ve been talking about for years as Republicans.\u201d \u2014 Former Senator Jim DeMint\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s deal with Democrats doesn\u2019t appear to help Republicans at all. While it averts a fall government shutdown and a default on the nation\u2019s debt until at least December, it also emboldens Democrats to push for immigration changes or spending priorities without giving an inch to the right.\u000a\u000aCongress will likely have to strike a major bipartisan fiscal deal in December to raise the debt ceiling long term and keep the government open for the remainder of fiscal 2018. And Republican lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol complained Wednesday that Trump probably just undercut leadership in those future negotiations, making it even harder for them to secure legislative wins.\u000a\u000aIn a brief interview on Wednesday, McConnell said his meeting with Trump a day earlier was \u201ccordial.\u201d And though he made clear to reporters that this was Trump\u2019s deal \u2014 not his and Ryan\u2019s \u2014 he said he would nevertheless support it.\u000a\u000aMcConnell also insisted that things have settled down after Trump\u2019s tirade of tweets criticizing the GOP leader in August over his stewardship of the chamber and singling out some of his Republican members.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d McConnell said of his relationship with Trump. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d\u000a\u000aHis Democratic counterpart was far more upbeat.\u000a\u000a\u201cToday was a good day, in a generally very partisan town,\u201d Schumer said. The minority leader said Trump was presented with a GOP deal and a Democratic one, and he \u201cwent with the better argument.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo conservatives, Trump\u2019s turn toward the Democratic leaders pointed to a further fracturing of the GOP on fiscal issues \u2014 on the heels of its split over Trump\u2019s decision to end protections for some young immigrants. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) declared the \u201cPelosi-Schumer-Trump\u201d deal simply \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 but others fretted about a new, more liberal-leaning dynamic.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s just a betrayal of everything we\u2019ve been talking about for years as Republicans,\u201d said former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), who headed the Heritage Foundation and is still an influential conservative leader. \u201cWhat the president\u2019s going to find is \u2026 if they bet on Democratic votes they better plan on [giving up] a lot more than they think they\u2019re going to.\u201d\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, the Republican Study Committee chairman, said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the deal and seemed blindsided by the president\u2019s decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for the conference; I can only imagine what it is for leadership.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday morning, Ryan called the deal floated by Democrats to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling through mid-December as part of a relief package for Hurricane Harvey victims \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Expecting cover from Trump on their insistence to extend the debt ceiling much longer, Ryan and McConnell instead were abandoned.\u000a\u000aJust the night before, Ryan and his leadership team were told by White House officials that Trump would publicly endorse their plan to pair Harvey emergency funding bill with an 18-month debt ceiling hike. They were optimistic his support would help secure more Republican votes.\u000a\u000aOnly, Trump went rogue. White House officials apologized to congressional leaders after the meeting, according to a GOP source on Capitol Hill. But the damage was done.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help our leadership to try to hold us Republicans together on anything when they know the president will chop them off at the knees,\u201d said a House Republican lawmaker allied with Ryan. \u201cTrump has got to start caring more about his colleagues over here.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s move toward Democrats wasn\u2019t the only source of tension with congressional Republicans. His announcement earlier in the week that he would wind down protections for Dreamers \u2014 and put the onus on Congress to fix the problem \u2014 drove another rift through the GOP ranks. And on Wednesday, Trump shared the stage in North Dakota with Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, whom McConnell badly wants to unseat next year.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has to understand he doesn\u2019t have a leadership problem, he has a membership problem.\u201d \u2014 GOP Senator\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t think there is much of a relationship,\u201d a Republican senator said of Trump\u2019s coordination with the congressional GOP. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president. Mitch will do what Mitch does.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe president has seemed uninterested in a sustained partnership with congressional Republicans, leaving much of that work to Vice President Mike Pence, his Cabinet and legislative aides. Trump does talk to individual senators and congressmen regularly, but he often tells them different things rather than fostering a sense of unity, Republicans say.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s led to increasingly regular rebellions against Trump\u2019s leadership, punctuated by Sen. John McCain\u2019s (R-Ariz.) vote against Obamacare repeal legislation in July despite Trump\u2019s last-ditch phone call to McCain on the Senate floor.\u000a\u000aThere have been many other examples. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) wrote a book largely condemning his party for emboldening Trump. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) questioned Trump\u2019s competence last month. And Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is trying to protect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.\u000a\u000aAnd, of course, Trump has repeatedly targeted McConnell over the failure to repeal Obamacare. Other Republicans have tried to dissuade him from doing so.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president has to understand he doesn\u2019t have a leadership problem, he has a membership problem,\u201d said one GOP senator friendly with both the White House and McConnell, referring to rank-and-file Republicans rather than GOP leaders.\u000a\u000aTrump invited McConnell and other congressional leaders to Trump Tower in August mid-feud, but the logistics proved too complicated. And McConnell\u2019s allies say the calculating Republican leader moves on from setbacks with the president nearly as soon as they\u2019ve happened, eyeing the next big-ticket item, tax reform.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe president\u2019s frustrated. And we\u2019re all frustrated but we\u2019ve got to operate despite that frustration and I think nobody understands that better than Sen. McConnell,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).\u000a\u000aAdded Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who flew with Trump on Air Force One last week: \u201cMy belief is that we\u2019re ready to move on to the next issue. And both the White House and the Congress understand how important it is we get something done on taxes.\u201d\u000a\u000aHowever, the deal Trump cut on Wednesday with Schumer and Pelosi might make that more difficult, focusing all of Washington\u2019s attention on the next deadline: Dec. 8, when the debt ceiling and spending deal expires. The Treasury Department can buy more time on the debt ceiling into 2018, but that still means more votes that split the party, to the delight of Democrats and detriment of Republicans.\u000a\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s the most toxic vote you can have around here,\u201d said a second House Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u000a\u000aJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.

aVPeople protest President Donald Trump's travel ban outside as the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle, Washington. | Jason Redmond/Getty Images Court rejects Trump administration on travel ban exemptions Grandparents, cousins of Americans get reprieve, as do many refugees.\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump's travel ban policy suffered another defeat Thursday as an appeals court rejected the administration\u2019s attempt to deny grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of Americans a temporary exemption from the controversial executive order.\u000a\u000aA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously declined to overturn a district court judge\u2019s ruling that the administration was taking too narrow a view of an exception the Supreme Court carved out from the travel ban in June.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe appeals court judges reasoned that since the justices said the mother-in-law of one travel-ban challenger was entitled to a reprieve from the president's order, other relatives should enjoy the same treatment.\u000a\u000a"If mothers-in-law clearly fall within the scope of the injunction, then so too should grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins," Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez wrote in a joint opinion. "The Government does not offer a persuasive explanation for why a mother-in-law is clearly a bona fide relationship, in the Supreme Court\u2019s prior reasoning, but a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or cousin is not."\u000a\u000aThe appeals court panel also cleared the way for a greater flow of refugees, declining to disturb a lower court order that those already assigned to resettlement agencies can enter the United States despite Trump\u2019s directive.\u000a\u000aJustice Department lawyers had argued that those agencies deal directly with the government and rarely have contact with refugees until around the time of their arrival, but the judges found that argument beside the point.\u000a\u000a"Even if a resettlement agency does not have 'direct contact' with a refugee before arrival, this does not negate the finding that a relationship has formed. The agency still expends resources and arranges for individualized services based on the specific refugees that the agency has agreed to resettle," the 9th Circuit panel wrote. "Resettlement agencies will face concrete harms and burdens if refugees with formal assurances are not admitted."\u000a\u000aA Justice Department official said Thursday night that the administration will again ask the Supreme Court to set aside the legal rulings that have largely gutted Trump's policy.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation," a Justice spokeswoman said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The Supreme Court has set arguments on the ban\u2019s legality for October 10.\u000a\u000aAsked about the appeals court decision, a White House official expressed confidence in the legal underpinnings of Trump's directive.\u000a\u000a"The president\u2019s travel order is well within his legal authority and keeps our nation safe," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The Department of Justice will vigorously defend it."\u000a\u000aThe new appeals court ruling could effectively negate the travel ban's application to refugees in the coming weeks, since about 24,000 are already assigned to U.S. resettlement organizations.\u000a\u000aIn July, the Supreme Court temporarily halted the lower-court ruling clearing the way for admission of more refugees, but the high court's ruling expires by its own terms now that the 9th Circuit has ruled on the issue.\u000a\u000aNow, the Trump administration seems intent on again asking the justices to address the definition of close family and to clarify which refugees are exempt under the high court's June order.\u000a\u000aThe annual allocation of refugees runs through the end of the fiscal year at the end of this month. Trump could try to block the admission of any refugees after Sept. 30 by setting that number to zero or a low figure.\u000a\u000aObama had set the cap for this year at 110,000, although for budget and capacity reasons a much lower number of refugees were actually expected to be admitted. Trump attempted to lower the cap to 50,000 for this year, but court rulings have effectively blocked that move.\u000a\u000aA lawyer handling the case decided Thursday, Neal Katyal, hailed the decision.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe court of appeals has just sided with Hawaii (and constitutional freedoms everywhere) against Trump,\u201d Katyal wrote on Twitter.\u000a\u000aAll three 9th Circuit judges who ruled on the travel ban exemption Thursday are appointees of President Bill Clinton. It's the same panel of jurists that issued one of the two appeals court rulings earlier this year that Trump's revised travel ban was likely illegal. By 9th Circuit policy, the same set of judges is usually assigned to recurring appeals arising from the same case.\u000a\u000aTrump billed his initial travel-ban order, issued in January, and the revised edition, released in March, as anti-terrorism measures designed to protect Americans from threats posed by radical foreigners and to allow authorities time to improve vetting procedures. However, critics denounced the measures as thinly veiled versions of the Muslim ban Trump promoted and promised during his presidential campaign.\u000a\u000aThe Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals accepted that argument in a May ruling against the revised travel ban, with the court's majority concluding that the order amounts to intentional religious discrimination.\u000a\u000aThe California-based 9th Circuit's decision, issued in June, dodged that issue, concluding that Trump failed to meet legal requirements and exceeded his statutory authority in issuing the directive.\u000a\u000aThe two key prongs of the revised travel ban are set to expire in the coming weeks, further complicating the legal picture. The 90-day ban on issuance of visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen expires Sept. 24. So that part of Trump\u2019s policy could be expired by the time the case is argued at the Supreme Court on Oct. 10. The refugee halt is scheduled to end about two weeks later.

aVBudget Director Mick Mulvaney speaks to reporters following a closed-door Republican strategy session that included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., at the Capitol on Friday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP House Republicans lash Mnuchin, Mulvaney behind closed doors GOP lawmakers booed the Trump administration officials for their debt ceiling stance.\u000a\u000aIt was supposed to be a call to unity.\u000a\u000aTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney joined a closed-door GOP Conference meeting Friday to try to rally wary Republicans around a debt ceiling bill they hated.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aBut the huddle quickly went off the rails when Rep. Tim Walberg stood up to say President Donald Trump needed to play more with the team. The Michigan Republican said he was all for bipartisanship, but he argued that Trump shouldn\u2019t have blindsided the conference when he struck a deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, undercutting GOP leadership.\u000a\u000aWalberg was the first of more than a dozen lawmakers who echoed that same sentiment, according to sources in the room. Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker of North Carolina asked Mnuchin why he even bothered meeting with conservatives over the summer if he was just going to ignore their input entirely. Another lawmaker said Trump \u201cpissed off a whole lot of people in here\u201d when he went against a joint leadership-White House plan to advocate for a longer debt limit increase that took the issue off the table until after the midterm elections.\u000a\u000aAnd the room booed when Mulvaney and Mnuchin refused to commit to spending cuts during the next debt ceiling debate \u2014 and then asked for their vote on the current legislation.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Mnuchin\u2019s] last words, and I quote, were \u2018Vote for the debt ceiling for me,\u2019\u201d Walker said as he left the meeting. \u201cYou could hear the murmurs in the room there. There was some hissing and I don\u2019t know if there was booing but there were some groans.\u201d\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

But most did so out of obligation to help the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma \u2014 not for anyone in the Trump administration.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disappointment in the decision that the president made, and the way our leadership was treated. That\u2019s a sore spot,\u201d said former House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.). "However, this bill \u2014 we have no choice but to raise the debt ceiling, and we have no choice but to help those people in desperate need in Texas and other places. \u2026 But it\u2019s not a happy camp."\u000a\u000aMost Republicans seethed as they exited the conference meeting and headed to the floor. They said they were shell-shocked that they were being scolded into raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit without spending cuts by a GOP administration \u2014 especially by Mnuchin, a longtime Democrat, and Mulvaney, once among the House\u2019s most ardent critics of raising the debt ceiling without conservative reforms.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so serious it kind of would have been funny,\u201d said Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Penn.)\u000a\u000a\u201cWhen you have a Democratic donor Treasury secretary saying we as a Republican Congress need to vote for this and an OMB director I don\u2019t believe ever supported a clean debt ceiling \u2026 say we need to do this, it\u2019s kind of \u2018Where am I right now?\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aLawmakers gave a particular earful to Mulvaney, who they remember adamantly rejecting previous debt ceiling increases and pushing to tie disaster aid to spending cuts, most notably after Hurricane Sandy hit New York and New Jersey in 2012.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe would\u2019ve been in the audience doing most of the shouting,\u201d said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) \u201cI remember him during Sandy. I don\u2019t forget.\u201d\u000a\u000aRep. Darrell Issa cracked that Mulvaney, a former Freedom Caucus conservative, should find 43 vacancies in the administration for Freedom Caucus members, suggesting they might abandon their principles and back what Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) has been calling a \u201ccrap-sandwich\u201d if he gave them a job.\u000a\u000aLawmakers \u2014 and Mulvaney himself \u2014 laughed, knowing full well it was a pointed jab at the budget director conservatives say sold out his ideology when he joined the Trump administration.\u000a\u000aMost of it was not lighthearted, however.\u000a\u000aThe room booed when Mulvaney refused Texas GOP Rep. Joe Barton\u2019s request that he commit to reducing spending as part of the next debt ceiling hike. Lawmakers also repeatedly voiced frustration that the administration refused to commit to tackling conservative priorities in December, when a confluence of fiscal fights \u2014 including a long-term government spending agreement \u2014 are expected.\u000a\u000aRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, downplayed the tension in the room, suggesting differences were philosophical, not personal: Many lawmakers were eager to vote for relief for Hurricane Harvey victims, but they were also torn over lifting the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\u000a\u000aBut one thing was clear, he said. Democrats won the week.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think that they would be accurate in suggesting that Democrats had a win on this because there are no structural reforms to the debt ceiling that was included with the debt ceiling vote,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s the first time I can recall we\u2019re increasing the debt ceiling without something conservative being attached to it.\u201d

aV\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d he replied, smiling a contrived pirate\u2019s grin.\u000a\u000aI again identified myself, adding my name, and he acknowledged who he was and shook my hand. (I am relying on my memory and notes jotted down immediately after.)\u000a\u000aI asked if he was indeed reading \u201cThe Best and the Brightest.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHe seemed surprised that I was surprised, although really I was stunned at the situation\u2019s surreal appropriateness. If a novelist were imagining the Trump presidency, this book, a case study in what can go wrong from the outset of an administration ushered in by a change election in uncertain times, is precisely what Mr. Bannon would be reading.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m having everyone in the transition read it,\u201d Mr. Bannon continued, later clarifying that \u201ceveryone\u201d meant several people.\u000a\u000aNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For instance, when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in November that President-elect Trump sought to fill his administration with \u201cthe best and brightest in the country,\u201d he presumably meant it in earnest.\u000a\u000aBut the implied irony was not that the advisers weren\u2019t impressive men (always men, usually men who had attended Harvard). They were. Rather, Mr. Halberstam\u2019s caustic title and the nearly 700 pages that follow indict the notion that society\u2019s smartest are necessarily the ones best equipped to tackle society\u2019s biggest problems.\u000a\u000aMr. Halberstam\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye is painted on a specific kind of smart person. President Kennedy chose his men based on general wits, rather than on specific knowledge. Perhaps the most famous example was Robert McNamara, an ingenious scientist of managerialism, a president of Ford Motor Company, who as secretary of defense, said Mr. Halberstam, \u201cknew nothing about Asia, about poverty, about people, about American domestic politics.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe book speaks to a concern about having a government run by technocrats,\u201d Fredrik Logevall, a Vietnam War scholar, told me.\u000a\u000aIt scarcely requires effort to see how Mr. Bannon\u2019s anti-establishment worldview and his own assumption of broad power \u2014 he has been elevated to the National Security Council\u2019s \u201cprincipals committee,\u201d an unusual move for a political adviser \u2014 could find ballast in \u201cThe Best and the Brightest.\u201d He is no technocrat, but a former Goldman Sachs banker, film producer and media impresario whose national security experience appears limited to several years as a Navy officer and a master\u2019s degree.\u000a\u000aHowever, also unlike McNamara and the rest, he has definite beliefs about the world.\u000a\u000aMr. Bannon envisions President Trump as unencumbered by ossified default norms so he is able to push, he told The Times, \u201cpopulist nation-state policies.\u201d\u000a\u000aThese policies have worried civil rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News under his editorial stewardship \u201ca platform for the alt-right\u201d \u2014 a movement whose tenets include white nationalism and anti-Semitism. He has also advocated \u201ca very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam,\u201d which may help explain Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning entry to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aIf \u201cThe Best and the Brightest\u201d is a brief against the East Coast meritocracy, though, its proposed alternative is not pure ideology. It is expertise.\u000a\u000aTime and again, in Mr. Halberstam\u2019s telling, lower-level government officials who understood Vietnamese politics, sentiments and even geography assessed reality accurately and offered correct policy recommendations to the major characters \u2014 who shunted them aside.\u000a\u000aIn early 1964, for instance, a State Department study concluded that bombing North Vietnam to reach a favorable political settlement would fail. The finding \u201creflected the genuine expertise of the government from deep within its bowels,\u201d Mr. Halberstam writes. But the higher-ups favored bombing, and so there was bombing. (Which failed.)\u000a\u000a\u201cYou\u2019ve got these guys that are so brilliant, but they\u2019re generalists,\u201d said Mr. Logevall. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction to be drawn, he concludes, between this abstract quickness, this verbal facility, and true wisdom, which he says was missing.\u201d\u000a\u000aSuch a reading prompts thought of the more than 1,000 State Department employees who signed a dissent cable opposing the immigration executive order \u2014 an order that, according to reports, was written by Mr. Bannon and the Trump adviser Stephen Miller, neither of whom are counterterrorism experts (or lawyers).\u000a\u000aIn this light, Mr. Bannon seems less a repudiation than a reincarnation of the tragic protagonists of \u201cThe Best and the Brightest.\u201d Walt Rostow, who occupied various foreign policy positions before ascending to national security adviser, comes to mind. Like Mr. Bannon, who has said he grew up in a working-class Catholic household in Richmond, Va., Mr. Rostow, the son of Jewish Socialist immigrants in New York City, began as an outsider.\u000a\u000aMr. Rostow was an economist, and in foreign affairs Mr. Halberstam shows him to be a dilettante. As bombs fell on Pleiku, he writes, \u201cRostow wandered around the White House clapping Air Force officers on the back, asking about the weather, reminding them that he had once picked targets, and he knew that weather was important.\u201d\u000a\u000aMr. Rostow\u2019s wartime experience in the Office of Strategic Services ostensibly justified his influence, much as Mr. Spicer claimed that Mr. Bannon\u2019s Navy tenure qualifies him for full membership on the National Security Council. That\u2019s a perch from which he might redefine American engagement with the world.\u000a\u000aAre Mr. Bannon\u2019s early moves \u201clittle mistakes\u201d? To go by Mr. Bannon\u2019s book report on \u201cThe Best and the Brightest,\u201d we may not know until years from now \u2014 by whether they led to big mistakes later on.

aVHouse and Senate Democrats have wondered for months whether Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters might choose to focus their energy on launching primary challenges to party moderates in 2018. They\u2019re about to get an answer.\u000a\u000aSanders has decided the moment is right to launch his proposal for the single-payer health insurance system that helped form the backbone of his presidential message. And Democrats who don\u2019t get behind it could find themselves on the wrong side of the most energetic wing of the party \u2014 as well as the once and possibly future presidential candidate who serves as its figurehead.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aThe Vermont senator himself has not explicitly said he\u2019ll support primary challenges to those who won\u2019t support his push for a so-called Medicare-for-all health care plan. But there are plenty of signs that Sanders and his allies view the issue as a defining moment for Democratic lawmakers.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur view is that within the Democratic Party, this is fast-emerging as a litmus test,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, the pollster for Sanders\u2019 White House run.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\u000a\u000aThe single-payer concept is increasingly popular in the party \u2014 high-profile senators like Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have expressed some support, and, for the first time, a majority of House Democrats have now signed on to the single-payer bill that Rep. John Conyers has been introducing regularly for more than a decade.\u000a\u000aBut even as leading party figures have drifted toward supporting a single-payer system similar to the one proposed by Sanders, almost none of them expect anything like it to become law while Republicans control Washington.\u000a\u000aWith Sanders promising to play a major role in 2018 races, that\u2019s led many party officials to worry about the prospect of his involvement in primaries that could upend the Democratic establishment\u2019s plans to win crucial House, Senate and gubernatorial seats.\u000a\u000aThe fears are acute enough that when the Nevada chapter of Our Revolution \u2014 the political group spawned from the Sanders presidential campaign \u2014 endorsed long-shot candidate Jesse Sbaih in the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primary over party favorite Rep. Jacky Rosen, retired former Sen. Harry Reid felt the need to call Sanders directly.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t endorse Sbaih, and don\u2019t let the national Our Revolution group accept its Nevada chapter's recommendation to back him either, the former minority leader implored his friend. Sanders agreed, said a Democrat familiar with the interaction.\u000a\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s a concern that [Sanders allied] people will try to make a stir,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide working on a 2018 campaign. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be a liberal Democrat in a lot of these states and be elected. [So] the question is how we improve the lives of people instead of playing these political games."\u000a\u000aSanders allies don\u2019t find that argument convincing.\u000a\u000a\u201cAny Democrat worth their salt that doesn\u2019t unequivocally say Medicare-for-all is the way to go? To me, there\u2019s something wrong with them,\u201d said former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept no more hemming and hawing. No more game playing. Make your stand.\u201d\u000a\u000aSanders himself has stood alongside Democrats in fights like the recent one against the GOP\u2019s health care plans. He\u2019s toured states with wavering Republican senators to pressure them on the issue and quickly condemned a recent single-payer measure pushed by Republican Sen. Steve Daines as a ploy designed to trick Democrats.\u000a\u000aHis team has been working with fellow progressive senators to enlist co-sponsors for his measure, said Democrats across Capitol Hill. Within Sanders circles, the increased popularity of single-payer arrangements is seen as a sign that his long-promised "political revolution\u201d is underway.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s been vindicated by the presidential campaign,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior Sanders 2016 campaign adviser.\u000a\u000aThe Vermont independent has signaled that he expects serious resistance even from Democrats, but he has yet to spell out how he'll fight back.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe will be taking on the most powerful special interests in the country: Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the corporate media, the Republican Party and the establishment wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d he emailed supporters last Tuesday.\u000a\u000aWhat\u2019s clear is that Sanders\u2019 large and politically active following has stopped Democrats from confronting him directly \u2014 including when it comes to offering alternatives to his Medicare-for-all measure. Many still remember the swift and angry January response from grass-roots progressives including Sanders supporters toward Booker for a symbolic drug importation vote, and toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her procedural vote in favor of Ben Carson\u2019s nomination as Housing secretary.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

It\u2019s an issue that everyone is going to be watching to see how they respond,\u201d said Chuck Idelson, a senior operative for the National Nurses United union, which served as one of the most prominent backers of Sanders\u2019 campaign and has long been a needle in the side of establishment Democrats.\u000a\u000aLike many Democrats who are closely aligned with Sanders\u2019 political operation, Idelson stopped short of primary threats. But he refused to rule out the possibility that his group might consider backing challenges of sitting Democratic lawmakers who don\u2019t back the plan.\u000a\u000a\u201cOur organization, and plenty of other people out there, are going to be holding the Democrats accountable,\u201d Idelson said. \u201cWhat are we electing people for if they\u2019re not going to be fighting for getting people health care when they need it?\u201d\u000a\u000aOther Sanders-allied progressives have been equally adamant on the need to give his Medicare-for-all push a starring role in forthcoming primaries after the recent Capitol Hill health care fights and the stalling of a much-publicized California state legislative proposal.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe should run on Medicare-for-all in the 2018 and 2020 elections,\u201d said Bay Area Congressman Ro Khanna, a Sanders backer who has encouraged primary challenges. \u201cThe Democrats that are activists are there, the Democratic voters are there, but now we just need enough of the elected officials to listen to where their constituents are.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe distrust between Sanders forces and the establishment is increasing the tension. Some Democratic senators privately bristled at the health care rallies that Sanders and others organized across the country in January: They were shocked to be greeted by angry Sanders backers in the crowds who loudly urged them to back a single-payer plan, according to several Democratic senators and aides. There is also longstanding grumbling over his refusal to share his campaign email list with other Democrats and, more recently, over his vote against a new round of sanctions against Russia and Iran.\u000a\u000aOn the other side of the divide, Sanders allies insist the party seldom acknowledges the role of the senator\u2019s 2016 presidential bid in shaping the party\u2019s new agenda, whether on health care, a $15 minimum wage, or free college. And they express frustration that Democratic gatekeepers are still slow to accept Sanders\u2019 likely front-runner role if he chooses to run for president in 2020.\u000a\u000aIn the words of one senior aide to Sanders\u2019 campaign, \u201cA special cloud of denial formed over the swamp when polls started coming out showing Bernie was the most popular politician in the country."\u000a\u000a

aVMEPs want to decrease the overall size of Parliament after the U.K. leaves the bloc, with the U.K.'s remaining seats reallocated among member states | Frederick Florin/AFP via Getty Images MEPs propose cut in their ranks after Brexit European Parliament lawmakers put forward plan to deal with seats vacated by departing Brits.\u000a\u000aMEPs want to shrink the size of the European Parliament after Britain leaves the EU, and opened the door for a future pan-European list of lawmakers, according to a draft report obtained by POLITICO.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. has 73 MEPs who will be leaving because of Brexit. Under the proposal, drawn up by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, 51 of those seats would be cut in 2019, taking the overall size of the Parliament down from 751 to 700. The remaining 22 British seats would be re-distributed among the remaining 27 EU countries.\u000a\u000aThe other 51 seats would be held in reserve and could be used to create pan-European list of MEPs and for MEPs from new member countries as a result of \u201cpotential future enlargements\u201d of the EU.\u000a\u000aThe committee will discuss the proposal in Strasbourg on September 11 and will vote on it at a later date before it passes on to a plenary session of all MEPs, although no dates for the votes have been set. National capitals would also have to sign off on the plan.\u000a\u000aThe new distribution of seats would apply \u201conce there is legal certainty and the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the union becomes legally effective,\u201d the report said.\u000a\u000aEven before the Brexit vote, the Parliament struggled to find a fair way to allocate seats. The larger (and more important) the country, the greater the number of MEPs it gets. The allocations were tweaked before the 2014 election to make room for Croatia, which joined the bloc in July 2013.\u000a\u000aThe committee\u2019s proposal, which comes after months of discussion between political groups, proposes a re-distribution that would prevent any EU country from losing representation while using \u201conly a minimal fraction of the seats vacated by the U.K,\u201d the report said.\u000a\u000aProponents of the idea of creating a pan-European list of lawmakers \u2014 with candidates representing a single European constituency \u2014 include the Italian government and French President Emmanuel Macron, who incorporated the idea into his presidential program and called for \u201cabout 50 seats\u201d to be set aside.\u000a\u000aCritics, including the largest group in the Parliament \u2014 the European People\u2019s Party \u2014 charge that a pan-European list is an unrealistic and federalist whim that would require a treaty change. They believe such a list would further deepen the gap between EU citizens and politicians.\u000a\u000aPaulo Rangel, a Portuguese MEP who is vice president of the EPP and a member of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, said transnational lists were \u201cwell-regarded\u201d by Socialist and Liberal MEPs. He said the legal framework for setting up such a list had been in the hands of the Council since 2015.\u000a\u000a\u201cUntil the framework comes into force \u2026 the transnational list will always be an idea without foundation. It will always be soft law,\u201d Rangel said.\u000a\u000aThe idea of a pan-European list first emerged in a 2011 report by former British MEP Andrew Duff, who proposed that an additional 25 MEPs be elected by a single constituency \u201cformed of the whole territory of the European Union.\u201d His proposal was approved in the Constitutional Affairs Committee at the time but the full Parliament refused to back it.

aVFueled by anger over President Donald Trump, a pack of credible Democratic challengers is already preparing to challenge Reichert, R-Auburn, who is seeking an eighth term in 2018.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s been close to a decade since Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert faced a serious threat to his re-election in Washington\u2019s 8th Congressional District.\u000a\u000aBut more than a year before the 2018 midterm elections there are already signs Reichert will have a fight on his hands if he hopes to win an eighth term next fall.\u000a\u000aFueled by alarm and anger at President Donald Trump and the GOP\u2019s congressional majority, would-be Democratic challengers are raising money, hiring staff and courting voters from Auburn to Wenatchee.\u000a\u000aAmong the candidates vying to take on Reichert are a pediatrician, a lawyer, an Amazon manager, a city-council member and a mortgage-business owner.\u000a\u000aReichert, 67, is a former King County sheriff first elected to Congress in 2004. He intends to run for re-election again, a campaign spokesman said last week.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe congressman has dedicated his entire adult life to serving Washington and welcomes anyone who hopes to do the same to run for office,\u201d the Reichert campaign added in a statement.\u000a\u000aLast year, Reichert easily coasted to a seventh term, beating former sportscaster Tony Ventrella, who ran a lackluster campaign that he suspended too late to remove his name from the ballot.\u000a\u000aDemocrats hope 2018 will be different, with a possible national wave building against Republicans, spurred by worries about health care, immigration, white nationalist violence and other concerns building record disapproval ratings for Trump.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe negative political headwinds on him [Reichert] are really strong,\u201d said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has listed Reichert among its top targets in 2018.\u000a\u000aTo retake the majority in the House, Democrats need a net gain of 24 seats. National prognosticators have so far ranked Reichert as a likely bet to be re-elected absent a historic wave.\u000a\u000aDemocrats have talked tough about Reichert before, but the party has not substantively backed a challenger since 2010, when former Microsoft executive Suzan DelBene lost amid a GOP-friendly tea-party backlash against President Barack Obama. (DelBene was elected to Congress in the 1st District two years later.)\u000a\u000aThe 8th District only got friendlier for Reichert in a round of political redistricting after the 2010 Census. The reshaped map shed Democrat-heavy areas around Bellevue and picked up large swaths of Central Washington.\u000a\u000aIt now runs from the eastern side of King and Pierce counties, including Reichert\u2019s Auburn home, across the Interstate 90 corridor to Lake Chelan, where he has a cabin.\u000a\u000aIn a statement, Chris Martin, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, pooh-poohed Democrats\u2019 talk of beating Reichert, saying he has \u201can unparalleled record of public service and continues to deliver results for his district.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cThe crowded Democratic primary will force their candidates to adopt far-left positions that will be unpalatable to general election voters,\u201d Martin predicted.\u000a\u000aMost of Reichert\u2019s challengers are running their first campaigns, and some have only recently moved into the district.\u000a\u000aBut they are campaigning energetically, shredding Reichert as a Trump enabler whose reputation as a moderate is overstated and who has for years refused to face constituents in a public town hall.\u000a\u000aKim Schrier\u000a\u000aKim Schrier, 49, a pediatrician from Sammamish, is the latest Democrat to enter the race, announcing her candidacy in early August.\u000a\u000aShe said she never considered running for office before Trump\u2019s election.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was so devastated by the results,\u201d she said. And since then, \u201ceverything I feared would come true has come true.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cI have a 9-year-old son who I know is going to ask me one day: \u2018What did you do to push back?\u2019 \u201d\u000a\u000aWith health care sure to be a major concern in the 2018 election, Schrier\u2019s background could make a compelling profile for Democrats.\u000a\u000aSchrier has worked as a pediatrician at Virginia Mason in Issaquah for 16 years. She also has Type 1 diabetes, having been diagnosed as a teenager. \u201cI have a very real sense of what happens when you take health care away from people,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aLike other Democrats, Schrier doesn\u2019t give Reichert much credit for his vote against the final House Republican health-care bill in May.\u000a\u000aReichert had voted in March to advance an earlier version of the legislation through committee and remained publicly undecided on the final bill until just before a floor vote, when it was apparent Republican leaders had enough votes to pass the measure without him.\u000a\u000aJason Rittereiser\u000a\u000aWhile all of Reichert\u2019s would-be opponents criticize him for refusing to hold town halls with constituents, attorney Jason Rittereiser is offering the most extreme contrast.\u000a\u000aRittereiser, 33, plans to hold 30 public town-hall meetings across the district in September. He slammed Reichert for dodging public town halls while accepting campaign checks from banks and other big corporations.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe is not accessible to the people,\u201d Rittereiser said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been underrepresented in our district for a long time.\u201d\u000a\u000aA former King County deputy prosecutor who handled sexual assaults and violent crimes, Rittereiser has worked for the last three years for a national employment-law firm with offices in Seattle.\u000a\u000aHe grew up in Ellensburg and had been living in Seattle but moved to Issaquah a couple of months before declaring his candidacy. Rittereiser said he can stand out among Reichert\u2019s challengers as someone who has lived on both sides of the Cascades.\u000a\u000aToby Whitney\u000a\u000aAmong the Democrats in the race so far, Toby Whitney has the most experience with how Congress works.\u000a\u000aSince 2014, Whitney, 50, has managed a software-development group at Amazon. But before that he spent six years in Washington, D.C., working for the House Ways and Means Committee and as legislative director for longtime Democratic Congressman Jim McDermott.\u000a\u000aWhitney said he left D.C. out of frustration with a system that favors corporate interests over the average American. He said Trump\u2019s election motivated him to seek office \u2014 with a focus on fixing the financial rut hobbling the middle class.\u000a\u000a\u201cI believe the biggest issue of our time is the lack of wage growth and economic mobility of the middle and working class in the last 40 years,\u201d Whitney said.\u000a\u000aHe said the U.S. needs to provide workers paid parental leave, fix a broken retirement system reliant on 401(k)s, and guarantee two years of free community college and lifetime job retraining.\u000a\u000aWhitney splits his time between a home in Seattle and one on Snoqualmie Pass.\u000a\u000aMona Das\u000a\u000aUnlike some of the other candidates, Mona Das, 45, said she has been thinking of running for political office for a while. She\u2019d attended training for women candidates last year at Yale University.\u000a\u000aBut waking up Nov. 9 to news of Trump\u2019s victory solidified her plans. \u201cI knew everything we hold dear and care about was going to be under attack,\u201d she said.\u000a\u000aAs a first-generation immigrant who came to the U.S. from India as a child, as well as a woman and business owner, Das said she could bring important perspectives to Congress, which she said already has plenty of doctors and lawyers.\u000a\u000a\u201cMy family came here with six dollars,\u201d Das said. \u201cOne thing I can say about Trump is he has fueled people like me to step up and run for office.\u201d\u000a\u000aA self-described progressive Democrat, Das moved to Covington from Seattle in June. She started her mortgage business, which focuses on first-time homebuyers, in Portland, but moved it to Renton four years ago.\u000a\u000aIn knocking on doors and meeting voters every weekend, Das said people are happy to hear from a politician who listens. While the district may not be as liberal as Seattle, she said it\u2019s changing as people move there seeking more affordable homes.\u000a\u000a\u201cA lot of these folks are moving into Renton and Kent and Auburn,\u201d she said. \u201cThe district is becoming more diverse every day.\u201d\u000a\u000aTola Marts\u000a\u000aTola Marts is the only elected official running against Reichert.\u000a\u000aAn Issaquah City Council member since 2010, Marts, 48, jumped into the congressional race earlier than most, announcing his campaign in May.\u000a\u000aAn engineer, Marts works at a lab that aids in vaccine research to help poor populations in Africa and other developing areas. He previously worked at Blue Origin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 private space-rocket company.\u000a\u000aMarts argued Reichert has grown too conservative for the 8th District. He pointed to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com that shows Reichert votes for Trump\u2019s agenda more than 80 percent of the time.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe finds a few areas where he doesn\u2019t go in lockstep \u2026 but by and large he votes on what the president wants,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aMarts said he\u2019s happy the list of Reichert challengers keeps growing. \u201cI am hoping all these Democratic candidates stay positive,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as all of us focus on taking out Dave Reichert, things will sort themselves out.\u201d\u000a\u000aA few other candidates also have filed paperwork to challenge Reichert, including Tom Cramer, who ran as a Democrat in the 2012 primary against U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, receiving 7 percent of the vote. Cramer\u2019s website says he is running to pursue \u201chigher pay for regular people.\u201d\u000a\u000aSusan Hutchison, chairman of the Washington State Republican Party, said she\u2019s not worried about Reichert\u2019s seat, pointing out that most GOP statewide candidates carried the district in 2016.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s good to have campaigns. It helps our candidates,\u201d Hutchison said.

aVWhen a devastating flood struck Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in August last year, Scott Rotolo returned home to nearly $100,000 in flood damage. Wanting to rebuild as quickly as possible, he contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help. The agency directed him to the Small Business Administration\u2014Washington\u2019s frontline emergency lender\u2014and he applied for, and accepted, a low-interest loan to rebuild his house and replace his possessions.\u000a\u000aTo Rotolo, a 39-year-old IT worker, it seemed like the smart financial decision: The government offers a low interest rate, and the money got him back into his house quickly. He and his family moved back in March. But a few months later, he realized that that he\u2019d made a big mistake: Because he took out a disaster loan\u2014just over $100,000 that he needed to pay back with interest\u2014he was not eligible for the federal disaster grants that came available a few months ago. The news came as a big surprise, Rotolo said in an interview: he didn\u2019t see any notice from FEMA or the SBA that taking out a loan would block him from getting a disaster grant. \u201cBecause I was responsible,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m being punished.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs Louisiana has begun dispersing nearly $2 billion in disaster grant money over the past few months, people in the disaster-relief world are sounding the alarm that many disaster victims can be unwittingly caught in the trap that snared Rotolo. Thanks to a rule originally passed to prevent double-dipping by unscrupulous disaster victims, some of the neediest people in devastated areas can actually lose their access to relief grants.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not clear how many people have actually been rebuffed for grants, though Rotolo is one of 18,000 people approved for a disaster loan after the 2016 Louisiana floods, all of whom would be affected by the rule. State officials say it\u2019s the top complaint they are hearing from disaster victims as they try to rebuild. \u201cThis is the number one issue that folks are running into,\u201d said Richard Carbo, deputy chief of staff for Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards.\u000a\u000a\u201cThis was a massive issue 11 years ago,\u201d said Adam Knapp, who was the policy director for the Louisiana Economic Development agency after Katrina and now is the CEO of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt was a massive issue after Sandy. It was a massive issue after our flood and still is. It\u2019s just a forgotten issue.\u201d\u000a\u000aThis week, as a Hurricane Harvey relief bill moves quickly through Capitol Hill, officials in Louisiana are trying to convince Congress to fix the issue\u2014so far, with no luck. On Wednesday, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting they include language in the Hurricane Harvey relief bill that ensures disaster victims are not penalized for receiving an SBA loan. Neither the $7.9 billion bill passed by the House Wednesday nor the $15 billion bill passed by the Senate on Thursday included any such language, but state officials are continuing to press lawmakers. \u201cCongress needs to act,\u201d said Carbo.\u000a\u000aThe problem has its roots in America\u2019s two-tiered system for delivering money to disaster victims. The first and most immediate form of relief is loans: The Small Business Administration issues low-interest loans to struggling homeowners and businesses, giving them access to cash as quickly as a few weeks after the disaster, which they have to pay back with interest. The second form of relief is grants, which are more valuable\u2014homeowners don\u2019t need to pay them back\u2014but can take much longer to receive.\u000a\u000aThe catch: every dollar for which disaster victims are approved for an SBA loan is a dollar less they can receive from a federal grant. In other words, if a victim who is eligible for $120,000 in assistance is offered a $90,000 SBA loan, she can only receive grants worth $30,000\u2014no matter if she accepts or declines the loan.\u000a\u000aThe rule means that many people are now finding themselves boxed out of grant money they\u2019d otherwise be qualified to receive. In some cases, disaster-relief experts and state officials said, they simply aren\u2019t aware that when applying for loans, they\u2019re closing off the chance to get a far more valuable grant later. \u201cIt always catches people off guard,\u201d said Robin Keegan, the former executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which was created following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to oversee the recovery.\u000a\u000aAlready, lawyers working with Harvey victims say they are unsure how to advise their clients, worried that applying for an SBA loan could prevent them from receiving grant money in the future. \u201cIt is very frustrating,\u201d said Tracy Figueroa, a lawyer at Texas RioGrande Legal Aid who leads its office of disaster assistance.\u000a\u000aThese rules arose to prevent a problem known as \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d\u2014or, colloquially, double-dipping. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and major floods in the Midwest in 2008, a federal audit found that due to a bureaucratic failure, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which issues one of the two main kinds of disaster grants, sent money to people who\u2019d already received an SBA loan to cover their losses. Such double dipping, which is prohibited by federal law, cost the government almost $1 billion, money that could have gone to other victims. The new rules, issued by HUD in 2011, were designed to prevent such bureaucratic mistakes from happening again, ensuring that federal assistance reaches those who need it most.\u000a\u000aBut state officials and disaster experts say, the rules have gone too far. Along with preventing double dipping, they say, the rules penalize people who would have been better off waiting for federal grant money\u2014leaving them saddled with thousands of dollars in debt instead of a simple payout by the government. \u201cNow is when homeowners are really fully finding out how much their SBA loan is a barrier for them,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy choice that the federal government has made.\u201d\u000a\u000aHUD and the SBA did not respond to a request for comment.\u000a\u000aA former HUD official who asked not to be named because she no longer speaks for the agency defended the current rules, arguing that if a disaster victim without insurance has the resources to rebuild\u2014in other words, they can repay an SBA loan\u2014then they should receive a loan rather than a grant. \u201cIf folks don\u2019t have flood insurance and they get an SBA low-interest loan, isn\u2019t that a fair benefit?\u201d The former official further argued that allowing people who are eligible for an SBA loan to receive a grant from HUD would be expensive and unfair. \u201cThey are just expecting that they should just get a grant to rebuild. You are penalizing homeowners that pay for flood insurance.\u201d\u000a\u000aState officials and many disaster experts see this problem differently, believing that even people with the means to rebuild deserve some grant money, instead of being saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in loans. \u201cSometimes the fact that you are bankable and can take out an SBA loan doesn\u2019t mean you are as well-resourced that you can take on that burden of debt,\u201d said Keegan, who is now the director of Resilient Baton Rouge, a group formed last year to provide behavioral health services to last year\u2019s flood victims. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard a lot in implementation woes of these programs is people are dipping into savings, retirement benefits or a college fund just to make ends meet.\u201d\u000a\u000aMore importantly, they say, agencies must do a much better job explaining to disaster victims that applying for an SBA loan can hurt them in the future when they seek grant money. Asked whether agencies make that information clear, Figueroa said, \u201cNot at all.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s hard for somebody who is on the phone with FEMA and being told that you better apply for that SBA loan because otherwise we can\u2019t even think about giving you FEMA money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are applying for stuff, doing whatever they need to scrape together a way to begin to recover and then grant programs come out later and [they say,] \u2018Oops sorry you got a loan so we can\u2019t give you this grant.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aA FEMA spokesperson said that the agency warns people about the ban on duplication multiple times: when they first register for FEMA assistance, on the eligibility letter they receive, and also in a release form when registering. \u201cThis form places the applicant on notice that they are required to return any FEMA assistance that is covered by another source such as insurance,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.\u000a\u000aControversy around the \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d rules also arose after Superstorm Sandy when New York lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo worried that HUD would attempt to claw back money that victims had received through disaster grants and from a flood insurance settlement. The lawmakers successfully negotiated a waiver that protected certain, low-income victims from clawbacks by FEMA for certain overpayments.\u000a\u000aEdwards would like to see a much bigger change: It\u2019s only fair, he says, to allow people who receive an SBA loan to take advantage of HUD disaster grants as well. In February, he sent a letter to the congressional delegation asking for a legislative change to either forgive SBA disaster loans taken out by victims of last year\u2019s flooding\u2014in other words, turn the loans into outright grants\u2014or to allow those victims to also receive HUD grants. In August, he sent a letter to Ben Carson, the secretary of HUD, asking for a regulatory change that would effectively accomplish the same thing. In that letter, Edwards appealed not just for his state but for disaster victims elsewhere in the U.S. \u201cThis is, perhaps, the single biggest change we can make to support homeowners,\u201d he wrote, \u201cnot just in Louisiana, but across the country.\u201d\u000a\u000aScott Rotolo says he\u2019s hoping that Edwards\u2019 efforts will succeed. If he had known that the SBA loan would have made him ineligible for a grant, he said he would have taken out a private loan at the market interest rate, and then applied for a grant when that money became available. Now it\u2019s too late. The SBA loan is effectively a second mortgage on a house he just moved into last year. \u201cI can\u2019t maintain the lifestyle I had before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just right there in the middle class and I don\u2019t have an extra $430 a month.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d

aVEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier addresses the media at the European Union Commission Headquarters in Brussels on September 7, 2017 | Emmanuel Dunand/AFP via Getty Images Michel Barnier rules out nonstop Brexit talks EU Brexit negotiator says he needs time between rounds to brief leaders in Brussels and beyond.\u000a\u000aThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier ruled out Thursday the possibility of nonstop talks with the U.K. in Brussels, an idea floated by London to speed up the pace of the negotiations.\u000a\u000aThe U.K. is keen to move on from talking about separation issues to the shape of its future relationship with the bloc. But the EU will only do so once the European Council deems that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made on divorce terms \u2014 an issue leaders said they will consider at their summit in October.\u000a\u000aIn rejecting the idea of nonstop talks, Barnier said he needed to spend time between negotiating rounds briefing heads of state and government, ambassadors from the EU27, members of the European Parliament and other leaders in Brussels. But he was also clearly intent on denying U.K. negotiators any advantage from having just one master, Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 a fact that theoretically, at least, allows British negotiators to be far more nimble than their EU counterparts.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe cannot negotiate every day, otherwise we will not do serious work,\u201d Barnier told reporters in Brussels, although he said he was willing to step up the current format of one week of formal talks per month.\u000a\u000a\u201cAs time is flying, and it worries me, I am ready to boost, to intensify the rhythm of the talks, obviously,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are ready to adapt timetables.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn explaining his resistance to the U.K.\u2019s idea of nonstop negotiations \u2014 a proposal first reported by POLITICO \u2014 Barnier stressed his role as negotiator on behalf of the full array of EU stakeholders.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe unity of Europeans is solid and real and is being built continuously,\u201d he said, adding. \u201cI need a bit of time, before and after each round, to do this work of dialogue and consultation and to report.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe U.K. has not publicly disclosed details of how it envisioned the \u201ccontinuous\u201d talks would be carried out, but one potential benefit for the U.K. would be to eliminate the ritual press conferences currently held at the start and end of each round. David Davis, the U.K.\u2019s Brexit secretary, has made little secret of his dislike of those events.\u000a\u000aAsked about Barnier\u2019s resistance to nonstop talks, one U.K. government official played down the EU negotiator\u2019s remarks, saying attempts to intensify the negotiations were still \u201ca live issue.\u201d No agreement has been reached between the two sides on a new format.\u000a\u000aAnother U.K. government official involved in Brexit said the option of \u201ccontinuous talks\u201d was never a formal British proposal, but one option discussed between two senior negotiators, and that the U.K. never expected it to be adopted.\u000a\u000aMinutes released\u000a\u000aIn an example of the potentially awkward interactions between negotiators, the EU released the minutes of a College of Commissioners meeting on July 12 in which Barnier seemed to chide Davis for not remaining in Brussels during the week of formal talks, and pointing to that as a sign of the U.K. lack of engagement.\u000a\u000a\u201c[Barnier] observed that the United Kingdom had not yet really engaged in the negotiations or spelled out its positions,\u201d according to the minutes. \u201cHe noted in this regard that David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, did not regard his direct involvement in these negotiations as his priority and there was also a possibility that he might not be present at the full opening session of the July cycle of talks.\u201d\u000a\u000aDavis also did not remain in Brussels for the third round of talks in August, attending an opening news conference and meeting on Monday afternoon and then returning late Wednesday to attend the closing meeting and news conference the following day.\u000a\u000aAt his news conference Thursday, Barnier was asked if not having Davis on hand throughout the formal talks was a problem. \u201cWe are meeting at the beginning to launch the round and we are drawing conclusions together. I do not participate in every meeting with my teams and the British teams,\u201d he said, adding that they were being kept informed \u201cevery hour, every two hours\u201d on the negotiations.\u000a\u000aBarnier was also asked about reports that he was planning to run for Commission president in 2019 and this might give him added incentive to reach a deal with the U.K.\u000a\u000a\u201cI am entirely focused, 100 percent of my energy, on the mission Jean-Claude Juncker and European leaders gave to me \u2014 100 percent of my time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I am thinking about.\u201d

aVAlthough he leads the traditional party of the Norwegian working class, Jonas Gahr Støre has a patrician background and is an heir to considerable wealth | Alex Wong/Getty Images Norwegian party\u2019s pledge: Vote for us, we\u2019ll raise your taxes Opposition party accuses government of spending way too much, and only tax hikes can balance the books.\u000a\u000aOSLO \u2014 Norwegian Labor Party leader Jonas Gahr Støre reached out to voters with a brutally honest pledge \u2014 he\u2019s going to raise their taxes if elected prime minister next week.\u000a\u000aA year ago, Norway\u2019s general election on September 11 looked like a certain victory for Støre\u2019s Labor-led center-left bloc over Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg\u2019s center-right coalition government. Now they are neck-and-neck in the polls.\u000a\u000aSolberg\u2019s Conservative Party has attacked Labor\u2019s platform by suggesting the party will raise taxes by more than it says if it gets into power, or will be forced to do so by its leftist allies in a governing coalition. But the Norwegian left says there is no option but to raise taxes because of the way the Conservatives have been spending money and giving tax breaks to the rich.\u000a\u000a\u201cDo you know how much money they have spent? It\u2019s a piñata,\u201d said Bjørn Jacobsen, who is running for parliament for the Socialist Left Party (SV) in the county of Møre og Romsdal. His party is a likely junior coalition partner if Labor gets into power.\u000a\u000aJacobsen shares the widespread feeling in Norway that it will be a very close contest on Monday, though he expects the outcome to be a coalition of Labor, the rural Center Party and the Socialist Left.\u000a\u000aBernt Aardal, a political scientist at the University of Oslo, predicts it will be \u201cvery close, both in terms of the election result and what is going to happen with the government afterwards.\u201d The uncertainty stems partly from weak support for many smaller parties, some of which could fail to reach the 4 percent election threshold, and from shifts in strength between parties in opposing blocs.\u000a\u000aThough it\u2019s a safe bet that either Støre or Solberg will be prime minster, the daily Aftenposten recently listed 10 different possible government coalition constellations. A weak result for Labor could force Støre to rely heavily on the small Green and/or Red parties for support, which could make governing difficult and hand the tiny parties considerable power.\u000a\u000aWelfare costs money\u000a\u000aEgalitarian Norway already has steeply progressive income-tax rates, with a top marginal rate of 46.7 percent, and a total tax burden of around 45 percent, which is above the OECD average.\u000a\u000a\u201cTax is not so important as what we shall do with it \u2014 we want to have as low taxes as possible, but as high as necessary,\u201d Støre said in an interview on national broadcaster NRK, reconfirming his pledge to raise the total tax take by up to 15 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.93 billion).\u000a\u000aHe said Norway needs that money to invest in teachers, to deal with an aging population and to boost job training.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe kept our tax promise in 2005, 2009, 2013, and we will keep it in 2017,\u201d Støre said.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think it is honest to say that if we are going to do what we want to do, we have to raise taxes. I think it is an honest thing, and there is some dignity in it\u201d \u2014 Anders Tangen\u000a\u000aThough voters are showing signs of fatigue with Solberg\u2019s minority coalition of her Conservatives and the populist Progress Party, the disillusionment does not seem as rampant as when voters in 2013 ousted the previous Labor-led coalition, which had governed for eight years under Støre\u2019s predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg.\u000a\u000aStoltenberg\u2019s approach, when he won power in 2005 for a second time, had been to tell the people not to expect tax cuts; Støre has gone one better and chosen to campaign on a promise to raise taxes.\u000a\u000aFor the social democratic Labor Party, which is the biggest party with 55 seats in the 169-seat parliament, that means rolling back tax cuts granted by the Solberg government to high earners and the rich. But in a country where income differences are smaller than in many others, the planned tax increases would not affect only the super-rich, but also people earning a high, though not extravagant, annual income of more than 600,000 Norwegian kroner ($77,120).\u000a\u000aSo, it\u2019s a \u201csoak the rich\u201d strategy that would affect Norwegians who likely think of themselves as unmistakably middle-class \u2014 and unwilling to hand over more to the taxman.\u000a\u000aThe tabloid VG in July launched on its website a \u201cJonas Tax calculator\u201d (named after Støre), where readers can plug in their financial details to find out if or by how much Støre\u2019s tax-hike pledge will affect them.\u000a\u000aTruls Wickholm, a Labor lawmaker from Oslo who sits on the parliament\u2019s finance and economic committee, said the party felt \u201cthe need to be upfront with voters about what welfare is actually going to cost.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cNot everyone likes the message of tax increases \u2014 that is something we understood going into this campaign \u2014 but most Norwegians understand that welfare also costs money, and, as you probably know, most of our welfare is paid for by taxes,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aDodgy strategy\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a message that some Norwegians might find hard to take coming from the 57-year-old Støre. Although he leads the traditional party of the Norwegian working class, Støre has a patrician background and is an heir to considerable wealth. He was educated at the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy and the Institut d\u2019études politiques de Paris, followed by a fellowship at Harvard, and served as Stoltenberg\u2019s foreign minister from 2005-2012. While exuding an air of competence and dedication, he can come across as a somewhat aloof, intellectual figure.\u000a\u000aIn Solberg, Norway\u2019s second female prime minister after Gro Harlem Brundtland, Støre faces one of the country\u2019s most popular politicians. Nicknamed \u201cIron Erna,\u201d she has softened in office into someone \u201cyou might even imagine having a drink with,\u201d as one Norwegian reporter put it.\u000a\u000aA recent opinion poll put Solberg ahead of Støre, by 44 percent to 41 percent, when voters were asked who they want as prime minister. However, Norwegians vote for parties and not for the prime minister at the ballot box.\u000a\u000aOther more relevant polls have Støre\u2019s bloc with a narrow lead, but Solberg\u2019s center-right has closed the gap to next to nothing, and some polls even have her bloc ahead.\u000a\u000aSo how has the election-year pledge to raise taxes worked?\u000a\u000a\u201cIt does not seem to have worked very well,\u201d said Aardal, \u201cbecause, first of all, tax is not a good campaign issue for the social democratic [Labor] party. It has been a much better issue for the Conservatives.\u201d\u000a\u000aLabor supporter Anders Tangen, a 50-year-old motivational speaker and radio and TV personality, said it was wrong to see tax hikes as a goal in themselves. \u201cIt is more like a way of getting things done, and what is important for me is that the Norwegian welfare system functions well,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe have seen in the last year that they [the government] have used so much money from our oil fund, and I think we need more balance on this,\u201d Tangen said. \u201cI think it is honest to say that if we are going to do what we want to do, we have to raise taxes. I think it is an honest thing, and there is some dignity in it.\u201d\u000a\u000aSitting on cash\u000a\u000aIf Labor fails to inspire voters between now and election day, running on a platform to increase taxes will be one of the criticisms that will be leveled at Støre, Aardal said.\u000a\u000aThe main plank in Labor\u2019s election campaign has been that Solberg\u2019s government has done a poor job of managing the economy. Unfortunately for the challenger, the economy has not cooperated with that argument.\u000a\u000aNorth Sea oil and gas producer Norway\u2019s economy was hit hard by the plunge in oil prices in 2014-2016, with unemployment spiking to a 20-year high in 2016. But oil has recovered from its trough of below $30/barrel to current levels of around $50/barrel, joblessness has fallen back to 4.4 percent and GDP grew by a better-than-expected 0.7 percent in the second quarter.\u000a\u000aConsumer confidence has sprung back from an all-time low in December 2015 to a 10-year high 20 months later.\u000a\u000aAnd when the economy sours in Norway, it\u2019s never quite as bad as elsewhere because the country has used its petroleum revenues to build up an almost $1 trillion financial buffer in the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund.\u000a\u000aLargely under pressure from the Progress Party, the government took more money out of the fund in 2016 than went in for the first time since it was established in 1996, prompting cries of mismanagement from the opposition.\u000a\u000aThe government is allowed to spend a small portion of the oil fund annually to plug budget gaps, and it lowered the cap on yearly spending of the fund to 3 percent from 4 percent, with support from the Labor Party and others. But that was not enough to stop Støre\u2019s party from blaming the government for squandering the nation\u2019s wealth to give tax cuts to the wealthy.\u000a\u000aThe first preliminary election results will be published at 9 p.m. local time (7 p.m. GMT), and a full tally could be available by around midnight.

Duke\u000a\u000aActing Secretary\u000a\u000aSUBJECT:\u000a\u000aRescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \u201cExercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\u201d\u000a\u000aThis memorandum rescinds the June 15, 2012 memorandum entitled \u201cExercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children,\u201d which established the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\u201cDACA\u201d). For the reasons and in the manner outlined below, Department of Homeland Security personnel shall take all appropriate actions to execute a wind-down of the program, consistent with the parameters established in this memorandum.\u000a\u000aBackground\u000a\u000aThe Department of Homeland Security established DACA through the issuance of a memorandum on June 15, 2012. The program purported to use deferred action\u2014an act of prosecutorial discretion meant to be applied only on an individualized case-by-case basis\u2014to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress had not otherwise acted to provide by law.[1] Specifically, DACA provided certain illegal aliens who entered the United States before the age of sixteen a period of deferred action and eligibility to request employment authorization.\u000a\u000aOn November 20, 2014, the Department issued a new memorandum, expanding the parameters of DACA and creating a new policy called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\u201cDAPA\u201d). Among other things\u2014such as the expansion of the coverage criteria under the 2012 DACA policy to encompass aliens with a wider range of ages and arrival dates, and lengthening the period of deferred action and work authorization from two years to three\u2014the November 20, 2014 memorandum directed USCIS \u201cto establish a process, similar to DACA, for exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,\u201d to certain aliens who have \u201ca son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\u201d\u000a\u000aPrior to the implementation of DAPA, twenty-six states\u2014led by Texas\u2014challenged the policies announced in the November 20, 2014 memorandum in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. In an order issued on February 16, 2015, the district court preliminarily enjoined the policies nationwide.[2] The district court held that the plaintiff states were likely to succeed on their claim that the DAPA program did not comply with relevant authorities.\u000a\u000aThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Texas and the other states had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and satisfied the other requirements for a preliminary injunction.[3] The Fifth Circuit concluded that the Department\u2019s DAPA policy conflicted with the discretion authorized by Congress. In considering the DAPA program, the court noted that the Immigration and Nationality Act \u201cflatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\u201d According to the court, \u201cDAPA is foreclosed by Congress\u2019s careful plan; the program is \u2018manifestly contrary to the statute\u2019 and therefore was properly enjoined.\u201d\u000a\u000aAlthough the original DACA policy was not challenged in the lawsuit, both the district and appellate court decisions relied on factual findings about the implementation of the 2012 DACA memorandum. The Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court that DACA decisions were not truly discretionary,[4] and that DAPA and expanded DACA would be substantially similar in execution. Both the district court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that implementation of the program did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act because the Department did not implement it through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\u000a\u000aThe Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling by equally divided vote (4-4).[5] The evenly divided ruling resulted in the Fifth Circuit order being affirmed. The preliminary injunction therefore remains in place today. In October 2016, the Supreme Court denied a request from DHS to rehear the case upon the appointment of a new Justice. After the 2016 election, both parties agreed to a stay in litigation to allow the new administration to review these issues.\u000a\u000aOn January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,768, \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.\u201d In that Order, the President directed federal agencies to \u201c[e]nsure the faithful execution of the immigration laws . . . against all removable aliens,\u201d and established new immigration enforcement priorities. On February 20, 2017, then Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly issued an implementing memorandum, stating \u201cthe Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\u201d except as provided in the Department\u2019s June 15, 2012 memorandum establishing DACA,[6] and the November 20, 2014 memorandum establishing DAPA and expanding DACA.[7]\u000a\u000aOn June 15, 2017, after consulting with the Attorney General, and considering the likelihood of success on the merits of the ongoing litigation, then Secretary John F. Kelly issued a memorandum rescinding DAPA and the expansion of DACA\u2014but temporarily left in place the June 15, 2012 memorandum that initially created the DACA program.\u000a\u000aThen, on June 29, 2017, Texas, along with several other states, sent a letter to Attorney General Sessions asserting that the original 2012 DACA memorandum is unlawful for the same reasons stated in the Fifth Circuit and district court opinions regarding DAPA and expanded DACA. The letter notes that if DHS does not rescind the DACA memo by September 5, 2017, the States will seek to amend the DAPA lawsuit to include a challenge to DACA.\u000a\u000aThe Attorney General sent a letter to the Department on September 4, 2017, articulating his legal determination that DACA \u201cwas effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.\u201d The letter further stated that because DACA \u201chas the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\u201d Nevertheless, in light of the administrative complexities associated with ending the program, he recommended that the Department wind it down in an efficient and orderly fashion, and his office has reviewed the terms on which our Department will do so.\u000a\u000aRescission of the June 15, 2012 DACA Memorandum\u000a\u000aTaking into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated. In the exercise of my authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities, except for the purposes explicitly identified below, I hereby rescind the June 15, 2012 memorandum.\u000a\u000aRecognizing the complexities associated with winding down the program, the Department will provide a limited window in which it will adjudicate certain requests for DACA and associated applications meeting certain parameters specified below.

aV\u201cHurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. Be safe and get out of its way, if possible. Federal G is ready!\u201d President Donald Trump wrote online Friday morning. | Shawn Thew/Getty Images Trump warns people to stay out of Hurricane Irma's path\u000a\u000aPresident Donald Trump warned Friday that Hurricane Irma, on track to make landfall in southern Florida this weekend, \u201cis of epic proportion,\u201d telling Floridians to heed government warnings and get out of the storm\u2019s path.\u000a\u000a\u201cHurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. Be safe and get out of its way, if possible. Federal G is ready!\u201d the president wrote online Friday morning.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aHurricane Irma, which churned through the Atlantic as a Category 5 hurricane before slamming into islands in the Caribbean, made history as one of the most powerful storms ever recorded. It is forecaste to slam into South Florida late Saturday night or early Sunday morning as a Category 4 storm, making its way up the Florida peninsula and then into Georgia and beyond.\u000a\u000aThe president has taken a keen interest in hurricane preparations and recovery, having already dealt with one powerful storm, Harvey, which devastated the Texas coast and triggered historic flooding in Houston. Trump twice visited the Gulf Coast in the wake of Harvey and struck a deal with Democrats this week to offer relief funding to the storm\u2019s victims, as well as fund the government and raise the debt ceiling for three months.\u000a\u000aThe most reliable politics newsletter.

aVCongressional Republicans, rudderless on an unpopular debt ceiling and government funding strategy, are looking to President Donald Trump to bail them out.\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are mulling a basic framework to raise the debt ceiling without spending cuts and avert an Oct. 1 shutdown with a short-term spending bill, according to multiple Republican aides. But while top Trump administration officials like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin back a \u201cclean\u201d debt increase, the president himself is mum on the latest strategy.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aGOP leaders, wary of the backlash from rank-and-file members who campaigned on reducing the debt, want Trump to publicly endorse the proposal to give them political cover.\u000a\u000a\u201cDistricts like mine are extremely supportive of this president; if he wants a \u2018clean' debt vote, and he\u2019s vocal about it, the right play \u2026 would be to let him do the whipping for it and it would get done,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), a whip team member who personally prefers to cut spending as part of a debt limit hike.\u000a\u000aWithout Trump\u2019s endorsement, the GOP could plunge into a month of intraparty battles that could rattle financial markets and threaten the economy. And absent relative GOP unity on a crucial fiscal deal, Republican leaders could be forced to beg for Democratic votes to avert catastrophe, a move that would invite criticism from the right.\u000a\u000aSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) when asked about a shutdown and debt default in an interview. \u201cSurely we\u2019ll be able to avoid that.\u201d\u000a\u000aWhen pressed by reporters late last month, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president supported a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling bill.\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s most direct comments on the issue came when he tweaked McConnell and Ryan on Twitter for creating a debt ceiling "mess," but there are plenty of signals that the president is falling in line \u2014 especially after Hurricane Harvey. Paradoxically, the storm, leadership sources believe, could actually smooth the entire process, making September a little easier.\u000a\u000aFor one, the severity of the damage is convincing top White House officials \u2014 and, they\u2019re praying, Trump himself \u2014 that now is not the time to pick a fight over the president\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico being funded in a must-pass spending bill. Trump has signaled to his staff that he\u2019d prefer to have the border wall fight later this year, sources familiar with those conversations said.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s in part because Trump has a personal interest in Harvey recovery, visiting the region for the second time over the weekend, demanding quick action to rebuild Texas and Louisiana. Republicans are set to approve $7.9 billion in Harvey emergency package as early as this week. The debt limit must be raised by the end of the month and is likely to move in tandem with a spending bill, whether it's the initial Harvey relief bill or the larger spending bill due by the end of month.\u000a\u000aNo final decision has been made, and lawmakers may need to wait until the end of the month to lift the debt limit and fund the government past September while also delivering an additional infusion of hurricane aid. Republicans and Democrats have estimated the storm could require more than $100 billion from the federal government, likely delivered in tranches.\u000a\u000aBetween the aid to recover the Gulf Coast and kicking the debt ceiling past the 2018 midterm elections, GOP leaders think that Trump will back down on the wall and that the dire situation in Texas could give them cover with conservatives who would otherwise rebel.\u000a\u000aYet some Texas Republicans and conservatives are already pushing back against a catch-all package that rolls Harvey aid into government funding and a debt bill that avoids default.\u000a\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want any insular issue to be brought to bear on something that is this important,\u201d said Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican who worked on the Katrina relief effort during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThis ought to be pure and isolated from all the other debates.\u201d\u000a\u000aSeptember has an astounding number of challenges for Trump and GOP leaders to address: In addition to the hurricane, spending and debt issues, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Flood Insurance Program and Children's Health Insurance Program all need to be extended past September.\u000a\u000aFurther drama appears inevitable. Trump is expected to announce on Tuesday that he will end the Obama-era program shielding some young immigrants from deportation but delay the termination by six months to give Congress time to act.\u000a\u000aBesides adding another controversial agenda item to an already packed legislative calendar, House Republican leaders fear that if Trump ends DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Democrats will withhold votes on the debt ceiling in protest. And Republicans know they\u2019ll need virtually every Democrat to back the debt ceiling bill or they won\u2019t be able to pass it, since many Republicans won\u2019t vote for it.\u000a\u000aAnd in the Senate, McConnell must decide whether he will try to repeal Obamacare again this month, a move that would similarly alienate Democrats. The parliamentarian has ruled that the chamber has until the end of September to attempt another vote on repealing the law by a simple majority. The party is split over the matter, with some Republicans, such as Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, looking to move on to piecemeal efforts to improve the law.\u000a\u000aRyan, McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) will meet with Trump on Wednesday to begin the high-stakes fall negotiations. Democrats say they are waiting for the Republican Party to chart a path forward, and are making few suggestions other than that they will deny Trump money for his border wall.\u000a\u000a\u201cRepublicans have a choice to make,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide. "They can do what we did in April, keeping the White House\u2019s unhelpful demands at arm\u2019s length and working with us to navigate the to-do list, or they can throw their lot in with the president, which will make September much harder.\u201d\u000a\u000aGOP leaders clearly prefer to show they are a governing party by minimizing the drama in September and moving on to tax reform. A shutdown or credit default is the last thing the reeling Republican Party needs after eight months with little to show legislatively for full control of the executive and legislative branches in Washington.\u000a\u000aBut working with Democrats on legislation addressing the debt limit and government funding that does not advance conservative priorities could invite major problems from the right, especially if Trump isn\u2019t leading the fight to avoid fiscal disaster. Conservatives will spend September pushing for leaders to cut spending as a condition for raising the debt ceiling.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou should make structural changes when you raise the debt rather than just continue on the path of the past eight years,\u201d said David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth. \u201cI think you\u2019d see Congress reject [a clean debt ceiling increase] unless Ryan and McConnell decide they want to govern with the Democrats, which they do at their own peril.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Republican leaders say that trying to craft bills that slash spending while a fiscal crisis looms could get too messy since they know they need at least eight Senate Democrats to get a bill to Trump\u2019s desk. They are hoping that leaving so much of the year\u2019s work for just four weeks in September will make everyone more cooperative \u2014 and avoid tarring the GOP as the shutdown or default party.\u000a\u000a\u201cDeadlines help,\u201d Blunt said hopefully.\u000a\u000a

aVPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has been criticized, by Democrats and Republicans alike, as \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201cunconscionable.\u201d It is also quite likely illegal. The decision is being implemented in a way that appears to violate the Administrative Procedure Act, and the courts might well block the Trump administration\u2019s action on those grounds.\u000a\u000aThe Administrative Procedure Act, sometimes called the \u201cMagna Carta of administrative law,\u201d is a 1946 statute that governs hundreds of federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. It requires that agencies go through a process known as \u201cnotice and comment\u201d before issuing, amending or repealing \u201csubstantive rules.\u201d As part of that process, the agency must publish proposed actions in the Federal Register and then give the public at least 30 days to submit feedback. When it finalizes its proposal, the agency must respond to issues raised by the public comments and must explain why it settled upon the course of action that it chose. The explanation must show why the agency\u2019s action is reasonable and not \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious.\u201d\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aIn hundreds of cases, the federal courts have had to decide what counts as a \u201csubstantive rule\u201d to which the notice-and-comment requirement applies. In a nutshell, a substantive rule is an agency action that alters the rights or interests of parties, changes the background regulatory regime and has a present and binding effect. Sometimes, agencies will take actions that do all of these things but are labeled as \u201cpolicy statements\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive rules.\u201d In those cases, federal courts will block the agency from carrying through on its policy until it goes through the notice-and-comment process.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s what\u2019s likely to happen here. On Tuesday, Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke sent a memo to other officials in her department regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Since its inception in 2012, DACA has allowed more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States before their 16th birthday to obtain work permits and certain other benefits. Immigrants eligible for DACA, known as Dreamers, must file an application with DHS and must seek renewal of their status every two years.\u000a\u000aThat will now change. Duke\u2019s memo says that \u201c[e]ffective immediately,\u201d DHS will \u201creject all DACA initial requests\u201d filed after Tuesday. It goes on to say that the department will \u201creject all DACA renewal requests\u201d received after October 5 of this year. The memo has all the signs of a substantive rule. It alters the rights of Dreamers, who now cannot obtain work permits and other privileges associated with deferred action status (such as Social Security benefits). In so doing, it changes the background regulatory regime. And as the memo makes clear, it has a present and binding effect on DHS officials and on hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.\u000a\u000aSince it announces a substantive rule, the memo is subject to the notice-and-comment requirement. But DHS has given no indication that it intends to go through the notice-and-comment process here. Instead, Acting Secretary Duke has moved ahead without giving the public 30 days to submit feedback. That\u2019s a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and it would give a federal court a basis for blocking the department from carrying through on its new substantive rule.\u000a\u000aThere is, to be sure, a wrinkle in this argument. The wrinkle is that then- DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano did not go through notice and comment when she announced the DACA policy by memorandum back in 2012. The Trump administration will likely say that if DACA didn\u2019t need to go through notice and comment initially, then DHS shouldn\u2019t have to go through notice and comment now when it rescinds DACA. And if DACA ­did­­ need to go through notice and comment initially, then DACA itself is procedurally invalid and should be set aside on those grounds.\u000a\u000aBut the Dreamers can come back with two rebuttals. First, the Napolitano memo announcing DACA and the Duke memo rescinding it are not equivalent. The Napolitano memo set forth criteria by which DHS officials should evaluate deferred action applications, but it emphasized that officials should exercise discretion \u201con an individual basis.\u201d By contrast, the Duke memo is categorical: If a Dreamer applies for deferred action after Tuesday or seeks renewal of deferred action status after October 5, then the request will be rejected. The Napolitano memo was, at least arguably, a policy statement. The Duke memo is more difficult to interpret as anything other than a hard-and-fast rule.\u000a\u000aSecond, even if the initial DACA memo needed to go through notice and comment, that does not mean the Trump administration can rescind the memo without heeding the Administrative Procedure Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has held that the notice-and-comment requirement applies even when an agency seeks to rescind a \u201cdefectively promulgated\u201d regulation. Under those circumstances, the proper course is for the agency to solicit public comments as it decides how to address the defect it has identified. The agency does not get a free pass to disregard the Administrative Procedure Act just because a prior administration did so. Two procedural wrongs do not make a right.\u000a\u000aNone of this is to say that the Trump administration must stick with DACA forever. After going through a proper notice-and-comment process, DHS might decide to amend or repeal the Obama administration\u2019s policy. The department would still have to justify its decision, and the Administrative Procedure Act would allow Dreamers to challenge the adequacy of the department\u2019s explanation. But if the department can explain why its decision is reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious, it should pass judicial muster.\u000a\u000aIn sum, the Administrative Procedure Act might put the brakes on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undo DACA, but it won\u2019t resolve the Dreamers\u2019 predicament permanently. Only Congress can do that. In the short term, though, the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014and the federal courts that enforce it\u2014might provide the Dreamers with much-needed relief.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDaniel Hemel is an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

aVAs catchy pop-social science coinages go, \u201cthe Big Sort\u201d may not have quite the pith or resonance of, say, \u201cbobos\u201d or \u201ctipping points.\u201d But in attempting to define and argue the implications of the sweeping social and political balkanization that has swept across America over the last 30 years, Bill Bishop has set his sights ambitiously on David Brooks and Malcolm Gladwell territory: identifying a big, worldview-changing social science phenomenon, and interpreting it for a popular audience.\u000a\u000aSuperficially, the phenomenon Bishop is examining is not new, and the litany of division he recites is familiar. The two major political parties have become more extreme and can\u2019t find common ground anymore. National civic groups and mainline church denominations have withered away, replaced by smaller, more narrowly focused independent groups. Marketers (and political pollsters) have sliced up the population into increasingly \u201cmicrotargeted\u201d segments. The three-network era of mass media, which helped create a national hearth of shared references and values, is long gone, displaced by a new media landscape that has splintered us into thousands of insular tribes. We can no longer even agree on what used to be called facts: Conservatives watch Fox; liberals watch MSNBC. Blogs and RSS feeds now make it easy to produce and inhabit a cultural universe tailored to fit your social values, your musical preferences, your view on every single political issue. We\u2019re bowling alone \u2014 or at least only with people who resemble us, and agree with us, in nearly every conceivable way.\u000a\u000aThis separation into solipsistic blocs would perhaps not be so complete if people of different political views or cultural values at least lived within hailing distance, and encountered one another on the street or in the store from time to time. But, increasingly, they don\u2019t. Over the last decade, as 100 million Americans have moved from one place to another, they\u2019ve clustered in increasingly homogeneous communities. This is where \u201cThe Big Sort,\u201d which grew out of a series of articles that Bishop, formerly a reporter at The Austin American-Statesman, wrote with Robert Cushing, a retired sociologist and statistician from the University of Texas, is both wonkiest and most original. Working with a team of collaborators (including Richard Florida, the author of \u201cThe Rise of the Creative Class\u201d), Bishop and Cushing swam around in different sets of data \u2014 voting records; I.R.S. income figures; patent filings; poll numbers from advertising firms \u2014 to figure out how thoroughly, and in what ways, Americans had sorted themselves. Their conclusion: \u201cBy the turn of the 21st century, it seemed as though the country was separating in every way conceivable.\u201d\u000a\u000aAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u000a\u000aAmericans have always moved around restlessly. But whereas in earlier times large flows of people \u2014 the \u201cgreat migration\u201d of African-Americans to Chicago in the 1950s, for instance, or the \u201chillbilly highway\u201d that took white Appalachians to the Midwest after World War II \u2014 were motivated primarily by the quest for economic opportunity, American migration is now inspired at least as much by \u201clifestyle\u201d choices as by economics. \u201cWe have built a country,\u201d Bishop writes, \u201cwhere everyone can choose the neighbors (and church and news shows) most compatible with his or her lifestyle and beliefs. And we are living with the consequences of this segregation by way of life: pockets of like-minded citizens that have become so ideologically inbred that we don\u2019t know, can\u2019t understand, and can barely conceive of \u2018those people\u2019 who live just a few miles away.\u201d

Dave Reichert over his steadfast refusal to hold a town hall.\u000a\u000aOne tactic: Shadow the Auburn Republican to public events and make a scene.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s a plan laid out by activists for his scheduled appearance Monday at the Washington Trade Conference at Seattle\u2019s Westin Hotel.\u000a\u000aThe Seattle-based Fuse Washington has planned a protest outside the hotel \u2014 and offered to pay the $175 to $225 cost of conference tickets for volunteers willing to go inside and \u201cdisrupt\u201d the event, according to an email circulated by organizers.\u000a\u000a\u201cPer the Indivisible Guide, if our Member of Congress isn\u2019t holding town halls, we must take the message to any public events!\u201d said the email sent last week by volunteer activist Summer Montacute.\u000a\u000aHer message, cc\u2019d to a Fuse staff organizer, notes the group would reimburse any volunteers for the cost of the conference tickets, adding \u201cPlease do not forward or share widely!\u201d\u000a\u000aAaron Ostrom, Fuse\u2019s executive director, said there\u2019s nothing nefarious about his organization\u2019s covering the cost of entry to the conference for some of Reichert\u2019s constituents.\u000a\u000a\u201cHe won\u2019t give these people an audience, so they have to go to him. They have to track him down,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have $225 to ask Dave Reichert \u2018Why did you repeal my health care?\u2019 we\u2019re willing to help them get in.\u201d\u000a\u000aAsked for comment Friday, Reichert spokeswoman Breanna Deutsch pointed to a previous statement in which the congressman said town halls have \u201cdisintegrated into shouting matches with no productive results, and in some cases put attendees and staff at risk.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo matter what activists do, Reichert has indicated he won\u2019t change his mind on town halls, which have been a time-honored tradition for many members of Congress. He is the only U.S. House member from Washington who has refused to hold the events going back years.\u000a\u000aReichert\u2019s office says he has met instead with smaller groups of constituents, including members from \u201cIndivisible\u201d groups organized to resist the Trump administration. Last week, he met with members of Indivisible Wenatchee for nearly two hours and took \u201call their questions,\u201d Reichert said in a Facebook post.\u000a\u000aOther Republicans, and even the White House, have claimed paid protesters are responsible for the recent rounds of disruptions at GOP town halls. The fact-checking organization PolitiFact has rated those claims false.\u000a\u000aIn many ways, the current round of liberal protests is the flip side of the conservative tea-party movement of around 2010. Then, as now, protests were organized by political groups but also grew organically.\u000a\u000aFuse helped organize the protest outside Reichert\u2019s Issaquah office last month that drew between 500 and 700 people, according to police estimates.\u000a\u000aWhile several Fuse staffers set up details of the event, including getting the protest permit, Ostrom said the vast bulk of the people who showed up were Reichert\u2019s constituents.\u000a\u000a\u201cThey\u2019re not getting paid,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aThese days, Ostrom said, it\u2019s not even particularly difficult to get hundreds or even thousands of regular folks to show up to protest Trump and the Republican Congress\u2019 plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe quantity of motivated volunteers is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d he said.

aVHRUNIVKA, Ukraine \u2014 As gunfire crackled across the sweltering fields, Max Stodola looked on with blank dread: \u201cIt happened so fast \u2014 there was nothing I could do. I just thought, \u2018See ya, guys, nice knowing you.\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aIt was August 2014. The volunteer medic was planning to resume his university studies in a few days \u2014 just enough time to join Kiev\u2019s push on Ilovaisk, a key railway junction held by Moscow-backed forces. As he approached the besieged town, a rocket-propelled grenade landed a few meters ahead. It skidded away and detonated near his friend, whose leg was sprayed with shrapnel.\u000a\u000aIn the coming weeks, Ukraine\u2019s soldiers \u2014 encircled by Russian armor and infantry \u2014 went on to suffer a heavy defeat. By then, Stodola had returned to university in Odessa. There, he received news that another friend had died throwing himself onto a grenade to save his fellow soldiers.\u000a\u000aStodola, then 24, had already endured an earlier artillery strike near Donetsk, where he had treated two dozen casualties. He continued to volunteer on and off for another 16 months.\u000a\u000aBefore he left for the war, the scruffy trainee dentist from Odessa was known as a joker \u2014 motor-mouthed but good-natured. When he returned, something had changed.\u000a\u000aHe was angry and aggressive \u2014 \u201cJust give me the tiniest excuse and I\u2019d explode.\u201d Nightmares stalked his sleep. Simple activities like grocery shopping put him on edge.\u000a\u000aIn Ukraine, mental health issues are taboo, and the state offers minimal support.\u000a\u000aAt home, Stodola was sluggish but struggled to switch off. He went to see a psychologist but stormed out halfway through the session.\u000a\u000aWorst of all, society appeared to have abandoned him. \u201cIt felt as if I was here, but not here. I was like a tree on the roadside, with cars just passing by.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aNine months after he left the front lines for the last time, Stodola wakes at dawn and joins a group of men and women trooping silently down a muddy track. Forest dew catches the sunlight as they trek into the undergrowth past trenches that scar the earth.\u000a\u000aSome are dressed in khaki camouflage. They cross an empty road and enter a field bordered by dense woodland. There is no cover, but they\u2019re not here to fight.\u000a\u000aThe group forms a circle. With closed eyes, each combat-hardened veteran inhales slowly and \u2014 arms raised skyward like a meditating yogi \u2014 begins a new day of therapy.\u000a\u000aSince the outbreak of war in 2014, tens of thousands of soldiers have left eastern Ukraine\u2019s conflict zone to resume their civilian lives. Coming home is seldom easy. Trauma follows them off the battlefield. Yet, in Ukraine, mental health issues are taboo, and the state offers minimal support.\u000a\u000aEven as hostilities continue in the east, Ukraine faces a major crisis away from the front lines: soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an affliction that can trigger abuse and addiction, anxiety and alienation.\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why Ivona Kostyna helps run Pobratymy \u2014 \u201cBrothers in Arms\u201d \u2014 a grassroots organization that helps veterans overcome trauma, build resilience and support their peers. The 20-year-old and her team of psychologists offer a lifeline to former servicemen abandoned by a state crippled by corruption, providing intense psychotherapy sessions, sometimes deep in the backcountry.\u000a\u000aStruggling against social stigma and dwindling funds, groups like Kostyna\u2019s are at the vanguard of a nation\u2019s attempts to heal itself.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aBefore the morning rush hour, a minibus drives around Kiev to collect a group of veterans before heading east to the sanctuary. The long drive takes them down bumpy highways and past wheat fields toward Ukraine\u2019s northeastern frontier with Russia.\u000a\u000aKostyna sits up front. She has a discerning look and speaks impeccable English, a result of having studied at international schools in Abuja and Tripoli, where her father worked as a Ukrainian diplomat.\u000a\u000aClose to four years ago in Kiev\u2019s Maidan Square, Kostyna stood among tens of thousands of demonstrators to protest then President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s decision to align with Russia over Europe. As clashes intensified, a sniper shot her friend.\u000a\u000aOfficials say around 500 Ukrainian veterans have committed suicide, with an estimated one-third of ex-servicemen suffering from PTSD.\u000a\u000aThe death devastated Kostyna. She left home and hitchhiked to Lviv, more than 500 kilometers away, where she took a waitressing job. \u201cI downgraded all the plans I had for life,\u201d she recalls.\u000a\u000aRussian forces invaded Crimea and fomented rebellion in the Donbas region. But, in her newly adopted city, Kostyna felt removed from the violence.\u000a\u000aSeveral months later, in June 2014, friends on the front started sending messages that shook her awake. They were lacking supplies, they said, and needed help.\u000a\u000a\u201cEveryone has their time to do something and realize their potential,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d become satisfied with doing nothing. I was judging others for not doing enough. In reality, I was judging myself.\u201d\u000a\u000aSo, Kostyna \u2014 just 17 at the time \u2014 began helping the war effort, risking her life repeatedly to deliver food and clothes to understocked troops battling Russian-backed separatists.\u000a\u000aAs she spent more time with the soldiers, they opened up to her about their problems \u2014 divorce, substance abuse, suicides. Overstretched and under fire, the Ukrainian army was failing to deal with the psychological toll on its soldiers.\u000a\u000aKostyna felt compelled to act, and teamed up with psychologists whom she knew through mutual contacts to devise a program to smooth the transition to civilian life.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aThe veterans gaze out at the wooded, rolling landscape as the minibus finally pulls up at its destination \u2014 Hrunivska Sich. Hidden behind a tall palisade in a forest clearing, the collection of tumbledown cottages is modeled on the fortified communities of Ukrainian Cossacks.\u000a\u000aKnotted trees hang heavy with apples and footpaths wind into the dark woods, where old trenches from World War II lie among the pines.\u000a\u000aThe rustic retreat is owned by Volodomyr Vakula, a boisterous Ukrainian in his early 40s. \u201cThe aim of this place is to gather people who think differently, who are the seeds of our nation, who seek to recreate the traditions of our ancestors,\u201d says Vakula, a former welder whose forebears were deported to Siberia in the late 20s by Joseph Stalin. \u201cThese soldiers are modern-day Cossack warriors. That\u2019s why they feel welcome here.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe group takes a bracing swim in the nearby River Psol, followed by a lunch of beef-and-buckwheat stew, before they gather for the first therapy session. One man wears a T-shirt that reads: \u201cShit happens. That\u2019s why we invented combat medicine.\u201d\u000a\u000aThey sit in a circle around Artem Denysov, a soft-spoken military psychologist who smuggled body armor from Poland to Ukraine\u2019s broken army at the start of the war, and later co-founded Pobratymy.\u000a\u000a\u201cVeterans chatting one-to-one isn\u2019t always good,\u201d says Denysov, 30. \u201cYou drag each other down and down till you\u2019re in shit. We encourage a two-plus-one format. Someone is an anchor and keeps the others from going under.\u201d\u000a\u000aOfficials say around 500 Ukrainian veterans have committed suicide, with an estimated one-third of ex-servicemen suffering from PTSD. Some believe the suicide rate is actually much higher. A lack of reliable figures likely masks the extent of the crisis, Denysov says, citing muddled bureaucracy, poor communication between government ministries and a fear among servicemen to admit they need therapy.\u000a\u000aSoldiers, psychologists and rights groups criticize Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defense for failing to provide sufficient mental health support. A spokesman says psychologists are on hand in the war zone, but the reality is few seek help.\u000a\u000aPavlo Tikhonovski, a blond, fresh-faced veteran, joins the afternoon session. The 27-year-old enrolled with Pobratymy after serving in the east and successfully finished the four stages of the program last year.\u000a\u000aBut the journey was hard. In February 2015, the volunteer fighter took part in the bloody advance on the strategic village of Shyrokyne. A mortar round landed near him, killing a fellow fighter. Shrapnel shattered Tikhonovski\u2019s foot, tore into his back and pierced his intestines.\u000a\u000a\u201cI was in a reptile state of mind, living only from action to reaction. I slept nonstop. Physically, I was at home but, mentally, I was still at war\u201d \u2014 Former soldier Andriy Ilchenko\u000a\u000aThere were invisible wounds, too. For months, he lay in hospital, overwhelmed by depression and a sense of helplessness. \u201cI was worried I\u2019d never have a normal life again. I was traumatized but no one in the hospital knew what to say.\u201d\u000a\u000aNext to him sits Andriy Ilchenko \u2014 a portly, ebullient chain-smoker in his late thirties who enlisted with the Ukrainian army in early 2015. The first weeks after he returned home, in April 2016, were tough, says the married father-of-two. \u201cI was in a reptile state of mind, living only from action to reaction. I slept nonstop. Physically, I was at home but, mentally, I was still at war.\u201d\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aUkraine has a troubled relationship with the past. Official readings of history tend to be naive and simplistic, brushing Nazi collaboration under the carpet, for example. The country is marked by widespread resistance to acknowledging scars left by wartime persecution and to dealing with mental health problems more generally.\u000a\u000aA macho culture promotes this shame, as does the legacy of the USSR. Soviet dissidents were imprisoned in psychiatric facilities, thus linking mental health problems with transgression. Common perceptions of soldiers are similarly confused.\u000a\u000a\u201cThose fighting in the east are celebrated as heroes,\u201d says Kostyra. \u201cWhen they come home, they\u2019re outcasts. People just presume they\u2019re dangerous alcoholics.\u201d\u000a\u000aKostyna compares trauma to a broken arm. \u201cIf you don\u2019t see a doctor, it\u2019ll keep hurting and prevent you from moving forward. If you do see one, they can fix it and put you in the right direction. Occasionally it\u2019ll hurt but, in the end, the bone will be stronger than ever.\u201d\u000a\u000aLeft untreated, trauma poisons soldiers\u2019 attempts to reconnect with their lives.\u000a\u000a\u201cWar split my life in half,\u201d Ihor Kholodylo, a 52-year-old medic who joined Pobratymy after enduring intense artillery attacks, tells me during a break for tea and cookies.\u000a\u000a\u201cWhenever soldiers came back from leave, they should have been relaxed and full of energy. Instead, they were saying, \u2018Home was awful, I was constantly arguing with my family and friends.\u2019 We had to do something.\u201d\u000a\u000aKholodylo \u2014 an energetic, natural-born leader \u2014 is a peer-to-peer co-trainer at Pobratymy. The organization follows a four-stage program \u2014 developed by the Danish psychotherapist and human rights activist Ditte Marcher \u2014 that goes beyond combat experiences, addressing an individual\u2019s full history from childhood onward. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to war to get trauma,\u201d says Kholodylo.\u000a\u000aThe program tackles misconceptions surrounding mental health, looks at the psychological impact of armed conflict, teaches veterans to create support networks and safe havens, tackles their respective traumas and coaches peer-to-peer support.\u000a\u000aFifty-six veterans have graduated from the full program, which typically lasts between four to six months. The organization\u2019s volunteers also go on lecture tours \u2014 extending its reach into the thousands.\u000a\u000a* * *\u000a\u000aOne evening, Ilchenko stands at the barbecue as pork shashlik sizzles over fat-spattered coals. Deep, the therapy dog \u2014 a golden retriever named after English rock band Deep Purple \u2014 sniffs around, while the veterans and psychologists sip on cherry kompot juice and sugary, black tea. (Alcohol is prohibited here.)\u000a\u000aHaving made strides in his recovery, Ilchenko now runs a radio call-in show for veterans. \u201cRussian soldiers broke the tradition of our ancestors. Our grandfathers rode all the way together to Berlin. They drank water together in Afghanistan. I never expected them to enter my home with a gun.\u201d\u000a\u000aAmid the sense of camaraderie around the fire, Max Stodola, a newcomer to the group, says he already feels empowered by the shared process of collective healing. The volunteer medic struggled with a sense of isolation after returning to society.\u000a\u000a\u201cI now know I don\u2019t have to be angry. I don\u2019t have to resent people who are safe, who are alive\u201d \u2014 Volunteer medic Max Stodola\u000a\u000aBut the sting has softened. Nightmares that haunted him for days have stopped. He sees clear waymarks toward reclaiming his life.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m only at the beginning but I\u2019ve become more patient, with others and myself,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000aWhen we catch up a few months later, he is transformed \u2014 giving public talks and being deeply involved with supporting veterans and their families.\u000a\u000a\u201cSomething inside me changed after the first session,\u201d he says. \u201cI now know I don\u2019t have to be angry. I don\u2019t have to resent people who are safe, who are alive. I have a feeling that much more is about to change.\u201d\u000a\u000aJack Losh is a freelance journalist with a focus on conflict-zone reporting and humanitarian issues.

aVRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\u000a\u000aGood morning, everyone. I want to begin by thanking Dana [Boente] for coming down to Richmond and introducing me today. Dana is currently wearing two hats, serving as acting Deputy Attorney General while also continuing to serve as your U.S. Attorney here in the Eastern District of Virginia. I\u2019m grateful for his outstanding service in both roles.\u000a\u000aI also want to welcome the many federal, state and local law enforcement leaders who have joined us. Thank you for everything you and your people do. I look forward to meeting with you this morning.\u000a\u000aAll of us who work in law enforcement want to keep people safe. That is the heart of our jobs; it is what drives us every day. So we are all disturbed to learn that violent crime is on the rise in America, especially in our cities. And that is what I want to talk about with you today.\u000a\u000aFirst, we should keep in mind some context. Overall, crime rates in our country remain near historic lows. Murder rates are half of what they were in 1980. The rate of violent crime has fallen by almost half from its peak.\u000a\u000aThe people of Richmond have seen this progress firsthand. Since 1995, murder and violent crime rates in Richmond have fallen by two-thirds. You have watched neighborhoods that were once in the grip of gangs and drugs transformed into places where kids can play and parents can take walks after sunset without fear.\u000a\u000aIn the past four decades, we have won great victories against crime in America. This happened under leadership from both political parties, and thanks above all to the work of prosecutors and good police using data-driven methods and professional training. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are alive today as a result.\u000a\u000aBut in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen warning signs that this progress is now at risk.\u000a\u000aThe latest FBI data tell us that from 2014 to 2015, the violent crime rate in the U.S. increased by more than 3 percent \u2013 the largest one-year increase since 1991. The murder rate increased 10 percent \u2013 the largest increase since 1968. And all of this is taking place amid an unprecedented epidemic of heroin and opioid abuse.\u000a\u000aIf this was just a one-year spike in violent crime, we might not worry too much. But the preliminary data for the first half of 2016 confirmed these trends. The number of violent crimes in the first half of last year was more than 5 percent higher than the same period in 2015. The number of murders was also up 5 percent, and aggravated assaults rose as well. Since 2014, the murder rate has gone up in 27 of our country\u2019s 35 largest cities. Homicide rates in Chicago, Baltimore, Milwaukee and Memphis have returned to levels not seen in two decades. Here in Richmond, the preliminary murder total for 2016 was 44 percent higher than the year before.\u000a\u000aThese numbers should trouble all of us. Behind all the data are real people whose safety and lives are at stake \u2013 people like the good folks whose stories I will hear later this morning. Each victim of this recent spike in violent crime is someone\u2019s parent, or child, or friend. And every loss of a young life to guns or drugs is a tragedy we must work to prevent.\u000a\u000aMy fear is that this surge in violent crime is not a \u201cblip,\u201d but the start of a dangerous new trend. I worry that we risk losing the hard-won gains that have made America a safer and more prosperous place.\u000a\u000aWhile we can hope for the best, we can\u2019t afford to be complacent. When crime rates move in the wrong direction, they can move quickly.\u000a\u000aWe know this, because those of us above a certain age have lived it. In the early 1960s, crime began to rise in our country. By 1973, crime rates in almost every category had doubled over their levels just a decade before. As the \u201970s went on, levels of crime and violence that we once deemed unacceptably high became the \u201cnew normal\u201d in America.\u000a\u000aI lived through that dark time in our history. I dealt with its consequences every day as a prosecutor. And I can assure you: We do not want to go back to those days. We must act decisively at all levels \u2013 federal, state and local \u2013 to reverse this rise in violent crime and keep our people safe.\u000a\u000aLast month the President gave us clear direction, issuing three executive orders that direct the federal government to reduce crime and restore public safety. This task will be a top priority of the Department of Justice during my time as Attorney General. I\u2019d like to talk briefly about how we\u2019re tackling this challenge.\u000a\u000aFirst, we\u2019re making sure the federal government focuses our resources and efforts on this surge in violent crime. Two weeks ago, I announced the formation of a Department of Justice Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety. It includes crime reduction experts from throughout the Department of Justice, including the heads of the FBI, the ATF, the DEA and the U.S. Marshals Service. The task force will evaluate everything we are doing at the federal level.\u000a\u000aSecond: We need to use every lawful tool we have to get the most violent offenders off our streets.\u000a\u000aIn recent years, we have seen a significant shift in the priority given to prosecuting firearms offenders at the federal level. This trend will end. This Department of Justice will systematically prosecute criminals who use guns in committing crimes.\u000a\u000aLast week, I sent a memo to all our federal prosecutors, urging them to work closely with their federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to target the most violent offenders in their districts. Working together, we will determine which venue \u2013 federal or state \u2013 would best take these criminals off our streets immediately, and ensure they are properly punished for their crimes.\u000a\u000aHere in Richmond, you have given us an excellent model for how we can lock up violent criminals and reduce crime.\u000a\u000aDuring the spike in violent crime in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, Richmond consistently had one of the top ten per-capita murder rates among American cities. In response, federal prosecutors worked with state and local law enforcement in 1997 to launch an innovative program called Project Exile. Its goal was to deter felons from carrying firearms, and to take off the streets those who were mostly likely to commit gun violence: criminals with guns.\u000a\u000aOver the decade that followed, murders and armed robberies in Richmond declined dramatically. A study published in the journal Criminology & Public Policy credited Project Exile with the reduction in gun homicides in Richmond.\u000a\u000aThis Department of Justice will encourage more efforts like Project Exile in cities across America \u2013 coordinated strategies that bring together all levels of law enforcement to reduce gun crime and make our cities safer.\u000a\u000aThird: To turn back this rising tide of violent crime, we need to confront the heroin and opioid crisis in our nation \u2013 and dismantle the transnational cartels that bring drugs and violence into our neighborhoods.\u000a\u000aOur nation is in the throes of a heroin and opioid epidemic. Overdose deaths more than tripled between 2010 and 2014. According to the CDC, about 140 Americans on average now die from a drug overdose each day. That means every three weeks, we are losing as many American lives to drug overdoses as we lost in the 9/11 attacks.\u000a\u000aIllegal drugs are flooding across our southern border and into cities across our country, bringing violence, addiction, and misery. We have also seen an increase in the trafficking of new, low-cost heroin by Mexican drug cartels working with local street gangs. As the market for this heroin expands, gangs fight for territory and new customers and neighborhoods are caught in the crossfire.\u000a\u000aThere are three main ways to fight the scourge of drugs: criminal enforcement, treatment and prevention.\u000a\u000aCriminal enforcement is essential to stop both the transnational cartels that ship drugs into our country, and the thugs and gangs who use violence and extortion to move their product. One of the President\u2019s executive orders directed the Justice Department to dismantle these organizations and gangs \u2013 and we will do just that.\u000a\u000aTreatment programs are also vital. But treatment often comes too late to save people from addiction or death.\u000a\u000aSo we need to focus on the third way we can fight drug use: preventing people from ever taking drugs in the first place.\u000a\u000aI realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. But too many lives are at stake to worry about being fashionable. I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store. And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana \u2013 so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that\u2019s only slightly less awful. Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life.\u000a\u000aIn the \u201980s and \u201990s, we saw how campaigns stressing prevention brought down drug use and addiction. We can do this again. Educating people and telling them the terrible truth about drugs and addiction will result in better choices. We can reduce the use of drugs, save lives and turn back the surge in crime that inevitably follows in the wake of increased drug abuse.\u000a\u000aFinally: The federal government alone cannot meet the challenge of violent crime and drugs \u2013 so we need to protect and support our brave men and women in law enforcement. About 85 percent of all law enforcement officers in our nation are not federal, but state and local. These are the men and women on the front lines \u2013 the ones doing most of the tough and often dangerous work that keeps our neighborhoods safe.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, in recent years law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable deeds of a few bad actors. Too many of our officers, deputies, and troopers believed the political leadership of this country abandoned them. Amid this intense public scrutiny and criticism, their morale has gone down, while the number of police officers killed in the line of duty has gone up.\u000a\u000aMany of you who are law enforcement leaders have also told us that in this age of viral videos and targeted killings of police, something has changed in policing. Some law enforcement personnel are more reluctant to get out of their squad cars and do the proactive, up-close police work that builds trust and prevents violent crime. In some cities, arrests have fallen even as murder rates have surged.\u000a\u000aThis is a terrible place to be, because we know that tough and professional law enforcement can make a real difference. It can reduce crime and save lives. We\u2019ve seen it happen in our country over the past four decades.\u000a\u000aTo turn back rising crime, we must rely heavily on all of you in state and local law enforcement to lead the way \u2013 and you must know that you have our steadfast support. The federal government should use its money, research, and expertise to help you figure out what is happening and determine the best ways to fight crime. We should strengthen partnerships between federal and state and local officers. And we should encourage the proactive policing that keeps our neighborhoods safe. This Department of Justice will do just that.\u000a\u000aThe new challenge of violent crime in our nation is real \u2013 and the task that lies before us is clear. We need to resist the temptation to ignore or downplay this crisis. Instead, we must tackle it head-on, to ensure justice and safety for all Americans.\u000a\u000aWe will enforce our laws and put bad men behind bars. We will fight the scourge of drug abuse. And we will support the brave men and women of law enforcement, as they work day and night to protect us.\u000a\u000aTogether, let us act to meet this challenge, so that our children will not look back and say that we let slip from our grasp all we had done to make America a safer place.\u000a\u000aThank you for having me here in Richmond today. I look forward to talking with you all and learning from you.

aVThe code name for the operation was \u201cRoyal Water,\u201d English for the Latin-named \u201cAqua Regia\u201d acid, which is powerful enough to dissolve gold.\u000a\u000aThat was how the small group of Hillary Clinton aides clued in to the top-secret identity of the man who played Donald Trump in debate preparations referred to him and his small team.\u000a\u000aStory Continued Below\u000a\u000aAnd for Philippe Reines\u2014the colorful and famously combative longtime Clinton confidant who stepped into the role of Trump opposite his old boss in tense and testing mock sessions\u2014it was the name of the project that drove him deep into Trump's mind for three of the most bizarre months of his life.\u000a\u000aClinton\u2019s chief gatekeeper in the Senate and at the State Department, Reines, 46, was a longtime clutch player in Clinton\u2019s tight-knit and clubby inner circle. But until August, when the 2016 Democratic nominee signed off on his star turn as Trump, Reines had been kept at arm\u2019s length from the ultimately doomed campaign, playing no official role. When he was finally handed one, Reines effectively took a three-month leave from his day job and went full method actor, cribbing from the all-in immersion techniques of Hollywood legends like Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro.\u000a\u000aReines purchased four podiums on Amazon, two for his home and two for the secret office the Clinton campaign lent him at the PerkinsCoie law firm in Washington, D.C. He searched eBay for a 2005 Donald J. Trump signature collection watch, which he purchased for $175. He experimented with a self-tanning lotion on his face. Before prep sessions, Reines began suiting up with velcro knee pads (to keep his legs straight), a posture enhancer (to keep his arms back), and dress shoes with three-inch lifts (to match Trump\u2019s 6-foot-1-inch frame). His longtime tailor fit him for a loose-fitting suit with large cuffs. His goal was not a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d-style caricature of Trump, so he didn\u2019t try to replicate Trump\u2019s famous mane. But he wanted to approximate his physicality so that Clinton would grow accustomed to Trump\u2019s looming presence when she saw Reines in her peripheral vision.\u000a\u000aHe also sat down with Tony Schwartz, Trump\u2019s ghostwriter-turned-tell-all critic, to better understand the man\u2019s psychology. Hoping to fully become the character he had been cast to play, Reines briefly went off his meds (he declined to say which, or if he has since resumed them).\u000a\u000aThe preparations were conducted in such secrecy that Reines bought a bag with combination locks to store his prep materials while shuttling between his home and his temporary office. He became so anxious about accidentally leaving the bag in an Uber that he put a GPS locator on it and then shackled the entire contraption to his wrist.\u000a\u000aAt home, or in his secret office, Reines watched all 12 Republican primary debates three times, while standing behind one of his podiums\u2014practice for the physical feat of simply standing still for 90 minutes. During his first viewing, he would watch the debate all the way through, taking notes. The second time, he would watch just for Trump\u2019s lines and reaction shots, and the third time he would watch with the sound off, studying Trump\u2019s mannerisms and body language.\u000a\u000aTrump eventually defeated Clinton, but it wasn\u2019t because he bested her in the debates, which former Clinton campaign officials still consider some of the few high points for the former secretary of state during a generally nasty and depressing campaign.\u000a\u000aFor Reines, who thought he was playing a historic role in helping elect the next president, the months he spent studying Trump\u2019s every word and gesture have transformed into something else, now that Clinton lost and Trump won: They\u2019ve given him a unique perspective into the mind and behavior of the president-elect.\u000a\u000aReines hasn't talked about the experience publicly until now. But nine days before Trump was set to be sworn in as the country\u2019s 45th president, he sat down with POLITICO and opened up about what living like Trump taught him about what to expect when Trump's unusual psyche collides with the unique demands of the American presidency. Looking ahead to the inauguration and beyond, Reines thinks Trump's biggest challenge is going to come from within himself.\u000a\u000a"I want him to leave his brain to science, I\u2019m just so curious,\u201d Reines says. \u201cWe just need to understand because it\u2019s a simultaneously scary yet fascinating person."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aMegan Rooney, then a Clinton speechwriter, was the first to think of Reines as a potential stand-in for Trump, back in May of 2016. There were skeptics within the Brooklyn headquarters, worried about bringing the flamethrowing aide back into the mix. But eventually staffers, including policy chief Jake Sullivan, realized that Reines\u2019 famous temper, deep understanding of Clinton and ability to needle could, in fact, make for the perfect fit.\u000a\u000a\u201cUsually [Clinton] has a visceral reaction to my sheer presence,\u201d Reines explained over a breakfast of pancakes and grapefruit juice at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, near Reines\u2019 old stomping grounds in Foggy Bottom. \u201cWith principals and their press people, it becomes a bit of a Pavlovian response. It\u2019s not like your spokespeople come in and say, \u2018I have a great thing to tell you.\u2019 It becomes a degree of, \u2018What now?\u2019 I knew how to push her buttons.\u201d\u000a\u000aAs a staffer, Reines was not a standard choice for the gig, which often goes to established politicians with built-in staffs to help with all of the research and practice that comes with the role. In 2012, for instance, Sen. John Kerry played Mitt Romney opposite President Barack Obama in debate prep. In 2008, former White House counsel Greg Craig played Sen. John McCain. Aside from the help of three volunteers\u2014Jeremy Barber, Kirsten Nelson and Stephanie Cohen, who kept him current on Trump\u2019s tweets and other statements\u2014Reines, however, was basically left on his own.\u000a\u000aWhile subsuming himself in the mind and words of Trump, Reines saw certain patterns emerge\u2014ones he doesn\u2019t expect will change when the president-elect enters the White House.\u000a\u000aHe noticed lesser-known physical tics, like the fact that Trump never makes eye contact. To train himself to avoid looking at Clinton, Reines taped a big X on the opposite wall and stared at it intently.\u000a\u000aReines and Clinton at the third debate. | Courtesy Barbara Kinney\u000a\u000aIn the first full mock debate session on September 1 (the Obama team pulled its full 2012 mock debate stage out of storage and lent it to the Clinton campaign), Clinton entered the room and saw her suited-up former aide standing at the podium in character. \u201cOh God, Philippe looks ready to be obnoxious,\u201d Clinton joked to cut the tension. Reines focused on his X on the wall and didn\u2019t acknowledge her. \u201cI did not look at her for the next five hours,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe took a break for lunch, and I stood at the podium. She came walking by and said, \u2018Aren\u2019t you getting lunch?\u2019 I didn\u2019t answer her.\u201d\u000a\u000a"He is so annoying. Just unbelievably annoying. God, Philippe, so annoying," Clinton said. To Reines, "that summarized the whole thing. It was impossible to tell who she was talking about."\u000a\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s just staying in character,\u201d Ron Klain, who alongside attorney Karen Dunn oversaw the debate prep, assured her. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go around and just take a little off of everyone else\u2019s plate.\u201d\u000a\u000aReines\u2019 deeper takeaways about Trump, he says, give a hint of how the president-elect will govern. To try and anticipate where Trump might fall on an issue, or what he might do, the key is to think of him as innately contrarian, Reines advises.\u000a\u000aHe gave, as an example, Trump\u2019s response at the first Republican primary debate in 2015, where he famously raised his hand to say he would not pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. Before doing so, Trump quickly peeked at the other candidates on stage, checking to see that no one else\u2019s hand was shooting up.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe moderator said it would be a show of hands. Right there, that's all the information he needed. If all of them had raised their hands, he wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Reines says with confidence. \u201cHe smelled their hesitation, his hand shot up. At worst, he had a 50-50 chance of choosing right. The question didn't even matter. It could have been, \u2018Who wants a root canal?'\u201d It was only of secondary importance that it also happened to be his position, Reines says. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most predictable unpredictable people.\u201d\u000a\u000aTo attribute forethought to how and when Trump tweets, or how he comes to a decision, is to misunderstand the instinctual player who might not be strategic but certainly recognizes the upside of simply being himself, according to Reines. \u201cI think of it like a pinball machine, where Congress are the bumpers, the machine says tilt, no one controls where the ball goes, and the player, at best, is just playing goalie,\u201d says Reines. \u201cTrump is not the player, he\u2019s the ball,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe truth is the ball doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s about to do.\u201d\u000a\u000aPresident Trump will be more preoccupied with being able to declare success than with actually succeeding, Reines predicts. Trump, for instance, declared victory when Sprint agreed to keep 5,000 jobs in the United States. Those jobs, however, were part of a commitment that Sprint\u2019s parent company had previously announced. Those details didn\u2019t matter much to Trump. A photo-op at the groundbreaking of a wall along the Mexican border might be all he needs to declare the fabled project successfully underway, and move on.\u000a\u000aReines noticed that Trump has two modes: basically polite, and what he refers to as \u201chot under the collar.\u201d The red-faced, finger-wagging, interrupting Trump was brought on mostly by people who just got under his skin, like Jeb Bush and then Clinton. \u201cJeb\u2019s mere presence drove him crazy,\u201d says Reines. \u201cThe pyschobabble part of me thinks it was because Jeb was the only person taller than him on stage. The less psycho-babble part of me thinks that in the back of his mind, he thought if someone was going to beat him it was probably the guy with $100 million.\u201d\u000a\u000aOn Oct. 26, Hillary Clinton's 69th birthday, Philippe Reines was still in full Donald Trump mode, and wrote her an 821-word email wishing her a happy birthday, in the stylings of Trump. Below is the full text of the email he sent the former secretary of state, which helps show how Reines mastered the president-elect's style of speech. From: Philippe\u000a\u000aDate: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 11:08 PM\u000a\u000aTo: Evergreen\u000a\u000aSubject: 10/26 October 26th. Such a bad date. Terrible date. She's a Scorpio. The Zodiac people - and by the way, the Zodiac is so so bad, there was a serial killer named The Zodiac Killer, it's true, it's true - they chose Scorpio because it was short for Scorpion. I mean, come on, how much time does cutting one letter save you? It's one letter. And N, I mean, it's not a terrible letter. It's not as great as D or J or T - but not terrible. H - boy, that's such a horrible letter. The worst letter. R and C are pretty terrible too. Scorpion, you know what that is? You all know, I see everyone nodding. It's a predatory arachnid. I mean, unless you're lending, predators are bad bad things. Trust me you don't want a predatory arachnid around. She loves arachnids. Eight legs, 73 legs, 200 legs - she loves them all. So sad. The Zodiac people - again, so incompetent - they say Scorpioans are known for their composure. Are you kidding? She has the worst composure. The worst of all time. Worse than OJ Simpson. I used to like OJ, but then he did that horrible thing to Nicole. OJ never found the real killer. You know who has no alibi that day? This is interesting, they don't want you to know this. Rafael Cruz has no alibi the day Nicole was killed. OJ had an alibi. That Kato guy. Weird guy. Nutjob. Space cadet. But very reputable. People tell me all the time that my composure is the best thing about me. But Scorpianians are all loozers. I hate to say it, I won't say it. But they are loozers. Incompetent. You know who was a Scorpianian? Pat Sejak. That guy couldn't even spell. Literally couldn't spell. He needed that blonde woman to tell him how to spell. So so incompetent. What's worse? 1947. Terrible year. The worst. You know what happened in 1947? She let India and Pakistan break away from Britain. Everything was great until 1947. She's born and boom, India and Pakistan are set free to threaten each other. I love Indians, there's a great Indian restaurant in Mar-a-Lago. It's open year round because the Indians are OK with that kind of heat. Nobody else is. You know what else she screwed up in 1947? She let Britain nationalise the coal mines. Can you believe that? Nationalise! With an S! They can't even spell it with a Z. They don't want you to know, they are lying so they pronounce it the same. But they are lying and spelling it with an S. The British are like Pat Sejak, they need a blonde spelling out all their stupid stupid decisions. But that's when she started to hate miners, back when she was an embryo and she nationaliZed the mines in England. And here is something I couldn't believe. Listen to this, this is unbelievable. There were only 144 million people in America in 1947. Now? 320 million people. Do the math people - do we need the Vanna White of math? No, we can do it. That's 176 million more people. One hundred and seventy six million more people! Since she was born she has let 176 million people pour into our country. Our country would be half the size if it wasn't for her. I'm sure some were OK, maybe one out of every ten. But still. And 69 is a stupid stupid age. I went straight from 68 to 70. Our leaders want you to think you need to add 1 every birthday. But that's because the whole birthday system is rigged. I might not even accept my 71st birthday it's so rigged. We'll see, we'll see. Maybe I will. Gemini is a great sign. The best. That's not me saying it, that's what people tell me. Scorpianians tell me too. Gemini is the best of them all. The Zodiac people say Geminis are outgoing and talkative. Again, they are so wrong. So wrong. Look at me, am I outgoing and talkative? Maybe a little. People come up to me and say I'm talkative. But I don't respond to them to prove I'm not talkative. I say nothing. I just stand there. She says she'll be the youngest woman president. Such a cute line. She hires Madison Avenue to come up with these lines. And they test all these words, and they are in cahoots, the Madison Avenue people, in cahoots with the Zodiac people. Not the murderer Zodiac - who by the way she has yet to catch even though she's had decades to find him - the Zodiac company. They do all this testing and decide that calling me talkative is how to beat me. Such nasty people. They know I'm not talkative, but they say it anyway. So dishonest. Look at me, I haven't even said anything this whole time! I've been standing here in total silence!...\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAnother sure-fire way to get under his skin, Reines says, is to quote Trump back to Trump. \u201cIt was when Clinton quoted his tweet on climate change being a Chinese hoax that he went off the rails,\u201d he says, referring to a moment in the first general-election debate when Trump interrupted Clinton multiple times to deny calling climate change a hoax. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t like being quoted back to him,\u201d says Reines. \u201cI think part of it is he might not remember what he said or wrote at any given time.\u201d\u000a\u000aBut Trump\u2019s \u201chot under the collar\u201d mode flashes and then dissipates quickly. \u201cHe tends to move on,\u201d Reines observes. Despite all of his lashing out against individuals and political foes, \u201cit would be hard to find someone he has consistently beat up over the past two years. When you kick him in the shins, he kicks back. There\u2019s no such thing as being the bigger person. But he moves on.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s digs at Clinton since the election, for instance, have come only in retaliation: He slammed her on Twitter after the campaign joined the Jill Stein recount, and again on Friday, in reaction to her former aides emerging from hibernation to weigh in on the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of FBI chief Jim Comey\u2019s conduct during the election. But \u201che\u2019s had a couple of glimpses of fundamentally respecting her,\u201d Reines notes. When Trump backed off of his campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary of state, for instance, Trump said of the Clintons, \u201cThey\u2019re good people. I don\u2019t want to hurt them.\u201d\u000a\u000aTrump\u2019s most famously cutting insults\u2014\u201cLittle Marco,\u201d \u201cLyin Ted\u201d\u2014were also what Reines calls his \u201cin case of emergency, break glass\u201d moves. \u201cHe didn\u2019t start out there,\u201d Reines says. \u201cWhen Trump called him Little Marco, it\u2019s because that was all that was left. It was a last-ditch effort to save himself\u201d after Rubio vigorously took him on.\u000a\u000aTrump, Reines says, is most at ease at a rally, where he engages in stream-of-consciousness thinking and talking, rather than participating in a conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s in a lot of situations where he\u2019s not dictating the conversation,\u201d Reines says.\u000a\u000aThis might be Trump\u2019s biggest struggle in adjusting to his new role on Jan. 20, Reines speculates. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time someone said to him, you have to do X and he bought into it?\u201d he says. \u201cI think the presidency is going to be a lot more \u2018you have to\u2019 than he realizes.\u201d\u000a\u000aReines has not been able to give up his Trump obsession, and was glued to the news conference last week, where he thinks the president-elect skillfully dominated the media.\u000a\u000a\u201cYou guys are bringing knives to a gunfight,\u201d the famously combative Reines says of the press corps covering Trump, joking that he should stand in to train the media on how to grill the president-elect. Reines cringed at the convoluted, multipart questions that allowed Trump to avoid a straight answer. The media\u2019s only hope of pushing Trump where he doesn\u2019t want to go is working together to ask follow-up questions, he says. \u201cHe knows that whack-a-mole works.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aIf the confident Clinton campaign made a mistake in its assessment of Trump, it was in underestimating how the simplicity of his message was breaking through to win the war, even if Clinton was winning every debate battle. They saw the poll numbers\u2014after the town hall-style debate, for example, an instant CNN/ORC poll found 57 percent of viewers thought Clinton won, compared with 34 percent for Trump\u2014and celebrated what they thought were dominant performances.\u000a\u000aBut after processing Clinton\u2019s loss on a meditative train trip across the country, Reines went back and thought about Trump through a different lens. \u201cWith 20/20 hindsight,\u201d he says, \u201cyou remember how direct his arguments were, and how compelling they were, if you set aside veracity. If people were waking up looking for something they had never seen before, this was it.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd part of Trump\u2019s ability to plow ahead while disregarding his previous positions, or distorting the truth, Reines muses, is because he doesn\u2019t experience shame or regret\u2014human emotions that drive many politicians who expend energy trying not to make a gaffe or contradict themselves.\u000a\u000a\u201cI think he\u2019d look at you blankly if you asked him, \u2018What\u2019s the biggest regret, or mistake you have made in your life?\u2019\u201d Reines says. \u201cTalking about those things were some of the few questions, when I was figuring out how he would answer, where I couldn\u2019t come up with a good answer.\u201d It\u2019s a different mind-set from which to approach the presidency\u2014and part of the explanation for Trump\u2019s \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d ethos.\u000a\u000a***\u000a\u000aToday, Reines takes great pride in being able to predict what Trump might say, do or tweet, before he does it\u2014and his former colleagues say it was uncanny watching him nail moments in debates before they happened.\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to learn everything that had been said by Trump,\u201d says Dunn. \u201cWith Philippe, it became an ability to predict situations that hadn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s a whole other level of understanding of the person you are playing, to be able to do that.\u201d\u000a\u000aReines, for instance, predicted correctly in a debate-prep session that Trump would blame the microphone when cornered\u2014which he did after the first debate, where he said he had a defective microphone. \u201cHe puts his fingers on it and leans in,\u201d says Reines, who had noticed that at rallies \u201che used the mic as a schtick.\u201d But Clinton aides less familiar with Trump\u2019s go-to moves were confused about what Reines was saying when he started yelling at the mic in debate prep. \u201cWho\u2019s Mike?\u201d they asked during a break.\u000a\u000aReines has long since resumed his regular life. But the line between Reines and Trump at times is still blurry in his mind. "It went from me saying things I knew he had said, to me saying things I thought he would say," he admits. "There are times when he says something and I spend five minutes trying to figure out if I was copying him or if he was copying me."\u000a\u000aAnnie Karni covers the White House for POLITICO.

aVBritish politician and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks at an event held by the right-wing, populist Alternative for Germany political party on September 8, 2017 in Berlin | Sean Gallup/Getty Images Nigel Farage urges German populists to campaign on Brexit Former UKIP leader says he\u2019s \u2018very keen\u2019 to contribute to debate.\u000a\u000aBERLIN \u2014 Nigel Farage urged the right-wing, populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) to make Brexit an issue in the final stretch of the German general election campaign.\u000a\u000aOn a visit to Berlin with just over two weeks to go until polling day, he also called on the AfD to pressure Chancellor Angela Merkel to get the EU to make concessions to the U.K. in its divorce negotiations.\u000a\u000a\u201cNobody talks about Brexit, nobody talks about what the implications of Brexit for Germany would be,\u201d the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) told journalists Friday afternoon before addressing AfD supporters at a campaign event in a Renaissance fortress on the outskirts of Berlin.\u000a\u000a\u201cI\u2019m very keen, if I possibly can, to inject something into this debate,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000aHis visit to the German capital followed a personal invitation by AfD deputy chief Beatrix von Storch, a fellow member of the European Parliament, who joined Farage\u2019s Euroskeptic Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group last year.\u000a\u000aAddressing a predominantly male crowd, surrounded by AfD posters demanding \u201ccourage for the truth,\u201d Farage stressed he had \u201cno formal ties with the AfD as a political party\u201d and was \u201cnot coming here to suggest what people should do.\u201d\u000a\u000aNonetheless, he concluded 30 minutes later, \u201cwith two weeks to go [until the election], I would urge Beatrix and others \u2026 to make Brexit a debate that matters.\u201d\u000a\u000aIn a wide-ranging speech, Farage encouraged the AfD to advocate for facilitating the U.K.\u2019s access to the European Union\u2019s single market after Brexit, while accusing EU leaders and their chief negotiator of \u201cdoing all they can to make sure Brexit doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d by imposing impossible demands on London.\u000a\u000aAt the same time, he accused Merkel, who has repeatedly stressed that there will be \u201cno cherry-picking\u201d for the U.K. in the Brexit talks, of ignoring the interests of German businesses.\u000a\u000a\u201cMerkel needs to know that unless she tells Brussels, \u2018Look please come to common sense,\u2019 then she will be putting the interests of Brussels above the interests of common German people,\u201d he said.\u000a\u000a\u2018Speak the unspeakable\u2019\u000a\u000aMerkel\u2019s conservatives lead comfortably at around 38 percent in recent polls \u2014 about 15 percentage points ahead of the party of her key rival, former European Parliament President Martin Schulz \u2014 and a fourth term for the longtime chancellor seems highly likely.\u000a\u000aThe German parliament, however, is still expected to undergo a major change, with the AfD, founded in 2013 and currently polling at between 8 and 11 percent, widely expected to become the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag.\u000a\u000a\u201cFor the first time in modern history, there is going to be a voice of opposition in the national parliament in Germany,\u201d Farage said cheerfully, \u201cand [other German politicians] are very scared of this happening, indeed.\u201d\u000a\u000aDrawing parallels to the ascent of UKIP over the last 25 years, Farage told the AfD\u2019s von Storch and her party supporters that \u201conce you have the opportunity, once you have the space, once you have the territory to challenge the establishment\u2019s status quo, you have the ability to make the country think.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cOnce you\u2019re able to speak the unspeakable, people will begin to think the unthinkable, and this is how you beat the establishment,\u201d he said.
